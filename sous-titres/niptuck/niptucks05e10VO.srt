00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,822
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:04,697
That's her.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,291
Wow. She's like a little...

4
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:08,618
little lion cub.

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,781
We're doing this. Superior arterial
hemorrhage. He's going into shock.

6
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,649
That is the way you play a leading man.

7
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,176
He has the courage of his convictions,

8
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:19,344
yet he is classy.
He is always classy.

9
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,795
We've been to an internist,
a neurologist, a gastroenterologist.

10
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:24,174
Nobody thinks you're sick.

11
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:26,948
You're hiding behind these symptoms
because you're scared of us.

12
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,338
You finally get what you want,
and you can't handle it.

13
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:32,491
- You guys are screwing each other.
- We love each other, Sean.

14
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:34,783
Sean called.

15
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:37,082
He offered me the job of receptionist.

16
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,027
I thought Gina was a stroke of genius.

17
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,754
Not only is she not screwable,
you've got built-in childcare.

18
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,298
You and my ex-wife
can have more alone time.

19
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,688
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

20
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,696
I don't like that he's so old.

21
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:57,488
- Believe me, neither do I.
- And he looks like a woman.

22
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:00,119
- Your mother's quite hard on you.
- Ha!

23
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:03,414
Magda and I have been married
for 21 years this may.

24
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:07,460
- Congratulations.
- For what?

25
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:12,667
I wanted a real man.
Omar Sharif. Burt Reynolds.

26
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:17,034
Hell, even a roll of brawny paper towels
would have been fine.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,324
But all I got was this hairless freak.

28
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,761
Back in the eighties,
hair removal was all the rage.

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,872
I partook, you know, to say the least.

30
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:28,888
Magda made me suffer through months
of excruciating electrolysis.

31
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,319
I followed the trends.

32
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,848
Well, now, magda demands it back.

33
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:36,817
She read in Newsweek that
being hirsute is en vogue again.

34
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,184
Chest hair, long sideburns.
I think they call it retrosexual.

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,403
Yeah. Hair transplants
to the face and the chest

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,480
are becoming quite popular.

37
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:50,437
I want a moustache on him,
and I want some fur on his ass.

38
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,291
His is pink like a girl's.

39
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,130
Well, you seem to have a healthy amount
of follicles on your head.

40
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:02,686
I don't think we'll have any problem
harvesting 2,500 to 3,000 grafts.

41
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,648
I agree to it only if I could get a face

42
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,576
freshening while I'm in here.

43
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:10,223
God knows I don't want all my
good years to be behind me.

44
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,805
Sure. We could do a tightening
along the jaw line

45
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,410
and get rid of the crow's feet
around your eyes.

46
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,843
What do you think, Magda?
That sound good to you?

47
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,766
Oh, Jesus. She didn't just...

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,570
She was up till 1:30 eating nachos and
watching Last Call with Carson Daly.

49
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:32,091
I've sold my soul to the devil,
and this devil just won't die.

50
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,301
When we met, I was in my early 20s,
struggling actor.

51
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:40,806
Magda's health was deteriorating fast.
I decided to marry her,

52
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:45,430
figured I'd put in a couple of years
at most, get a pretty nice payday.

53
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,637
Her first husband
made millions in tobacco.

54
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,273
No money in the world
is worth giving up your life for.

55
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:54,360
If I leave beelzebub now, her first
phone call will be to the lawyers.

56
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:58,436
I'll wind up with practically bupkis,
and then she'll keel over the next day.

57
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,762
It's her life.

58
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,769
Oh, I haven't even told you
the worst part.

59
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,838
Magda screws like bugs bunny.

60
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,282
She demands it, 6-8 times a day.

61
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,975
- How do you do it?
- I close my eyes.

62
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:15,940
I think of the villa I'll buy
in Portofino when she finally kicks.

63
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,373
How long was I out?

64
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,346
Damn. You're still here?

65
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:26,586
Oh, I dreamt I was screwing
a flugelhorn player.

66
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,531
Yes. We heard the flugelhorn.

67
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,229
I'm hungry. Go make me some soup.

72
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,334
OK, people, let's get it done.

73
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,613
15 blade.

74
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,271
Oh, my God. What happened?

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,011
- Who's that?
- It's ashley.

76
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,716
- So, where have you been?
- What...

77
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:37,024
This woman was crushed by an elephant
at the circus. Isn't that right, Peter?

78
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,872
I am performing a mandibular
reconstruction with the 13th rib.

79
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:43,367
- Just... 3 centimeters to the left.
- No, doctor, not the patient.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,190
- You. Your eyes.
- Oh, it's nothing.

81
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,068
Just a little river blindness.

82
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,729
I caught it fixing cleft palates on the
Amazonian river this weekend.

83
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,905
Oh, the Yanomani children.

84
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,054
To see their faces, it was all worth it.

85
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,222
- Peter, if you could have been there...
- Doctor, should you be operating?

86
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,713
Yes, I should be operating.
Peter's my eyes.

87
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,223
Bone saw!

88
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:06,177
Here we go.

89
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,752
Oh, we got a bleeder!

90
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,261
Aidan Stone, you are a boy genius.

91
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,744
- Oh, my God.
- Marcus!

92
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:22,651
Freddie, Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.
Thank you. Thank you.

93
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,593
- It was a nice scene.
- Yeah. Thanks. You too.

94
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,459
- Dating a black guy now.
- That's great.

95
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,405
Good for you.

96
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,083
Who's Jose Feliciano over there?

97
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,959
Oh, that's marcus.
Aidan's blindness consultant.

98
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:39,626
I don't know how you guys do it.
And it's all the time, right?

99
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,971
- It's like 24/7.
- Well, pretty much, yeah.

100
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,930
Did it seem authentic, though?

101
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,336
I mean, I was doing some
really cool shit with my eyes.

102
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,788
- Were you?
- Like, back and forth, and then...

103
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,316
- Well, it sounded lifelike.
- It did. Yeah.

104
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,014
But no, what did it look like?
Did it look... 'cause I...

105
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,063
Mr. Mcnamara? Excuse me.

106
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,789
I'm Colleen Rose
of the Colleen Rose agency.

107
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,778
I was on the lot visiting another
client, and I thought I'd swing by

108
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,292
and watch you work.
What I just saw you do was sensational,

109
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,455
just sensational, really.
Such pathos. Strasberg, right?

110
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,153
Doesn't matter. You are a scene stealer.

111
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:18,010
And I hear through the grapevine
you're looking for representation.

112
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,224
I'm flattered, but I'm a medical
consultant, not an actor.

113
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,519
- I don't think i'm very good.
- I totally disagree.

114
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,431
You have a very naturalistic process.

115
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,635
And I know I can get you work...
Movies, commercials.

116
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,166
It would be a crime to hide
that massive talent of yours.

117
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:34,906
I've just gotten off the phone with
Aidie's agent, who's very, very upset

118
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,934
about yesterday's dailies. He has
a massive zit on his client's nose.

119
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,963
I need you tomorrow morning
6 A.M. To reshoot.

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,012
Oh, wait. Freddie, I have 2 surgeries
scheduled for that time.

121
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,103
- Excuse me.
- No, excuse me. I'm Freddie Prune,

122
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,162
executive producer and creator of
Hearts & Scalpels. How can I help you?

123
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,249
And I'm sean's agent.
Colleen Rose of the Colleen Rose agency.

124
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,315
Seanie, I didn't know you had an ag...

125
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:57,575
Sean is not going to be rescheduling
any surgeries because of some zit,

126
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,303
all right? Sean is a medical consultant
and a producer.

127
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:03,392
He's not one of your cattle.
He saves lives at his day job.

128
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:06,446
So listen, do what you have to.
If you have to shoot around him, fine.

129
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:09,938
Get close-ups, fix it in post...
I don't care, really, what you do,

130
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:11,900
but my client will not be here tomorrow.

131
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:16,022
You get me a strawberry frivol right now
before I kick you square in the nuts.

132
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,481
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

133
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:26,818
In this next bit,
I think I'm going to cry.

134
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,795
You know? I just...
I really want to show that

135
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,043
blind people can cry like normal people.

136
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:34,787
- That's pretty brilliant, right?
- You know, Aidan,

137
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,755
blind people really do cry
like everyone else.

138
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,146
I know. But I'm saying that when I cry,

139
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,383
I can see again. Yeah.

140
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:46,149
Oh, but I can only see again when
I'm crying. I have to get, like...

141
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,954
I just got to get really emotional.

142
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:54,788
I don't know that river blindness
was ever cured that way, but,

143
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:57,025
well, from what I've learned,

144
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,876
I mean, blind people do
get their sight back.

145
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,478
Eden, right?

146
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,669
- Yes. We met at your hell party.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,611
- Oh, that was a pretty crazy night.
- Are you looking for Sean?

148
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,136
I think he's hanging out
with the extras somewhere.

149
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,017
No, actually, I took the studio tour
and snuck away.

150
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,270
Thought it would be more fun
to find things myself.

151
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,667
Or maybe you could show me around.

152
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,794
Well, where would you want to start?

153
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:27,130
Oh, well, I've always wondered if the
big stars have beds in their trailers.

154
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,525
I am big, darling.

155
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,458
I'm very big.

156
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,355
I have your results.

157
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:46,500
The tests don't rule out everything,
but your T.S.H. is in the range.

158
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,396
We just can't find out
what's wrong with you, Julia.

159
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:53,189
Well, um, what don't they rule out?

160
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:54,841
Certain rare cancers,

161
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,209
- but I really don't think...
- You don't have cancer.

162
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:01,924
Just sometimes, I think that you believe
I'm faking this whole thing.

163
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:07,100
But I know that there is
something very wrong with me.

164
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,307
And if Dr. Hughes
can't find out what it is,

165
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,605
then I will go to see
someone who can.

166
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,781
There is something else
we could test for.

167
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:19,072
Your symptoms could be caused
by an autoimmune disease.

168
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:25,409
When was the last time
you were tested for HIV?

169
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,217
Slow down. There are other

170
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,190
- autoimmune diseases besides HIV.
- 6 months ago.

171
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,871
And how many partners have you
had since then? Maybe 50?

172
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,403
I'm not HIV positive.

173
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:39,468
I was fine until
we started sleeping together.

174
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,442
Test me for HIV.

175
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:48,718
And I would like you
to get a test today, too.

176
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,961
Here's your afternoon pick-me-up...

177
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,621
double espresso with non-fat soy,
just the way you like it.

178
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:07,184
I left out the sambuca since you do
have surgery in 10 minutes.

179
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,199
Thank you. Oh, thanks.

180
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,307
Did you pick up my dry cleaning?

181
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,866
I got it on my lunch break.
I hung it up in your car.

182
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:18,368
Thanks.

183
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:25,988
What is this crap?

184
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:29,113
I mean, you get my coffee,
you get my messages,

185
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:31,658
you haven't called me "asshole"
in days. It's like

186
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:34,892
Gina slut-bitch died and Miss
Moneypenny's here in her place.

187
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,868
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

188
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,274
No, Christian, really.

189
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,213
I admit it... I'm not the same girl
that you knew back in Miami.

190
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,810
I guess I just... I finally realized
how lucky I am.

191
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:51,657
My viral load is so low,
it actually rivals Magic Johnson's.

192
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,293
I actually like my job.
I get to see Wilbur.

193
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,699
And I have you to thank for it.

194
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:02,150
And I know, you're kind of having
a tough time with Julia, and...

195
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,042
I don't want to add to your problems.

196
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,578
So, huh... huh. What did you hear?

197
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,826
That she rides you pretty hard.

198
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,221
That's all.

199
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,991
Well, you know,
she's sick and she, um...

200
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:30,078
You know, she's in bed all day.
She got nobody to talk to.

201
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,909
- Yeah. No, I get it.
- No, you don't get it. Jesus Christ.

202
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,273
It's like we're married already.
I mean...

203
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,616
I need a break.

204
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:44,674
What you need is a release from all the
stress that this hag is putting on you.

205
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:48,164
- I know exactly how to give it to you.
- Oh, no.

206
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:51,367
I am not going anywhere near that
saber-toothed snatch of yours.

207
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,509
Oh, God. No. I'm done with that
K-hole of irresponsibility.

208
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,068
I have a better idea.

209
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,394
I was thinking about letting Gina go.

210
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,676
You were right.

211
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,920
She's a distraction for both of us.

212
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,131
And today, she asked for a raise.

213
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,218
Well, I think we should
give her a raise.

214
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,266
I hate to admit it, but I think

215
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,223
she's the best receptionist
we've ever had.

216
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:46,239
You know what happened the other day?
I didn't know what to eat for lunch,

217
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,312
so she ordered the entire menu.

218
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,731
When they delivered it,

219
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,787
she screamed at them
for screwing things up,

220
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:53,435
so we got everything for free.

221
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:55,694
Your agent's on the phone.

222
00:12:57,314 --> 00:13:00,038
Agent? I thought you weren't moving out.

223
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:03,135
She's not a real estate agent.
She's a talent agent.

224
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:04,722
Talent agent?

225
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,231
I thought you need talent
for a talent agent.

226
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,597
<i>No panties. I likey likey!</i>

227
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,262
<i>Do you have enough time?</i>

228
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,546
<i>They'll wait.</i>

229
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,391
<i>I run this show. Matter of fact,
I run the whole goddamn network.</i>

230
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,519
<i>I thought Barbara Shapiro
ran the network.</i>

231
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,912
<i>That deaf bitch?</i>

232
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,875
<i>The only reason why they let her
in the jewish mafia is</i>

233
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,357
<i>is to fill a disability quota.</i>

234
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,918
<i>I'm going to make you
squeal like a pig.</i>

235
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,692
<i>Grab my ass.</i>

236
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,589
What happened?

237
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,781
I'm not a premature ejaculator.
There's, like...

238
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,084
There's, like,
3 hours cut out of that...

239
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,783
video. Who edited this?

240
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,045
<i>That's it?</i>

241
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,089
This is bad.

242
00:13:58,517 --> 00:13:59,530
Really bad.

243
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,634
Listen, kids.

244
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,804
2 million downloads
on <i>Youtube</i> in 8 hours.

245
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,432
There's got to be a way we can spin
this to our advantage, don't you think?

246
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:07,652
Barbara...

247
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,436
You know I was just kidding
about the whole jewish mafia thing.

248
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,960
- Sure he was.
- I love the jews.

249
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,439
You're an offensive piece of shit.

250
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,965
What... I'm sorry.
What did she just say?

251
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,943
You are an offensive piece of shit.

252
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,154
Am I... am I fired?

253
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,655
Absolutely not.

254
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:23,949
Is he?

255
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,117
Not yet.

256
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,746
You are going to go straight
to rehab,

257
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,491
and we will tell the press

258
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:34,627
that you're a cokehead
and a sexaholic.

259
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:36,462
And then... hey!

260
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:37,463
3 months,

261
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,299
you will do an interview
with Larry King,

262
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,200
and maybe

263
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,387
we will bring you back for sweeps.
Do you understand?

264
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:47,583
It's too bad you're not black.

265
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,891
We could have kept you
around till the end of the season.

266
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,343
Is this some sort of joke?

267
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,978
OK. First of all, Barbara,
I am the show.

268
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,019
There is no...
there is no show without me.

269
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,859
OK. Freddie is not really
that talented.

270
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,604
- How dare you.
- No, how dare you.

271
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,467
How dare you. What are you going
to do without me?

272
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,213
I just don't understand why I'm here.

273
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,532
Are you going to write
for that fat pig Kate Tinsley?

274
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:07,907
Maybe you should have
thought of this

275
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,274
before you stuck your little penis
in and out of mrs. <i>Youtube</i>

276
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,830
and betrayed not only me,

277
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,957
but the tens of thousands of people
that made you a huge television star.

278
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:18,218
Do you know why you are here?

279
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:20,547
You are here because you are
the new star of <i>Hearts & Scalpels</i>.

280
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,217
That's why you're here.

281
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:26,071
- What?
- What?

282
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,139
Just for 3 months, until... I just need
to keep the show going. It's OK.

283
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,183
- It's... we need to...
- You did good, Colleen.

284
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,228
Saved our ass.

285
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,022
Wait... wait. This was...

286
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:38,857
You're behind this, aren't you?

287
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,026
I'm just as surprised as you are, OK?

288
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:44,014
You said... you put that little
bitch up to it to set me up

289
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,282
so you would take my job.
And I thought we were friends, judas!

290
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:48,450
We're friends?
What are you doing with her, anyway?

291
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,991
I'll tell you one thing, buddy.

292
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:51,651
You want to dance with the devil?
You can go to hell!

293
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,493
You're the one who couldn't
keep his dick in his pants.

294
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,658
2 can play at this game, guy.

295
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,111
This is not over.
This is not over, freddie.

296
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:08,762
Do we have a deal?

297
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,514
Let's talk about the numbers.

298
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,215
I rember you.

299
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,892
You're the one who had so much promise.

300
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,363
So much hope.

301
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:30,862
Thank you, Dr. Troy.

302
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,083
This man's ready to have a do-over.

303
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,461
New face, new life.

304
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:37,449
Now's the time to start.

305
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,752
There you go. No need to let a wife
get in the way of having a good time.

306
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,962
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm going to leave her.

307
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:43,761
What?

308
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,637
No, no, no, no. You don't need
to get divorced to have fun.

309
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:50,076
You can have your cake and eat it, too.

310
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:53,843
No, no, no. No, Magda's no idiot.
She'll hire a private investigator.

311
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:57,374
If I don't just leave her
and throw the last 21 years away,

312
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,313
I'll never have any room to breathe.

313
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,150
Have you ever been
someone's caretaker, Dr. Troy?

314
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:05,736
It's suffocating.

315
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,571
It can drive you to madness.

316
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,140
Wait. Where's nurse Billy?

317
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,353
You shouldn't be walking
around by yourself.

318
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:18,134
He said he'd puke if he saw any blood.

319
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,376
I might just puke when I see your face.

320
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,047
Take a hike, doc.
Time to try out the new hair.

321
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,843
He's not ready for
any physical activity yet.

322
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,221
He's just going to lay there.

323
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:34,431
I don't care.
I'm going to sit on his face.

324
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:39,749
The... yeah. The... the follicles,
they're very...

325
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,751
They're very sensitive right now,
and so, you're going to...

326
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,817
you're going to have
to wait a couple of days.

327
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:48,554
OK. We'll watch a movie.
Where's your tape machine

328
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,656
I got weekend at Bernie's.

329
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:52,950
Not again, Magda.

330
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,689
Yes, again, G.I. Joe.

331
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,871
Now, move your hairy ass.

332
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,957
Make room for momma.

333
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,542
God, momma.

334
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,135
Mid-30s latino softball player
with an external appendage

335
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,758
protruding from the sacral region.

336
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:10,894
A human tail?

337
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,429
<i>No quiero mi cola quitada!</i>

338
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:14,972
Why don't you want it removed, sir?

339
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,284
I'm possessed by Satan!

340
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,605
Your mother sucks cocks in hell!

341
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,210
You know, I don't disagree with you,

342
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,984
but Mr. Aureilles,
you have got to calm down!

343
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,779
Jesus! That's fantastic!

344
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:35,576
Claude, could you see if there's any
of that split pea soup left at crafty?

345
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,575
Here.

346
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,456
Listen to me! You are not possessed.

347
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:42,750
This is a treatable medical condition.

348
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,278
I can't cut my tail off!

349
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes, you can.

350
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,203
This is los angeles, people!

351
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,179
It's called a rolling blackout!

352
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:05,147
Sorry! Accidentally stepped
on the riser pedal.

353
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,690
OK. Now, listen.

354
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:10,027
Everything is going to be fine.
I'm going to remove

355
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:13,822
your devilish appendage, and you'll be
sliding into home plate by next week.

356
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:15,274
Cut!

357
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,327
Bravo, people. Very courageous work.

358
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,316
And a star is born, Freddie.

359
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,551
You know, Colleen,
sometimes I forget that

360
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:29,352
I gave birth to the supernova
that was Aidan Stone.

361
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:32,040
But I tell you what, I think that

362
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,287
Sean McNamara is sexy and

363
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,290
vulnerable and

364
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,318
so very, very modern.

365
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:40,808
And by the way, so do the blogs.

366
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,148
So you're going to be seeing
a lot more scenes like

367
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:44,768
this on <i>Hearts & Scalpels</i>,
I'll tell you that.

368
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,955
God. That's really good.

369
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:49,477
Thank you.
That was impressive work, Sean.

370
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,754
Thanks, Kate. You, too.

371
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:55,635
Though I really don't feel
like I know what I'm doing.

372
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,086
Hey, asshole.

373
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:06,625
No. It's more

374
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:08,086
like, "Hey, asshole."

375
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,295
You know, I'm sorry.
Why are you here, again?

376
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,048
It's postmodern sex, Christian.

377
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,844
This way, we both get what we want
without any consequences.

378
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,026
She's HIV negative,
so you get to ride her bareback,

379
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,599
and I get to experience sex
without exchanging any fluids.

380
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,661
Plus, it's kind of like watching myself.

381
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,190
Christian, you have to look at me.

382
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,442
- But I can't!
- But we have to have a connection!

383
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,019
I can't, all right?
It hurts my neck. All right?

384
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,990
This is not puppetry of the penis.
You want an acrobat? Blow a chimp.

385
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:40,993
Fine.

386
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,270
Jesus.

387
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,039
This isn't working for me.

388
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,665
Just put here where I can see you.

389
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:49,585
That's all.

390
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:14,401
- Kiss me.
- No.

391
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,486
- Kiss me.
- no!

392
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,732
There's no danger of
transmitting the virus unless

393
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,464
I've had dental surgery,
and I haven't.

394
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,589
Leave, Gina. You're ruining everything.

395
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,276
I'm not paying you to use your mouth,
you little whore.

396
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,806
Now, you shut up,
or you won't get a penny.

397
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,375
Please? Kiss me.

398
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,210
no.

399
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,204
Fine. Keep going.

400
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:51,023
Kiss me.

401
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:52,898
Please.

402
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:14,336
I will see you at work in the morning.

403
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,086
Conor finally fell asleep.

404
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,931
You're throwing up again?

405
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,387
I'm sorry. Even tea makes me vomit.

406
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,105
Have you had anything to eat?

407
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,608
I don't want to tell
the kids that I have aids.

408
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:54,791
Julia, you don't have aids.

409
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:56,457
I've got all the symptoms.

410
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,711
Well, along with 100 other
possible things.

411
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:03,102
It's extremely difficult to spread
between women,

412
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:06,731
and Christian has been
very careful ever since Gina.

413
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,866
Yeah. So careful that...

414
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,955
He's ignoring me.

415
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:16,110
I feel like
I'm going through this alone.

416
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,823
Well, you're not.

417
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,728
I'll stay with you.

418
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,555
No. I'm sure you have plans.

419
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,231
And Christian should be here any minute.

420
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:34,911
I'll stay till Christian gets here.

421
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:06,005
What is this, post-coitus cuddling?

422
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:10,334
Don't be an asshole. She's sick.
She can barely hold her head up.

423
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,230
Fell asleep waiting for you.

424
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:14,615
Where have you been?

425
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,485
There were some complications
with a patient recovery.

426
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:20,709
The transplant didn't take,
so I had to redo it.

427
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,640
- You could have called.
- Well, I didn't.

428
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,831
But I'm here now.

429
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,310
And you don't have a ring
on your finger anymore, so...

430
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,925
Time for you to go.

431
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,451
Rest and fluids, hmm?

432
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:55,815
He took the kids for an early dinner.

433
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,439
When you didn't show up,

434
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,195
he offered to stay until you did.

435
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:10,364
You could have called me too, you know.

436
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:14,271
I guess I had all the help I need.

437
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,206
You're leaving me?

438
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,437
I have to, Magda. I...

439
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:38,239
It's time I find my own identity.

440
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:41,573
What will that be, Jeff?
Who are you without me?

441
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,880
I found you on Santa Monica Boulevard
without a pot to piss in.

442
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,681
Everything you are
is because of what I did.

443
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:49,950
I made you a man.

444
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,060
Yeah, well, maybe I don't like
the man I've become.

445
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,930
Could have fooled me.

446
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,793
You seem to love having
gifts showered down on you.

447
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,465
Trips to Europe, cars,

448
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,853
a new wardrobe every season.

449
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:07,928
Don't you want that new Bentley
that's parked outside?

450
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:12,435
It was going to be
your welcome home gift.

451
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,825
You know, I know I'm slowing down,

452
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:20,102
and I can't keep up all the time,

453
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:23,032
so I figured
it would be great for you to have

454
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:25,422
a new car to drive around in

455
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,055
and show off your new face
to your friends.

456
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,853
And I was going to throw in
$500 more a week

457
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,360
walking-around money.

458
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:40,594
You know, Jeffy,
you're what keeps me alive.

459
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,219
But I'm not going to live forever.

460
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:47,233
You... you promise?

461
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,108
To us.

462
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:59,661
- Again, I'm sorry I was so late.
- Forget about it.

463
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:00,986
Forget about it!

464
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:05,651
While I was waiting,
I made friends with this bottle here.

465
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,628
Yeah, I see that.

466
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,959
Maybe you two should
take some time apart.

467
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,914
Oh, I'm fine, cookie. Perfect!

468
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:17,217
Well, I've got some good news,
and I've got some bad news.

469
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:21,969
The bad news is,

470
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,847
next week, you have
a nude scene with 2- ton Tinsley.

471
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,251
What? Colleen, I can't do that.

472
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:30,814
I'm not even an actor.

473
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:33,092
- It's undignified...
- The good news is,

474
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:36,354
I told that Freddie "Forget it!
My client won't do it."

475
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,213
"No nudie."

476
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,579
He agreed.
You're getting more surgeries.

477
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:47,753
Which means you get to keep
what I am sure is that

478
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:51,378
scrumptious weenie of yours under wraps.

479
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,143
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

480
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:00,833
Uh, my steak's a little rare, but...

481
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,049
Excuse me.

482
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,359
- No, Colleen, it's fine.
- Let me do my job, Sean.

483
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:06,361
Waitress.

484
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:13,951
Oh, God. Magda, slow down.

485
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,266
Slow down.
You're going to hurt yourself.

486
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:18,665
Zip it. You're ruing
my Tom Selleck fantasy.

487
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,153
Oh, Magnum!

488
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:26,151
- Oh! Somebody's going to see us!
- Good! We'll charge admission.

489
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,620
Super orgasm!

490
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:41,751
Where did you go? Wake up.

491
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,563
Wake up!

492
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:54,572
Are you going to be OK?

493
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,032
Let me ask you something.

494
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,134
- What are you doing?
- What do you think of these?

495
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:01,950
Colleen, this is inappropriate.

496
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:04,446
- This is crossing the line.
- Go ahead. Squeeze them.

497
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,859
These aren't the tits of a
50ish-year-old woman, am I right?

498
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,937
You're drunk, OK?
Just go to bed and get some rest,

499
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:14,573
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- They look fake, they're so perky.

500
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:16,422
Colleen, get out of the car.

501
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:22,389
Sorry.

502
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,754
Sorry, cookie.

503
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:27,216
Oh, shit, am I sorry.

504
00:29:27,336 --> 00:29:29,830
- It's fine...
- No, it isn't fine. It's...

505
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:33,158
Ever since my husband left me
2 years ago for this

506
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:39,036
young Goddamn extra from
"The young and the restless"...

507
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:44,520
And then, I had these fibroid tumors
the size of grapefruits

508
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,520
that they cut out of me.

509
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:51,553
Sorry. It won't happen again, cookie.

510
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,403
Oh, shit.

511
00:29:57,116 --> 00:29:59,507
I've got to go back to A.A. tomorrow.

512
00:30:01,194 --> 00:30:03,163
Agents Anonymous.

513
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,765
Get it?

514
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,755
Just drink some water
and go to bed, please.

515
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,483
Do you have a breath mint?

516
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:17,844
No?

517
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:20,835
OK.

518
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,904
Oh, Jesus, God.

519
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:50,322
You have a nice day. Thank you.

520
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:54,275
McNamara/Troy. Thank you for holding.
How can I help you?

521
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:57,731
Oh, hi, Julia.
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

522
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:02,478
Listen, I'd love to talk. I just...
I need Christian.

523
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:05,142
I haven't seen him yet.
Did you try his cell?

524
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,879
He's not picking up.

525
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:10,649
You just tell him that I called.

526
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:13,278
Any message?

527
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,944
<i>Will you ask him
if he's heard from Dr. Hughes? </i>

528
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:17,541
I was just, um...

529
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:22,011
Hoping that he could rush
through some test results of mine.

530
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,743
I will definitely make sure
that he gets that message.

531
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:28,335
You feel better, OK?

532
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,903
Bye.

533
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:41,763
- Hi.
- Any messages?

534
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:44,622
Yeah.

535
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:46,824
Julia call?

536
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:48,669
No.

537
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:53,054
But there's a fresh pot
of sumatra in the kitchen.

538
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,369
Hi, Julia.

539
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:04,961
When I spoke to you on the phone,
I was so worried about you.

540
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,644
Here.

541
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:09,744
Um, thanks. God.
Can you just leave them there?

542
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:13,166
- Smells right now are making me...
- Oh! I rember that feeling

543
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:16,138
when I was first on the cocktail.
Even the slightest odor

544
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:17,341
would make me yack.

545
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:19,724
Has Dr. Hughes put you
on the cocktail already?

546
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,062
I don't know what you're talking about.

547
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:26,607
It's not HIV tests
that you're waiting to hear about?

548
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,481
Julia, one of the advantages
of me answering the phones

549
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:33,489
is that I am the gatekeeper
for the entire office.

550
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,578
Nothing gets past me.

551
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,250
Now, what I can't figure out is how
you managed to put yourself at risk.

552
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:41,841
And Christian uses condoms, right?

553
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,874
Is Christian positive?

554
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,757
I'm sure everything's going to be fine.
I'm just a cynic.

555
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,006
Even if the worst were to occur,
you could get through this.

556
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:57,176
I can help you. Christian will help you.
When I found out that i was positive,

557
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,259
he was so wonderful.

558
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,686
He was a fount of support.

559
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:05,696
Not for me. I've barely seen him lately.

560
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:09,455
That makes sense.

561
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,352
What's that supposed to mean?

562
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,103
I hate to be the one
to bring you bad news,

563
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:16,577
but I think that we're friends,

564
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,568
even if your shitty managerial skills
did single-handedly destroy the spa

565
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,615
that I sacrificed
my entire nest egg for.

566
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,958
Just say what you have to say, Gina.

567
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,460
Christian's having an affair.

568
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,221
I literally walked in on them. It...

569
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,813
- it was degrading.
- No, no. That's not true.

570
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,371
Oh, don't be such a Pollyanna, Julia.
It makes me sick.

571
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:41,873
Gina, I want you to leave, please.
Right now.

572
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:44,685
OK.

573
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,009
Bye.

574
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:51,708
You know,
I guess all that I'm trying to say

575
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,502
is I think you need
to keep that dyke close.

576
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:57,169
Christian is not capable
of keeping his sword sheathed.

577
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,751
He's not capable of staying committed.

578
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,671
That's not news to you, right?

579
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,478
I mean, surely, you've figured that out
after all these years.

580
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:09,737
What are you doing here, Gina?

581
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:17,840
Just a little girl talk.

582
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:23,211
Oh. Julia, what I neglected to tell you

583
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,065
is the woman Christian's
having the affair with is me.

584
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:39,189
She's a dirty, whoring liar,

585
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:41,860
and she's been in love
with me for years.

586
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,959
But are you sleeping
with her, Christian?

587
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:48,001
No. She's got the gate to hell
between her legs.

588
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:51,197
Why don't you tell your precious Julia
where you were last night?

589
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,615
OK. Fine. I will.

590
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:02,193
At home with my tongue in his ass.

591
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,714
I want you to leave, Gina.

592
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,751
And by the way, you're fired.

593
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:11,310
Oh, yeah. I expected that.

594
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:14,385
I mean, it's a conflict of interest,
our working together now.

595
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,705
And feel better, Julia.

596
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:25,907
I should have known you'd never change.

597
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:29,245
You're such a damn hypocrite,
accusing me of sleeping around

598
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:32,118
when the only evidence you have
is that wingnut...

599
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:35,763
Despite the fact
that you're cheating on Olivia.

600
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:37,922
I can't talk about this now.

601
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:39,736
I'm not feeling well.

602
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:41,983
There's always something wrong with you.

603
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:44,603
At least Gina
doesn't live in denial, like you do.

604
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:47,176
You want me to just face facts

605
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:51,242
and admit that this relationship
isn't working? Is that it?

606
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,749
That you're never here for me?
That you don't support me?

607
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,209
That I'm not even sick?

608
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:02,490
You're not sick, Julia.

609
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:05,563
Or should I say, you
didn't catch anything from me?

610
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:22,545
I'm going to go heat up
some soup for you or something.

611
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:32,232
Tell me you don't like
about yourself now.

612
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,617
Me? I'm perfect.
It's dudley do-right here.

613
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,490
You got to do something about his chin.

614
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:43,453
Every time I'm riding him,
it's like I'm sitting on a butt plug.

615
00:36:44,272 --> 00:36:45,885
And you really want this?

616
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:47,767
Not just her
making this decision for you?

617
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,711
Sure. I mean,
she just gave me a Bentley.

618
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:54,528
Magda, don't you think
it's a little soon to be getting

619
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,064
back in the saddle, so to speak?

620
00:36:56,184 --> 00:36:59,899
Hell, no. It's now or never, guys.
I mean,

621
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:03,185
I'm pretty much knocking
at death's door,

622
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:06,011
and I don't see anyone waiting
on the other side for me.

623
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,571
Then out of respect for Mr. Morris.

624
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:11,571
He's had a grand mal seizure.
He's a vegetable.

625
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:13,148
He'll never live a normal life again.

626
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,642
Yeah, that's a damn shame.

627
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:18,730
Jeff was really great in the sack.

628
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:23,033
This one just lays there
like a bag of rocks.

629
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,323
But I'm teaching him.

630
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,671
You know, Jeff made
his own choices in life.

631
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:36,365
And I got to do the same thing.
It's time to move on.

632
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,426
You get nothing from the past,

633
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,916
and who knows what the future is.

634
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,131
It's the present, boys.

635
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:48,304
You got to take a bite out of that apple
and have fun while you can.

636
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:50,980
Nobody's keeping score.

637
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,841
Hey, cookie. Got us some jamba juices.

638
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:06,182
I've got bana berry or razzmatazz.
Which one do you want?

639
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:10,267
After the scene I made last night,
I need to replenish my fluids.

640
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:14,370
That's an apology, by the way.

641
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,995
Apology accepted.

642
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,037
I'll call you if I need you.

643
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,295
I was, um, thinking I'd stick around
and watch the scene.

644
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:28,074
Do you see
any other agents here, Colleen?

645
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,333
Every day, you have
some excuse to come visit

646
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:33,126
and hover around me
like some irritating fly.

647
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,554
Why don't you go back to your office
and just let me do my work?

648
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:39,255
Now, you just stop with the attitude,
Mister Fancy Pants.

649
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,267
We have to stick together here.

650
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:44,243
No, we don't.
I'm tired of you crossing boundaries.

651
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,394
I'm your client, not your friend.

652
00:38:46,944 --> 00:38:49,182
And we need to keep things professional.

653
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:51,932
I don't want to see you here
unless I invite you.

654
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:53,408
Am I clear?

655
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,093
Thanks for the jamba juice.

656
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:58,821
Ooh, hey, uh...

657
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,431
How much more time
do they need to light the set?

658
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:03,849
About 25 minutes.

659
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:06,398
Can you throw this away for me?

660
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:10,657
Have we met?

661
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:13,380
No, but you're Sean McNamara, right?

662
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:15,605
Never really met a tv star before.

663
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:17,464
What is your name?

664
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,877
I'm Jenny. I'm just an extra here.

665
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:22,431
Well, there are no small parts, Jenny.

666
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,779
- Can I show you around?
- Sure.

667
00:39:56,506 --> 00:39:57,530
What is this?

668
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:02,127
Well, I figured that you called
to apologize, and

669
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:04,528
I wanted to make it as easy as possible.

670
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:06,282
I didn't come to apologize.

671
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:09,267
I came to serve you
with a restraing order.

672
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:14,333
I don't want you near me, Wilbur, Julia,

673
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,634
or my work ever again.

674
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:20,763
That's bullshit.

675
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:23,918
I didn't do anything.

676
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:26,857
I took a page out of your book, satan...
I lied.

677
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,566
I told the judge that you were harassing
me and my family,

678
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:30,918
and that you were stalking Julia.

679
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,617
With your history,
he didn't have to think twice.

680
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:35,261
OK.

681
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:41,448
If this is it between us, then...

682
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:45,016
Well, I think we should end it
the way we began it.

683
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,308
I made us a meal.
I think your mouth's going to water

684
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,491
when you see the first course.

685
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:55,420
Just look at it.

686
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:01,707
Very cute.

687
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,204
But you're kidding yourself, Gina.

688
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,045
I know you want it, Christian.

689
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,528
I know you want it
'cause you're just like me.

690
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:10,992
I'm nothing like you.
You're a goddamn Medusa.

691
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,377
What, you're a friggin'saint?

692
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:16,622
You're always going to cheat on Julia.
You are always going to come back to me

693
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:20,123
because I'm the filthiest piece of ass
you've ever had.

694
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,734
I came so hard...

695
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,266
Watching you bang that girl.

696
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:26,724
And so did you.

697
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:30,809
I don't judge you.

698
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,368
This is the last time
we'll ever see each other.

699
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:37,626
You love me, asshole, in your own way.

700
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:40,384
Just like I love you.

701
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,947
Like I always have.

702
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,323
There's a difference
between love and sex.

703
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:46,760
No, there isn't.

704
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,398
Sex is the only way that we can feel
we're not alone in the world.

705
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,952
You're always
going to feel alone with Julia

706
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:56,938
'cause she's never going to give
her whole self to you.

707
00:41:58,454 --> 00:41:59,436
I'm leaving.

708
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,079
Come on. Just one last bang.

709
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:04,760
Just for old time's sake.

710
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:07,009
No.

711
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,060
Just stick it in.

712
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:12,178
Just the tip. Just a little bit.

713
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:14,779
You can take all your rage out on me,

714
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,789
just like you always have.

715
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,272
Give me the condom.

716
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:25,136
This is love.

717
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:40,737
<i>This is love.</i>

718
00:42:41,284 --> 00:42:44,008
