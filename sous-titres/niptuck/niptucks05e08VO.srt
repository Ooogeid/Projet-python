1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,690
- Ms. Mckracken, tell us--
- It's not Mckracken. It's Carol.

2
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,678
Mckracken is something
I just use for legal stuff--

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:10,345
Divorce papers, bankruptcy notice,
that sort of thing.

4
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:13,977
- And Carol is your maiden name.
- No. My professional name

5
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,995
As in Christmas carol.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,259
I manage the Deck the Halls store
in Reseda,

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,385
spreading cheer throughout the year
with the widest assortment

8
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:25,573
of Christmas decorations
south of the North Pole.

9
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:28,340
Oh, and these
are the spirits of Christmas.

10
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:34,416
Somebody have a little too much
eggnog and crashed the sleigh?

11
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,760
No. We don't drink and drive.

12
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:39,465
We stroll and sing.

13
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,645
You're professional carolers.

14
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,823
We're all proud members of
the screen actors guild,

15
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,585
on honorary withdrawal.

16
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:58,045
Deck the Halls keeps us
in bread pudding year round

17
00:00:58,207 --> 00:01:01,348
so that we can give the gift
of live music for free.

18
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:05,440
That's what we were trying to do
before our trip to Venice.

19
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:08,766
- Oh, your group performed in Italy?
- California.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,221
There we were
in our red hats and scarves...

21
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:14,983
Singing a winter wonderland
watching the sunset on the beach

22
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:18,603
when a tattooed man in blue
approached and advised us

23
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,435
that we were in Crip territory.

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,324
Well, I happen to speak Crip, so I
told him, "Chill. We were friendlies."

25
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,761
But then 5 men in blue approached

26
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:31,465
and asked if the red scarves meant that
we were sent by the bloods to diss them.

27
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:34,204
I said fo-shizzle, we were just
spreading the word

28
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,082
and please not get up in our grills.

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,292
Then I reached for my pitch-pipe--

30
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:42,922
- They beat the crap out of you.
- Maybe they weren't music lovers.

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,959
How did you escape unhurt?

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,246
I took their advice and hauled
my cracker ass out of there.

33
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:54,065
Ms. Carol, does your status at the
screen actor's guild entitle you to

34
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,418
- accident insurance?
- Oh, no.

35
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,088
That's why we're here.

36
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,405
We saw a notice on the
Sag bulletin board

37
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:03,325
for the Hedda Grubman
cosmetic surgery fund.

38
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:04,995
For all four surgeries?

39
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:10,416
In return for your services,
we're prepared to render ours.

40
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,094
- You want to sing for your surgeries?
- Not just sing.

41
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:17,159
"Deck the Halls". We will open
our store room to you.

42
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,448
Mcnamara/Troy will be turned
into a winter wonderland

43
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:23,612
with live music
courtesy of "The Spirits."

44
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,857
Mrs. Grubman did love Christmas.

<i>Duke Collins</i>

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,205
Sean, really. What are we, 5?

50
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:21,439
Oh, come on. We've been doing
secret Santa since college.

51
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,872
It's a holiday tradition.

52
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,041
So's mince meat, whatever
the hell that is.

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,255
Well, I think it's sweet. I mean, it's
nice to have some sort of a tradition,

54
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,838
especially when you celebrate
Christmas every year

55
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,707
in a bathing suit and sunblock.

56
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,405
Think of it as a challenge

57
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:38,600
finding something original and
meaningful for under $10.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,474
Good. So, you won't mind another
"pull my finger Santa?"

59
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:44,846
Look-- we haven't all been together
on Christmas in a long time.

60
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,070
Maybe it is stupid,
but I want to do it, OK?

61
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,365
I want to do the tree,
the big turkey dinner.

62
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,092
If we can't take the time to celebrate
being together as a family when we are,

63
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:56,292
we're going to regret it
when we're not.

64
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,265
All right. Let's do it.

65
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,850
If you get your own name,
we throw them all back

66
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,889
- and we try again.
- Yes, yes.

67
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:25,615
Hello.

68
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,462
How bad?

69
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,264
Um, we're on our way.

70
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:37,965
Matt's in the hospital.

71
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,070
He's got second degree burns
over 30 percent of his body,

72
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:45,408
mostly back and legs.

73
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,667
We had to wait for his vitals
to stabilize in the ER

74
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,173
before transferring him over here.

75
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,721
Honey, can you hear me?
Everything's going to be all right.

76
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,547
- Pulse is 160...
- Hang in there, buddy.

77
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,820
- He'll need excision and grafting.
- We'll do it.

78
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,112
Fine. We'll just prep him
and check your privileges.

79
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:01,392
My God, I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

80
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,805
Methamphetamine lab explosion.
Excuse me.

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,115
- Meth lab explosion?
- We thought he was clean.

82
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:11,072
- And you didn't tell me?
- He told us it was over.

83
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,170
That he'd gotten help and
had it under control.

84
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:15,127
He asked us to trust him, Julia.

85
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,237
We'll be back when we're finished.

86
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,882
He's lucky to be alive.

87
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,506
We have to focus on that.

88
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,146
I'm angry at him, too, you know?

89
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,016
How are you feeling, sweetie?

90
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:09,958
The surgery went well.
We had to do some grafting.

91
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,840
We took some skin from your ass.

92
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:15,744
You know, the place
where you keep your brains?

93
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:18,007
Thank you.

94
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,884
They said you were lucky.

95
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,229
That you could have been killed.

96
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:29,910
How could you do this to yourself?
I just don't understand.

97
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:39,157
In the ambulance I heard them.

98
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,897
They didn't think
I was going to make it.

99
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,728
And all I could think about was Jenna,
about leaving my baby.

100
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,169
Don't give up on me, OK?

101
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,804
No one's giving up on you.

102
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,210
We're your family.

103
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,204
You'll be out in time for Christmas

104
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,543
- and we'll all be together.
- No, we won't.

105
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,240
You're not invited.

106
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,566
Your promises are shit, man.

107
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:17,193
I'm done saving your ass.
I'm done being sucked in by your lies,

108
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:19,094
your pathetic cries for help.

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,658
You know what it's like to be a parent--
peeling skin away

110
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,298
from the body of your own child?

111
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,595
The child you delivered with
your own hands? I'm through!

112
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,839
Don't worry. He'll come around.

113
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,955
I'll talk to him.

114
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:49,420
The bullet entered at a strange angle.

115
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,841
Whoever did this
must have been up pretty close.

116
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,619
He was sitting on my lap.

117
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,837
Oh, so this was a lover's quarrel.

118
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:59,461
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,955
It was a kid, 9 or 10 years old.

120
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,564
Sorry. I thought that--

121
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,657
Look, I needed some extra cash
last Christmas, so I

122
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,790
took a gig playing Santa.

123
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,253
Merry christmas, Jacob.

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,085
<i>I had a line a mile long.</i>

125
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,999
<i>The store was going to close
in a half hour.</i>

126
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,198
<i>From the minute he climbed those steps,
I knew something was wrong.</i>

127
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:29,857
<i>Thinking back, it was like
he was on a mission or something.</i>

128
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,241
<i>I asked him what he wanted
for Christmas.</i>

129
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,394
Same as last year. Don't you remember?

130
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,610
Every christmas I give you a list--

131
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,553
a Nintendo, an iPod, a digital camera.

132
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:45,671
And every time you tell me
you'll get me that stuff, if I'm good.

133
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:49,227
Yeah, right. Being good doesn't
get you anything, does it?

134
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,709
You lying sack of Christmas shit.

135
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,829
They shot Santa!

136
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:10,319
Did they catch the kid?

137
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,128
Yeah. But I didn't press charges.

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,945
I mean, the kid's had it tough enough.

139
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,523
Why make it worse?

140
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,585
Well, that's very magnanimous of you,
Mr. Collins.

141
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:27,657
I'm not sure many people would
have responded quite that way.

142
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,688
We'd have to reopen the wound,

143
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,427
clean the scarring and damaged tissue,

144
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:39,254
and then create something
called a "Limberg flap,"

145
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,795
which we'd rotate
onto the enlarged hole.

146
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,544
I could schedule you
for sometime after the--

147
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,583
No. I want it done now.

148
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,476
I want to be out in time
to be Santa on Christmas eve.

149
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,770
Look, doc,

150
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:55,896
I've spent a year nervous
around kids, you know?

151
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,417
It's like post-traumatic
stress syndrome.

152
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,110
I've got to get back on the reindeer.
I like kids.

153
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,399
I don't want to spend my life
afraid of them,

154
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:07,101
have them afraid of me.

155
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,997
Mmm...I talked to Sean about Matt.

156
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,754
He'll come around.

157
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,544
This doesn't feel right--
Sneaking around.

158
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,678
That's why we should tell him.
Just be honest about it.

159
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,325
I'm going to wait 'till
after the holidays.

160
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,934
It was going to be hard enough this year

161
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,310
with everything going on with Matt.

162
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,440
It'd just be cruel.

163
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,114
What about Olivia?
You have to tell her, too.

164
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,191
No. She has too much going on with Eden.

165
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:51,035
I want to wait 'till
after the holidays. Please.

166
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,012
It's important to me.

167
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,655
Shit!

168
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,310
Jesus!

169
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,472
I thought you said he was
in surgery all afternoon.

170
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,787
- Someone must have canceled.
- <i>Hello</i>.

171
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,483
I'm not getting in that closet.

172
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:22,349
Christian. Christian?

173
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:30,638
What are you doing?

174
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,010
Just working out.

175
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,626
I always do this after I masturbate.

176
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,875
Make sure I hit all the muscle
groups.

177
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,993
I thought we'd go get a tree together.

178
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,506
I found this great organic tree farm
down on third.

179
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,200
They've got Douglas firs and

180
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,000
- Colorado blue spruce--
- Sean, Sean, Sean!

181
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:51,931
You don't expect me to work out
in front of the mirror

182
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,076
and not want to whack off again.

183
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,061
You're sick.

184
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,069
You go by yourself.

185
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:03,839
I can take all night.

186
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:06,100
I need a lot of foreplay.

187
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:09,559
I'll wait. I'm not due back in surgery
for a couple of hours.

188
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,865
- Can I get you some water or something?
- Get him out of here.

189
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,390
I'm not good in small, dark spaces.

190
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,351
I feel like I'm in a sealed coffin.

191
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:39,207
Are you done?

192
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:43,138
You go, man. I just want to take
a nap and cuddle.

193
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,014
Come on. Get up and let's go!

194
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,013
You go. I'm all snuggled up here.

195
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:50,707
It's pathetic picking out
a tree by yourself.

196
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,813
We used to always do it together,
the 3 of us, rember?

197
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,816
Yeah, I know, I know.
That was 20 years ago.

198
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,781
Now we do things by ourselves,
like, tie our shoelaces

199
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,101
and pick up trees.

200
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,122
Fine.

201
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,871
I'll call Julia. See if she'll come.

202
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,255
Why is her phone here?

203
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,286
I don't know. I guess I must have
picked it out by mistake

204
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:25,913
when we played secret Santa.

205
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,390
All right. I'll go by myself.

206
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,488
If I hear one word
about the size or shape.

207
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,892
I'm not one of your girlfriends, Sean.

208
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:48,602
That was fun.
Let's never do that again.

209
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,728
Have you seen my other shoe?

210
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:56,922
There you go.

211
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,136
Where are you going?

212
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,514
Where I should have gone
instead of coming here.

213
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:07,340
- To talk to Kimber.
- You sure you'll come out alive?

214
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,572
I don't know, but I have to try.

215
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,184
I mean, the fact is,

216
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,164
if I can avoid hurting
Sean and Olivia, I will.

217
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:19,310
But I'm not going to have
my son wake up

218
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:22,773
and feel that everyone
in his life has deserted him.

219
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,396
You know what? I'm coming with you.

220
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:28,901
Takes at least 2 to tango
with Kimber,

221
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,411
preferably 8. One for each tentacle.

222
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,964
Go away!

223
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:03,336
Bah humbug.

224
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,026
Ebenezer Cruz,
where's your Christmas spirit?

225
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:10,983
I love that our savior was born.
I just hate the party we throw

226
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,199
and the music.

227
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:16,357
I mean, take a look at this guy.

228
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:19,947
Getting plugged by a 10-year-old
because he didn't get a Nintendo.

229
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,800
People go broke, they eat too much,

230
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,349
spend it alone--

231
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,626
Come on, Liz. After all these years,

232
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,609
you still need an engraved invitation?

233
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:31,142
You're spending the day with us,
just like you do every Christmas.

234
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,669
You, too, Linda.

235
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,019
Can't. I'm golfing.

236
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,382
It won't be the same without you.

237
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,637
We're having everybody over.
Julia's coming.

238
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,789
And olivia.

239
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,097
I don't think I can make it either.

240
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,761
Are you still pissed
about what happened with Julia?

241
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:49,111
I wish that I were
a better person, Sean.

242
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:53,426
But maybe we both can learn
a lesson in forgiveness from Santa.

243
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:55,340
So you think duke here did
the right thing

244
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,076
by forgiving the kid that shot him.

245
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,159
That the punk's going to suddenly
see the light and go straight?

246
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,369
What movie are you living in?
"It's a wonderful life"?

247
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:07,189
Should have pressed charges
and locked that kid up,

248
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:10,388
so no one else would wind up
with a hole in their face.

249
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,238
It's about love, Sean.

250
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:13,941
It's about grace.

251
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,191
Mr. McNamara,

252
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,252
are you asleep?

253
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:36,167
You've been asleep
the last 4 times I've come to visit.

254
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,404
5's my limit. I won't be back again.

255
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:44,217
Mr. McNamara, persons suffering

256
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:46,308
disfigurement from a traumatic event

257
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,745
have to learn
how to recreate themselves,

258
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,393
to adapt to new body images.

259
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,013
Look,

260
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,960
lady, my dad's a plastic surgeon, ok?

261
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,589
I'm going to be fine,
so try recreating someone else.

262
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,064
I don't usually force
my services on unwilling patients.

263
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:11,273
The results are rarely successful.

264
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:13,828
However,

265
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,867
after reading your medical history,

266
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:21,202
I think you're definitely
in need of some recreation.

267
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,573
You tested dirty for meth.

268
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,673
I'm Rachel Ben-Natan,

269
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,876
your burn rehabilitation counselor.
I'm here to assist you.

270
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:35,934
How did it happen?

271
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,006
It was a falafel attack.

272
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,401
You know, those pita sandwiches?

273
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,263
I just had to have one.

274
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,069
So I went to

275
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,916
the university cafeteria,

276
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:51,747
I sat down

277
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,376
across the table
from a very handsome boy.

278
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,033
I was quite beautiful.

279
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,206
I could always get anyone I wanted.

280
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,266
When he turned away,

281
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,154
I just assumed he was gay
and went back to my falafel.

282
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,706
I was just about to take the first bite
when he blew himself up.

283
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,326
7 students died.

284
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:16,132
There was blood and

285
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:19,399
body parts, and pieces
of flesh everywhere.

286
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:22,623
I don't know how I survived.
I was very lucky.

287
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,901
You think you were lucky?

288
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:30,949
Well, I've lost my taste for falafel,
but I still have my life.

289
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,535
- Have you walked the hallways today?
- No.

290
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,331
No. It still hurts.

291
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,428
It will hurt more if you don't.

292
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,239
What if I say no?

293
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:42,766
Try it and see.

294
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,659
I should warn you though,
I spent 2 years in the israeli army.

295
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,194
And merry Christmas

296
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,789
to the biggest dick in town.

297
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,871
Keep it up, Danny boy.

298
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:20,672
How about that, uh?

299
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:26,452
All right, go on with your business.
We'll have a little swinging.

300
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,871
So, who's the over-40 crowd?

301
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:31,654
No one. Just some ghosts
from Christmas past.

302
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:35,201
Could stay close,
'cause I might need you.

303
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,308
Merry christmas, Julia.

304
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,563
- Would you like to hold baby Jenna?
- Yeah. May I?

305
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,671
No. You may not.

306
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,195
Emily, take Jenna to daycare.

307
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,475
So I take it you 2 are Mattie's parents.

308
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:51,773
I promise you that your granddaughter
will get everything that money can buy.

309
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,644
Great. So she can grow up
to be just like her mommy.

310
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:57,762
I don't think we should hope
for miracles, do you?

311
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,134
Wouldn't want to pressure the child.

312
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,733
Ram's going to marry me, and then

313
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,428
he's going to legally adopt
Jenna once we both get divorced.

314
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,713
That's why we came, Kimber,
because we thought you'd like to know

315
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,420
matt's had an accident.
He's in the hospital

316
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,896
and he's been badly burned.

317
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,117
Making meth, right?

318
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,458
Well, thank god Jenna was with me.

319
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,848
You're not fit to be near that child,
Kimber, and you know it.

320
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,637
What? You're a good mother, why?
Because you went to college?

321
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,357
Or is it because you've never had
to work a day in your life?

322
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,935
Because I was busy raising a family.

323
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:30,718
Yeah. You were lousy at it.

324
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:34,790
You robbed him of everything, Kimber.
His identity, his money, his future.

325
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:38,054
You're not going to
rob him of his child.

326
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:40,536
Don't you think that the little girl
is going to be a little bit better off

327
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:41,895
with Kimber and me,

328
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,816
rather than some punk who is willing
to be filmed taking it up the ass

329
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,732
so he can score
a little bit more boo-yah?

330
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,001
That's my son, you dick-sucking pimp.

331
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,503
Didn't you guys know
that Matt worked here?

332
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:55,698
Ram cast him in "First time fairies."

333
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,299
As a bottom.

334
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,272
Stop it, kimber. You're lying.

335
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:04,055
It's the only thing she's good at,
except for spreading her legs.

336
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:07,385
Well, my daughter's going to
have everything.

337
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:10,770
She's going to have designer clothes,
gourmet food,

338
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,647
and 2 parents who love her.

339
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,428
What's matt going to give her? Drugs?

340
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:19,006
So stop trying to rescue my child
when you can't save your own.

341
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:22,018
Could you please escort
these grandparents out of here?

342
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:28,783
Merry Christmas.

343
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:36,026
Hi, Julia.

344
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:40,602
I made some fruitcake.

345
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:43,550
It's a recipe from
one of my mom's ex's.

346
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,855
She was a real bitch,
but a dynamite pastry chef.

347
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:51,569
At least there was something
you liked about her.

348
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,277
I made it for you.

349
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:57,035
It's sort of a peace offering.

350
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,724
You want peace, Eden?

351
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:03,443
It's going to take a lot more than
a fruitcake after what you've done.

352
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,052
You have every reason to hate me, Julia.

353
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:09,799
My being with Sean was inexcusable.

354
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:12,065
Some sort of acting out, I guess.

355
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,827
I really should be back in therapy.

356
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,128
My anger towards you--

357
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:21,038
I feel terrible
about the way I've behaved.

358
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:24,723
Look...

359
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,786
you love my mom,

360
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,005
my mom loves you.

361
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:34,201
I've never had a real family.

362
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,823
Maybe this could be one.

363
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:45,635
I used to love fruitcake
when I was a girl.

364
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:49,907
It's so fattening.

365
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,171
One bite won't hurt.

366
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:12,202
What are you doing for Christmas?

367
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,294
Nothing really.

368
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,705
I may just go to the movies
or something.

369
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:23,622
I know mom's going to be with you.

370
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:25,206
It's ok.

371
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,798
Why don't you join us?

372
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,782
That's really kind of you, Julia,

373
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:37,258
but I don't think Sean
would appreciate my being there.

374
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:41,297
I don't know. You know,
it might help him.

375
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,559
Forgive and move on.

376
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:47,872
I'd love to come.

377
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:03,269
It's delicious.

378
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:08,877
This is what I rember about fruitcake--

379
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,307
once you start, it's hard to stop.

380
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,991
Well, I'll save the rest for later.

381
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:17,508
You can have it whenever you want.

382
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,059
Mom doesn't really like it anyway, so...

383
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,977
It's all yours.

384
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:40,427
Just a few more steps, mr. McNamara.

385
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:46,127
- Are all israeli women this--
- Pushy? Yes. It's genetic.

386
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,554
At ease, soldier.

387
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:57,315
So how long did you train for?

388
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,014
Not long.
Women are not really expected to fight.

389
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:04,121
Thank God.

390
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:06,955
Didn't you want to defend your country?

391
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,406
What I wanted was to find a husband.

392
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:16,305
All those handsome,
hard bodies in uniform,

393
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:21,075
tanned and sex-starved from the desert.

394
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:24,483
So after the army you went
to university to study psychology.

395
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:26,497
No. To find a husband.

396
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,525
Hey, Mattie.

397
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,326
- Is this a bad time?
- We were just finishing.

398
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:38,100
Rest up. Tomorrow we're going
to do twice around the floor.

399
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,892
No, Rachel. Stay, please.

400
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:45,105
Guys, this is Rachel Ben-Natan,
my counselor and torturer.

401
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,895
This is my mother Julia McNamara
and one of my fathers Christian Troy.

402
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:51,220
Mattie has 2 daddies. Nice to meet you.

403
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,843
- How nice for you.
- Yeah, it's big fun.

404
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:57,655
I-- we've been to see Kimber.

405
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,186
How's Jenna? Is she all right?

406
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,453
Kimber wants to keep Jenna, Matt.

407
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:10,657
I just need sometime with her to talk,
show her I've changed.

408
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:13,087
Apparently she's filing for divorce,
she's getting married

409
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,448
to Ram, and they have a pretty good case
against you ever getting custody.

410
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,180
No, I'm gonna fight for her.
She belongs with me.

411
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:21,420
Do you really think that you're capable

412
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,420
of taking care of a child?

413
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,927
She can't wait for you to grow up.

414
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:30,525
First dad and now you.
Anyone else wants to throw in the towel?

415
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,111
Oh, Mattie, come on.
Do you really think that any judge

416
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:34,180
in his right mind would give
you custody?

417
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:35,439
Seriously!

418
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:38,978
What is the Matter with you people?
Matt, listen to me.

419
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,734
You want your child back?

420
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:43,025
Either find a way or make a way.

421
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,663
And stop looking to your parents
to rescue you.

422
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,286
I'll be right back.

423
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:05,812
Are you ok?

424
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:08,084
Oh, yeah yeah. Really.

425
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:11,733
Just-- feeling a little low and

426
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:15,890
overwhelmed with everything
that's been going on.

427
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:19,693
- Excuse me, miss.
- I'm not going to apologize.

428
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:21,109
I meant every word I said.

429
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,152
- Was that tough love?
- Honesty. Try it.

430
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:34,944
Look, I'm a plastic surgeon.

431
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:37,259
I know you don't make much
as a burn counselor.

432
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:39,498
I'd be happy
to offer my services for free.

433
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:43,178
Why? Is there something
you think I should have done?

434
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,132
Well, since honesty
is the word of the day,

435
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:51,389
I could do a series of skin grafts,
I could restructure your bone line.

436
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,914
You could make me beautiful again.

437
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,482
Thank you, doctor, but no.

438
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:58,933
You might find this hard to believe, but

439
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:00,369
I'm quite happy as I am.

440
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,649
- A martyr?
- A survivor.

441
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,035
A living example of what people
can go through and survive.

442
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:23,896
Are you all right?

443
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,125
- Yeah.
- You look a little pale.

444
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:30,564
I'm probably getting a bug
that's going around or something.

445
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:33,882
Here they are.
I can't believe I found them.

446
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,591
What's going on?

447
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:42,061
What? Oh, nothing.
I must have gotten up too quickly.

448
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,990
Oh, those pictures are freshman year!

449
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:48,350
Christmas Eve before and after
the tree caught on fire.

450
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,770
You guys go ahead and laugh.

451
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,487
You didn't suffer
property damage, right?

452
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:54,991
Those "Penthouse" magazines
were vintage. Irreplaceable.

453
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,038
Ok, thank you.

454
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:03,334
Hello.

455
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,554
Well, we were just going to do
our secret santa thing.

456
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:14,291
Ok, well, I could meet you later.

457
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,575
Ok. Yeah.

458
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:19,659
You too. Bye.

459
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:25,368
Ah, that was Olivia.
We're having dinner later.

460
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,737
- I see you got your phone back.
- What?

461
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:34,762
Oh, yeah. God, I've been leaving things
all over the place lately.

462
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,072
So, who's going to go first?

463
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,387
I will.

464
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:43,345
Although I don't know
if we can top last year's

465
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,628
"I love my dick" picture frame.

466
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:46,802
That was good, huh?

467
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,112
Thank you, Santa.

468
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:54,640
Green paper, my favourite.

469
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,405
"McNamara/Troy.
Put your tits in our hands".

470
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,891
I thought that worked
for 80% of our clients.

471
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,910
Doesn't get better than that, does it?

472
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,253
My turn.

473
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:13,292
Mmm... edible undies. Hilarious.

474
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,301
Dessert for Olivia.

475
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,038
Very funny.

476
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,775
I have another one.

477
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,663
Hey, you're not supposed
to go over, rember?

478
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,160
- You know...
- Make us look cheap.

479
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,217
Oh, they're beautiful.

480
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:33,170
It's not like they're expensive
or anything.

481
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,090
It's just-- I don't know, I saw them,

482
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,306
I thought they'd look good on her, and

483
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,738
I got them.

484
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:48,113
I thought they'd look good
with your eyes.

485
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,334
Thank you, Christian.
You shouldn't have.

486
00:31:56,492 --> 00:31:59,254
You guys are screwing each other.

487
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:03,705
Sean, I just bought her some earrings.

488
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:09,207
The phone, the touching...

489
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:14,062
Am I stupid?

490
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,339
Nobody's stupid. You shouldn't--

491
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:19,095
What? Take it personally?

492
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,353
Let it bother me.

493
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:23,179
She's not my wife anymore,
who gives a shit?

494
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:29,146
- How long?
- Sean, I'm sorry.

495
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:31,494
It just happened.

496
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,541
When were you gonna tell me?

497
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:36,996
Christmas day?

498
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,681
New years?

499
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:40,635
Or did you just want me
to catch you in the act

500
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:43,066
when I came home early by mistake?

501
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:47,050
You were there that day.

502
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:50,064
When the phone--

503
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,495
What did you do, hide under the bed?

504
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:53,800
In the closet.

505
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:58,855
- Jesus.
- Sean, you know,

506
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:01,268
I am sorry and we wanted
to tell you, but--

507
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,802
Well, I just wanted to
wait 'till after the holidays.

508
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,060
Right. Right.

509
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,398
Were you gonna sit me and Oli down
and give us the good news

510
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,590
- at the same time?
- What the hell is the difference?

511
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,275
I mean, seriously.

512
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:15,520
Look, I know it's difficult,
but you're not together now anyway.

513
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,749
- It's not like we're cheating on you.
- You're such a clueless piece of shit!

514
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:36,142
We love each other, Sean.

515
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:33,054
You left early this morning.

516
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:37,212
I didn't figure there was any point
in staying in bed if I wasn't sleeping.

517
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:42,874
I'll say one thing
for leaving the house before 5:00.

518
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,689
There's no traffic.

519
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,548
Look, we've been through enough over the
years to split us apart and then some.

520
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:00,459
But somehow,
we always end up back together.

521
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:05,658
I can't imagine anything in the world
that could change that except

522
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:09,123
maybe Julia. So,

523
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,438
I won't see her
if it means that much to you.

524
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,733
Oh, come on.
It's not like you're Mr. Celibate

525
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,203
pining away waiting for her.

526
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:22,940
Why didn't you just go
to New York and sleep with her there?

527
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,572
Or did you have to follow me
out here and do it under my nose

528
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,650
because that's the only way
you can really get off?

529
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,166
We're not doing it
to cause you any pain, all right?

530
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,128
We're doing it
to see if finally it feels right.

531
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,457
But...

532
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:41,708
I won't do it without your blessing.

533
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:49,497
I don't know if I can give it to you.

534
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:52,868
Give you my blessing.

535
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,271
I just don't know.

536
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:11,557
It looks good, doc.

537
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:16,196
Now I can look at my face without seeing
that kid, the gun.

538
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:18,778
Well, Santa
you're a better man than I am.

539
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:21,213
Then you must be one hell of a scumbag.

540
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,078
Excuse me. I'm in a private
consultation with a patient.

541
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,543
Go on. Tell him.

542
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:29,628
Don't be afraid. Just say it.

543
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,482
I'm sorry, daddy.

544
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:40,923
I'm sorry I shot you.

545
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:44,529
You did it, honey.

546
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:47,017
You turned the other cheek.

547
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,841
Honey, go wait in the lobby.
I'll be out in a second.

548
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:53,778
Your son is the one who shot you?

549
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:54,996
It's a long story, doc.

550
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,734
- How did you find me, Nancy?
- I followed the money,

551
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:00,635
like I always do.

552
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,856
I went to get back payment
from the court account,

553
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:03,842
and they said that

554
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:07,311
some ex-partymotion had been
granted for some emergency surgery?

555
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,785
It's not your money, Duke.

556
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,823
It's his!

557
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:14,762
You should have been straight
with us before the surgery.

558
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:15,869
I want you out now.

559
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,020
Come on, man.
The little bastard shoots me

560
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,897
ad she comes fter me for child support?

561
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:24,606
I am still waiting
for that apology, Duke.

562
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,592
"I'm sorry, son,

563
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,855
for abandoning you,

564
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,015
for giving up on you,

565
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,062
for pretending
like you don't even exist!"

566
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:40,987
Not now, go away!

567
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,602
You put that gun in his hand
and you cocked it.

568
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:51,522
All he had to do was pull the trigger.

569
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,484
Like this.

570
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:30,783
You need a hand with that?

571
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,412
No. I have 2 good ones of my own.

572
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:39,707
I came to ask you to come home.

573
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:41,754
Spend Christmas with your family.

574
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:43,904
Thanks.

575
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:47,360
It's ok. I made plans.

576
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:53,800
You know, when my dad left,

577
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:58,080
I thought I knew how to deal with it.

578
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,141
He wrote me off,
I'd write him off son of a bitch.

579
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:03,737
I thought I had it pretty under control.

580
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:06,517
The hurt, the loneliness,

581
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,206
the anger.

582
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:12,859
I'm just replaying it

583
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:15,741
by doing to you what he did to me.

584
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:19,046
- Look, dad, I don't hold it--
- He couldn't help it.

585
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:22,910
He couldn't be different with me
because of how his father was with him.

586
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:28,469
We're just passing the same shit
on and on and on.

587
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:32,215
And I just want it-- I want it to stop.

588
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:40,369
Here.

589
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:43,859
What's this?

590
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:47,070
Something he left me

591
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:48,948
before he left me.

592
00:40:50,568 --> 00:40:54,136
He said it was a box for me
to put my dreams in.

593
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:57,347
I just figured it was useless.

594
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:02,112
The only dream I had was
seeing him again.

595
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,295
But I have another one.

596
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:10,723
For you to forgive me.

597
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,755
I don't want to give up on you, man.

598
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:20,981
I don't want you to give up on me.

599
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,887
You keep this.

600
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:35,849
This is for your dreams.

601
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,744
I've got to find my own.

602
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:42,218
All I know right now is that

603
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,444
I'm never gonna be a man
or a decent father

604
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,293
until I stop being your child.

605
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:59,723
I'd still love for you
to spend Christmas with me.

606
00:42:00,193 --> 00:42:01,925
With us.

607
00:42:02,808 --> 00:42:04,517
Be around people who love you.

608
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:06,648
I'm spending it with Rachel.

609
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:08,672
If I can't be with Jenna on Christmas,

610
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,992
I figure spending it with Rachel
and her kids

611
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,085
might take the sting
out a little, you know?

612
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,282
- She's got kids?
- 24 of them.

613
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:18,127
All in the pediatric burn unit.

614
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,198
It's good seeing you, dad.

615
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,460
Merry Christmas.

616
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,129
I'm glad you reconsidered.

617
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:33,253
- Matt coming?
- No. Maybe next Christmas.

618
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,530
Ok. Now, do you feel like
a holiday Martini?

619
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:41,699
It's like an everyday Martini
just with a lot more vodka.

620
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:45,520
Hey, thank you for coming.

621
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,807
It wouldn't be the same without you.

622
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:53,530
I know how hard this must be for you.

623
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:56,666
Not being here would be even harder.

624
00:43:57,811 --> 00:43:59,400
Here we go.

625
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:03,532
Cheers.
