1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:03,198
I let him touch me.

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,551
Yes, Mr. Troy?

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,822
For years,
I let him touch me.

4
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:09,946
Your foster father?

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,945
He's dead, and I thought
that would end it.

6
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:14,230
But it didn't.

7
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:17,212
Christian, you're not getting it.
We are in trouble.

8
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,216
Hot shit, rock n' roll.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,517
We need to cut back everywhere.

10
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:24,760
Congrats doc.
She's a beauty.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,995
Remember Jack,
spending is optimism.

12
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,076
Your money problems
are not my fault, Jack.

13
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,810
I'm the one who bought the
maserati from you, remember?

14
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:55,068
I'm late what, 2 payments?

15
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,588
No, don't do that.
I'll get the money.

16
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,669
Who's your daddy?

17
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,545
Oh, you! you!

18
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,426
I always wanted
to screw the IRS.

19
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:21,789
So kind.

20
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,531
No one ever returns the favor.

21
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,792
So, we good?

22
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,122
With your tax bill?

23
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:32,434
Sweetheart,
that was wonderful,

24
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:36,731
but that was not
a $475,000 screw.

25
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:40,080
I am not the treasury
Secretary, Dr. Troy.

26
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:43,367
I don't have the authority to make
this kind of balance go away.

27
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,111
How did this happen, anyway?

28
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,266
You look like you do
pretty well for yourself.

29
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,915
Yeah, I usually just spend
everything and then...

30
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,651
pay my taxes with my
last couple of paychecks.

31
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,981
So do that.

32
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:57,489
Well, you know, things
have been kind of... slow.

33
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:01,156
You made me come hard.
I can get you 2 weeks.

34
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:02,787
Then your case goes upstairs.

35
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,858
Well, what if I can't
come up with the money?

36
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,114
I will get the money.

37
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,981
I'll start with whatever equity
you have in your house.

38
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:12,126
Then your business,
iras, pension funds.

39
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:15,648
If that doesn't cover it,
jail is always an option.

40
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,404
I will bend you over your desk and
turn you into my sloppy bottom...

41
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,566
until i get every last cent.

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,655
Have a nice day.

43
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:48,912
Wanted to get a head start
this morning, partner,...

44
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:51,382
- hope you don't mind.
- No. no problem.

45
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:54,618
I was running late anyway.
I had a meeting this morning.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,069
So I need to talk to you
about something, Seany.

47
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,323
- It's important.
- I'm all ears.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,079
Seriously.

49
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:09,432
We both know the business
has taken a bit of the turn, and...

50
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:12,148
anyway, i let a few payments
slip here and there, you know,...

51
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,855
- the mortgage, the car...
- You're a little short this month?

52
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I can help.

53
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:18,741
- What do you need?
- I need your signature.

54
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:20,840
I want to take out a loan
against the business...

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,757
You want to pull more
equity out, in this climate?

56
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,623
You won't even know
it's missing.

57
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,160
No no, no way.
All right?

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,149
We're already
upside down as it is.

59
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,022
And these days,
you miss one payment,...

60
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,886
they want to put a lien
on your earnings.

61
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,876
It's too risky
for both of us.

62
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,678
I don't really have
an option, sean.

63
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,802
How much you need, anyway?

64
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:50,608
One fifty.

65
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,117
- Jesus.
- I know.

66
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:57,300
It's just a bridge loan,
though, right?

67
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,434
- Yeah, it's just...
- Till you get liquid again?

68
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,568
- Yeah.
- All right.

69
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:02,107
I can loan it to you.

70
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,165
Penalty's not too steep.
I dip into my IRA.

71
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,902
I can float you the loan,
but you gotta pay me back...

72
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,413
as soon as you can.

73
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:11,281
You'd do that for me?

74
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:14,513
Hey...

75
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,768
We're family.

76
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:23,202
Hey, Sean.
There's a guy in your office.

77
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,626
- He says he's your brother.
- What'd you say?

78
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,608
Brendan.

79
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,315
Does that sound right?

80
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:30,565
Brother?
I thought he was dead.

81
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:31,663
He is.

Sean

86
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,243
Brendan?

87
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,221
Hey, Sean.

88
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:51,739
Long time.

89
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,598
I wasn't sure I...

90
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,752
I probably should
have warned you.

91
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,334
I don't even...

92
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,307
I don't know what...

93
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,478
Jesus Christ, Brendan!

94
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,824
I said good-bye to you.

95
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:09,192
Mom did, too.
We had you declared dead,

96
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:11,500
legally dead.
We held a wake.

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,012
I'm sorry, sean.

98
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,329
You know, that private detective
looking for you for 3 years.

99
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,228
I mean, I flew
around the country.

100
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,673
I even dragged the family
to baltimore one Christmas

101
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:22,791
because somebody had
spotted you in a bar.

102
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,141
And now you just...
You waltz in here...

103
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,628
no warning, no phone call,
looking like that.

104
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:30,992
Didn't seem like something I wanted
to share over the phone you know?

105
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,577
"Hey, Sean, long time, no see.
By the way, I'm really into meth."

106
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,369
I just, i thought it would be...

107
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,392
better just to show up and take
my licks all at once, you know?

108
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:45,054
So, how are Julia
and the kids?

109
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:47,395
Living in new york,
we're divorced.

110
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,516
You look good.

111
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,530
Handsome.

112
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,892
I mean, i always knew
you'd be successful.

113
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,224
Even if dad didn't.

114
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,756
And what have
you been doing? I mean...

115
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:05,653
other than shooting drugs
and playing possum?

116
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,337
I do carvings.

117
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,286
I make wreaths,
bowls, clocks.

118
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,304
I even make
my own candles.

119
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:15,542
They're big with
tourists, you know?

120
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,557
I guess we're both pretty
good with our hands.

121
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,928
How'd you pay for meth
on that income?

122
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:23,946
I stole, sometimes.

123
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,108
But I'm clean now, Sean.

124
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,812
And I know I can stay off
of the stuff. I just...

125
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,585
I need... a little help.
I need...

126
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,210
a brother.

127
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:37,804
And I didn't need one.

128
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,021
There aren't a lot of people
I can turn to, Sean.

129
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,290
Brothers don't do
what you did to me.

130
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,939
You wouldn't have wanted
to know me. Sean,...

131
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,062
you wouldn't have wanted
your kids around me.

132
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:51,850
I want to be a brother to you,
I just, I just...

133
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:55,088
I need a little help.

134
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:58,766
I just don't want to
look like this anymore!

135
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,696
Every time I look in the mirror,
all I see is...

136
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:06,243
somebody that I would never
give a break to, you know?

137
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,011
All i see is a freak...

138
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:10,569
and a failure.

139
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,598
Come on, Sean, you know that only 10%
of meth heads ever kick that stuff.

140
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,752
All the more reason
he needs my help.

141
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:20,914
Matt kicked it.

142
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,130
For now.

143
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,166
Can't believe you're
giving that loser... my loan.

144
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,659
I mean, jeez, I wonder
what he's going to do with it.

145
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,291
He's talking about starting
a little business, a craft store.

146
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,882
He makes these
wooden carvings.

147
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,443
Oh, brilliant. The one thing
that people need to survive...

148
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,647
in this time of economic crisis,
a little whittlin'.

149
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,953
Sorry, Christian but my
brother's situation is...

150
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,567
a little more dire than yours.

151
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,584
You know, I can't just fix his
face and then kick him out.

152
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,056
Not when i spent years
trying to find him.

153
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,074
You buying him a condo?

154
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:49,190
I'm gonna get him an apartment
in santa monica.

155
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,602
- Oh, jesus!
- That way i can keep an eye on him.

156
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,416
And he's gonna need
a decent car.

157
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:55,206
You are such a fool,
you know that?

158
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,215
Do you have any idea
what this means to me?

159
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,257
To get my brother back
after all this time?

160
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,897
Yesterday, I thought
I was your brother.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,071
Huh?

162
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,025
Where are you going?
I need you in surgery.

163
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,760
It's a family affair.
I don't want to interrupt.

164
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,617
Where's tweedle dumbass?

165
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,768
It's just me and
my brother today, Liz.

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,349
You know, it's not really
recommended that...

167
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:24,093
a surgeon do such an extensive
surgery on a family member...

168
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,386
with no assist...

169
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:27,809
You want to go ask him
to come back?

170
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,690
Go easy on him, Sean.

171
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,541
I'm sure he feels like
he's being replaced.

172
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:39,652
Christian is going to have to
take care of himself for once.

173
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,178
Brendan needs me.

174
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,495
And to get a second chance
at having him back in my life...

175
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,090
is something I can't ignore.

176
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,764
15 blade, please.

177
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:57,237
You came all the way from
Sweden for this procedure?

178
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,047
No, not exactly.

179
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:03,464
I like to travel with my son
when his college schedule permits.

180
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,712
What better education
is that, yes?

181
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,533
And you have gained an
international following, Dr. Troy.

182
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,126
The best in Beverly Hills.

183
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:13,268
I'm flattered, Mr. Nilsson,
but don't you think your son's...

184
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:16,819
desire to look more like you is
a little, uh... extreme?

185
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,198
Yes, I do.

186
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:22,269
There, you see, even
the esteemed doctor thinks so.

187
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,604
I've tried to discourage it, but...

188
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:26,667
once Benny has set
his mind to something...

189
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,700
Since I was 3 and
they adopted me,

190
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,839
this is what
I have dreamed of.

191
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,278
To look like my family,
like...

192
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,081
their real son.

193
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:37,853
And you think it would
make them love you more?

194
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,057
No.

195
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,993
I know that is not possible.

196
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,352
But looking like him...

197
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,910
would be a sign
to the outside world that...

198
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,544
I am his child,

199
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:51,716
no question.

200
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,215
Some people think that ties of brother
are stronger than ties of love.

201
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,908
I'm afraid there's no
talking him out of it.

202
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,400
If you turn us down,

203
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,831
We'll just have to go to
Dr. Bravo Montenegro of Venezuela.

204
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,550
I may not think
it is necessary, doctor.

205
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,239
My wife certainly wouldn't,
God rest her soul.

206
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,005
But if it's what benny wants...

207
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,942
Creating a family resemblance through
surgery is not a simple procedure,

208
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,207
And i'm afraid that the expense
would be considerable.

209
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,924
The money, doctor,
is not the consideration.

210
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,149
I am not what you americans
would call a... jock.

211
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:31,840
I do not play catch with him...

212
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,402
or share with him sports,
things of that nature.

213
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,820
But if i can help him
feel good about himself,

214
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,318
that is a father's duty, yes?

215
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:59,920
So it measures the abnormal
electromagnetic changes...

216
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,233
in the tissue.

217
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:02,993
How does it help with pain?

218
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:05,595
Well, once we locate
the abnormal activity,

219
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:08,011
The probes... normalize it.

220
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:09,576
Such a simple idea.

221
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,296
How's it feel?
You ok?

222
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,458
Better?

223
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:15,256
Ok, breathe.
That's it.

224
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,526
Sean, we're prepped and ready
to go on the Nilsson kid,

225
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,843
you plan on making an
appearance or what? huh?

226
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:20,864
What's that?

227
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:24,914
It is the electromagnetic
resonance healing device...

228
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,611
invented by my friend,
Ron Weinstock.

229
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,114
- Did we buy this?
- No, he lent it to me.

230
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,799
It costs six figures, and I wanted
to see how it worked first.

231
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,224
I asked liz to look into
alternative pain management.

232
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,902
Brendan can't take opiates.

233
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,991
He has to protect his sobriety.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,601
Whatever floats your boat.

235
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,671
By the way, just so you know,
we're coming home today.

236
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:49,468
Brendan's going to stay with us,
and i'm bringing that machine.

237
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,291
No, sean, that's where
I draw the line.

238
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,650
No, he can't be alone.

239
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,629
The temptation to use
painkillers is too high.

240
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,913
I'm not allowing this drug
addict to bunk in my house!

241
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,359
He's got a point.

242
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,415
I've earned the bad rap.

243
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,299
But i swear, Christian,

244
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,182
I'm in a different place now.

245
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,110
Right.

246
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,621
- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

247
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:13,854
If you are, he and I
will get a place and...

248
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:16,456
you can look for
someone else to split the rent.

249
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:45,929
Just give me a sec,
would you?

250
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,844
You have nothing to
worry about, Mr. Nilsson,

251
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,368
he's in very good hands.

252
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:55,726
But i understand,
I'd be nervous, too.

253
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,255
I know he'd appreciate
your support.

254
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,350
Really?

255
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:00,892
Because...

256
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,490
I thought maybe I
somehow made him...

257
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,820
feel less like my real family...

258
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,908
because he wasn't blood.

259
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,831
And that's why he's doing it.

260
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,758
Being related by blood
doesn't make a family.

261
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,756
And I think he knows that.

262
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,756
Thank you.

263
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,454
Hit it.

264
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,863
15 blade.

265
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,877
Oh, look, look! oh!

266
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,087
That's the guy.

267
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,452
Hey, you want to join us?

268
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,109
It's a great game.

269
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:03,279
Come on.

270
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,596
Got an extra double
double for you.

271
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,349
I'm taking Kimber to Nobu.

272
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,222
Oh. Glad to see you're
saving your money.

273
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:13,787
Ha ha ha, that's great.

274
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:17,038
Yeah, I think the less time
I spend here, the better.

275
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,409
And i'm pretty sure that
I'd puke watching wally...

276
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,496
and the beave rehash their
childhood memories. Cheers.

277
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,942
You know, i got a couple of
friends from my CMA meetings.

278
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,799
I think i'm just
going to crash...

279
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,716
No, no, no, you are staying
right here. Come here. Come on.

280
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,452
Just until you're back on
your feet again, ok?

281
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,865
This is good for us.

282
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:48,904
Don't worry about him.

283
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,737
All right, jerkoff,
where is it?

284
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:54,604
Hmm? You know what i'm
talking about, where is it?

285
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,660
- Dude, i don't have any clue...
- My chronoswiss.

286
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,248
I don't even know
what that is.

287
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,051
It's a $20,000 watch, ok?

288
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,218
It was in the self
winder this morning.

289
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:05,193
The only people who have
been here are you,...

290
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,682
your brother and the maid.

291
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,960
And far as I Remember,
Carmen's is bonded,

292
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,346
so i can't imagine that
she's the cat burglar.

293
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,671
- Seany, was it you?
- Of course not.

294
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,285
Should I call the police?

295
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,011
Did you take it?

296
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:21,988
Sean...

297
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:24,508
I swear to you, no,
that's not who I am anymore.

298
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:25,526
Bullshit!

299
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,515
Once a liar, always a liar.

300
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,537
You callin' them or me,
what do you want to do?

301
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:30,880
Put that down.

302
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,866
You're living in denial,
my friend, you know that?

303
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,689
You go one week,
then you're out of here.

304
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,195
Hey, this is my home.
If i want my brother to stay here,

305
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,068
he can stay as long as he wants.

306
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,318
Do i have to remind you
that you're a paying tenant?

307
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,479
Huh? Like I said, one week.

308
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:49,036
And I don't give a shit
if you go with him.

309
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,135
I want my watch back
by the time I get home.

310
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,822
What are you two laughing at?

311
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,954
Oh, Benny was just reminding me
of the time we went skiing...

312
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:13,174
together in Gstaad.

313
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,367
Sounds like you guys
live the life, huh?

314
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,767
One of the benefits of
my line of work is the travel.

315
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,169
What kind of work
do you do, Mr. Nilsson?

316
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,814
International banking.

317
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,599
Benny and I have
traveled all over.

318
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,246
Singapore, Tokyo,
Buenos Aires, Cape Town.

319
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,214
Wow, let's take a look
at this face of yours and...

320
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:33,443
hopefully get you two back
on the road as soon as we can.

321
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,416
Tell me what you think.

322
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,189
Oh, it's amazing.

323
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:46,311
I feel like I'm looking
at myself at your age.

324
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,440
Thank you, Benny.

325
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:55,241
I didn't realize how much
this would mean to me.

326
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,199
I did it for us, dad.

327
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,035
You know, if you're
feeling up to it, you can...

328
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,809
check out later today.

329
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,761
Great. We're only in L.A.
for a few more weeks.

330
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,482
I really wanted to try surfing.

331
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:11,571
Oh, that might be difficult, Benny.

332
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:16,251
Your surgery has forced us to
reschedule a number of appointments.

333
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:18,861
Well, you should try it
if you can. L.A. is a...

334
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,419
great place to learn.

335
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,114
I'd love to, Dr. Troy.

336
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,207
I just don't see when I'll be
able to get away, Benny.

337
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:27,339
Excuse me.

338
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,503
Of course.

339
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:31,340
Yes?

340
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,578
Of course, saturday?

341
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,532
Would be fine.

342
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:38,735
Thank you.

343
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:42,029
We'll see you then.

344
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,093
You know, Mr. Nilsson,
I'd love to take Benny surfing.

345
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,340
Are you sure?

346
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:54,742
I don't know what a lesson would cost,
but I'd be happy to pay you.

347
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:57,423
What I need is financial advice.

348
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,977
How quickly can you get me
approved for an offshore loan?

349
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,054
Sean?

350
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,932
Wasn't sure you'd be Home,
but I did get enough for 2.

351
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,442
Sean.

352
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:17,066
What, are you deaf, huh?
Come on, brother.

353
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,374
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

354
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,473
- You scared me.
- Who the hell are you?

355
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:25,852
Oh. I'm jay.
Are you Dr. Mcnamara?

356
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:28,511
No, I'm not Dr. Mcnamara.
What the hell are you doing in my house?

357
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,093
Sorry. I didn't hear you come in.
My hearing's gone on this side.

358
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,396
I don't give a shit about your hearing.
How'd you get in?

359
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:35,969
Uh, Brendan.

360
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,330
You a friend of his?
Is that what this is?

361
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,102
Hey, Christian.
Is sean with you?

362
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:41,688
What the hell makes you
think it's ok to bring...

363
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,441
one of your charity cases
in here when I'm not here?

364
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:44,522
Sean knew, ok?

365
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,277
I don't give a shit
if Sean knew.

366
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:47,939
And Jay's a close
friend of mine.

367
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,670
What are you,
a sponsor or something?

368
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,792
- That's got nothing to do with this.
- Jesus, yes, it does.

369
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:54,228
I can put my patch back on,
if that's what troubling you guys.

370
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,762
Can you just give us
a minute, please?

371
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,639
All right, look. I don't care
if you're mean to me.

372
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,939
But you don't have to talk
that way to my friends.

373
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,887
Hey, you listen to me.
Sean and I share this house,

374
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:09,649
all right?

375
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,085
And i'm not ok with you bringing
your crack addict buddies...

376
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,156
in here when I'm not here
to keep an eye on you.

377
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,838
Oh, get over it, will you?
I didn't take your stupid watch.

378
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,331
I don't need drug money.
I'm clean.

379
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:22,348
You know, I've never
understood why...

380
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,801
Sean got into business
with you in the first place.

381
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,665
You don't even have
half of his talent.

382
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:28,435
Not even an ounce
of his compassion.

383
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,897
Sean needs me.

384
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,652
Says I can protect him
from being taken advantage of...

385
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,023
by losers like you
all the time.

386
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,081
Yeah, you're laughing because
you know it's true.

387
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:38,801
No, no, no.
I'm laughing...

388
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:42,083
because Sean is going to fix
Jay's face tomorrow for free.

389
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:43,117
Bullshit.

390
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:46,101
Oh, yeah. See, Jay kicked
his coke habit 5 years ago,

391
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,063
but the abuse ate his
sinuses away so much...

392
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:50,098
that he could never
afford to get it fixed.

393
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,274
Sean jumped at the
chance to help him.

394
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,163
Wow...

395
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:56,211
You're really going to suck
everything out of him...

396
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,117
before you disappear
again this time, huh?

397
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,292
No.
I'm not going anywhere.

398
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,370
You see, Sean is my family.

399
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:06,038
See, what you guys have is
a partnership. It's business.

400
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:08,372
And when that's over...
and it will be over someday...

401
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:09,709
you'll be gone,

402
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,315
and i will never have
to look at you again.

403
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:14,580
Why wait?

404
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,399
Let's take care of that
right now, shall we?

405
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,121
Get out of my house.

406
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,893
Get your hands off of me!
Asshole!

407
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,291
Get the hell out of my house.

408
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,066
And take the freak with you.

409
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:27,662
All right.
Let's go.

410
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,223
Let's do a 3.0 vicryl.

411
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:09,807
If I lived here,
I would surf every day.

412
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,995
Yeah.
Waves are pretty nice.

413
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,223
You did good out there, kid.

414
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:16,443
You got a real feel for it, huh?

415
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,192
You want to get dressed, just
go use the bathroom right there.

416
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:27,831
Thank you, Dr. Troy.

417
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,914
Christian.

418
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:35,467
This was one
of the best days.

419
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,309
Good, good.

420
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,127
Look, Benny, you're dripping
all over the travertine floor, huh?

421
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,530
Why don't you go
dry yourself off?

422
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,670
I'm making us a siberian surf.

423
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:53,901
It's great. You're going to love it.
It's got hot coffee,...

424
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,900
kahlua, irish cream,
a little stoli.

425
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,461
You want some cream on top?

426
00:26:02,422 --> 00:26:03,359
Benny?

427
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,698
Benny,
you want some cream on top ?

428
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:22,164
Or you can just have it plain.

429
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,851
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,205
- No. it's...
- It's just...

431
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,136
I guess this is what it feels like
to be a normal father and son.

432
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:46,951
Just 'cause your dad's not
into sports, I mean...

433
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:51,838
He's not the physical type,
doesn't mean what you guys...

434
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,674
share isn't normal.

435
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:56,612
My father is very much
the physical type.

436
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,253
Just not with you?

437
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:03,296
The circles he travels in,

438
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:05,848
the people...

439
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,552
they are all very rich...

440
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,906
and very bored.

441
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:17,749
He finds it necessary to keep them
entertained for business purposes.

442
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:21,331
So...

443
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:26,272
He arranges these parties.

444
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:30,747
Very exclusive...

445
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,476
and very lucrative.

446
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,470
Sounds like you've been
exposed to a lot of culture.

447
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,645
Exposed.

448
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:48,004
Yes, I have, as you say,
been exposed.

449
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,492
That's why I got the surgery.

450
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,194
I needed to look more
like his real son.

451
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:55,698
Some clients doubted
we were related.

452
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,510
If we look alike,

453
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:01,457
we make more money.

454
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,886
You listen to me, Benny.

455
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,804
Real family doesn't own you...

456
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:10,257
and don't abuse you.

457
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,356
They take care of you.

458
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,179
That's what they do.

459
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,322
Sean?
I think we have a problem.

460
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:34,947
What now, locusts?

461
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,134
Your brother.

462
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:38,451
He's in recovery
with harvey no-face.

463
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:53,116
What the hell is
going on in here?

464
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:54,579
I told him not to.

465
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:56,339
He's going to screw up
his face again.

466
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:58,783
Not to what? Ok?
Relax, guy.

467
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:00,867
Look, there's...
There's nothing to see here.

468
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:01,979
I'm a doctor.

469
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,271
You think I don't know
what cocaine smells like?

470
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:05,832
Where is it? Huh?

471
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:07,825
What did you do with it, huh?

472
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:12,142
This is how you treat the new nose
I spent 6 hours building for free,

473
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:13,932
you piece of shit junkie?

474
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,617
Brendan brought it in, ok?

475
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:17,817
So if you want to be pissed
at someone, it's him.

476
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:20,622
Look at me. I'm in too much
pain here to control my urges.

477
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:23,276
That is crap. He must have
snuck it in with his stuff.

478
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:25,510
I am Clean, Sean.
I swear. What are...

479
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,797
Why are you doing this to me, man?
I helped you out!

480
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:30,432
I don't care how it got in here.
I want it out...

481
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:31,563
with you.

482
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,734
Dude.
Where am I supposed to go?

483
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,430
Well, you can try
the emergency room.

484
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,405
They have to take care
of you there. Jesus.

485
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:40,593
How many people have to tell me
I'm wrong about you?

486
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,558
I didn't give him the coke. Sean...

487
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:43,809
Christian's watch,

488
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,796
cocaine in my recovery suite.

489
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,546
Is it just a coincidence this all starts
happening after you show up?

490
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,218
I'm going to be
home at 7:00.

491
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:55,237
I want you out of
my house by 6:00.

492
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,710
With nothing but the
shit you came with.

493
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:06,898
Dr. Troy.

494
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:08,901
I have bad news.

495
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,704
I've spoken with
my overseas representatives.

496
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:14,370
Turns out we're not
as liquid as I thought.

497
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:18,526
I won't be able to help you
with your loan, but...

498
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:23,860
on a happier note, your work
on Benny is just so amazing.

499
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:27,235
We truly look like
father and son now.

500
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,041
Not anymore.

501
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:38,959
You son of a bitch,
what you were doing to your son...

502
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,790
is illegal in this country,
do you understand?

503
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,361
You understand me?!

504
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,186
Yes!

505
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:46,907
About that loan,

506
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,840
I've decided to make it
personal, ok?

507
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:52,608
I want $400,000 cash by friday.

508
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:55,982
- That's a lot of money...
- By friday, you asshole!

509
00:31:56,102 --> 00:31:58,423
I keep your little secret,
and you get to stay out of jail...

510
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,925
away from one of those perverts
who'd love to do to you...

511
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,670
what you're doing to your son!

512
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,234
Ok. 400,000.
I can manage that.

513
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,427
Just as soon as
Benny can travel,

514
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:12,610
we will be on the plane,
and you will never see us again.

515
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,126
You are going alone, ok?
Your father-son freak show...

516
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:19,060
is now a solo act.

517
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,500
What are you doing here?

518
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:50,417
Waiting for you.

519
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,694
I wanted to give you this.

520
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,758
You made this?

521
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,305
I wanted to...

522
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:08,207
tell you I'm really sorry about
what happened with Jay.

523
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:11,065
I think we both got screwed
in trying to...

524
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:13,485
do a favor for someone
we cared about.

525
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:16,686
Anyway, I need to grab my shit.

526
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:20,365
I got a line on some work back east,
so I bought a plane ticket.

527
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,591
It's probably best if
I go now anyways.

528
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:37,954
Oh, perfect.
He just walked in.

529
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,538
Hey, Brendan,
how tall are you? 6'1"? 6'2"?

530
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:41,458
Why?

531
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,645
Let's say 6'1", dark hair,
medium build, looks like a loser.

532
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:47,958
I tell you what. You send somebody
out here right now, you see for yourself.

533
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:48,886
Who is that?

534
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,175
Yeah, sure.
I'll hold.

535
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:53,021
I come home this afternoon, and
my diamond cuff links are missing.

536
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,877
And the only person here
was your brother,

537
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,341
so now I'm pressing charges.

538
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,297
- You're what?
- Pressing charges, my friend.

539
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,367
I set you up. I left them out so
you could see them, all right? But...

540
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:04,172
I'm sure we'll work things
out once the cops get here,

541
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,098
dust for prints you--yeah, yeah,
yeah. I'm here. Yep. Mm-hmm.

542
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:08,900
Address? Yeah...

543
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:12,250
I never saw your cuff links,
Christian.

544
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,388
I haven't been home
all day, remember?

545
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:17,310
No, no, no, sure, man. You're out
getting high and selling my stuff.

546
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,664
I'm getting sick of you trying
to make me into a criminal.

547
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,796
- You're the one that's out of control.
- Stop it!

548
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,199
I am done with this asshole
accusing me of stealing his shit!

549
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,540
Who are you going to blame
for your problems this time,

550
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,366
Sean?

551
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:28,203
Hey!

552
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:35,374
I mean, you...
what is your problem, man, huh?

553
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:38,064
If you didn't do anything,
why would you be so angry, huh?

554
00:34:38,184 --> 00:34:39,743
You're hiding something.
What is it?

555
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:41,885
Are you going to say anything?

556
00:34:43,336 --> 00:34:46,448
How much did that plane ticket
cost that you just bought?

557
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,480
You did tell me
that you were broke.

558
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,832
Are you serious?
I used a credit card, Sean.

559
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,477
You don't believe me.

560
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,650
I don't believe this shit.

561
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,301
I am out of here.

562
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,472
Screw you both.

563
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:09,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's take a look at the bag first.

564
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:13,210
- Will you show me?
- No.

565
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,667
- Why not?
- You don't trust me.

566
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:20,987
Fellas.

567
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,168
Are they in there?

568
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,150
I guess he could have
sold them already.

569
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,971
You guys deserve each other.

570
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,571
You ok?

571
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:29,502
Did my father give you
the money you asked for?

572
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,709
It was wired to my account.

573
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:34,432
He can afford it.

574
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,369
We could clear 100,000 at one
of those parties, you know.

575
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:43,720
You shouldn't have to look
at his face anymore.

576
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,853
You know, I can...

577
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,868
change you back to the way
you looked before, you know,

578
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:50,941
free of charge.

579
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,290
I'm not sure I can go
through another operation.

580
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,483
And I can't afford to stay
in that hotel much longer.

581
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:00,484
I only have a few
hundred dollars.

582
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:07,620
Don't worry about that.
Here.

583
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:09,973
You deserve it.

584
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:18,717
Should buy you enough time to
figure things out while staying...

585
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,813
as far away from your father as
you can, you know...

586
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,995
go to school, get a job.

587
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:33,200
I don't expect you
to understand, but...

588
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,001
in spite of everything...

589
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:40,448
I still believe he loves me.

590
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,852
No, let me tell you
something, Benny.

591
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:51,036
Whatever your father feels for you,
it's got nothing to do with love.

592
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:54,247
And the sooner you understand that,
the sooner you can go out and...

593
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,433
make your own family and
find out what real love is.

594
00:38:56,853 --> 00:38:59,008
Those the ones you
soak in cognac?


595
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,195
What's the occasion?

596
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,380
Brendan's gone.

597
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,712
Christian...

598
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:23,540
I am truly sorry for all of this.

599
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:35,657
Hey, Sammy, how much
you want for this lighter?

600
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:39,653
Goes for 225 on eBay.
You can have it for 140.

601
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,318
So, what would you give me
for these, my friend?

602
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:50,081
Cuffs are Roberto Coin.

603
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:54,938
36 grand at least on first dibs.

604
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:56,866
Looks good.

605
00:39:58,043 --> 00:39:59,999
You don't need to apologize.

606
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,205
I don't know what
happens to me.

607
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,391
I guess I just need to be
reminded from time to time...

608
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:12,235
who my real family is.

609
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,753
Just enjoy the sunset,
my friend.

610
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,952
It's all water
under the bridge.

611
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,899
Hey, do you still
need that loan?

612
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:54,135
So, how much longer am I going to
have to wait till your partner shows up?

613
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,088
He's in the middle of surgery.

614
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:58,410
I can have him pulled,
if you like,

615
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:03,123
but... as you can see,
he signed all the proper papers.

616
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,744
Oh, it won't be necessary.

617
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:10,227
Everything seems to be in order.

618
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:20,685
Don't need the loan anymore,
buddy boy.

619
00:41:20,805 --> 00:41:22,259
Got an extension.

620
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:24,397
But thanks.

621
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,272
Means a lot.

622
