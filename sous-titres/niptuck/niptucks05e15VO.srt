2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,587
you really should lock up
your firearms

3
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:06,771
and not leave them
in a bedside table drawer,

4
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:08,309
You stupid bitch.

5
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:11,677
Are you a doctor?

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,887
Plastic surgeon.

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,139
Is that how we know each other?

8
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,433
I'm your husband.

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,851
We're still married?

10
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,820
We're still married.

11
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,858
You really don't remember me,
do you?

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,448
My first years in college were
memorable in the sense that

13
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,334
i don't really remember that much,
even if we had a thing.

14
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:30,869
We had more than just a thing,
christian.

15
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,465
We had a daughter.

16
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:35,489
Mr. Mcnamara, i'm Colleen Rose

17
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,161
of the Colleen Rose Agency.

18
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,833
You are a Scene-Stealer,

19
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,803
and i know i can get you work.

20
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:42,961
Be a crime to hide
that massive talent of yours.

21
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,919
Sean, your agent's on the phone.

22
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,129
- Agent?
- She's a talent agent.

23
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:48,464
Talent agent?

24
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:50,716
I thought you need talent
for a talent agent.

25
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,302
Sean mcnamara, you are the
new start of "hearts and Scalpels!"

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,380
- What?
- You did good, colleen.

27
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:58,935
- What do you think of these?
- Colleen, this is inappropriate.

28
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:01,227
Go ahead squeeze them.
These aren't the tits of a

29
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,272
Fiftyish-Year-Old woman, am I right?

30
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:05,523
Do you see any other agents here,
Colleen?

31
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,966
- We have to stick together here.
- No, we don't.

32
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:09,851
I'm tired
of you crossing boundaries.

33
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:12,445
Look what i made you.
It's a Sean bear.

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,365
It's how i express my friendship.

35
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,659
Colleen, what's going on?
Why are you here?

36
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,425
It's my niece's kiosk, and

37
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,041
I'm just filling in because she
was sick. Why? Is that wrong?

38
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,624
You lied about who you are.
That's unforgivable.

39
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,906
I trusted you!

40
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:27,920
This is the end of our
Relationship, do you understand?

41
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,131
What are you doing here, colleen?

42
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:33,551
- What have you done?
- I just need you to fix these for me.

43
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,263
Colleen, i am walking to the phone,
and i am calling the Police right now.

44
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,936
You did this to me, and you
will fix them!

45
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,981
All right. Let's go.
Come on. Come here.

46
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,844
You'll be sorry for this, i swear!

47
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:46,498
Dr. Mcnamara, what can you tell us
about Colleen Rose?

48
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,232
Did you tell her to kill your agent?

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,540
- What are they doing here?
- You're a public person now, buddy boy.

50
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,752
They own you.

51
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,460
Nothing is off limits.

52
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,337
Look.
I know how hard this is for you.

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,638
- What the hell?
- Behind you!

54
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:02,875
I'm not Sean.
You're scaring his Daughter.

55
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,225
- That's whose picture we want.
- Get out of my way.

56
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,984
What are you doing here?
I don't think you're gonna be much help

57
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,090
- with a broken collar bone.
- You mad at me?

58
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm mad at myself.

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,011
I lost my priorities, my values.

60
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,072
I chased a dream
like a silly teenager.

61
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:20,514
Look what's happened.

62
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:22,933

They tell me it starts to feel
better after a couple of weeks.

Third floor.

Do you mind if i handle this solo?

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,335
I just feel like i want to be alone
with my daughter in there.

71
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:55,336
Of course.

72
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,163
I should check on Darlene anyway.
She's had a tough recovery,

73
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:00,422
a lot of pain.

74
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:03,677
Hello?

75
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,791
Liz, can you get some gauze and tape,
please?

76
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,197
9:30 at craft, and don't be late.

77
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,170
My arm's a little bummed up,
so you might have to feed Me.

78
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,711
It's gonna be good from now on,
I promise.

79
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,420
I've been thinking, liz.

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,244
Maybe It's time to put down some roots,
find a place of my own.

81
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:54,154
The kids need a real home out
Here, and so do I.

82
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,704
What do you think
of the hollywood hills?

83
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,087
It's gonna be all right, Cookie.

84
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,584
I'm gonna take care of you now.

85
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,208
She's in sinus-Tack.

86
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,419
- Her heart rate's 190 and rising.
- She's in malignant hypothermia.

87
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,629
Where's sean?

88
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,845
Sorry about the mess i made in here,
Cookie.

89
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:17,764
So what else is new?

90
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,683
She's gonna die,
Christian. Let's go.

91
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,144
- Go, go, go, go.
- I'm going.

92
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,259
- That's better.
- All right. I got it.

93
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:29,943
- See how easy?
- Please.

94
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,798
I'm bleeding to death.

95
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:35,182
Her heart rate's 95. OK.

96
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:37,960
She's gonna be OK.
Gonna be OK, Annie.

97
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,712
- I need you to help me.
- Tell me what to do.

98
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,048
Sean?

99
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,171
No. I'm not gonna let them
Hurt you, sean.

100
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:53,842
- Sean!
- Mine!

101
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,512
Pressure here.

102
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,727
I have such plans for us, Cookie.

103
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,942
Move out of this shit hole...

104
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,380
someplace quieter...

105
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,240
and we'll grow old together.

106
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:43,600
- I can't feel my legs.
- Just stay with me, buddy, all right?

107
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,103
Just... Just stay with me.
Look at me, look at me.

108
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:48,939
Stay with me, buddy, all right?

109
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,252
OK? You stay with me. You hear me?

110
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,904
Can you hear me? Stay with me.

111
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:01,798
Need a lift?

112
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:06,099
Oh, you just can't stand that my biceps
are getting bigger than yours. Can you?

113
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,401
You're right.

114
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:10,620
Now if you could just teach your dick
to drive this thing.

115
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,134
Come on.
Your first consult's in your office.

116
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,672
You can't escape!

117
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:18,218
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

118
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,355
My back.

119
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,619
It's in agony
from supporting my front.

120
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,278
A breast reduction?

121
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,193
- Oh, i don't know, liz.
- Those are you two best assets.

122
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,957
They're like having a pair
of Louis Vuitton bags.

123
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,002
They're great to look at, but they're
not a lot of fun to lug around.

124
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,349
I have wanted this for a long time,

125
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:40,031
and I figured
what better time than now?

126
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:43,220
My boobs will be the first thing
you get to put your hands on.

127
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:46,228
- That's very sweet of you, Liz.
- Don't you worry, buddy.

128
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,759
You won't be scaling those mountains
alone. That's a Two-Man job

129
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,044
if ever i've seen One.

130
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,300
Well, you seem like
a perfectly good candidate.

131
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,939
I'd recommend a post reduction.

132
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,421
All right. Fantastic.

133
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:59,569
Why don't we say... tomorrow?

134
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,036
The sooner she gets her boobs reduced,
the sooner we can give her belly button

135
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,071
- some room to breathe.
- Shut up, christian.

136
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,450
I'm teaching all day.

137
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:07,702
You do it.

138
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,494
Oh, no, no, no. Wait.

139
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,846
Thes are still my breasts
we're talking about,

140
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,808
and i think that I've earned
the service of both Mcnamara and Troy.

141
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,515
- How about wednesday?
- I'm teaching then, too.

142
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:23,135
They seem to really like
what I have to offer over there.

143
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,192
What about what you have to
offer over here?

144
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,721
I am not ready to operate!

145
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:32,004
The cervical nerves are still Inflamed.
My hands aren't what they were.

146
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,772
Dr. Cargill said it's up to me,
and i'm telling you, I'm not ready.

147
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,789
Look.

148
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,438
I appreciate both your support.

149
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,460
Christian is more than capable
of doing what you want done.

150
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,648
OK. Fine.

151
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,428
- What if i wait?
- Don't.

152
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,826
There's no telling when
I'm gonna be ready or even if.

153
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,386
Time.

154
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,388
Einstein said there was no now,

155
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:11,043
no past, present, or future.

156
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:15,941
Physicists think that if you travel
at the speed of light time disappears.

157
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:17,916
Unfortunately,

158
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:21,562
we don't have a spaceship
that can travel at the speed of light.

159
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,238
We age.

160
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,113
Our cells deteriorate,

161
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:28,607
deform, and mutate into tiny,
misshapen freaks,

162
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,203
making our skin sag and wrinkle

163
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,061
and our muscles atrophy.

164
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,339
We don't have a time machine, but...

165
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:40,045
we do have this.

166
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,180
Now this is one of the top plastic
surgery residencies in the country.

167
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,225
They've asked me to come here
and make sure that when you leave

168
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,658
you're not just doctors or surgeons

169
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,221
but benders of time,

170
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,405
and it's your job to use this 10 blade
on a 50-Year-Old woman

171
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,150
and take her back

172
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,945
so when she looks in the mirror
she sees herself when she was 30.

173
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
OK.

174
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,253
Show me what you got.

175
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,750
Oh, awful.

176
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,107
Really awful.

177
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:23,329
Congratulations.

178
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:25,209
Our first mediocre.

179
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,303
Where's your partner?

180
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,267
I prefer to work alone.

181
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,933
- How old are you?
- 17.

182
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,564
My name is Rajeesh Paresh.
I missed being

183
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:41,615
the youngest person to graduate
from harvard medical school by 12 days.

184
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:43,186
Very nice.

185
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:47,112
You should use pds sutures
to minimize the tension.

186
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,857
That's one option. I much prefer using
the muscle to hold the suture. I feel it

187
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:53,518
- produces a far more natural look.
- Until the muscle gives out

188
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,027
And
the patient's entire face collapses.

189
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,458
Do it my way.

190
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,964
Dr. Sean Mcnamara,
i'm sorry about contradicting you.

191
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,848
My father says I have his brains
but my mother's mouth.

192
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,541
Well, you're very good, dr. Paresh.

193
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,393
You were wrong today,

194
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,206
but your attitude was right.

195
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,650
We have to be arrogant sobs
to do what we do.

196
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,932
Hey, Raj.

197
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,258
Dr. Mcnamara,
I was wondering if I could help you out.

198
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,465
Thank you.

199
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:36,119
Those ramps can be a bit dicey.

200
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,556
- May I?
- Yes, please.

201
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,045
I'll see you tomorrow, Raj.

202
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,020
So I'm finally gonna lay my eyes

203
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,453
on the famous Liz Cruz tas.

204
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:56,848
Tatas?

205
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,229
Have you been hanging out
with my uncle pe?

206
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:00,769
How about bodacious boobies?

207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,580
OK. Breathe deep,

208
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:07,250
center yourself,
and act like a real doctor.

209
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,948
I know it's a stretch.

210
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,537
Oh, this is so weird. OK.

211
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,988
Um, i'm a 36-D,

212
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,382
but I know
you could tell by looking.

213
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,701
I was thinking of a small "c."

214
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,767
This way, I'd have the size
but not the weight.

215
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:28,129
Do you self-Examine, lizzie?

216
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,284
Yeah. When I remember.

217
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,914
Well normally,
my lovers do all the examing.

218
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:36,128
That's the classic lesbian foreplay.

219
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,056
Why? What are you asking me?

220
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:40,506
This...

221
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:42,772
Yeah?

222
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,124
- Feels like a lump.
- Oh, shit.

223
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,273
Well,
don't jump to Worst-Case scenario.

224
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,415
Just be a big girl
and get yourself a mammogram.

225
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,348
You'll feel some pressure.

226
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,131
- I couldn't have faced this alone.
- Why would you?

227
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,780
I'll be there no matter what.

228
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,482
You can breathe, dr. Cruz.
You're fine.

229
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,331
You're just one of those women
with fibrocystic breasts.

230
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:38,044
About half of the women
with lumps have the same condition.

231
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:40,631
You drink a lot of coffee,
diet colas?

232
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,495
I do. Too much, I know.

233
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:46,249
- Is that what this is from, diet soda?
- You have a lump?

234
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,573
- It's probably nothing.
- How long have you had a lump?

235
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,603
Inflamed sweat gland
from lifting weights.

236
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,712
I'm not suggesting
there's an epidemic, but

237
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,806
in 2008,
somewhere in the neighborhood of

238
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,025
450 men will die of breast cancer.

239
00:18:57,145 --> 00:19:00,513
It would be prudent
to have it looked at, dr. Troy.

240
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,191
- You'll feel some pressure.
- Ow! Holy shit!

241
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:16,964
You see this darkened tissue?

242
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:19,322
This is what we're going to biopsy.

243
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,994
We're going to determine
if this is ductal cancer in situ,

244
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:25,965
which means there's little to no chance
It's spread into the surrounding tissue,

245
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,858
or if we're dealing
with an invasive ductal

246
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,543
- breast cancer.
- How soon will I know?

247
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,328
I need to know something today.

248
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,946
I don't want to hear any of this
"We'll call you next week". bullshit

249
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,078
I can do a frozen section
so we'll know today

250
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,552
if it's a malignancy
and if it's invasive.

251
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:47,139
I'll be here, no matter what.

252
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:54,481
- You ready?
- Sure.

253
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:02,033
It's not malignant. I just know it.

254
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:04,845
I have a sixth sense about
these kind of things. Besides,

255
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:07,282
Like you said,
I don't fit the profile.

256
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:09,369
Didn't Tennessee Williams have

257
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,991
- breast cancer or some shit?
- No.

258
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:14,077
Richard Roundtree did.

259
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,257
Sorry. I looked it up online.

260
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:18,883
Shaft had tit cancer?

261
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,261
Jeez.

262
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,059
Well, Shaft aside,

263
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:25,572
I'm not a pussy.

264
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,142
That is not
what's gonna take me out.

265
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,038
Oh, I agree.

266
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,439
Odds are it's gonna be
a jealous husband with a gun.

267
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,467
Damn straight.

268
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,999
I don't have good news, dr. Troy.

269
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,214
So tell what you don't like
about yourself.

270
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:09,867
They kicked me out of the band,
and now i got to get a real job.

271
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:28,874
Do you mind?

272
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,405
You were blocking my view.

273
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:32,916
Raj is it?

274
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:35,943
Sean said you'd be here to observe.

275
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:39,467
Apologies, dr. Troy. If you're fine with
the use of such substandard techniques,

276
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:41,010
then by all means
I'll stay out of your way.

277
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,806
- Did you just call my work substandard?
- Multiple sutures in the earlobe

278
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,518
without eversion will likely resolve

279
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,861
in an inferior scar,
perhaps even a keloid.

280
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,123
Wow, raj.

281
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:52,663
You sure know a lot for someone just out
of medical school, and you're so young.

282
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:55,439
In india, my father was
a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon.

283
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,941
He started tutoring me
as soon as I was able to hold a scalpel.

284
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,516
He said I was meant to change
the world with my hands.

285
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,949
That's a lot of pressure
to put on someone at such a young age.

286
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,166
But as surgeons, we must learn
to deal with that pressure every day.

287
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,694
He was preparing me,
and for that, I am grateful.

288
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,750
Who taught you your skills,
Dr. Troy?

289
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,411
The university of miami.

290
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,168
Well,
we can't all learn from the best.

291
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,735
All right, doogie howser.
You're out of here, all right. Go.

292
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,586
Come back when you reach puberty.

293
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,077
Well, I'd recheck
those stitches if i were you.

294
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:23,371
They still seemed a little loose.

295
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,227
I know what you're going through,
Christian, but come On. He's just a kid.

296
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,812
He's not just a kid.
He's a pain in the ass,

297
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,495
and you do not know
what I'm going through,

298
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:39,533
so stop acting like you do.

299
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:48,954
Me, too,

301
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,094
like you can't imagine.

302
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,985
You know what?

303
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,550
The little shit was right.

304
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,349
I need to resuture these.

305
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:00,795
They're a little loose.

306
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,425
Come on. Push yourself.

307
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,809
You can make it. You got it. OK.

308
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:13,683
That's it. I'm done.

309
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,681
You got to do one more, dad,
OK? Come on.

310
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:19,244
Can't we just order pizza
and watch the game together?

311
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,018
I got to pick up jenna.

312
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:24,637
We're gonna see mom to do an hour
of memory rehabilitation,

313
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:26,988
show her old slides
and pictures and stuff.

314
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,408
Is she still furious with me?

315
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,798
I told her you lied to her
and said you were still married

316
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:36,596
Because you loved her,
not because you were trying to hurt her.

317
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,960
Yeah.
She still doesn't want to see you.

318
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,503
There's something
I want to show you.

319
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:53,677
Oh, man.

320
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:58,857
What's this?
From your Parole officer?

321
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,722
No. Not this time.

322
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,275
You've enrolled
at Santa Monica College?

323
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,198
Yeah, just until I get
enough credits to transfer to Ucla.

324
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,569
Chemistry and biology, anatomy?

325
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,201
I think I want
to try the premed thing.

326
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:20,123
I know i've given you too many reasons
not to be proud of me.

327
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,505
Seeing you in that chair
made me want to change that.

328
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:29,776
Well,
I would have gotten in a wheelchair

329
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,985
a long time ago if I thought...

330
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,055
I'm sorry that's what it took.

331
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,926
Well, if you ever need help

332
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:42,121
with your science homework,
you better come to me.

333
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,789
Who else would I ask... Christian?

334
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,366
Ask me about what, matty?

335
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,898
Whether you should keep banging
your half-Sister

336
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,447
and populating the world
with more redneck retards?

337
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,749
For the record, christian,
I haven't spoken to Emme

338
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,141
in over a month.

339
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,069
The last thing I heard,
she moved to new york.

340
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:58,870
She's studying fashion, doing great.

341
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,902
You know, she is your daughter.
You should call her.

342
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,664
You know,
all my children disappoint me,

343
00:25:03,784 --> 00:25:05,422
except for Wilber because
he doesn't talk very much.

344
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:08,297
Matt's taking premed courses
at santa monica college.

345
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:12,510
Community college. Glad to see
you're shooting so high there, killer.

346
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,763
Well... see you tomorrow.

347
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:22,895
- Did you do an hour of those bars?
- I did 45 minutes.

348
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:25,751
Well, then get back on it, superman.
I need you back at work as of yesterday.

349
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:27,704
I don't want to be hanging with hadji
The snake charmer.

350
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,011
His name is raj,

351
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:32,360
and actually, he kind of reminds me
of myself when I was in med school.

352
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,160
Right. Well, you want to play
henry higgins, that's fine by me,

353
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,356
but I don't want to see him
around until you're back,

354
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:39,697
all right? So come on.
Get back to it.

355
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:42,095
- I did enough for today.
- Why are you such a pussy?

356
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:45,042
Screw you, asshole.
You have no idea what I'm going through.

357
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,629
- I can't walk. It's Hard.
- So is stage two breast cancer.

358
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,035
What does breast cancer
have to do with anything?

359
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,091
I have it.

360
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,118
Can i give you a hand?

361
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,177
I think i'm fine for now.

362
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,210
Thanks.

363
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:37,739
You're gonna beat it.

364
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:41,204
I went to med school.
I know what stage two means.

365
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,562
Can we get a table or something?

366
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,565
Sure.

367
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:55,389
Nice shot.

368
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,741
Have you ever had a vision?

369
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,655
If you're gonna tell me that Elvis and
the virgin mary arrived at

370
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:05,184
- at our front door after i left...
- Rember when we took that psyche course

371
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:06,783
and we did lsd and

372
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,145
it was like we saw, you know,

373
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,578
the truth behind
the So-Called reality?

374
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,590
- You had a flashback?
- No.

375
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,789
A flashforward 20 years.

376
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:19,053
This crazy dream I had
when Julia walked out on me.

377
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,047
I was drinking too much, and

378
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:24,892
it was right before connor's surgery,
but it was so real

379
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,847
it was like I had it yesterday.
I was walking,

380
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:32,275
and you were definitely still alive.

381
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:34,610
And auntie em was there and
Uncle henry?

382
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,110
- Fine. Forget it.
- No, no. I want to hear it.

383
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,182
- How did i look?
- Pathetic.

384
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,630
You looked like Ricardo Montalban
returning from fantasy island.

385
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,247
You had silvery hair
and a wife on each arm.

386
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,012
Two wives. I like the sound of that.

387
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:52,410
- What about julia?
- Oh, happily married,

388
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,255
just not to either one of us.

389
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:58,606
You know, the future wasn't perfect,
but

390
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,053
at least we were both there.

391
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:05,289
That was a dream, Sean.
It wasn't a goddamn prophecy.

392
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:15,107
I know what it was,
but that part of it,

393
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:17,333
the part about us
being around for it,

394
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:19,196
I'm not just gonna dismiss that, OK?

395
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,183
It was telling me something,
something about having faith

396
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,444
because
we both come out all right in the end.

397
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,412
We were still together,

398
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,247
older, but...

399
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,543
we got to see our kids grow up.

400
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,965
I'm scared, Sean.

401
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,631
You're gonna die, Christian,
just not right away.

402
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,108
Of course, it does suck

403
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,865
to think that we're closer to the end
than the beginning, doesn't it?

404
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:55,644
I'm telling you,

405
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:59,078
we're here
for at least another 25 years,

406
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:02,559
so you might as well enjoy it
as much as you can, right?

407
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,567
Can I get you gentlemen anything?

408
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,652
Actually, could you show me
where the men's room is?

409
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,294
- I'd be happy to.
- That's very sweet of you.

410
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,123
Can i buy you a drink?

411
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:30,867
No, thanks.

412
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:33,237
I could use the conversation.

413
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,232
I just found out
I have breast cancer.

414
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:53,845
You like those.

415
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,519
100% real, doctor.

416
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,733
You're hurting me.

417
00:30:57,993 --> 00:31:00,160
When was the last time you had
these checked for lumps?

418
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,364
Are you giving me a breast exam
while we're having sex?

419
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,489
I think i felt something.

420
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,488
I had a mammogram
at my regular checkup. They're fine.

421
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:08,239
How long ago? You can't be too careful,
you know, particularly at your age.

422
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,369
My age?

423
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,880
You're the one who's in his forties,
not me.

424
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:15,551
Next time you want a sympathy screw,

425
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,882
You might try showing
a little more sympathy.

426
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,711
I didn't come here
to wallow in your misery.

427
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,524
That was
the most amazing sex I've ever had.

428
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:50,388
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

429
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:53,278
Doing it in the chair like that.

430
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,829
Now i'm addicted.

431
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:00,847
How soon can you be ready again?

432
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:37,996
Lipo, give me this, give me this.

433
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,047
Oh, i've got you, got you.

434
00:32:41,741 --> 00:32:43,771
Give me this. Give me that.

435
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,763
Oh, my... I cannot

436
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,037
believe how big lipo has gotten.

437
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:58,891
Do you want me to stay over with wilber
while you're in the hospital?

438
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,225
The nanny will be here with Sean.

439
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:07,838
How do you feel about wilber?

440
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,480
I mean, you like him, right,
more than just any kid?

441
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:15,134
- What are you talking about?
- I just... I need to... I need

442
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:18,120
to hear you say it.
I need to know that you...

443
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:23,780
- that you like him.
- I love wilber, christian.

444
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,304
You know that.

445
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:31,569
Hey, buddy.

446
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:33,765
Why don't you take
Lipo out to the balcony,

447
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:35,730
Play with him out there for a bit?

448
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,098
- Come on. Lipo, outside.
- Lipo, go.

449
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:48,067
Wilber's gonna need
some stability in his life

450
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,694
if something happens to me.

451
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:52,696
I want you to raise him.

452
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,989
I know what It's like to bounce around
from parent to parent, and

453
00:33:57,216 --> 00:34:00,919
he's pretty much lost one
of his every year of his life, so...

454
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,041
he loves you, trusts you.

455
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:06,418
I think he deserves a

456
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,451
good mother.

457
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:10,811
OK.

458
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:16,944
That's it?

459
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:22,017
You're not gonna tell me
how crazy i am for worrying about this?

460
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,059
I have known a lot of people
with breast cancer.

461
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,065
Some of them have made it,
and some of them have not.

462
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,386
As your friend,

463
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:34,405
I think that you're gonna be around
for the next 50 years pissing me off.

464
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,251
As a doctor,

465
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,910
I think it's a good idea that you get
not het all your affairs in order.

466
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:45,956
I just want to be as honest
with you as you would be with me.

467
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,710
You deserve that.

468
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,158
I don't think you guys
really understand.

469
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:06,435
Without my breast, how am I ever
gonna feel like a real woman again?

470
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:07,600
Silly me.

471
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,106
I thought
this experience might just make you

472
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:12,905
the teeniest bit sensitive to what
some women have to go through.

473
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,891
- You're gonna do just fine.
- Absolutely.

474
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:16,845
Dr. Moss is the best there is.

475
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,911
At least you could do the cutting?

476
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,642
- You're the only surgeon i trust.
- Moss is your man.

477
00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:24,965
I'll stick around to make sure he leaves
enough tissue for a diep procedure

478
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,529
so we don't have
to take it from your ass.

479
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:28,059
I'll let you off the hook this time

480
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:31,201
but only because
you're doing the reconstruction.

481
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,402
I hate being on the outside

482
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:37,264
with my nose pressed up
against the glass,

483
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:39,090
not when it's family.

484
00:36:08,823 --> 00:36:09,823
Thank you.

485
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:25,551
Can you please make sure there are
clean margins in every direction?

486
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,910
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave immediately.

487
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,111
I got clearance from dr. Marsh.

488
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,466
You can take it up with him
if you have a problem with it.

489
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:37,529
Send the frozen section to pathology.
I don't want him closed up

490
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:39,033
until it's clear.

491
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:10,944
Dr. Mcnamara?

492
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,479
Yes.

493
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,761
I'm Jo Rose,

494
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,268
Colleen's Sister.

495
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,822
You didn't need to come
after what she did to you.

496
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:26,076
I wanted to make sure she's dead.

497
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,608
You look so serene, Cookie,

498
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,385
So at peace.

499
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,914
- Must be a relief.
- It is.

500
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:27,761
No more pains, no more worries,

501
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:29,514
no responsibilities,

502
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,677
No disappointments,

503
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:34,937
but they're all gonna remember you
exactly as you are now...

504
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,133
Young,

505
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,815
at the height of your vitality
and power.

506
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:42,843
You have the comfort of
Never-Ending blackness now

507
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:45,801
and the joy of infinite freedom.

508
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,165
You can catch up on your rest.
