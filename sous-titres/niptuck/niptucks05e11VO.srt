<i>previously on nip/tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,200
Mr. Mcnamara, i'm colleen rose of the colleen rose agency.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,200
You have a very leturalistic process.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
At mesk you something.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,900
What do you think of these?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,100
Colleen, this is inappropriate.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
Hey, asshole, sean called.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,100
He offered me the job of receptionist.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,400
I don't want you near my work ever again.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,900
I know you want it,christian.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Uhh! This is love.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
Gina: unh! Ahh! This is love.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,700
Have you decided what you're gonna do with gina's body?

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,700
Why do you keep asking me that? I'm not her next of kin.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,500
Are you joining me for our 10:00?

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,400
I just need to get my shit together, ok?
Just give me a sec. Just...

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,500
so tell me what you don't like about yourself. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm not sure which one of you is here for the consult.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
That would be me. We just got back from our honeymoon,

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
And, well, it, uh-It didn't go quite as we had planned.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,100
Oh, bet it happens all the time.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,500
I mean, the pressure alone is enough to kill your libido.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,300
That's not exactly what i meant.

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,900
We were goin' up to the mountains,
the oregon coast rangsoinsnowing hard.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
Uh, it was impossible to see anything,

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,300
And i took a wrong turn, went down a ravine, uh, 20 feet.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Our car was on its side,completely buried in snow.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We were trapped inside for 10 days.

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,100
But you survived, which is a miracle,

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,200
And if your marriage can survive that,
it's a pretty good sign.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,700
And you're here because...

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
well, i don't remember much.

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
It's-Uh, i must have been knocked unconscious or something.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,400
I- I just remember wakin' up with this incredible pain and, uh,

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,400
These huge gouges taken out of my arm.

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
The trim from the dash cut right through it.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,500
Ah. Tendons are ok. Muscle's undamaged. You're lucky.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
The cut's pretty, um-The trim from the dashboard did this?

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,800
Tell them the truth, kyle.

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Honey.
I have to tell them, tell somebody what you did.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,700
The guilt is-I can't take it anymore.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,800
We had-No food, no water. I'm-

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm severely hypoglycemic.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,700
We tried text messaging till the cell battery ran out,
but no help came.

45
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
After a week, she started to complain of headaches and dizziness,

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
And eventually she started to lose motor control.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
I started hearing noises,

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
And my-My eyes wouldn't focus.

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,000
I could only see these spots.

50
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,500
I thought she was gonna die.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,600
I thought we both were gonna die.

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,100
He saved me. He, uh-Gouged
out small pieces of his flesh,

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,700
Warmed them with the car lighter,
and fed them to me.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,000
I was like a-Like a cannibal eating
my own husband to survive.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
What kind of person am i?

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,500
I- I think i'm gonna-I'm gonna be sick.

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,900
She couldn't have lasted without something to eat,

58
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,700
And i didn't want to lose her.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
I did not know what else to do.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
You must think i'm a monster,

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,800
But you have no idea what you would do to survive

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,300
Until it happens to you. Please.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Please f-Fix my husband.

65
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,500
I still can't believe gina killed herself.

66
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
Seemed like she was doin' so well.

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,700
Liz: well, happens to a lot of suicidal personalities.

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,700
Things get good.
The bad feelings don't go away. All hope is lost,

69
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,500
And then splat. How is wilber handling this?

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,200
Fine. He took it hard at first,but...

71
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,300
kid's a survivor.

72
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,200
I owe gina for wilber,but besides that,

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
She's nothing but a chronic hemorrhoid.

74
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,600
Every time i thought she was gone,

75
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,300
She'd flare up again and be a pain in my ass.

76
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,800
Here. Hand him over.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,500
Why? What are you doin'?

78
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I'll close. It's almost noon.

79
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Why don't you go pick wilber up from school?

80
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,000
Your son needs you right now more than i do.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Can i help you?

82
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,800
He's my son, wilber.

83
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm dr. Troy.

84
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh. So the principal called you already?

85
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,600
About what?

86
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,100
Well, uh, there was an incident today with your son.

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,200
He bit another student, yeah, during stretch and grow.

88
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I guess owen got too close to wilber's mat.

89
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,100
Jesus. Is the other boy ok?

90
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh. Well, you know, at this age,
they forget all about it 20 minutes later.

91
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,200
We have a bigger problem, though.

92
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,000
Uh, school policy requires that wilber be expelled.

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Yeah, it's in the enrollment contract
that you signed-Personal conduct.

94
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,700
You can speak to the principal, but-

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Is he aware that wilber's mother died a few days ago?

96
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,799
Oh, my god. I had no idea.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
What-What happened?

98
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,999
She jumped off the balcony.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,100
Suicide.

100
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
You haven't told him?

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,900
No.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, well, no wonder he's acting out.

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,300
He's probably so confused
by her sudden absence in his life, scared.

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,700
You need to tell him what happened.

105
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
He's too young to understand.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
Oh, well, he might not have the verbal skills,

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,500
But he can certainly sense such a big change.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Look, i'll talk to the principal.

109
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm sure the school will make
an exception, given the circumstances.

110
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,800
But you need to tell wilber
that his mother is gone for everyone's safety.

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,700
Come on. Do it for me.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,399
Wait, come on. You can do it.

113
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,700
Colleen, this is awkward.

114
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Well, i've heard about it,and i-I wanna hear it.

115
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,700
I mean, i think i deserve the full mcnamara charm.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Ok. Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,700
So good.

118
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,000
The old hammertoe,which i got from pounding

119
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,600
The pavement on yours and my other clients' behalf.

120
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Hold still, please. I see there are several toes

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That are quite rigid and some calluses.

122
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,100
Ok. Now, check those out.

123
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,900
It's gonna be a great awards season for hearts 'n scalpels,

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,500
And i refuse to walkdown the red
carpet in a pair of goddamn easy spirits.

125
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Now, i read about this surgery in the new allure.

126
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's as hot as your career.

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
So you shave the bones.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
They shorten the toes, they fuse the tendons,
and they peel the skin.

129
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,200
It's nothin' to it, right?

130
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,800
I do want you to look your best, colleen.

131
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,800
It's in my best interest that you do.

132
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,800
I do feel however that we have a proper

133
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,500
And fair financial arrangement and
good professional boundaries, which-

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Whoa. Hold it right there,cookie.

135
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
You think i'm asking for a freebie?

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,699
Never.

137
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,999
All right? I'm the patient.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,999
You're the pro.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,300
Just like you're a client, and i'm a pro.

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,000
So let's get this surgery on the book.

141
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, my god. How cute do you look holding those shoes.

142
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,100
What ya doin', buddy?

143
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,600
Playing my t-Rex. He bites hard, like this.

144
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Wilber, no. It's not nice to bite.

145
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,900
We don't do that in this house, ok, or at school.

146
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,100
But i know why you're doing it.

147
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,600
You're upset because
your mommy's gone away again. Right?

148
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,300
I miss mommy.

149
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,700
Ok, here's the deal.

150
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
You're my son, and i love you,

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,700
And i'm gonna be honest with you always, ok?

152
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Mommy's not coming back, because...

153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,700
daddy killed her.

154
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
I- I don't know what happened.

155
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,500
I- Daddy was horny and tired
and needed to get his rocks off.

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,100
You'll understand what i'm talking
about when you're older.

157
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,599
And mommy offered him cheap sex,

158
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,400
And like a fool, daddy accepted.

159
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,000
Basically i-I screwed her off the balcony,

160
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,900
And she fell to her death,
and i haven't told you or anybody else,

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Because i don't want the police involved,

162
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,900
Because then daddy could go to jail,

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,199
And then i wouldn't be with you,

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,800
And i'm not gonna let that happen.

165
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Is mommy a skank?

166
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes, honey. She was.

167
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,700
She was a bad person and a bad mommy,

168
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,200
Maybe this is all for the best,

169
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,700
So it's just you and me, like it's meant to be.

170
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,300
Play with me, daddy.

171
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,200
I miss mommy.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
She buys me ice cream.

173
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,800
When's mommy coming back?

174
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,100
Mommy took a long trip, honey,

175
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,600
You know, like before.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
Mommy's not coming back for a long time.

177
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,000
What were you two gabbin' about?

178
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,600
Oh, sorry, sean. I should have waited
before i sent her into la-La land,

179
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
But the woman is a force of nature,
and she doesn't know when to stop.

180
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Yeah. I've been there.

181
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,500
And she's very excited about what you're doin' for her.

182
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,699
This isn't pro bono.

183
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,699
She's paying for it.

184
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
No, not this,

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,300
But this takin' her to all
the award shows this winter.

186
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Yeah. Are you really goin' to the oscars?

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
No, she must have meant one of her other clients.

188
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
Hmm. I don't think so.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
It's hammer time. Hit it.

190
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,100
Nancy sinatra: * these boots are made for walkin',

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
And that's just what they'll do,

192
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,600
One of these days,
these boots are gonna walk all over you *

193
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,300
Are you ready, boots?

194
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Start walkin'.

195
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,600
I have nicole.

196
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,100
Call back.

197
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm in the middle of a surgery here.

198
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,099
Hi, sean. We're c.A.A.

199
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,799
Who?

200
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,700
Creative artists agency.

201
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,600
The biggest talent agency in town, sean.

202
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,000
That's right, and we wanna
be in the sean mcnamara business.

203
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,300
You could have caused an infection,

204
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,500
Severely compromised that patient's health.

205
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,900
We sincerely apologize,dr. Mcnamara.

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
In no way did we intend to
put you or anyone else in danger.

207
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,399
I have tom.

208
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,500
Call back.

209
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,399
Cruise?

210
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Or hanks.

211
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Look, i appreciate the interest,

212
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,900
But i already have representation.

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,500
It's colleen rose of the colleen rose agency.

214
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,100
Huh. I'm not familiar with her.

215
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
Have you heard of colleen rose?

216
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
No.

217
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,300
No. Probably one of those new boutiques.

218
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm sure she's a terrific agent,

219
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Though she doesn't have as
much in common with you as we do.

220
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
But you don't even know me.

221
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,800
Well, that's why we're here,to begin that process.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Look, you're a doctor. We wanna help people.

223
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
We care about our clients' entire lives,

224
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Not just their careers. For example...

225
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,400
this is a list of organizations
with which we're involved.

226
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
Doctors without borders,

227
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,200
N.R.D.C., habitat for humanity.

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
This week, we're actually taking an afternoon off

229
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,600
And building a house in new orleans
to help aid katrina victims.

230
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,300
Have you helped with the katrina effort, sean?

231
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,400
Mikey, you got that club sandwich?

232
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm friggin' famished.

233
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,600
I've been at this one all goddamn morning.

234
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Who are you?

235
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm dr. Christian troy.

236
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
I arranged for ms. Russo's interment.

237
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,200
Right. This one just bought me a flat-Screen tv.

238
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,500
Thanks for the gig.

239
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,100
I hear you're the best.

240
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,100
And i hear you're a plastic surgeon,
which is fantastic.

241
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm a goddamn picasso with the putty,

242
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,100
But not even i can figure out how to
put this humpty dumpty back together again.

243
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,300
Can i pick your brain?

244
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,700
Sure.

245
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,500
So, doc, help me out here.

246
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
As you can see, the left side of ms. Russo's face,

247
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,000
The point of impact,
has just been shattered beyond recognition.

248
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,700
There's no cheekbone, no jaw structure to prop up.

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Try a vitallium recom plate for the left mandible.

250
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
This will give you some architecture to manipulate.

251
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,900
There's no stable fixation point.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
The whole side's like smucker's jelly.

253
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,600
Dr. Troy,
i don't think there's anything else i can do for her.

254
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,700
I think we're talkin'closed casket here.

255
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
You want a minute?

256
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
For all the times i've wanted to kill you...

257
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,500
this wasn't one of them.

258
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,400
Hello.

259
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
His heart suddenly dropped from 74 to 140.

260
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,900
He's been labile for the past half an hour.

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,200
Fever?
105.

262
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
Sean: his heart rate's stabilized at 90,

263
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,100
But his b.P.Keeps bottoming out.

264
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
Get his chart.
Maybe he's on some medication we're not aware of.

265
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh, he doesn't take anything.

266
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,200
He's never been sick a day-Now you fix this.

267
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Maybe those instruments you used
weren't sterile. I read about that.

268
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
I assure you we sterilize everything.

269
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,700
I can't lose him.

270
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,100
I'll kill myself if something happens to him.

271
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,500
Kyle,

272
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Can you hear me? Babe?

273
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,600
Mrs. Ainge,
your husband is in some kind of septic shock.

274
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,999
If you want him to pull through this,

275
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,199
You're gonna have to wait outside.

276
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,800
You understand?

277
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,000
Let's start him on a dopamine drip, 10 mics.

278
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
Have some ephedrine standing by.

279
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
He's losing blood pressure.

280
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,300
How's it going, colleen?

281
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
What's the matter, cookie?

282
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Minor trouble with another patient. He's stabilized.

283
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Oh, well, he'll live. I mean,you are a genius.

284
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Your work is just goddamn brilliant.

285
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,300
I could have a second career
as a foot model. Seriously.

286
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Well, you seem to be healing perfectly,

287
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
So i'll just check in later.

288
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,900
Look what i made you.

289
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,800
It's a sean bear. Hey, look.

290
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,300
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

291
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,700
I recorded it during our consult.

292
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,200
Also i sewed these surgery garbs
and the booties myself in silk

293
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,000
So it would be soft against your skin. Heh.

294
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,400
It's, uh-Heh-Charming.

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,400
It's how i express my friendship. Here. It's my hobby.

296
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I make teddies instead of knitting or whatever
it is other people do to relax.

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,900
I'm in a very stressful profession,
as i'm sure you know.

298
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,599
Colleen, when we started working together,

299
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,300
I had in mind a more businesslike arrangement.

300
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,300
I understand your approach is a more personal,

301
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Hands-On kind of-

302
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,900
You ready, sean?
Operation katrina kids, here we come.

303
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,200
Oh, hey, bob. Uh, you know,

304
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
I'll be right down. We're just finishing up here.

305
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,700
Operation katrina kids?

306
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,000
Who's this?

307
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,400
Bob levitz.

308
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,600
"Caa"? What's caw?

309
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,000
That's c.A.A.,creative artists agency.

310
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Whatever. Why are you gonna
fly to katrina with them?

311
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,400
What, you want poverty?
I'll show you poverty. We'll get in my volvo.

312
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,599
We'll drive down to watts.

313
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Colleen.

314
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,800
Oh, come on. These guys
are gonna eat you alive, sean.

315
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
You're nothin' but a piece of meat to them,

316
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,100
And as soon as they swallow you,

317
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,000
They're gonna shit you out just
like last night's dinner at the palm.

318
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Um, bob, can-Can you just give us a minute?

319
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah.

320
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,700
Do what you gotta do.
We got a private jet waiting.

321
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,200
No one's gonna leave without you.

322
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,000
Ok.

323
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,300
Nice to meet you, collette.

324
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,500
You can't go. You have a patient in distress.

325
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,099
I told you my patient has stabilized.

326
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,399
I'm only out for the afternoon.

327
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,700
I was talking about me.

328
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
My staff will look after you.

329
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,900
And as for you and me,
i haven't made any commitments.

330
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,100
I just want to explore my options.

331
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,700
Fine. Go.

332
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
You just broke my heart.

333
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,099
Colleen.

334
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Go.

335
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,000
Go!

336
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,700
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

337
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,700
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

338
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,900
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

339
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,400
Big turnout, huh?

340
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,899
Yeah. I knew she didn't have any family,

341
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,200
But i didn't realize she had so many friends.

342
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,500
Nice to know, right,

343
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,800
That she touched so many people.

344
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,599
Hello, everyone. I'm manuel.

345
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Hi, manuel.

346
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,500
Today's a very sad day.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700
We've lost a dear friend,

348
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
A pillar of support in our struggle
to control those impulses

349
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,600
That too often run our lives.

350
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,100
All these people must be from
her sexaholics anonymous heyday.

351
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,400
Gina, more than anyone in this room,

352
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,800
You struggled with those impulses.

353
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,900
Well, no more.

354
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,700
So in that spirit, i'm going to say
what i know everyone is thinking right now.

355
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
She gave the best damn blow job i ever had.

356
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,850
Gina, gave me the rim job of my life.

357
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,850
A hand job like an octopus.

358
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,150
Her tongue could actually vibrate.

359
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,850
In fact, i'm hard right now.

360
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,650
My little g spot.

361
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,550
That's what i liked to call her.

362
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,650
And the taint is real, folks.

363
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,750
Gina turned me on to that, too.

364
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,650
And i am going to be whacking off to those memories

365
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,250
For the rest of my life.

366
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,450
I only had sex with gina once

367
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,650
And i'm sorry that i did.

368
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,650
Because i am the guy

369
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,750
Who gave her aids.

370
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,449
Not on purpose.

371
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,050
I didn't even know myself that i was,uh

372
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,850
Positive at the time.

373
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,650
But gina

374
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,350
When i told her

375
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,250
She forgave me.

376
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,750
She, uh-

377
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,150
She said it would finally force her to get her life under control,

378
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,850
Something she wasn't able to do before.

379
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,150
She even helped me get treatment.

380
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,950
I mean

381
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,950
She-Supported me.

382
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,449
This addiction that we have

383
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,550
It can ruin your life,

384
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,050
But in a weird way

385
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,550
When i met gina...

386
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,750
it saved mine.

387
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,350
It was the wake-Up call that i needed,

388
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,950
And i wanna thank her for that.

389
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,949
Is something wrong?

390
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,150
He did it again, this time during sleepy time.

391
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,249
Mason pearce was just lying on her mat next to him.

392
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,050
She needed 2 stitches.

393
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,249
Well, i don't understand.

394
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,149
He's such a sweet kid.

395
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,750
Well, have you told him about his mother's death yet?

396
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,850
No.

397
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,150
Look, i can't protect him anymore.

398
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,450
If i don't remove him,the parents are going to sue.

399
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,750
How much?

400
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,249
Wilber loves it here.

401
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,350
He needs some kind of consistency in his life.

402
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,550
There must be something you need, a-

403
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,650
A jungle gym?

404
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,850
I was hoping that you could provide something else to climb on.

405
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,549
That's it. Right there

406
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,250
Big boy. That's good. Ohh. Oh,what a good, big boy you are.

407
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,849
Ohh. Faster. Ohh. Yeah, yeah,

408
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,949
Yeah, yeah. Faster! Faster! Ohh

409
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,650
Oh, yes! That's good. Ohh! Yeah!

410
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,350
Faster, please! Ohh!

411
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,950
Jesus! What the-You bit me.

412
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,049
Oh, i'm sorry.

413
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,549
You drew blood.

414
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,550
I'm sorry. I just-Um, i've never done that before.

415
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,550
I guess you bring out the animal in me.

416
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,550
You're the one that bit the kids, aren't you?

417
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,850
I'm sorry, but i would never hurt a child.

418
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,349
I understand that it's difficult to accept that

419
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,450
Your son has issues

420
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,249
But it's gonna take a lot more than

421
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,549
The accusations of the father of a bad,

422
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,450
Little biter and my behavior in a moment of passion

423
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,750
To release wilber from the responsibility of these attacks.

424
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,550
Ok?

425
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,950
Ok.

426
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,850
Well, i'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than that,vampire.

427
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,550
Just so you know,i'm pretty good with skin,

428
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,649
And i don't think it'd be too much trouble for me

429
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,349
To take an indentation of the marks you

430
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,350
Just left on my  neck

431
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,549
Match them to the ones on the kids

432
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,550
That you claim wilber bit.

433
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,350
I hope you know how to operate a griddle,

434
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,450
Because you won't be teaching kids anymore.

435
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,150
The new lab work pinpoints his white blood count at 30,000,

436
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,150
But they still don't pinpoint the cause of the infection.

437
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,850
We're losin' him, sean.

438
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,150
How is he?

439
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,250
We need to move him, get him to a hospital.

440
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,649
He's fighting something, and we don't know what it is.

441
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,849
We're running out of options.

442
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,349
I think i know what's made him sick.

443
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,150
I-

444
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,050
I cut myself and fed him small pieces of my-Of my flesh.

445
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,450
He's in recovery.

446
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,749
I didn't mean to. It's-After the operation,

447
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,949
I felt so guilty about what i did,

448
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,250
About what he did for me.

449
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,950
I made him do it.

450
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,849
Love nourishes. It does.

451
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,549
What?

452
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,350
Kyle showed me that.

453
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,250
Do you have any idea how filthy and contaminated human flesh is?

454
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,749
Bacteria in uncooked meat can cause life-Threatening diseases.

455
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,349
I don't understand.

456
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,350
I ate pieces of him,and i didn't get sick.

457
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,949
Well, you said he warmed those pieces.

458
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,650
Obviously the heat was enough to kill anything toxic.

459
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,150
If your husband dies, mrs. Ainge, you have yourself to thank.

460
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,349
Who are you calling? I didn't want to hurt him.

461
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,849
I just- It would help me get rid of my shame.

462
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,049
I-I thought if we both did it, we could be-Be like we were.

463
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,649
Please don't call the police.

464
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,349
I can't promise you that. I'm sorry.

465
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,650
Dr. Larsen,please.

466
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,650
Tell him dr. Mcnamara's on his way over.

467
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,550
If he could meet me at the e.R. I'd appreciate it. Uh-Huh.

468
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,050
Welcome to my humble home.

469
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,550
Wait a minute. You said this was your office.

470
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,049
My home office, yes.

471
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,850
Please, come in.

472
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,250
Right.

473
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,550
So, koreatown. It's an up-And-Coming neighborhood,i'm told.

474
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,950
I feel so safe here, and the vegetables are so inexpensive.

475
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,650
Heh. Can i take your jacket?

476
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,350
Yeah.

477
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,550
Wow. Lot of bears.

478
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:19,949
Yes.

479
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,850
Have you spoken to sean?

480
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,450
Ah, he's running a few minutes late.

481
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,350
Would you like a glass of asti? Cheese canape?

482
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,950
No? I really appreciate your agreeing to this meeting, bob.

483
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,849
I like doing things in a very open and honest fashion,

484
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,150
Just putting everything out on the table.

485
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,650
That way,everyone feels that they've been heard

486
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,949
And sean can then make a more informed choice.

487
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,950
Whatever it takes.

488
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,050
Please.

489
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,050
Wait!

490
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,849
You know, uh, sean is a great talent.

491
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,150
He deserves the best representation.

492
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,550
I made you your own bear.

493
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,450
It's an agent bear.

494
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,249
What the hell is this?

495
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,350
That's what you do, isn't it,eat people alive?

496
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,750
Devour their souls and spirits?

497
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,150
Have a cheese canape, bob.

498
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,449
No.

499
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,849
I went to a lot of trouble.

500
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,750
Thank you. No.

501
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,950
So, colleen

502
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,749
Who else do you represent these days?

503
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,550
Why? So you can steal them from me, too?

504
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,550
I represent moon zappa, dakota fanning.

505
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,250
I also happen to represent ms. Nicole kidman.

506
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,150
She's just stunning.

507
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,150
Well, i wonder how that works,

508
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,150
Since i'm on team nicole.

509
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,550
Not anymore!

510
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:26,350
Wakey, wakey, mr. Agent bear.

511
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,950
Are you ready to be immortalized forever?

512
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,150
I know what you were thinking.

513
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,249
You thought,"i'll just make a few snide remarks

514
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,250
About her age and her pitiful apartment,"

515
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,450
And then sean will be all yours.

516
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,850
Well,hard to talk with duct tape on your mouth, isn't it?

517
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,150
You know what it's like...

518
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,550
to be a nobody

519
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,950
And suddenly become a somebody because you hitched your dumb,

520
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,450
Little unimportant star to one that shines so much brighter than  yours?

521
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,350
And do you know how much it hurts

522
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,050
When that wondrous,

523
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,549
Magical star suddenly flickers out

524
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,749
And dies in your life

525
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,950
And you end up being just shut in the shadows?!

526
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,449
Mmm! Mmm!

527
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,950
It hurts so much!

528
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,050
You will not take away my star!

529
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,950
You will not take away my sean.

530
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,950
I want you to open your mouth.

531
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,350
I said open your mouth!

532
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,850
Get some goddamn dignity.

533
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,250
See the stuffing?

534
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,050
It's going inside you now.

535
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,350
That's it. That's it.

536
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,150
That's it. That's it.

537
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,250
Hey, there. Officer kane is here to assist you to the police station

538
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,150
And take an imprint of your teeth.

539
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,850
You could go peacefully, but frankly i'd prefer if you resisted arrest.

540
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,450
I'll be happy to do anything to help clear my name.

541
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,549
Our parents pay a premium to send their children here,

542
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,650
And i really don't wanna waste any more of my valuable time

543
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,250
So dr. Troy can remain in denial about his son.

544
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,950
Just so you know, you'll be away for 2 years for this

545
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,350
And even female inmates don't take kindly to bitches that bite babies.

546
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,449
I'm sorry, officer.

547
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,550
I forgot my purse.

548
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,950
I had my teeth capped, dickhead.

549
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,750
Ok. Tcch.

550
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,950
Lanie's forearm flexor muscles are about 30% gone.

551
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,350
She might lose partial control of her hand because of this.

552
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,650
If she had just ordered him beef carpaccio,

553
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,950
I don't think her husband would have known the difference.

554
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,550
How is mr. Ainge doing?

555
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,849
The hospital localized 2 infections, toxoplasmosis and listeria,

556
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,750
But he is responding to antibiotics.

557
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,450
Did you take a bite out of crime, mcgruff?

558
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,450
That bitch filed away the evidence and got caps,

559
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,950
So they couldn't prosecute.

560
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,149
The principal believed me,

561
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,450
However, so the least i could do is get her fired.

562
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,750
What are you gonna tell wilber now that his teacher's gone, too?

563
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,749
That she was picked up by a tornado and carried far,

564
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,550
Far away and never to be seen of again.

565
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,549
You can't keep lying to him.

566
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,449
He's gonna keep askin' questions. You know that.

567
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,950
He's too young to understand,all right?

568
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,450
It's too hard on him.

569
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,850
I think it's too hard on you.

570
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,950
Is that a sausage toe?

571
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,350
I don't think so. Just a little swollen.

572
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,150
Have you been wearing closed-Toe shoes?

573
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,250
Oops. You told me,and i forgot.

574
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,050
I was a bad girl.

575
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,550
You just need to ice it and take some ibuprofen.

576
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,350
Sorry i was so panicky.

577
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,250
It's fine.

578
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,149
You will remain a watched-Over patient at mcnamara/troy

579
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,450
Until you're healed and happy.

580
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,750
Heh.

581
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,650
Um, i know i kind of misbehaved the last time i saw you,

582
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,250
And for that, i'm very sorry.

583
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,649
And i also wanted to take this opportunity

584
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,950
To wish you well with "caw"

585
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,850
And that charming bob levitz.

586
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,049
Actually, my mentor taught me once,

587
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,250
She said, "never be sad if you lose a client."

588
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,349
It's sort of like the pope.

589
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,950
You know, one goes, another one comes along.

590
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,150
Well, this pope isn't going anywhere.

591
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,449
Apparently bob levitz had some kind of spiritual awakening

592
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,450
After our trip to new orleans.

593
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,050
He sent out a mass e- Mail via his blackberry

594
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,350
Saying he's takin' off for darfur to build schools.

595
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,550
Whoa. How fantastic for those refugees over there, huh?

596
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,050
Bob's a real go-Getter.

597
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,150
I'm sorry.

598
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,950
Not so fantastic for you, sean.

599
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,450
Have any of his colleagues tried to contact you?

600
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,350
Oh, not a single one.

601
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,049
Fools. Why didn't you call me?

602
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,850
I mean, at the very least,i am your friend.

603
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,950
I didn't feel i had the right

604
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,650
After running off like that.

605
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,650
I guess i was bit by the bug

606
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,250
The hollywood bug.

607
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,750
Heh. That's what this town does to us.

608
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,150
Heh. We've all been there, cookie.

609
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,050
It's odd. I never would've imagined it.

610
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,449
The whole time we were down there,

611
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,650
He was chasin' fats domino, tryin' to sign him.

612
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,750
Heh.

613
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,150
Didn't seem like he had a spiritual awakening.

614
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,349
Heh heh. It's hard to keep those ethics intact

615
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,250
When you have that constant corporate pressure.

616
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,350
Yeah. I'm seeing that.

617
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,150
We were a rare team,you and i.

618
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,650
What do you say we just forget this whole incident and

619
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,150
Um, start over?

620
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,550
Sounds like a plan.

621
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,450
Good.

622
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,450
Close your eyes. Keep 'em closed. Keep 'em closed.

623
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,750
Keep 'em closed. Not yet.

624
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,550
Open 'em. Heh.

625
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,450
He's mine?

626
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,750
Actually, he's a she.

627
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,449
I called her lipo. Isn't that cute?

628
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,950
Huh? Daddy got her from the pound.

629
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,450
I always wanted a puppy when i was a little boy.

630
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,750
So now

631
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,550
Any time you feel like you miss your mommy,

632
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,650
You can play with your puppy so you don't get sad.

633
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,850
Cool.

634
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,450
Heh heh heh.

635
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,450
Daddy, is mommy coming back?

636
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,849
No, honey. Mommy's never coming back.

637
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:26,950
