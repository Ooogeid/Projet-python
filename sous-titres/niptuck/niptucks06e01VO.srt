Previously on "Nip/Tuck"... 

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,810
The tumor has spread to
the superclavicular lymph node. 

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,960
- Give me a ball park. 
- 6 months. 

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,430
- My best friend just told me that he's... 
- Dying?

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,900
- I actually have to say the word. 
- It feels like I'm losing everything. 

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,910
I want you to come home with me, Lizzie. 

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,270
I want you to marry me. 

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,280
I now pronounce you husband and wife. 

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,790
Our lab tech switched your I. D. numbers. 

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,240
Your cancer is in remission. I wish you
and your bride a long, happy life together.

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,200
In 1987, after the infamous Black Monday crash, 

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,460
a new financial golden age was born, 

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,680
and along with it, a new industry, 

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,810
the luxury industry. 

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,810
Newfound wealth coupled
witheasily available credit

20
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,950
opened the door to vanities and excesses
once reserved for the rich and famous. 

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,240
Since that time, the one luxury
business that has always seen annual growth

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
has been plastic surgery. 

23
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,510
Doctors Sean McNamara and Christian Troy
rode this wave of financial proficiency. 

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,820
They suckled unabashed from
the teat of a flush society

25
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,130
willing to spend millions on
the new must-have status symbols... 

26
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,660
in compliant thighs and titanic tits. 

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,080
When you're done with her lipo, you
can start on her right breast. 

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
Do you realize we're gonna clear a quarter
of a million bucks on this patient alone?

29
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,480
Haha ha!

30
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,980
But as in every fairy tale, there
was a costly lesson to be learned. 

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,180
The credit crunch hit. 

32
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,560
Sean and Christian were
not immune to the downturn. 

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,190
Beauty is symmetry, Mrs. Praline. 

34
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,250
We're happy to do your tummy tuck, but...

35
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,970
you're not gonna be bikini ready
until you let us augment your breasts.

36
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,620
We prefer to do more than one surgery at a time. 

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,880
That way you only go under anesthesia once, 

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,710
and your recovery time is considerably faster. 

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,890
I told you, I've only got enough left in my
home equity line of credit to get a tummy tuck. 

40
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,780
For Sean McNamara, a man wound
tighter than a hummingbird's asshole, 

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,010
the financial stress was overwhelming. 

42
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,210
He began fighting incessantly
with his ex-wife Julia,

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,180
who now resided in New
York with their two children.

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
French lessons and karate?

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,870
Julia, you're over scheduling them. 

46
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,010
Well, then you're gonna have
to start paying for it. 

47
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,550
Sean's troubles were further exacerbated
by his new girlfriend, Teddy Rowe, 

48
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,780
who seemed immune to the
financial anxiety gripping the nation. 

49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,820
Can you imagine?

50
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
She had grown accustomed
to her beau's largesse

51
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,870
and wasn't going to resort to trumpery when it
came to celebrating their 6-month anniversary. 

52
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,070
I love them. 

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,330
And how much are these?

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,960
125, 000. 

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,940
Sean's anxiety ate at him like
vultures on fresh carrion. 

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,590
He developed a seemingly
incurable case of insomnia. 

57
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,400
Freed from his death sentence, 

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,970
Christian celebrated by providing the merchants of
Rodeo Drive with his own economic stimulus package. 

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,120
Hot shit rock and roll. 

60
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,000
Congrats, doctor. She's a beauty.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,070
Remember, Jack, spending is optimism. 

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,800
Sean and Christian weren't the only ones struggling. 

63
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,650
Just home from their honeymoon, 

64
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,790
Christian revealed to Dr. Liz Cruz
that he wasn't dying of breast cancer

65
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,280
and no longer wished to remain married. 

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,920
I took care of your first
and last at your new apartment. 

67
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,710
The security deposit, too. 

68
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,700
If you want, we can go furniture
shopping on the weekend. 

69
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,480
- Just let me do this alone, ok?
- Come on, Liz. 

70
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,290
- We're still friends. 
- We're not friends. 

71
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm your wife. 

72
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,170
Why didn't you tell me you weren't
dying when we were away?

73
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,720
Why did you go let me make a fool of myself?

74
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,930
I just wanted you to have a good time. 

75
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,870
I'm just trying to be practical. 

76
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,130
We'd be a perfect match
for 6 months, but 60years?

77
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,990
I mean, I'd be cheating on you within a week. 

78
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,320
I just don't want to hurt you
any more than I already have. 

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,990
What do you want me to do?

80
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,150
- Thank you for breaking my heart?
- No. 

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,840
I just want you to understand
that this isn't easy for me, either. 

82
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,390
I love you, andI 'll never
forget how you took care of me. 

83
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,140
And this is how you repay me, huh?

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Former porn millionaire Kimber Henry found
herself tossed out of Ram Peter's silk-sheeted bed

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,210
with nothing but the realization that there's
nothing less marketable than an old whore. 

86
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,070
Once again, she tried to reinvent herself. 

87
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,790
So you do electrolysis now?

88
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,420
Well, I went to night school to get certified.  

89
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,310
Well, hear me out. 

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,430
Just say some lady sasquatch
comes in for some lipo, ok?

91
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,810
You smooth her out, you make
her thighs like porcelain, but... 

92
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,390
she's got some hairs back
there, and that's no good. 

93
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,630
That's where I come in. 

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,370
Ok. 

95
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,790
Look at this. It doesn't even hurt. 

96
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,050
And figure this is a great way
for you to promote your business. 

97
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,670
You're gonna have an on-site esthetician, and
I know what it takes to be camera-ready. 

98
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,290
Kimber, it's a great idea, 

99
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,740
but business is too slow right now
to take on any new expenses. 

100
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,150
We can't afford you. 

101
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,700
This was rock bottom. 

102
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,130
McNamara/Troy, once the Tiffany's
of the plastic surgery world, 

103
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,860
was now like a malodorous whale
carcass washed up on Zuma Beach. 

104
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,850
The clients were gone. 

105
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,700
With them went the money,
and with that went the joy. 

106
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,420
What is this?

107
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,460
It's generic. We need to cut back everywhere. 

108
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,690
- That's bullshit. 
- Christian, you're not getting it. 

109
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,210
We are in trouble. 

110
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,350
I want my goddamn Yoplait!

111
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,800
I just finished paying off
last semester's tuition, 

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,790
for which you received no credits because
you never took your finals, ok?

113
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,300
I have here your car registration renewal. 

114
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,680
You have 9 unpaid parking tickets, 

115
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,250
and the credit card I
gave you for emergencies

116
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,010
has several luxury charges on it. 

117
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,960
- Well, I can explain those charges. 
- Matt, listen to me. 

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,190
You need to pay back some of
those debts. It's ridiculous. 

119
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,810
You got $450 for some men's
store called Emmanuel Delacroix. 

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,520
It's not a men's store. Emmanuel Delacroix
is the number-one mime in the world, 

121
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,930
and he's here doing aonce-
in-a-lifetime master class. 

122
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,890
What?

123
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah. My acting teacher turned me on to him. 

124
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,770
Look,

125
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,170
you know how they say when you find your
bliss is when the money starts rolling in?

126
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,330
I think I've found it. 

127
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:24,170
Mime is so amazing, man. It takes us beyond
our petty egos, beyond language, and unifies us. 

128
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,810
It's a great art form, ok?

129
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,300
The pure universal language of gesture. 

130
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,530
Is this a joke?

131
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,190
Listen, boxcar Willie. 

132
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,810
We can rent your room, ok? So you either
kick in, or you're out by the 1st, ok?

133
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,210
So get off your unicycle or whatever the hell it is
that mimes drive these days and get a goddamn real job. 

134
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,020
You know, it's a waste of time trying
to share anything with you two. 

135
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,740
Hello. 

136
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,470
Mm-hmm. 

137
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,610
Really?

138
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,320
Mm-hmm. 

139
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,540
Thank you very much. 

140
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,060
- What was that?
- That's Liz's attorney. 

141
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,840
She's suing me for divorce. 

142
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,840
I just never expected this from
her. She's not greedy, you know?

143
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,760
Possessive, maybe. Stubborn, sloppy. 

144
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,020
Christian, remember, the trick
is not to get emotional. 

145
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,720
It's our job to make a rational appeal
to her better nature, and... holy shit!

146
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,140
- Holy shit what?
- She hired Roger Payne. 

147
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,490
With a "y, " but the meaning is the same. 

148
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,610
How bad could it be? The guy's blind. 

149
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,710
So is justice. 

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,450
Look, this is ridiculous. I mean, come on, Liz. 

151
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,390
We can let the lawyers argue about
this, or we can settle this as friends. 

152
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,590
What do you say?

153
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,880
I never meant to hurt you. 

154
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,270
I... I think that you should be compensated
for everything that I put you through. 

155
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,680
Here. I hope this is enough. 

156
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,370
Hmm. $250, 000. 

157
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,000
Should cover your legal fees, Mrs. Troy. 

158
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,370
Mrs. Troy? We were married 5 minutes. 

159
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,030
Yes, well, in the course of those 5 minutes, Mrs. Troy
gave up her residence and half of her income. 

160
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,580
- I thought I was dying. 
- Is that why you put everything in her name?

161
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,820
You what?

162
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,840
I was taking care of Wilbur, you
know? I was trying to be responsible. 

163
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,640
Well, I'm sure you want to continue to be responsible
by settling with Mrs. Troy 50% of all personal property

164
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,690
and half of your interest in McNamara/Troy. 

165
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,680
What the hell are you smoking?

166
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,920
She can't do that. 

167
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
Canshe do that?

168
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,310
Is it in her name?

169
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh, I get it. 

170
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,620
I get it. This isn't a negotiation; this is a gang rape. 

171
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,370
- Welcome to California. 
- Jesus, Liz, I can't believe you'd stoop this low. 

172
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,220
- You're fired. 
- Ah. Afraid not,Ddr. Troy. 

173
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,560
You can't fire her until the case is settled. 

174
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,890
It's the law. 

175
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,390
Come on, Lizzie. Say something. 

176
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,860
You should have gotten a prenup. 

177
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,360
It's cheaper not to fight. 

178
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,520
I just think you're in denial if you
assume it's not gonna cost you. 

179
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,800
There's nothing wrong with being in denial, my
friend. Our whole careers were built on it. 

180
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,360
And let's just forget about that crap, ok?

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,730
We just got to relax, drink some beer,
and enjoy the water for the day, all right?

182
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,040
Uh, what's all this?

183
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,700
What?

184
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,950
- They seized my boat. 
- You're kidding. What for?

185
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,250
You know, I missed a few payments
here and there, but... 

186
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,960
Jesus. They're saying they'll auction it off

187
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,840
if I don't pay the balance by
the end of the month. I mean... 

188
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
- You better sell it. 
- I can't sell it. 

189
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,700
This is the only thing that isn't in Liz's name. 

190
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,490
Jesus!

191
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,580
I might have to live here
if she gets the house. 

192
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,240
I'll just take some money out of the
business, you know? Just to cover me for now. 

193
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,070
If you borrow more, you lose your credit
rating, and then you're really worth nothing. 

194
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,760
Then I'll get some money from you, all right?

195
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,570
Just front me 6 months for
the rent on the Malibu house. 

196
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,640
Uh, 

197
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,300
you know, now might be a good time
to give you notice. I'm moving out. 

198
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,970
Things have been good with Teddy, and
we're talking about getting a place. 

199
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,970
What?

200
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,700
Christian?

201
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,710
Dr. Mike Hamoui was the Miami plastic
surgeon that Christian had

202
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,420
not seen since their homoerotic
shower encounter two years ago. 

203
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,990
Hey, I heard you guys
were out here now, too!

204
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,370
Mike, remember my partner Sean McNamara?

205
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,740
Yeah, yeah, of course I remember. 

206
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,290
You know, I was just going to take the "Reverie"
out for a spin. You guys want to join me?

207
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,480
Hey.

208
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,030
- Nice boat.
-Thanks. 

209
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,030
You guys want to get some grub?

210
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,190
- Yeah, sure. 
-Yeah. 

211
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,440
Yeah, I can go about 2, 000 miles without
having to stop in this bad boy right here. 

212
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,140
Most boats, you know, go
as far as, like, Cabo. 

213
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,070
We went to Acapulco last year
with the girls. It was a great trip. 

214
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,360
How many feet is it?

215
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,140
About 102. 

216
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,500
Yeah, I was thinking about
getting one this big, but, uh, 

217
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,300
they're a bitch to park. 

218
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
True, that. 

219
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,260
Gives the girls, though, plenty
of room to spread out. 

220
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,640
Sienna, honey, you're frying yourself again. 

221
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,700
Go put on the sunscreen that
I gave you, huh? Thank you. 

222
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,110
So, Mike, you have your
own practice out here now?

223
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,290
Yeah!

224
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,870
After I sold Christian's condo and made a huge
profit, I decided to travel around, become a pod surgeon. 

225
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,060
I work for myself now, do surgeries. 

226
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,630
Just don't keep an office. 

227
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,190
Man, do I love L.A. 

228
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,300
I don't get it. A pod surgeon?

229
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,950
Yeah. I find a practice and I pay 10% of
my profits to uset heir surgery suites. 

230
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,220
There's no strings attached, I have
no overhead. It's a win/win for everyone...

231
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,340
Thank you, honey. 

232
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:36,060
Only seconds passed before Sean and
Christian proposed a similar deal to Mike. 

233
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:43,570
Bringing him into their business as a pod surgeon
would help ensure botht heir financial futures. 

234
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,210
- I think it's really... 
- Mike was happy to accept. 

235
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,450
I know every year there's a new high-tech trend in
exercise, but nothing can compare to the kettle bells. 

236
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,690
They originated in Russia in 1704. 

237
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,670
Obviously the kettle bells are not a trend. 

238
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,870
The beauty of the kettle bell is that it's
a combination of strength and cardiac... 

239
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,680
Um, we're short a small reef retractor. 

240
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,420
I gave mine back to Linda. Where's yours?

241
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,030
I gave it to Linda. 

242
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,330
You have any idea what the hell this is?

243
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,110
A, uh, small reef retractor. 

244
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,900
Oh, nice, Sean. 

245
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,970
Oh, God. I'm sorry. 

246
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,560
- I haven't been sleeping well. 
- You know what?

247
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,840
I'm under a lot of stress, too, right?

248
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,280
But you don't see me opening us up to
a malpractice suit that could bury us. 

249
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,020
Hey. 

250
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,570
What's going on with you?

251
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,890
Don't say nothing. 

252
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,140
Meticulous Sean McNamara does
not screw up a tummy tuck. 

253
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,010
I haven't been able to sleep. 

254
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm thinking about my kids a lot. 

255
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,210
It's Conor's birthday. 

256
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,270
He's there, I'm here, and it sucks, but I
don't want to burden you with all this. 

257
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,110
Hey, nothing about your life is
a burden to me, all right?

258
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,460
I love you. 

259
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,180
Oh... 

260
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,610
your sleeping pills. 

261
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,580
I'm surprised you have not
written a scrip for yourself. 

262
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,550
I don't want to do that. 

263
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,420
Pills scare me. 

264
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,460
I don't even take advil, especially after
I was rushed to the hospital a few years ago. 

265
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,890
Ecstasy. 

266
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,370
Yeah. I knew you'd like that. 

267
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,330
You know, there's a beautiful resort. 
It's been renovated. It's up in Ojai. 

268
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,630
We could go away for the weekend. 

269
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,170
It's only an hour away. 

270
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,520
What happened to the girl who didn't give a shit
about all these conventional bourgeois trappings, huh?

271
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,610
Now it's all about weekends
away, his and her massages. 

272
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,720
Hey, I'm just trying to find a
way to make you feel better. 

273
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,330
If you're not interested in that,
just forget I said anything. 

274
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,730
Anything. 

275
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,520
sorry, but Dr. Hamoui is booked
solid for the next two weeks. 

276
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,050
His next availablea ppointment
is on the 15th. 

277
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,640
Mike, where's the couch?

278
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,790
Don't worry, fellas. It's all safely in storage, 

279
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,170
and this stuff won't cost you a penny. 

280
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,750
Feel free to use it as much as you like. 

281
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,450
I figured you wouldn't grab that doughnut
with these machines staring at you. 

282
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,060
You know what? We don't need anybody
telling us how to take care of ourselves. 

283
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,780
That's not why we brought you in here. 

284
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,060
I'm sorry. 

285
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,760
I'll have the equipment
gone by the end of the day. 

286
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,650
No, the equipment can stay, Mike. 

287
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,630
What we want to talk about is
the 20 patients out in thelobby. 

288
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,550
- That was fast, right?
- What did you do?

289
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,200
It's all about creating a niche
market and then selling yourself. 

290
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,780
Business 101, fellas. 

291
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you mind if we sit in
on one of your consults?

292
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,010
Yeah. 

293
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,580
Will they be assisting in the surgery?

294
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,930
Absolutely not. 

295
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,810
They're excellent surgeons, but

296
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,950
I'm the only doctor who lays
a hand on any of my patients. 

297
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,530
They're just here to consult. 

298
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,470
Good. 

299
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,900
My friend Lindsey Thompson... 

300
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,030
she said you're the best. 

301
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,320
She said her vaginal
rejuvenation saved her marriage. 

302
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,280
I remember Lindsey. 

303
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,460
How many kids do you have?

304
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,660
3, all boys. 

305
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,580
My youngest, Derek... 

306
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,450
he was a very hard birth. 

307
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,150
I needed two episiotomies, 

308
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,920
and, well, things haven't been the same

309
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,430
down there since. 

310
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,900
There are thousands of women
just like you out there. 

311
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,340
It's exactly why I've
stream lined my practice. 

312
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,440
One procedure done right... 

313
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,760
vaginal reconstruction. 

314
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,590
It's brilliant. 

315
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,320
Do you realize, most vaginal reconstructions
take less than 20 minutes to perform?

316
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,680
And they cost 15 grand a pop. 

317
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,410
No wonder he's raking it in. 

318
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,130
We can do this, Christian. 

319
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,680
We're better surgeons than he is. 

320
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,640
How often do you and your
husband have sex, mrs. Brett?

321
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,490
I understand, 

322
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,540
but you don't have to be ashamed. 

323
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,210
I know this is unorthodox, 

324
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,270
but I want you to feel comfortable with me. 

325
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,720
I have nothing to hide, 

326
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,810
- and neither should you. 
- Lindsey said you might dothis. 

327
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,790
He's selling sex. 

328
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,240
We can do that. 

329
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,830
Damn straight. 

330
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,030
I was in "Playgirl."

331
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,550
Oh, it all sounds so good, but

332
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,930
our insurance won't cover the procedure. 

333
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,840
You think you don't deserve this. 

334
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,210
I'm sorry, but I got to call bullshit on that one. 

335
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,350
You just need to find a way
to reclaim your sexuality. 

336
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,940
Is there a better way than to make the
tool with which you express that sexuality

337
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,650
look and feel the way it did
when you were in your 20s?

338
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,010
I want you to know, 

339
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,560
this isn't just another surgery to me, 

340
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,840
and I'm not some high-school kid who
thinks that every vagina is the same. 

341
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,880
Yours is different. It's... 

342
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:22,450
special, and I'm gonna get
to know it inside and out. 

343
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,850
When's you next appointment?

344
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,920
We can't just start stealing Hamoui's clients. 

345
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,770
We need his 10% to keep the electricity on. 

346
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,160
So, we'll come to him with aplan, 

347
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,490
include him in on it. 

348
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,010
Well, we're the experts. 

349
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,210
He'll look like a novice next to us. 

350
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm telling you, 

351
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,270
there are hundreds of thousands
of women who need this. 

352
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,440
That's a lot of untapped vagina. 

353
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,420
How you planning on reaching them, 

354
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,900
crazy Sean's cross-country gyno tour?

355
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,970
No. Better. 

356
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,310
We need to call Kimber first. 

357
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,830
Christian, wake up. Hey, hey, wake up. 

358
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,120
Jesus, it's 2:00 in themorning. 

359
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,110
Just because you can't sleep, 
doesn't mean I shouldn't. 

360
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,380
It's on right now. Come on. Get up. 

361
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,900
Los Angeles... land of the beautiful people, 

362
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,320
where dreams always come
true and fantasy is reality, 

363
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,400
where you're as young as you feel
when your partner is inside of you. 

364
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Hi, I'm Dr. McNamara of
McNamara/Troy plastic surgery. 

365
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,090
These days, there are so many
options for male sexual gratification, 

366
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,380
but fewer choices for our fairer sex. 

367
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,210
I'd like to tell you about a new technique

368
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,610
we've developed called the vaginal uplift. 

369
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,030
According to Masters and Johnson, 

370
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,520
sexual satisfaction is due
to the amount of frictional

371
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,150
forces generated during intercourse. 

372
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,320
sweetie. 

373
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,890
This simple out patient procedure restores

374
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,450
the architectural integrity of the vagina. 

375
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,930
It takes under an hour, andin just days, 

376
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,520
both you and your partner will be enjoying
a whole new level of sexual satisfaction. 

377
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,680
Hi. I'm Kimber Henry, actress. 

378
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,360
Some of you may remember me from
my work as an adult film star. 

379
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,230
After I retired, I gave birth to my babygirl. 

380
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,860
I was having trouble reaching orgasm. 

381
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,990
That's when I decided to go see
the doctors at McNamara/Troy. 

382
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,920
Tell us what you don't like about your vagina. 

383
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,800
They were respectful, relaxed, 
and informative. 

384
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,160
They asked me to tell them exactly

385
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,550
what I was hoping for and
how I wanted to look and feel. 

386
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,930
Mm, and the exam was gentle and discreet. 

387
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,590
If you call and book your
consult in the next half-hour, 

388
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,710
we are offering a 6-installment
fee, payable over the next year. 

389
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,760
But don't take it from us. 

390
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,450
Listen to some of our satisfied customers. 

391
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,960
I felt a lot of shame when
my significant other told me

392
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,180
that my vagina reminded him
of a roast beef sandwich, 

393
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,000
but sincemy vaginal uplift, 

394
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,280
I feel more attractive and more confident, 

395
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,950
and the bonus is no pesky incontinence
when I swing that golf club. 

396
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,180
I feel like a 20-year-old
on the green again. 

397
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,810
You guys are great. 

398
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,450
Yes!

399
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,940
Yeah. That's the way to go. 

400
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,160
- Right?
-  Yes!

401
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,710
It's a winner. 

402
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,470
Well done. 

403
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,180
Ok. Did you brush your teeth?

404
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,530
Did you get all that nasty cotton
candy out of your mouth, huh?

405
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,910
Let's see. 

406
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, my goodness, have you ever seen
cleaner teeth in your whole life?

407
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,020
No. 

408
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,460
Nighty-night, sweetie. 

409
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,040
Can we go to the zoo nextweek?

410
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,000
Of course you can. 

411
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,750
Aunt Lizzie is your buddy, right?

412
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,150
Right. 

413
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,560
Right. 

414
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,740
I love you, auntie Liz. 

415
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,350
I love you, sweetheart. 

416
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,550
Ok. You go to sleep. 

417
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,460
Love you. 

418
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,580
You sure you have to leave sosoon?

419
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,830
I made your favorite... mushroom risotto. 

420
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,150
- I thought maybe you could... 
- I lied about liking your risotto. 

421
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,860
It tastes like gruel. 

422
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh, well, maybe you could stay for a drink. 

423
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,720
Oh, come on, Lizzie. It's us. 

424
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,210
Don't you dare use that word. 

425
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,840
Why? There's always gonna bean us. 

426
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,660
If there's one thing I've learned
about life, it's that it's fragile. 

427
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,140
Relationships like ours
are rare, weird but rare. 

428
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,400
I don't want to lose you. 

429
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,330
Neither does Wilbur. 

430
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:50,120
Come on. Let's take the boxing gloves
off just for a minute for his sake. 

431
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,270
I got a 1995 Chateau Mandeville. 

432
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,610
Is it expensive?

433
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,600
This is a $400 bottle of wine, sweet thing. 

434
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,920
Well, then I'll take half of it. 

435
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,130
Oh. That's what I've always loved about you. 

436
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,410
Is it?

437
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,050
Is that what you loved
about me, my sense of humor?

438
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,830
Because it's been a long time
since I laughed about anything. 

439
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,500
You've pretty much wrung
all the joy out of me. 

440
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,780
Tell me what I can do to make it up to you. 

441
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,260
You're gonna make it up to me, all right. 

442
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,620
That's why I hired roger. 

443
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,970
I'm not talking about money. 

444
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,740
That lawyer you hired, he's scum. 

445
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,270
You really think that cleaning me
out is gonna make you feel any better?

446
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,270
Yes. I do, and you know why?

447
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,120
Because you can't keep treating
people like toilet paper. 

448
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,370
You can't keep wiping your ass with them

449
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,620
and flushing them like they're disposable. 

450
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,510
I used to have such scorn for
those women who fell all over you. 

451
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,410
I thought they were all empty-headed
bimbos, the way they'd cry over you, 

452
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,570
but, you know, I see them differently
now because I became one of them, 

453
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,040
and I am gonna stand up
on behalf of all of us

454
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,080
because I am not gonna
let it be so easy for you. 

455
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,940
I am not gonna allow
you to break my heart and

456
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,280
- then not suffer the consequences. 
- Oh, stop being such a drama queen. 

457
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,700
I mean, serious, your heart is gonna be fine. 

458
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,340
Your dance card is gonna
be twice as full now

459
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,670
you've discovered the joys of
dick. I mean, let's face it. 

460
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,810
-  Face what?
-  Face the fact that yours truly here, ok, 

461
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,860
I found your g-spot. 

462
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,370
What the hell are you doing with it?

463
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm wasting your money, Christian. 

464
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,880
And to think I was such an idiot that I
felt bad coming over here, wringing you dry. 

465
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,750
Lizzie, come on. Just calm down. 

466
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,870
You know what'll calm me down?

467
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,160
A boat, yours. 

468
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,490
Don't you even think about it. 

469
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,450
Oh, you can kiss that goodbye, 

470
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,540
and when you're sitting here and
you're cutting out your little coupons, 

471
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,680
I want you to think of me partying

472
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,400
on my hot, floating dyke bar... 

473
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,640
the Lesboat. 

474
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,850
Once we saw your infomercial on tv, 

475
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,540
we had to come in. 

476
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,880
Yeah. Mrs. Hoberman, tell me what
you don't like about your vagina. 

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,180
Her vagina is fine. 

478
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,290
It's better than that. 

479
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,040
We'rehere for don. 

480
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,010
Yeah. I want one of those 6-pack surgeries. 

481
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,430
Well, the surgical term
is abdominal etching, but... 

482
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,320
Our infomercial was about
vaginal rejuvenation. 

483
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,530
No. I know, but you know the scene

484
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,050
where you're playing volleyball
with the other guy, Dr. Hamoui?

485
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,120
Yeah. Well, seeing you two
with your shirts off next to him

486
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,390
made me realize how much I let myself go. 

487
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,350
What?

488
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm changing locks by tomorrow, right?

489
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,900
You either pay your share
of the rent by sundown, 

490
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,530
or you can sleep on the beach
with all the other freaks. 

491
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,890
What can I get you?

492
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,670
Small or large, Marcel?

493
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,730
It's $1. 08. 

494
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
You need 8 more cents. 

495
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,630
No money, no coffee. 

496
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,610
This ain't a charity. 

497
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,830
You can't pay, go someplace else. 

498
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,090
Leave before I call a cop. 

499
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,590
Let go, you freak. 

500
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,020
Now you're gonna pay for that. 

501
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,020
Ok, ok. You can have your dollar back, ok?

502
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,850
Ok, ok. Ok. 

503
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,240
Here. 

504
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,930
Dr. Troy, you do realize that your being here

505
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:49,210
places me inviolation of the legal
code of professional responsibility. 

506
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,970
You recognize my cologne. 

507
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,760
Just give me 5 minutes of your time, 

508
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,240
and if you don't like my proposition, 

509
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,630
you never saw me. 

510
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,080
all right. You have 5 minutes. 

511
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,480
I'll give you 250 grand

512
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,290
now and another 250 if you convince

513
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,230
Liz cruz to drop the case. 

514
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,570
Dr. Troy, this is a breach of ethics. 

515
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,300
It is against everything that I stand for. 

516
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,420
Besides, it would take
more than a tawdry bribe to

517
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,220
get me to jeopardize a
lifetime of legal practice. 

518
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,510
How much, then?

519
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,530
Take off your pants. 

520
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,610
Excuse me?

521
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,710
My secretary tells me you're an adonis. 

522
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,610
I'd like to know what an adonis
sounds like when he jerks off. 

523
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm sorry. What?

524
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,540
Masturbate. 

525
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,220
Pleasure yourself in front of me, 

526
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,320
describing to me exactly what
you're doing stroke by stroke. 

527
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,920
Once you bring yourself to
climax, I will accept your offer, 

528
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,360
and I wil lconvince Mrs. Troy
that we cannot win the case. 

529
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,110
Gee, what about your ethics code?

530
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,050
I don't think that this is
covered in the aba handbook. 

531
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,090
Besides, I can always
claim that I never saw you. 

532
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,200
So, you're a pervert. 

533
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,740
Dr. Troy, your proposition requires

534
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,540
that I compromise myself on your behalf. 

535
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,120
This is simply quid pro quo. 

536
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,860
- Your 5 minutes are up. 
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no. Wait. Just, uh

537
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,530
Ok. 

538
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,260
There. Pants are off. 

539
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,760
Lair. 

540
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,090
Don't worry. No one can
see through the windows. 

541
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,910
Whatever. 

542
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,450
That's better. 

543
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,580
Touch your dick, Dr. Troy,
and describe it to me. 

544
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,790
Feels great. It's very hard. 

545
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,650
We're not in a courtroom now, Dr. Troy. 

546
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,270
I want more than just the facts. 

547
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,870
Paint me a picture, how your
hand feels as you touch it. 

548
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,810
Take off your briefs. Let yourself breathe. 

549
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,680
This is ridiculous. 

550
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,170
I'll see you in court. 

551
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,010
Good luck. 

552
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,110
You know, I did lose a case once... 

553
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,910
Yeah. 

554
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,330
But unlike you, I wasn't able
to make him take his pants off. 

555
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,610
That's when I knew he had me. 

556
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,460
Let's look at the bright side, partner. 

557
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,130
At least Mr. Hoberman's 6-pack
will bring in some income. 

558
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,470
And maybe Christian can take his
share and get a gym membership. 

559
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,820
You got to do something
about that gut there, tubby. 

560
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,840
Liz, that's enough. 

561
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,100
I know, and isn't it great?

562
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,190
Because I can say whatever I
want to, and he can't fire me. 

563
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,820
You know, Sean, I'm thinking
we're done with hoberman here. 

564
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,260
We should turn our fat-sucking
wand onto Liz's huge ass. 

565
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,760
All right. Enough!

566
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,750
Has it occurred to either of you the
effect you're having on Switzerland here?

567
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,540
I stay up late nights trying to figure
out a way to help you two make amends. 

568
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,620
Deal with your hurt feelings and
grow up. I'm sick of this shit. 

569
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,650
Ok. I am so sorry, Sean, 

570
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,980
but from a medical viewpoint, 

571
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:57,250
this looks more like lumpy oatmeal
than it does a body by jake. 

572
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,510
Dr. Hamoui, 

573
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,850
could you come here and help
out Sean and Christian, please?

574
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,940
Hey, you guys got a patient
of your own. That's awesome. 

575
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,810
How may I be ofservice?

576
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,000
Could you please just lift
up your shirt and show them

577
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,830
what the end result is
supposed to look like?

578
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,800
- Oh. 
- Thank you. 

579
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,300
It was in that moment that
Sean and Christian realized

580
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,130
they had lost the greatest
luxury of them all, 

581
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,230
something more important
to them than money... 

582
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,280
their youth. 

583
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,290
Give me a 20 blade. 

584
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,080
What for?

585
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,790
I want to cut Liz's tongue out. 

586
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,400
Ok. Here it is... 

587
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,990
aunt dottie's famous garbage salad. 

588
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,880
I hope aunt Dottie's garbage didn't
include coffee grounds and sour milk. 

589
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,020
No. Garbage salad

590
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,630
is whatever is still good in your fridge plus

591
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,540
fresh lettuce, hard-boiled egg, 
and a special lemonade dressing. 

592
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,120
Mm, this is really good. 

593
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,770
I'm not kidding. 

594
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,720
It's as good as a $50 lobster in my book. 

595
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,890
I don't know what I was thinking, 

596
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,010
all my obsessing on

597
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,660
expensive resorts and honeymoon suites. 

598
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,290
I would rather be here
eating garbage salad

599
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,280
with you on your balcony
than anything else. 

600
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:40,840
You know, I was thinking about Christian, 

601
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,100
his little legal nightmare with Liz, 

602
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:53,320
and I don't mean to
get ahead of anything

603
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:04,440
but I want you to know
I would sign a prenup. 

604
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,010
I don't want your money. 

605
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,570
I just want you. 

606
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,240
Well, I would never ask that of you. 

607
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,240
Hey, we're in this for love, you and me. 

608
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:23,580
Christian and Liz had some unusual
issues going into their marriage. 

609
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,300
Could you see us spending our lives together?

610
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,320
I could. 

611
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,140
Sean McNamara, will you marry me?

612
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,790
Yes. I will. 

613
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,930
While some more optimistic analysts predict

614
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,470
that the downturn is finally ending, 

615
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,310
this financial voice of authority
believes it will be a long time

616
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,850
before Americans can sleep soundly again. 

617
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:14,480
Dr. Mcnamara, I know
what I want for breakfast. 

618
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,640
Sean?

619
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,370
Sean?

620
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,690
Sean?

621
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,130
Sean, wake up, Sean. 

622
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,900
Ok. 

623
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,420
Christian!

624
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,640
Christian!

625
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,910
Christian, get up!

626
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,170
Christian!

627
