1
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:04,309
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,235
I'm afraid I've never
done this before.

3
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:07,691
Paid for someone.

4
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:09,129
You're one hot mama.

5
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:10,785
I'm surprised you two never went for it.

6
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:12,481
I sort of assumed
that you were straight.

7
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:15,816
I know about your little tryst
with Julia, Dr. Troy.

8
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,319
You don't want to play this
game with me.

9
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:18,581
You're going to get yourself hurt.

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,814
I'm Mrs. Feeney.

11
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm from the Shelter drug
rehabilitation center.

12
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:24,234
Rehab?

13
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,362
You need professional help.

14
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:28,477
There's been a bed reserved for you.
You'll be there for six weeks.

15
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,555
When I come back,

16
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:32,009
Sean is going to know everything.

17
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,095
Why aren't you in your scrubs?

18
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:39,902
It's just another tit job.

19
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,658
****

20
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,964
What I try to say is that
it's just another tit job.

21
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,855
You can handle it.

22
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:48,166
I got Sally Hershberger at 10.

23
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,995
I got a manucure at 11.

24
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,886
And, I got official at noon.

25
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:56,360
Camera is a cruel mistress, my friend.

26
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:59,016
I can't have a hair cuticle *** police.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,105
I told you. I'm not doing a reality show.

28
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,770
Fiona worked very hard for this.

29
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,477
Because you pushed her, relentlessly.

30
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,038
Come on, Christian.

31
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,205
We already have enough exposure
through Hearts'n Scalpels.

32
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,710
Hearts'n Scalpels...

33
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,786
Dramas are going by the way of sitcom, my friend.

34
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,866
Into the shit of "reality is the future".

35
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:16,904
In fact, reality is the present.

36
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:18,408
All right.
No overpriced writers.

37
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:19,921
No actor to suck up, too.

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,318
It's exploitation
and I won't be involved in it.

39
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:25,392
The all point of those shows
is to make fools out of people.

40
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,215
Those people are foolish, all right?

41
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,484
We're different. We're doctors.

42
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:30,419
And we have the opportunity
to show people

43
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:31,803
how we operate.

44
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,407
You mean it's your chance
to be in the spotlight.

45
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,381
Yes Sean,
this is important to me, OK ?

46
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:38,794
I'm star and I'm tired
of feeling like a supporting player.

47
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:40,170
All right?

48
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:42,682
Look.

49
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:45,708
We'll make it interesting.
We'll... we'll make it classy.

50
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:48,461
It'll have to be much PBS than VH1.

51
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,417
All right. Go ahead. Do the show.

52
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,791
Just without me.

53
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,013
I can't.

54
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:59,052
Look, they're not gonna green light
the show without you in it.

55
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,301
They think you're some kind of draw
or something.

56
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,198
Sean...

57
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:08,698
Please?

58
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,120
Look, just do it for me.

Season 5 Episode 06
<i>Damien Sands</i>

62
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,584
Hi. I'm Dr. Christian Troy.

63
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,608
I'm a board-certified plastic surgeon,

64
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:10,696
and this show is
about me and my partner

65
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,284
and the fascinating world in which
we live and work.

66
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:18,781
While there are a number of programs
focusing on plastic surgery

67
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,843
Hearts 'n Scalpels, for example,

68
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,455
on which I play Dr. Peter casey...

69
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,826
Arterial hemorrhage, doctor!
He's going into shock!

70
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,451
None analyze the whys
and hows of the process

71
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:30,553
as much as look for the faux drama
in the situation.

72
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,990
We're doing this pilot to revel
the truth about plastic surgery.

73
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:37,493
Sean I have been together 20 years.
I'd say we've seen

74
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:40,493
up to 40,000 undressed women.

75
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,945
You could double that number if
you're talking about my personal life.

76
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,489
Every single one of them is special.

77
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,770
Every single one
of them is different.

78
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,583
I think you could go up to a double-D.

79
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,129
I like that.

80
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:56,098
I see "D."

81
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,652
Maybe even a double-D would be fine.

82
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,324
Double-D sounds delicious.

83
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,277
I think you should go down
to a double-D, sweetheart.

84
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,005
Can I go bigger?

85
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,295
I mean, I've always loved
the letter "H."

86
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:11,973
I even named my cat Heathcliff.

87
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,016
We'll focus on the health benefits
of plastic surgery,

88
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,453
which quite frankly all too often
are buried under media slander

89
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,400
that claims our industry is unnecessary

90
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,535
and caters only to the wealthy and vain.

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,152
Yeah.

92
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:30,581
I think everything's gonna change
for me now. Don't you, Dr. Mcnamara?

93
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,824
Ladies will be lin' up
to meet this stud.

94
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:38,152
We'll examine our patients' psyches
and their bodies,

95
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,251
ask them why they would undergo
a painful procedure

96
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,131
just to have their appearances altered.

97
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:46,588
I think the audience will find
their reasons very sympathetic.

98
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:49,721
The difference between
this reality show and others,

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,076
simple.

100
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,299
The others don't have me and Sean,

101
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,312
and in the end, that's
what this show is all about,

102
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:58,595
us.

103
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,310
And we're fantastic.

104
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:07,360
<i>Don't want no saggy bottom,
don't want no droopy eyes.</i>

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,382
<i>I'm like a piece of candy,
go up one more cup size,</i>

106
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:16,976
<i>everybody wants to look like me,
plastic fantastic.</i>

107
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:21,522
The most important thing
we do every day is floss.

108
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:25,418
Just kidding.

109
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,581
It's actually the first time
we meet a consult.

110
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:31,987
We, uh-- we say, "tell me
what you don't like about yourself."

111
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,534
it's a-- it's a line I came up with.
It's kind of our signature line.

112
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,755
Actually, I came up with it
in med school.

113
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:42,476
No, you didn't. You, uh-- I--
I came up with it,

114
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,438
Grubman's first consult.

115
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,183
I knew that she was a well
of self-hatred and, uh, she'd--

116
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,283
- she'd be on the table for years.
- It was in Weintraub's seminar.

117
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:55,320
You weren't even there that day.
You stayed in bed with a belly dancer.

118
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,781
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself?

119
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:04,936
Mr. Sands?

120
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:09,759
I don't like that the world we live in
rewards youth over experience.

121
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,768
You see, that's what's so great
about plastic surgery.

122
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,685
We have ability to give
people with experience

123
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,266
back their youth.

124
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,058
I'll never be 20 again.

125
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,204
I know that.
Frankly, I wouldn't want it.

126
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,187
20-years-olds have their heads
up their asses,

127
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:29,598
and they stick their dicks
in any moist hole they can find.

128
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,980
Even at 40, 45,

129
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:35,457
you think you know yourself
and what you're good at, but

130
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,521
you really don't, do you?

131
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:41,767
These types of patients
are quite common.

132
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,994
They're really just looking
for someone to talk to,

133
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:46,014
and sometimes the best that we can do

134
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:47,298
is listen

135
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:49,574
and advise them not to go
under the knife at all.

136
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,927
But you are here to talk about getting
cosmetic surgery, aren't you?

137
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,204
Yes, of course.

138
00:06:57,474 --> 00:07:01,653
I would like a neck tightening
and an eye-lift.

139
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,363
May I ask, Mr. Sands,

140
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:09,198
what type of business you're in?

141
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,315
I see you left it blank
in your questionnaire.

142
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:16,186
Oh, I'd rather not divulge
that information.

143
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:20,115
Knowing your profession
can be quite helpful

144
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,113
in planning your recovery schedule.

145
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,059
Blurred vision, for example, is a common
side effect after a blepharoplasty.

146
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,796
- An airline pilot or a truck driver--
- That's not a concern.

147
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,356
Most of my work is-- uh, it's

148
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,441
done in the dark.

149
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,919
So you're a vampire.

150
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,592
No, Sir.

151
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:44,069
More like a Marquis de sade,
a Casanova, a libertine.

152
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:47,165
Naturally I was shocked when my partner
informed me he believed

153
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,156
our consult was a male escort.

154
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:52,318
I don't like to judge, but really,

155
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,843
of all the people out there
we should be helping,

156
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,587
I'd have to say that
a male prostitute is

157
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,300
pretty far down the list.

158
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,110
Most of the time, I would have
to agree with Dr. Troy,

159
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:04,872
but there was something
about this patient

160
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,877
that makes him quite a unique case,

161
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,586
something I don't believe has
ever been on television before.

162
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,426
I don't want any drugs in my system
during the operation.

163
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,146
I've been clean for 20 years, and I'd--
I'd like to keep it that way.

164
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,410
We practice western medicine, Mr. Sands.

165
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,767
Pharmacology is necessary in anesthesia.

166
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,473
Well, it's not a problem for me, Sean.

167
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,223
If he wants to feel the pain,
I say we go for it.

168
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:31,644
I assume you're looking for a more
holistic, alternative approach.

169
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,027
Acupuncture.

170
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,886
I love all this California,
new age crap.

171
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,865
It's hilarious to me to think that
you can stick a needle in your head

172
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,581
and that your whole body's
gonna go numb. You know? It's--

173
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,562
it's just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

174
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,153
If he signs a release

175
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,484
and our staff anesthesiologist
stands by ready to jump in,

176
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,501
I think it's a totally viable request.

177
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,294
I mean, more and more people
have been turning to eastern medicine

178
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,681
to treat a number of ailments,
and we do know an acupuncturist

179
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,347
who studied in china.

180
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,380
When Sean first asked me
to treat one of his patients,

181
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:07,000
I must admit I was quite surprised.

182
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,409
I have my degree
at the Nanjing university

183
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,627
of traditional chinese medicine, but

184
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:14,837
I've only assisted on acupuncture
anesthesia a few times.

185
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:19,222
What? Sean didn't tell you
she's his ex-wife's girlfriend?

186
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:24,531
I'm not sure why
my opinion matters, but,

187
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,251
well, I mean, no. Of-- of course
I-- I completely trust

188
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:32,366
Sean and Olivia, you know?

189
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:36,321
I-- I feel that this patient's
in very good hands.

190
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,692
Uh, I-- I think I should go
and check on him.

191
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,535
I'm gonna check on him now. OK.

192
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,594
She's still a little shy about P.D.A.

193
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,715
I'm not gonna talk about my ex-wife
and her personal life.

194
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,138
If you have any questions about medicine

195
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,901
or surgical procedure, I'm all ears.

196
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,277
Preparation is key before surgery,

197
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,335
so we're doing a dry run
of the acupuncture anesthesia.

198
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,466
Dr. Troy has volunteered
to be our guinea pig.

199
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,610
There are approximately 20 points

200
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,602
that can trigger
analgesia in a patient.

201
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,351
After examing Dr. Troy, I've isolated 3,

202
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:18,004
and about a half-hour before surgery,

203
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,633
we'll insert needles into
large intestine 4, liver 2, and heart 3.

204
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,941
You're not sticking any needles
into my heart.

205
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,334
- Oh, can I do it?
- Keep your hands off me, all right?

206
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:29,806
I don't wanna catch that, uh,
rash festering all over your face.

207
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,376
Sure, Christian and I joke around,

208
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,516
but we've been working together
for a long time.

209
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:37,191
We don't mean it.
We really love each other,

210
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:40,180
like Bill and Hillary,

211
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,615
Ike and Tina.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,814
Heart 3 is on the inside
of your elbow, Christian,

213
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:46,105
and the needles will only go in
about a centimeter.

214
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,714
- You'll barely feel them.
- OK.

215
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,603
Yep. Felt that.

216
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,947
These people are crazy.
The only reason I moved out here

217
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,165
was because they threw
a bunch of money at me.

218
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:03,618
And the golfing opportunities.

219
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,465
We'll slowly turn it up to 100 hertz
on the continuous mode.

220
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,715
- What's the electro-stimulator for?
- It calms the shen,

221
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,796
which is the patient's emotional
experience of the surgery.

222
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,718
That's right, Liz.

223
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,902
I took a couple of night classes
back in Miami.

224
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:26,082
I'll have the intravenous
anesthesia ready for Mr. Sands

225
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,266
if he feels anything, but I have

226
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:31,807
the utmost confidence in Olivia
and her techniques.

227
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:33,967
She's really great.

228
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:37,423
Close your eyes for me, Christian.

229
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,105
- Can you feel this?
- Of course I can.

230
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,027
How about you, Ollie?

231
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,920
What do you feel when
you're in the sack with Julia?

232
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,624
Can you feel her disappointment

233
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:48,534
when she reaches down
between your legs and

234
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:49,990
comes up empty-handed?

235
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,741
I can assure you, Christian,
that when we are undulating

236
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:56,173
in the sheets together,
there are no empty hands.

237
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:57,847
Heart rate is 60.

238
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:01,337
You know, I don't think
this is working, Sean.

239
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:03,943
I mean, it might make great tv, but...

240
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,310
how do you operate on a patient
who is screaming bloody murder?

241
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:08,664
Right?

242
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,331
You know, Olivia,
it's just a matter of time

243
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,228
before Julia gives up the gay ghost.

244
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,990
You know, our private life
is exactly that,

245
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,258
private.

246
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,411
It's for us to know and for you
to have masturbatory fantasies about.

247
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:24,074
I think she's talking to you, Lizzie.

248
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,053
Lay off, Christian.

249
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,931
You're the one who said she wasn't
a carpet cruncher, not me.

250
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,312
Liz? You don't think Julia's gay?

251
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,918
I think that people can fall in love

252
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,290
with whom-- whomever they want,

253
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,177
and I totally understand
why julia fell in love with you.

254
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,648
Patient's ready, Dr. McNamara.

255
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,964
I'm gonna go get her so that
she could take out the needles.

256
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,221
Good work there, Liz, all right?

257
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:56,921
I really don't think this is working.

258
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,935
You and Julia are a great couple

259
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,356
you belong together...

260
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,495
Julia is gay as a jicama salad

261
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,688
Christian is just trying to get
a rise out of you...

262
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:09,195
I know. It's just...

263
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,485
he can't just go around saying
stuff like that...

264
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,477
and not think there's going to
be consequences.

265
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:14,393
I know...

266
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,610
I'd appreciate it if you kept it on
the surgery and out of the bedroom.

267
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,184
You know? I mean,
you promised me this show would be

268
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,162
professional, not exploitative,
remember?

269
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,912
Just trying to spice things up
a little, all right?

270
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:25,500
You know Julia's not a lesbian.

271
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:28,347
That's why you're overcompensating
by having Olivia here.

272
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,172
You know, i'm trying to be supportive.
You're trying to break them up.

273
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:32,881
Look, if you want to
be supportive, all right,

274
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,096
then tell Olivia to take
a hike, all right?

275
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,372
And we'll get rid of grandpa.

276
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,672
I'll have 20 tit jobs in here
that'll have much more

277
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,641
eyes on the tv screen
than his saggy ass? All right?

278
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:44,683
Right.

279
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,535
The run-through was
a complete success.

280
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,535
How are you doing, Mr. Sands?

281
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,131
Just great, thank you.

282
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:58,831
Fully anesthetized, doctor.

283
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,086
Then let's get this started.
Hit it, toots.

284
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,666
Because the surgeries can take up to 6,

285
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:05,089
maybe even 8 hours,

286
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,364
we here at McNamara/Troy have

287
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,523
a tradition of playing music
to keep us dancing.

288
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,499
15-blade.

289
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:15,186
I'm really glad we're doing
this surgery, Dr. Troy.

290
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:18,379
I only wanna hear you speak
if there's any pain, Mr. Sands.

291
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:20,787
My competition's getting
more ferocious...

292
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:25,662
- Younger.
- We gonna have to sew your mouth shut?

293
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,752
Give me a bovie and a 2-prong hook.

294
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,942
Metz pickups, Linda.

295
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,627
While Dr. Troy lifts the skin

296
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:40,024
and cauterizes the bleeders,
i'll separate it from the muscles.

297
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,633
Why so much hostility, Dr. Troy?

298
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,072
What are you afraid of?

299
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,252
Certain information might come out,
perhaps?

300
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:06,109
- What are you doing?
- Needles are not working.

301
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,155
- He's perfectly sedated.
- I'm the operating physician.

302
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:12,297
It's my call. It's better to
be safe than sorry.

303
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:18,530
right, Sean?

304
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:26,987
I don't know what what was going
on between Dr. Troy and Mr. Sands,

305
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:31,547
but for some reason, christian has
a bee in his bonnet about that guy.

306
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,558
The patient is stable, doctor.

307
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,554
Maybe we can cut around
that last part, yes?

308
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:39,904
Eden, this is a sterile zone.

309
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,380
You got what you wanted, right?
They attacked me in rehab.

310
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:45,508
Get the hell out of here, or you'll go
someplace much worse than rehab.

311
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,325
You are a liar!
You put the pills in my bag,!

312
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,662
<i>Coming up next...</i>

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,808
You know, you just wanna
get rid of me again

314
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,387
because you don't want
your little secret out.

315
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,798
I have no secrets, Eden.

316
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:56,938
Really?

317
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,207
She's a drug addict and a liar,
and she'll do anything

318
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,859
she can to score some more pills.

319
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,510
Lying isn't gonna help anybody.

320
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,201
Who's the liar, Sean?

321
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,447
You want me to tell them about
our little masturbation party,

322
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,957
or they know about that, too?

323
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,834
She's a drug addict and a liar,

324
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,309
and she'll do anything--

325
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:14,871
Anything to get

326
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,930
some pills.

327
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,996
I don't give a crap about
that little bitch Eden

328
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,075
or about Julia and Liz and Olivia
and their muff-diving bullshit.

329
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,977
This show is supposed to be about me.
Me!

330
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,363
- How did this happen?
- How do you think it happened?

331
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:40,133
The real junkies in rehab attacked me.
And I'm sure you'll all be proud to know

332
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,247
that i'm a pack-a-day smoker.
Good job, everyone.

333
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,135
I'm sorry. Do we have to have
these things here? I mean,

334
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,932
this is a family matter.
Do we have to share it with the world?

335
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:48,952
Keep rolling.

336
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:50,663
Cigarette burns, probably second-degree.

337
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,606
Did a doctor at the center see these?

338
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:55,519
They don't care.
All they do is cash your check.

339
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:58,577
So you ran away before you even
got the treatment you need, right?

340
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:00,190
That's why I'm here, head.

341
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:03,634
Why don't you just stick some needles
in her, send her on her way?

342
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:04,893
Go to hell, Christian.

343
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,486
You just wanna get rid of me again,

344
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,930
because you don't want
your little secret out.

345
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,452
I have no secrets, eden.

346
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:12,396
Really? So then I guess Sean knows
that you already Julia.

347
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,169
20 years ago. We all know.

348
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,550
No, Sean. Like a month ago.

349
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,642
Lying isn't gonna help anybody.

350
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,156
Who's the liar, Sean?

351
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,577
Want me to tell them about
our little masturbation party,

352
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,264
or do they know about that, too?

353
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,596
What I believe Eden Lord
was referring to

354
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,582
is an exam I gave her after
a previous operation.

355
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,528
Another female was present.
It was completely clinical in nature.

356
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:49,104
My medical opinion, the little bitch
belongs in an institution.

357
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:52,092
I-- somewhere deep down,

358
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:55,348
I know that Eden's a good kid.

359
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,083
I just have no idea why

360
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,796
she hates me so much.

361
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:05,100
I'm sorry.
Can we-- just stop a minute.

362
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,097
This camera business is
really intrusive. Can I--

363
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,401
I signed the release form.

364
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:43,735
Liz.

365
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,284
Hey. Hi.

366
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,560
- Do you have a moment?
- Yeah. Sure. What?

367
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,201
Well, you know,
I know that it's not easy,

368
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:57,467
you know, being in a new city,
finding someone.

369
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,945
Yeah. Well, you tell me about it, huh?

370
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,284
You don't know how lucky
you are you found Olivia.

371
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,102
You mean before you did?

372
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:10,113
No, excuse me.
Can you stop taping me, please?

373
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,676
No, I'm serious.

374
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,825
No, stop taping me now,

375
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,083
or I'm gonna just leave.
Am I making myself clear?

376
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:22,711
I've watched you, Liz.
You can't keep your eyes off her.

377
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,359
We're friends, Julia.

378
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:26,641
You might not have gotten
that handbook yet,

379
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,577
but 2 lesbians can be just friends.

380
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,074
Then, I hope that you
and I can be friends and...

381
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,025
you can respect our boundaries.

382
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:38,959
And maybe you wanna talk to your
girlfriend about that instead of me.

383
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,845
Do they know about
the overhead cameras I had put in?

384
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:50,645
I don't think so.

385
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,639
But it's pretty sexy stuff, right?

386
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:57,442
3 lesbians fighting over
their turf is ratings gold.

387
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:03,768
This cream will help
your scars heal faster.

388
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,040
Why are you doing this?
Don't you hate me like everybody else?

389
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,345
I'm doing this because I'm a doctor.
This is what I do.

390
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:17,704
Now, you'll need some surgery.

391
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,482
Shit. Are they gonna scar?

392
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,625
Not if I'm your surgeon.

393
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,285
I lied earlier.

394
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,738
Julia and Christian

395
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,064
didn't sleep together.
I just...

396
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,387
I was so angry,
I had to say something.

397
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,434
I'll see you in a few days, OK?

398
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,175
We'll schedule some time
in the O.R. for your grafts,

399
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,726
and afterwards,
this whole thing can just be forgotten.

400
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,601
I don't give a crap
about that little bitch Eden

401
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,916
or about Julia and Liz and Olivia
and their muff-diving bullshit.

402
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,310
This show is supposed
to be about me. Me!

403
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:16,483
OK, why don't you just go
do something glamorous, you know, like

404
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,196
go shopping on rodeo drive.

405
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,354
- People eat that shit up.
- That's ridiculous.

406
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,108
I see that shit all the time.

407
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:23,287
Go have lunch at Fred Segal.

408
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,496
OK, that place is
just crawling with celebrities.

409
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:27,918
I just saw Jason Priestley having a nosh
there last week. That's good.

410
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:30,018
You came here with no contact
except for me, right?

411
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:32,642
I got you this job, and
that's the best you can come up with?

412
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,184
Where's Fiona?
Get Fiona on the phone?

413
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:35,763
She's unavail, Christian, OK?

414
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,359
Sean Penn just got back from Iraq.
She's got damage control to do.

415
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,496
Then you better come up
with something fast, Bliss, all right?

416
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,109
I'm sick of hearing about
this "Hearts 'n Scalpels" bullshit.

417
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:44,481
This is my show.

418
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:47,854
I know, I know, OK?
I will think of something, I promise.

419
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,366
When I found out my first assignment
as a Los Angeles P.R. Queen

420
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,833
was to work on the launch
of a reality show,

421
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,363
well, I was beside myself.

422
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:58,553
Here's the thing.

423
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:01,390
Reality shows are my jam, OK?

424
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,597
Charm school, project runway,
hey Paula...

425
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,704
the one where they spend
every episode

426
00:22:06,804 --> 00:22:08,937
convincing us
that Paula Abdul's just tired.

427
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:13,055
Well, I watch every one, OK?
I'm just obsessed.

428
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,474
So suddenly it came to me.

429
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:19,375
Who better to give Christian advice
on how to navigate a reality show

430
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:22,950
than the biggest star
in reality TV, right now?

431
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,486
Oh, that's right.

432
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,690
Ms. New York herself.

433
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,121
I'm sitting next to New York.

434
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,860
She's huge.

435
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,845
That's right, honey. I am big,

436
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:36,161
and I'll save your ass
from cancellation,

437
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,606
because I know
how this genre works.

438
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:43,858
And after we explained to Christian
about the whole New York phenomenon,

439
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,672
he really seemed
to get with the program.

440
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:47,641
New York gave it to him straight.

441
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,260
I love New York.

442
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,854
I'm just gonna cut to the chase
and give it to you straight.

443
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,205
You need to be
way more interesting, homeboy.

444
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:55,384
- Interesting?
- Like, seriously.

445
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:56,821
- Interesting?
- Yes.

446
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:59,039
See... come in.

447
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,088
- Interesting?
- Interesting.

448
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,574
I am interesting, all right?

449
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,369
If you want this show to go,

450
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:06,800
you are going to have
to create conflict,

451
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:08,496
be the center of controversy.

452
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,348
Controversy, conflict.
Oh, what do you mean,

453
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:11,613
so everybody can hate me?
Is that what you're talking about?

454
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,643
You know what?
Everybody is not gonna hate you.

455
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,682
Just don't take responsibility.

456
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,895
Deny, deny, deny.

457
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,934
And then, just move on
to the next thing.

458
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,158
- It's simple as that.
- Deny?

459
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:24,972
I think that
what New York is saying, Christian,

460
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,349
is that people have
very short attention spans,

461
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,883
so you just need
to listen to New York,

462
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,853
'cause New York knows
what's goin' on, OK?

463
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,051
You feelin' it?

464
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,951
Could you guys, uh,
just give me a second here?

465
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,599
I care about Julia, and...

466
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,161
I don't wanna see her get hurt.

467
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,169
You know,
I should never have let...

468
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,401
- What's goin' on here?
- ... Olivia anywhere near you.

469
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:24,471
You are a bitter, dried-up...

470
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,805
How we feelin, Mr. Sands?

471
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,701
I thought you had forgotten
about me, Dr. Troy.

472
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,257
- Or did you stay away on purpose?
- I heard you asked for some morphine.

473
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:45,548
What happened?

474
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:48,234
Acupuncture not the answer
you thought it would be?

475
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,958
There are some side effects
to morphine.

476
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,163
They include hallucinations,
delusions of grandeur.

477
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:56,402
This is not a healthy environment.

478
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,038
The peace and quiet
that acupuncture requires for success

479
00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:01,431
are nonexistent here.

480
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,295
Keep saying that, Mr. Sands.

481
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,009
If I develop an addiction
to these painkillers,

482
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,062
I'll be saying lots of things
to my lawyer.

483
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,863
To be fair,
you did request a service

484
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:15,141
that our acupuncturist
couldn't provide.

485
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:18,669
We've decided to eat the costs.

486
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:23,621
Your procedure is free of charge.

487
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,283
That seems fair.

488
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:36,978
Marvelous.

489
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,688
I could be 44 again,

490
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:43,571
- don't you think?
- 45 at the most.

491
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:46,431
Remove the wrinkles,
not the wisdom.

492
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,814
You and your partner
have done a very good job.

493
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,570
This puts me back on the game.

494
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,769
Will I be seeing you
on the playing field?

495
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,304
The only playing field I have
is that surgical table back in there.

496
00:25:58,532 --> 00:25:59,916
Let's keep it that way.

497
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,018
This town isn't big enough
for the both of us.

498
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:08,471
Doesn't he look fantastic?

499
00:26:09,691 --> 00:26:12,609
Patient satisfaction is a priority
here at McNamara/Troy.

500
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:14,248
Tell me,

501
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,596
are you satisfied, Mr. Sands?

502
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:20,683
Very.

503
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,444
<i>As it turns out,</i>

504
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,041
Dr. Troy is an excellent doctor.

505
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,180
He's not who I thought he'd be.

506
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,703
Actually I could probably
send him some work.

507
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,005
On second thoughts, maybe not.

508
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,620
He doesn't really seem
to need any help, now, does he?

509
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,365
While Eden lord was not originally
scheduled to be a patient,

510
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,872
she does need our help.

511
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:46,552
Her forearms were badly scarred
in an accident,

512
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:49,947
so we're gonna graft some skin
from the back of her thighs

513
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,906
and sew it onto her forearms,
here you can see what i'm talking about.

514
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,789
We pick an area of unaffected skin,

515
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:01,618
shave it off, and then roll it
through this machine here,

516
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:03,788
which creates a meshlike quality,

517
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:07,508
allowing the skin to expand
when sutured to the affected area...

518
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:09,026
Where are you?!

519
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:16,657
She's in here... goddamn it.

520
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:22,934
- Goddamn it, how could you?
- What are you talking about?

521
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:26,864
And of all the people that
you had to choose, Liz and here?

522
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,670
- Slow down, Julia.
- What, were you hoping...

523
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,584
- You don't know what you talking about.
- Oh, don't even, you know?

524
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:36,310
You know, I should never have let
Olivia anywhere near you.

525
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,782
You are a bitter, dried-up...

526
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,093
You looked me in the face,

527
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,560
and you told me that
"lesbians could be friends."

528
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:46,645
I mean, I just can't believe
that I fell for it.

529
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,035
OK, who told you what?

530
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,976
You weren't even there, Christian!
Come on. Get in here.

531
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,565
- Just get off me.
- Get in.

532
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:56,514
- Wasn't even there to see what, Liz?
- It's not her fault.

533
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,433
Don't blame Olivia.
Those were my lips.

534
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:01,590
You don't need to defend me, Liz.
I kissed her, OK?

535
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:05,909
I was hurt and confused
and in need of some kind of comfort.

536
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:09,180
Look, I screwed up, OK?
I screwed up, but so have you.

537
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,220
Look, I'm sorry, but you know,

538
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,737
when I told you
about the indiscretions

539
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:15,771
that I've had
since we've been together...

540
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:17,946
You know, I know I'm not perfect,

541
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,415
but I thought you understood.
I trusted you.

542
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:23,206
- I wish you'd trusted me.
- What... what indiscretions?

543
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,344
Listen, Liz, Liz, Liz,
don't interrupt people

544
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,768
when they're trying
to make a reconciliation, all right?

545
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,588
Nothing more.
It meant nothing.

546
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,355
God, you have been
so unavailable to me lately.

547
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:34,796
I... I don't know
if it's the cameras or what,

548
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,672
but sometimes when I'm with you,
I have never felt more alone.

549
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,737
Look, I just... can we...
Not here.

550
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,062
OK, OK. Turn it off.
The show's over. Turn it off.

551
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,797
<i>God, you have been
so unavailable to me lately.</i>

552
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:50,134
<i>I don't know
if it's the cameras or what,</i>

553
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:53,051
<i>but sometimes when I'm with you,
I have never felt more alone.</i>

554
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,946
<i>Look, I just... can we...
Not here. Please.</i>

555
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:57,452
<i>OK, OK. Turn it off.
The show's over. Turn it off.</i>

556
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:00,894
This is the cut they wanna air?

557
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:04,572
The producers love it.

558
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,967
They won't change a frame
and won't consider any edits.

559
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,263
- We're screwed.
- I knew we shouldn't do this.

560
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,438
I did this for you.
You fix it.

561
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,600
Oh, come on. Like you don't love
being Mr. Famous plastic surgeon.

562
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,505
There's a camera around these days,
you're like a heat-seeking missile.

563
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:19,767
I wouldn't be surprised

564
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,500
if I turn on the TV next year
and find you oncelebrity fit club.

565
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,762
I am not fat.

566
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:26,689
I'm in terrific shape,
and I don't need to go on that show!

567
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:30,207
- I have standards, you idiot!
- All right, all right. I'm sorry, OK?

568
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,020
I thought getting that TV show
would even the playing field.

569
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm sorry that I single-handedly
destroyed our reputation.

570
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,963
Well, nobody made me
sign the consent form.

571
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,323
I admit it.

572
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:47,844
I like getting attention.

573
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:51,637
After years in your shadow,
I liked being in the limelight.

574
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:56,171
I've become deeply superficial,
haven't I?

575
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,411
I've gone Hollywood.

576
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,901
- What are we gonna do now?
- We have to move back to Miami.

577
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,121
They have cable television
in Miami, too.

578
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,758
Then we can't shoot any more episodes.

579
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:10,939
- We're contracted to do 13.
- Well, then, we're screwed.

580
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:14,365
There's only one thing to do.

581
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:17,642
You're right.

582
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,152
We gotta hang Fiona and
that dumb-ass Bliss Berger

583
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,925
by their press-on fingernails.

584
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,210
I don't know what to say.

585
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,854
Then let me help.
Crawl back to Fiona

586
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,608
and tell her that you've both been fired
by McNamara/Troy.

587
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,696
The show is a complete embarrassment.

588
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:35,835
It's not about doctors.

589
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:38,427
It's about 2 sex-crazed lunatics
and their crazy family.

590
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,594
If people want to watch a cheesy soap,
they can watch "Hearts 'n Scalpels".

591
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,281
You hid cameras without our consent.

592
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,544
Sorry, but watching you guys interact

593
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:51,144
when you think no one's watching
is where all the action is.

594
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,593
Well, during surgery, fine,

595
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:54,746
but not with our wives
and children and friends.

596
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,782
This show will hurt people
in our lives.

597
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:58,584
And we have to do
12 more of these things

598
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,427
because we signed that consent form.
You didn't protect us.

599
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:02,810
You screwed us.

600
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,709
So you wouldn't agree
to any more reshoots,

601
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:07,869
- that sort of thing?
- No.

602
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:10,014
Well, then, fine.

603
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,548
Hey, good news.
The show's not happening.

604
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,106
I hope you're happy.
You could have become...

605
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,500
huge stars from this.

606
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:19,233
Wait a minute.
You got us out of it?

607
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:20,743
I didn't have to.

608
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,776
The network tested the show
this morning.

609
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,347
The network tested us?

610
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,055
How high'd we score?
Bet you we scored huge.

611
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,740
Actually, killer,
it was just the opposite.

612
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,366
Let's have a look.

613
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:35,017
The test audience rated you low,

614
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:38,753
on the likability scale, uh,
a 2 on a 1-to-10 scale.

615
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:41,338
And they thought
the tone of the show was,

616
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,826
and I quote, "pushing credibility."

617
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:47,770
Said one tester,
a Mrs. Lois Gene:

618
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:50,921
"This show jumped the shark
5 minutes into the pilot."

619
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:52,577
End quote.

620
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,402
The, uh, lesbians tested high, though.

621
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:57,190
They always do.
Guys find that hot.

622
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,934
What? This is bullshit.

623
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:01,898
We're hot!
You tell her, sean.

624
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,333
- So we're not picked up?
- Nope.

625
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,392
The show's not happening,
especially without reshoots,

626
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:11,902
so thanks for killin' my baby.
I appreciate it.

627
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:14,568
By the way, boys,

628
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:17,938
before you consider
firing myself and Ms. McNeil,

629
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:19,716
I suggest you wait a beat.

630
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,824
If this report gets leaked
to the bloggers, and it will,

631
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:25,509
you'll need somebody around
to do damage control.

632
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,773
- I thought we were kinda cute.
- Well, me, too.

633
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,004
How much you think
it costs for reshoots?

634
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:45,809
<i>But you know, when I told you</i>

635
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:49,191
<i>about the indiscretions that
I've had since we've been together...</i>

636
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,346
<i>you know, I-- I know I'm not perfect--</i>

637
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:52,677
<i>When I told you</i>

638
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:55,946
<i>about the indiscretions that I've had
since we've been together--</i>

639
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:58,046
<i>you know, I-- I know I'm not perfect,</i>

640
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:00,319
<i>but I thought you understood.
When I told you</i>

641
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,585
<i>about the indiscretions that I've had
since we've been together--</i>

642
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,748
<i>You know, I-- I know I'm not perfect,</i>

643
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,234
<i>but I thought you understood.
I trusted you.</i>

644
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,567
<i>I wish you'd trusted me.</i>

645
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:21,321
What I don't get is how you knew
about olivia and me,

646
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:23,717
and you were nowhere
around when we kissed.

647
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,383
Maybe a little birdie told me.

648
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,459
Maybe I have a hidden camera of my own.

649
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:31,025
Oh, yeah? Where did it happen?

650
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,296
In the ladies' bathroom.

651
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,667
Oh, you have a hidden camera
in the ladies' bathroom.

652
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:38,343
How else would I know
you have stretch marks?

653
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:44,078
Look, I admit I was shocked to find out
that Olivia kissed you first,

654
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:47,005
and I was even more pissed that
they didn't capture my reaction

655
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,462
on camera, because I think it would
have made for brilliant television.

656
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:52,944
But I'm not surprised that
Olivia made the first move,

657
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,144
because despite your flaws--
and you have many--

658
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:58,695
Trust me, you are still
a very cute little cupcake.

659
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:04,106
Oh, I am so happy those cameras
aren't around anymore. Aren't you?

660
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:07,816
We can finally get life around
here back to normal.

661
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:11,704
And in the spirit of normalcy,
I think you should insult me.

662
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:15,122
Oh, no, no, no. No, I am done
with name-calling, Christian.

663
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:17,145
Oh, come on, Lizzie. I just apologized.

664
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,631
You can't still be mad at me.
Besides, you're the one who kept lying

665
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,898
about your crush on Miss Muffin Muncher.

666
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:23,919
You know, Christian,

667
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,934
sometimes you have to lie
to protect other people's feelings.

668
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,391
You know I don't think
Julia's a lesbian,

669
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:32,030
but there's no reason
Olivia has to know that.

670
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,640
You're right.

671
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:38,761
I guess she would have
figured it out on her own.

672
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:40,192
You know, in a perfect world,

673
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:41,841
you'd be with Julia,

674
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:45,049
and I would ride off
into the sunset with Olivia,

675
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:48,095
but maybe that's not the way
it's meant to happen, huh?

676
00:34:57,986 --> 00:34:59,664
How are the arms?

677
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:01,561
They itch like hell, Sean.

678
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:09,009
All right. Let's, uh,
give the graft some air.

679
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:21,106
Hey, easy, easy.
You'll rip your stitches.

680
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:26,162
They look like they're healing well.
You just can't scratch like that.

681
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:36,634
What am I gonna do? My mom says
I have to go to public school now.

682
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:41,217
I think that could be good for you.

683
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:42,734
Are you insane?

684
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:44,891
I don't belong in public school.
I won't survive.

685
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,847
Where do you belong, then?

686
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,258
Nowhere, I guess.

687
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,498
Or maybe with you.

688
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,570
You're the only one who's even
pretended to be nice to me.

689
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:09,411
Pretty much everyone else
wants me to go to hell.

690
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,842
You need to get some rest.

691
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,428
Wait.

692
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,590
Will you stay with me,

693
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,775
just for a little while?

694
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:27,672
Maybe for a moment.

695
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,092
So is this it? You're moving out?

696
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,663
- Is that what you want?
- Of course not.

697
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:34,010
I want to be with you,

698
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:38,659
but first you need to realize
that who you are and what you are

699
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:41,095
is nothing to be ashamed of.

700
00:37:42,423 --> 00:37:44,220
Then why am I so scared?

701
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:50,061
Because-- I don't know.

702
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:52,767
You've only known one thing
your whole life.

703
00:37:53,392 --> 00:37:55,688
- Change is hard.
- Yeah.

704
00:37:55,808 --> 00:38:00,673
But it's not that.
I love being with you. It--

705
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:01,613
It's just...

706
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,427
You feel judged for being
a lesbian in public.

707
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:12,534
Why do you think so many of us
are still in the closet?

708
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:19,807
It takes a strong individual
to be gay in this world, Julia,

709
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:22,540
a strong personality.

710
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,955
You're very strong.

711
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:32,039
It's one of the biggest reasons
I fell in love with you.

712
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,078
I don't feel strong at all.

713
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,314
Trust me. You are.

714
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:48,071
It's just so much easier
when we're alone.

715
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,425
Well, the cameras have all gone.

716
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,222
Promise me something.

717
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:08,220
If I'm ever not being as open
as I should be,

718
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:13,142
let me know about it first
before you'd run to Liz.

719
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,294
I do promise, but

720
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:23,705
you need to give me the same respect
and stay out of Christian's bed.

721
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:06,143
When Eden burst
into the surgery suite that day,

722
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:08,270
do you believe anything she said?

723
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,225
Of course not.
Stupid little bitch'll say anything.

724
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,985
So you didn't put
those pills in her bag?

725
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:16,627
What? No, of course I didn't.

726
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:22,977
She told me she lied about
you and Julia sleeping together again.

727
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:29,592
I wonder why
she finally admitted she lied?

728
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,837
Guilt, I guess.

729
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:37,899
Maybe she felt like
too much damage had been done

730
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:41,331
and it was time to stop hurting people.

731
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:44,196
Maybe.

732
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:52,389
