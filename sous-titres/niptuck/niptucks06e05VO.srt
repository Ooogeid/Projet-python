2
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,091
My husband and I are with the kids.

3
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:07,026
I can't sleep in the campers anyway.
They're so cramped.

4
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,354
I need to go.

5
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:09,959
Sean!

6
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,668
I heard about you.
The mime robbing people.

7
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:17,506
Can you mime dead?

8
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:48,138
I can't see, for god's sake.
Linda, suction now.

9
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:54,533
It's me again.

10
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:56,395
Um, just call me.

11
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:00,546
- Your son's gonna be fine.
- Thank god.

12
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,780
He was very lucky you got him
out when you did.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,160
Another 15 minutes would have
been too late for all of you.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,392
Can I see him?

15
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,906
- No word from your wife?
- No. Not yet.

16
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:20,266
They'll need those for evidence.
Make sure you keep them.

17
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,706
It's for his own good.

18
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:24,039
I mean, he needs to learn
how to be a man.

19
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,568
Let's just save his life
right now and talk about

20
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,096
destroying it later.

21
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,281
Close him up.

22
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,250
It's about Teddy.

23
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,588
Where did you take her?

24
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,190
I want to see her.

25
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,735
We searched the woods near
the campground.

26
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,453
And what we found was a...

27
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,670
...a human heart.

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,195
Are you certain it's hers?

29
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,405
The DNA matched hair samples
from the camper.

30
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:34,807
We're gonna catch this bastard
before he does it again.

Sean

36
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:50,103
I'm gonna go in
and check on Matt.

37
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:53,306
And, um, there's someone
here to see you.

38
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,772
meep, meep!

39
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,157
Meep, meep!

40
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,911
The police really don't have
any idea?

41
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:18,726
And you never saw anyone
who could have...

42
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,262
We were sleeping.

43
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,787
Oh, thank god that Conor
and Annie are ok.

44
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,841
That's the most important thing.

45
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,077
You should take Matt's room
while he's recovering.

46
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,627
And I'm so glad you're here.

47
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:44,305
Well, if you need anyone to
help with the funeral arrangements,

48
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,263
- I'd be happy to do that with you.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:49,028
But I'm not staying, Sean.

50
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,406
Why?

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,414
I don't think that pretending

52
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,816
we're family right now is what
the kids need.

53
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:58,733
And with all this going on with Matt,
well, they've seen enough.

54
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,361
What's that supposed to mean?

55
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:02,142
Oh, Sean, I don't want to
fight you on this.

56
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:04,180
Fight me?
I thought you were here to help me.

57
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,560
I am. I just can't get over
the fact that you put our kids

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,992
in harm's way like that.

59
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:09,864
No, no.
You think this was my fault?

60
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:12,701
I think that your judgment
wasn't as it should have been.

61
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,455
Screw you, Julia.

62
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,685
Well, then what about Matt, huh?

63
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,533
I mean, he was living
in your house.

64
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,375
How could you not know
what was going on?

65
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:23,578
Mom, when this show's over,
can conor and I watch another?

66
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,794
- No.
- Yeah

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,140
You can watch one more,
and that's it.

68
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,290
You can do whatever you want.
I have a funeral to plan.

69
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,334
How's conor?

70
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,840
He'll be fine.

71
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,535
Annie?

72
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:50,486
Well, let's just say this visit
hasn't done a whole lot to

73
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,541
restore her sense of stability.

74
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:57,091
Oh, god. I keep telling myself
that he's a good kid.

75
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,833
That he's just finding himself.

76
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,774
We're not helping him by
coming to his rescue all the time.

77
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,141
I think we should go to the police.

78
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:08,623
You want me to say that it's
ok for my kid to go to jail?

79
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,859
Well, it might be the best
thing for him, you know?

80
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,167
I mean, it hasn't worked for him
coming out here, has it?

81
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,697
And let the prison system
teach him right from wrong

82
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,542
because I couldn't?

83
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,734
Maybe. I mean, just maybe.

84
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,873
It's not because of his parents
or his teachers or his school

85
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:26,041
or the freaks he calls friends.
I mean, it could be in his DNA.

86
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,877
You know, my dad was a rapist.
Maybe it skips a generation.

87
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,348
Don't say that.
He is a good kid.

88
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,504
No, Julia, he's not a good kid.

89
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,361
You just can't admit it because
the truth is too painful, all right?

90
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,606
But we need to do
something different

91
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,388
for his sake as well as ours.

92
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:44,293
I've contacted a lawyer and told
him that Matt's gonna turn himself in.

93
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:46,561
You know, since he was the only
one he managed to hurt,

94
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,596
maybe the judge will be
lenient on him, you know?

95
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,888
- And Sean agrees with you?
- No, Sean doesn't agree with me.

96
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,754
That's why I need your help.

97
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,426
You know it's the best thing for him.

98
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,060
I need your support.

99
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:09,485
He looks like an Angel,
doesn't he?

100
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:12,573
Looks can be deceiving.

101
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,725
You know, there comes a time you
have to surrender the idea

102
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,591
for who your children could be.

103
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,219
To the reality of who
they actually are.

104
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:43,532
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself, ms. Sullivan.

105
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,140
I like myself fine.

106
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,903
It's my sister Moira.

107
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,013
I want you to get her off my back.

108
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,002
I mean it off my back.

109
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,105
I promised my therapist I would
never call it "her" again.

110
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:06,523
This is Moira.

111
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,290
I absorbed her in utero.

112
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,738
She--it is--

113
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:14,568
I don't really know
the medical term.

114
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,003
A parasitic twin.

115
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,816
Yes. Except I'm not supposed
to use the word "twin" anymore either.

116
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:23,091
It's just a bunch of extra bone,
blood, and tissue mass.

117
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,036
See, that's her little leg,

118
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,919
And that's part of an arm.

119
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:33,368
Uh, is this the first time
you've considered removal?

120
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:36,862
Um, mother had planned
to have her--it removed

121
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:41,997
when I was no longer a toddler,
but by that time, she was Moira.

122
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:46,546
She was part of the family, and surgery
became something we kept putting off.

123
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,142
So she actually became real to you.

124
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,399
Mother lived in a powerful
fantasy world.

125
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,040
And her belief that Moira was
her other daughter took over our lives.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,062
And I was so young,
it just seemed normal.

127
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,616
Where was your father?

128
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:04,351
Did he just go along with this?

129
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,168
There was no father.
It was always just us.

130
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:11,005
She can make one and
one add up to 3, my mother.

131
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,851
I couldn't argue with her.

132
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:15,408
She was the source of everything
for me...

133
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:18,684
...all things good and
all things terrifying.

134
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:22,024
She used to make me play piano
for her and Moira.

135
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,571
Since I was the one
who was chosen to survive,

136
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,121
I felt like I owed it to them
to be doubly brilliant.

137
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,724
She projected her own little
world on to you

138
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,434
and never thought about
what that might do to you?

139
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,314
I call that child abuse.

140
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,601
That's amazing.

141
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:38,062
That's what my therapist says.

142
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:41,202
Mother's gone now.

143
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,596
And, um

144
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,283
I'm making my debut at Royce hall.

145
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,537
I never could play publicly before
because I looked like such a...

146
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,880
Well, you know.
You're looking at me.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,683
I want to wear an ivory gown
with bare shoulders.

148
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,026
I want to be seen as a real woman.

149
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,548
For so long, I tried to be
the good girl.

150
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,987
The good girl who survived
what they wanted me to be.

151
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,399
And now it's my turn.

152
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:19,349
Oh, no address books
or even some old mail.

153
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,843
Are you sure the movers
packed up everything?

154
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,887
No pictures, no records.
Nothing.

155
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,249
It's like Teddy just vanished
into thin air.

156
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,964
You know, maybe someone else
came to her condo and...

157
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:33,421
...cleaned it out
before we got there.

158
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,591
- Well, like who?
- I don't know. Some friend, relative.

159
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,555
Why don't you call them?

160
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:41,462
I-I d-don't know their names, ok?

161
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:44,098
You never met any of
her friends or family?

162
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,203
She was from Texas, Julia.

163
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,840
Well, she had very expensive taste in clothes.
We know that much about her.

164
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,210
- All right. If you're going to be disparaging...
- I didn't mean anything by it.

165
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,931
Yes, you did, all right?

166
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,305
You're insinuating I didn't know
very much about her,

167
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,251
how stupid could I have been,
that I didn't know anything.

168
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,330
Love is blind, Sean.

169
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,524
I mean, I'm the same way
with Matt.

170
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:11,392
After all the lies, the betrayals,
the drug addiction,

171
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:15,409
on and on and on, I just refused
to admit that he's a bad kid

172
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,806
or that I'm a bad parent.

173
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,354
You weren't a bad parent.

174
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,443
Yes, I was.

175
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,104
We both were.

176
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,576
And admitting the truth is
the first step to healing.

177
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:34,669
Ohh. I'm not saying it makes
the pain go away, but...

178
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,991
...god knows it helps.

179
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,597
I sucked as a father.

180
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:45,643
I was selfish and obsessed
with my career.

181
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,297
I never took the time
to get to know Matt

182
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,883
or Teddy.

183
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,307
It was easier to make them up.

184
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,151
Matt's a fugitive, Sean.

185
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,336
He needs to turn himself in
to the police.

186
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,808
We both know that, right?

187
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,120
Yeah.

188
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,537
Yeah?

189
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,699
Matt's gone, Sean.

190
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,725
Where do you think he is?

191
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:50,358
Holed up in some shitty
roadside hotel somewhere

192
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,421
figuring out how we're going to
bail him out again, like we always do.

193
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,424
I'm worried he might get an infection.
He hasn't healed yet.

194
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,085
Further proof that we should
have called the cops earlier, all right?

195
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,703
At least if he was in custody,
we'd know that he'd be

196
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,650
getting proper
medical attention.

197
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,834
- If anything happens to him...
- Sean, just go home. Ok?

198
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,434
Just go home.
Mourn your wife and your son.

199
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:12,677
I got it.

200
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,334
Do you think that her twin
ever had consciousness?

201
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:25,816
I mean, before she was absorbed
into Abigail's shoulder,

202
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,345
do you think she had a soul?

203
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,783
I prefer not to think about it.

204
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:31,967
I got to think about separating
Moira the mooch's Feeding vessel

205
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,730
from Abigail's subclavian artery

206
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,379
without losing Abigail.

207
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,577
Ten-blade.

208
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,252
I'm gonna tie off the vessel.

209
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,132
I need you to drop the lung
so I can get access.

210
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:09,377
Watch the pulse ox and let me know
when you need to give her a breath, ok?

211
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,198
Ok.

212
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,384
3-0 silk suture.

213
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,310
Give her a breath.

214
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,170
Ok.
Now the fun part.

215
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,025
Now all she needs is
the courage to be herself.

216
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,026
No mean feat.

217
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,124
I thought you were at work.

218
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,103
And I thought you were
halfway to Mexico.

219
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:47,953
I needed some money first.

220
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,698
I just stashed some here a while ago
in case you went through my room again.

221
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,900
You shouldn't be moving
around right now.

222
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,718
- You need rest. You need--
- No, I need to go.

223
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,670
All right. All right.
Come here. Come here.

224
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,742
Oh, man.

225
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,598
Stay right here.

226
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:37,371
I'm really sorry
I put you through all this.

227
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,827
I'm sorry I was a lousy father.

228
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:51,220
What are you talking about?
You were a great dad.

229
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,932
I never saw you for
who you were.

230
00:16:57,147 --> 00:17:00,200
I only saw you for who
I wanted you to be.

231
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,681
If I were tougher...

232
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:07,253
I don't know--less forgiving, more forgiving.
I never got it right with you.

233
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:11,929
And here we are.

234
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:14,243
What I did...

235
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,657
I did because of me,
because of who I am.

236
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,773
It's not your fault.

237
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,650
Matt.

238
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,889
You're my oldest, my first,

239
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,581
the first person in
this world who...

240
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,314
I love more than myself.

241
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,942
I will always be
responsible for you.

242
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:54,571
You don't have to be
responsible for me anymore.

243
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:58,634
Let me go if only this once.

244
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,796
It's a little more
complicated than that.

245
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,536
It doesn't have to be.

246
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,939
You got to change
that every 6 hours

247
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,054
so you don't get
an infection.

248
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:22,290
And try not to pull out the stitches.

249
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,909
I love you, Matt.

250
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,021
Go.

251
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,173
Dr. Mcnamara?

252
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,809
Listen, thanks for coming.

253
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,829
Why don't you have a seat?

254
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,894
Um, a highway patrolman

255
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:13,001
pulled over a suspect off
of route 14 in Lancaster.

256
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,102
uh-huh.

257
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,811
Well, he saw blood
on the suspect's hands.

258
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:20,712
He asked him to open the trunk,
and inside

259
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:24,074
he found your wife's head in a box.

260
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:26,695
He--he cut off her head?

261
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:33,324
So let me call a grief
counselor for you, ok?

262
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,317
No, no.

263
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,748
Where is the rest of her?

264
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:46,384
He won't tell us unless
he speaks with you.

265
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,229
What did you do
with my wife's body?

266
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:19,709
Which part?

267
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,511
Just tell me where she is.

268
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:31,099
Well, I hope you're planning
on having her cremated

269
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:33,946
given that your wife is a bit,

270
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,402
uh, scattered.

271
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:39,489
But then again,
when disposing of toxic waste,

272
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,211
it's best to break it down
before burning it.

273
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,809
You know, people think

274
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,263
that lethal injection is painless,

275
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:55,602
but thiopental may not provide enough
anesthesia for the duration of the execution.

276
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,256
It took one man 34 minutes to die.

277
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:03,444
People said his eyes were open,
his mouth was moving the entire time.

278
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:08,223
Well, then I'd better think
of something great to say.

279
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,285
You seem to be quite
well-versed on this subject.

280
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:16,574
I used to be one of those doctors
against the death penalty, but...

281
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:22,153
you know, I am going to request permission
to administer the stuff myself because

282
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,054
I want you to feel

283
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,587
everything.

284
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:29,319
Well, that's harsh.

285
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,254
You want to prolong my death

286
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,916
after I went to
such great lengths

287
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,576
to prevent yours.

288
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,179
What are you talking about?

289
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:44,202
We have a lot of money.

290
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,819
My husband, he's a big shot
plastic surgeon,

291
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,198
and he's got a huge
life insurance policy.

292
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,091
Oh, ok. Well,
then I'll give you my address

293
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,994
so that you can send me a check
in 40 years when he dies.

294
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,815
No, it won't be that long.

295
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,008
Look, I'll tell you the truth.

296
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:04,870
I'm going to kill him.

297
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,419
- I almost pulled it off tonight.
- Did you ?

298
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,027
Yes. Why do you think
I came up to you ?

299
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:11,978
You'd be the perfect alibi.

300
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,414
Lying bitch!

301
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,514
You came after me like
an animal in heat.

302
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,335
You got kids?

303
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:21,764
They're his.

304
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:23,979
In order to get the money,

305
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,410
you had to get them
out of the way, too?

306
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,270
Animals don't kill their young.

307
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,298
You're a bug.

308
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,318
An insect.

309
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,021
A spider.

310
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:38,747
Hey, hey.

311
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:41,941
You know how a black
widow kills its prey?

312
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,161
First it wraps itself around it.

313
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:47,177
It spins a cocoon.

314
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:51,401
It squeezes.

315
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,877
Shh. It's ok. It's ok.

316
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,554
It's ok. It's ok.

317
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:01,674
Until its prey stops moving.

318
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:20,606
Would you like to hear
what I did after that?

319
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:27,327
I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch!

320
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,956
You lie!
You lie!

321
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,679
I'm gonna be there.
I am gonna watch you die!

322
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,063
You hear me?!

323
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:36,765
I'm gonna be there.
I'm gonna watch you die.

324
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,450
Hey!
You ought to be thanking me!

325
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,161
I saved your life!

326
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:49,897
Hey, beautiful.

327
00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:54,016
How's my girl, huh?
I'm so happy to see you.

328
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:55,659
Yes.

329
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:01,511
I could have you arrested
for breaking and entering, you know.

330
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:05,617
Well, if you don't want me
visiting,

331
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,013
you shouldn't leave
the key under the mat.

332
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:14,822
You can't just sneak in here
in the middle of the night, Matthew.

333
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:17,858
Well, I wanted to see my daughter
if that was ok with you.

334
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,712
- No, it's not.
- Yeah? Well, tough shit.

335
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:21,688
Ow!

336
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,823
What's the matter with you?
Are you ok?

337
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,186
I got shot.

338
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:29,022
You got shot?
How?

339
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,748
I was stupid and I got shot.
I'm fine.

340
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,997
I was desperate;
I needed some money.

341
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:39,130
I started doing shit,
robbing convenience stores.

342
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,694
I know I've been a little
behind in payments.

343
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:50,365
Ok.

344
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:53,726
Where are you going?

345
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,363
Mexico, I guess.

346
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:58,399
I hear you can get
lost down there.

347
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,567
I'll try to call Jenna
when I can

348
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:03,220
so she doesn't forget
who her father is.

349
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:05,571
Wait.

350
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,878
Take me with you.

351
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,958
You didn't want to live
with me when I was here.

352
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,094
Why would you want
to leave everything

353
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:16,525
and come and live with me
when I'm a fugitive?

354
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:17,699
Leave what?

355
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,705
Look at this place.
It's a dump.

356
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:25,394
Electrolysis doesn't exactly
pay the rent, Matt, and...

357
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:28,762
...dildo sales are down.
It's the goddamn economy.

358
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,080
I need to get out of here, too.

359
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:37,451
Maybe we could be
a family again.

360
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,106
What do you say?

361
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,276
He did beautiful work,
my partner.

362
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,075
It was a tricky surgery.

363
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,078
By tricky, do you mean
I could have died?

364
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:25,961
In a word, yes.

365
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:31,027
I'm very grateful.

366
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:35,883
I don't know how to tell you
how different I feel.

367
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:37,577
I'm so happy.

368
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,462
I'm also kind of scared.

369
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:44,399
It's gonna take a little time
to get used to the new you.

370
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,070
Be patient with yourself.

371
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,713
I had a dream last night I was
in the middle of my concert

372
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,927
And all these people were
clapping and yelling "brava."

373
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:59,270
I saw my mother's face
in the audience.

374
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,341
She was screaming,
"you killed her!"

375
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,480
I forgot the notes.

376
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,817
Do you think there's any way
that I could see her?

377
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,935
Moira.

378
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,903
I promised my therapist
I'd take her home...

379
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:21,809
...the stuff home,
do a little ritual.

380
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,678
For closure,
try to say good-bye and...

381
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,537
...bury the remains forever.

382
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:34,365
Uh, this... is it,

383
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:36,709
the stuff.

384
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,424
This is it?

385
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,516
This is Moira?

386
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,098
She really is just
medical waste.

387
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,827
Oh, my god!

388
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:58,912
This must be hard for you to see.
I'm sorry.

389
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:01,629
I gave up half my life
for medical waste?

390
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,341
Why did I do that?

391
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,395
Was I crazy?

392
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,850
It's so pathetic.

393
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,651
Ok.

394
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,904
Oh, shoot, she's wet.

395
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:29,820
Ok, give me 50 bucks.

396
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,557
I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna
change her, I'm gonna pay,

397
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,226
and you pump.
Ok ?

398
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:36,925
Good girl.

399
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:49,160
I think it was a mistake to
bring you and Jenna with me.

400
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:51,083
It's too dangerous.

401
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:52,585
no, Matt, it's--

402
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,668
Here. Here.

403
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:56,776
I want you to take this, ok?

404
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:59,840
It's enough for a cab ride
back to L.A.

405
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,794
Or call someone to come
and pick you up.

406
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:05,658
What are you gonna do?

407
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,182
Leave us here in the middle
of nowhere?

408
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:11,877
And what if something happens
to you and Jenna, huh?

409
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:17,036
- I would never forgive myself for that.
- Yeah, but what about you?

410
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,660
You can't sit up,
let alone drive a car.

411
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,629
Now, we're gonna be in Mexico
in a couple of hours.

412
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:25,432
We're gonna find a cute little place
by the beach

413
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:29,234
and we're gonna eat fish tacos and
coconuts all day.

414
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,493
You and I have each other now

415
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,833
and that's all we need.

416
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:39,418
We're Bonnie and Clyde,
remember?

417
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,564
Yeah.

418
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,245
Ok. Well, we'll be right back,
all right?

419
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,947
Come on.
Say bye to daddy.

420
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:51,838
Bye.

421
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:01,322
You guys made good time here.

422
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,445
Take it easy.

423
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,807
We don't want to make
a scene here, right?

424
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:10,416
- Were you following us?
- Actually, I was waiting here for you.

425
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:13,189
- You were waiting?
- Yup, I was waiting.

426
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,735
I called her as soon as
I found out you left.

427
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:26,891
So everything she said, it's
been nothing but a lie.

428
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:29,196
Don't blame her, Matty.

429
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:34,025
Ok. She just needed to keep you
occupied till I could catch up.

430
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,156
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

431
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:38,635
Close the door.

432
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:42,042
Come on, it's over, Matty. Ok?

433
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:43,729
Your body can't take any more.

434
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:46,128
We need to get you home
and get you better.

435
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:49,586
Then you can turn yourself in.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

436
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:55,120
Oh.

437
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:57,883
- I want you to get out.
- Jesus, Matt.

438
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,109
Don't be stupid.

439
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:05,351
That's what I am, isn't it?

440
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:07,855
- What you always thought of me.
- Just put the gun down.

441
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,227
- Why disappoint you now?
- Put the gun away, Matt.

442
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:16,330
You have 3 seconds.

443
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,844
1...

444
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:20,347
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

445
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:21,181
2...

446
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,739
I love you, Matty.

447
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:25,108
Ok? You're my son.

448
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:28,989
I don't want you to get
hurt anymore, all right?

449
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,751
Come on, we can talk
about this on the way home.

450
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:34,477
Shit!

451
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:38,655
I got nothing left
to lose, Christian.

452
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,772
Get out.

453
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,183
Get out.

454
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:58,862
I always wanted
better for you, Matty.

455
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:01,340
Good-bye, christian.

456
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,715
I'm sorry I have
to tell you like this.

457
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:26,615
We didn't want to call you in until
all the details were confirmed, but uh...

458
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:29,013
Glen Sanders,

459
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,848
Ophthalmologist from tampa,

460
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,433
married in 2001,
died 6 months later.

461
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,342
Insurance paid 500 grand on that.

462
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:39,528
You got Darryl Jefferson,
cardiac surgeon from Houston, Texas,

463
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:42,074
married in 2002,
deceased 3 months later.

464
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,952
750 on that policy.

465
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,564
Ian McKenzie, podiatrist,

466
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,282
married in '04 for 9 months before
he slips and falls in the shower.

467
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,927
Only a quarter Mil.

468
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,750
Then we come to harland Frank,
plastic surgeon from sin city.

469
00:32:56,274 --> 00:33:00,125
Died of an overdose of nitrous oxide.
Now, that was a big pay day:

470
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,630
Over a million.

471
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,569
And then, of course,
over there...

472
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,399
How'd you find all this out?

473
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,897
Once her face got out there
in the papers, 

474
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:14,640
we got a call from Dr. Frank's nurses
telling us all about Dixie.

475
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,893
Who's Dixie?

476
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,173
That was the name she used
when she worked there.

477
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:20,776
So we looked into harland's death,
we retraced her footsteps

478
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,368
and a pattern emerged.

479
00:33:22,488 --> 00:33:24,502
Her name is Elizabeth...

480
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,167
Hey, Dr. Mcnamara.

481
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,495
What?

482
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,602
We found her body.

483
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,248
Her body?

484
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,883
Yeah, thanks to you.

485
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,048
Technically you're still married,
you're the only known relative.

486
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:47,241
I do have to ask you what you
want to do with the remains.

487
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,587
Burn them.

488
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:04,266
I've been waiting for you.

489
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,115
I don't understand.

490
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,084
These stitches should have held.

491
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,556
What happened?

492
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,321
It didn't go like I planned.

493
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:19,204
It started out well.

494
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,120
The audience was so kind
and receptive.

495
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,405
There were so many faces.

496
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm concerned
about an infection.

497
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,566
We just need to get you on some antibiotics
before we do anything.

498
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm not clear on what
caused this rupture.

499
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,291
All day I'd been practicing.

500
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,460
It wasn't going well.

501
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,596
My anxiety was building.

502
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,561
By the time I got to my dressing room,
I was feeling really weird.

503
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,284
I told my therapist to leave,

504
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,727
to take her seat in the audience.

505
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:17,120
I just needed the comfort of
her little hand on my shoulder.

506
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,460
I couldn't do it alone.

507
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:24,446
The stage manager didn't
want me to go on,

508
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,411
but I knew it was
now or never.

509
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,342
You have to put it in.

510
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,944
Just this.

511
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:36,225
She won't take any of my blood.
It's just her little arm.

512
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,336
No one will know but me.

513
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,892
What's the harm?

514
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,250
Can you make sure Linda gets
her another liter of saline?

515
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,210
We need to increase
her blood volume.

516
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,555
What are you gonna do
with Moira?

517
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:02,176
After I told Abigail that I would not
sew her back into her shoulder,

518
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:05,544
I promised that
I'd call a mortician.

519
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,969
She's gonna get
a proper burial.

520
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,700
Why is it that we see
what we want to believe

521
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,188
when we don't believe
what we see?

522
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,023
Because we have hope.

523
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,209
Because we want to believe
in the good.

524
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,114
Because usually
the truth just sucks.

525
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,578
Her body temp's 101.

526
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,313
Her heart rate's down to 105.

527
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,731
Looks like the antibiotics are
fighting the sepsis.

528
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,085
I think she's gonna survive.

529
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,682
And so are you.

530
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,393
Sean, Matt's on the phone.

531
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,718
It stings like crazy.

532
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:57,421
It's gonna be tender
for a little while.

533
00:37:58,264 --> 00:38:00,524
You just have to keep
an eye on it.

534
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,023
Thanks.

535
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,823
I couldn't just leave
you like that.

536
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,126
I'd have understood if you did.

537
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,154
But I know why you didn't.

538
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,576
I don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.

539
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,179
I should go.

540
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,755
Take care of yourself.

541
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,930
I'll do my best.

542
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,231
You did the right thing, dad.

543
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:27,831
Drop the bag.

544
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,099
Turn around.

545
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,639
Walk with your back towards us.

546
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:53,638
You have the right
to remain silent.

547
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,875
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

548
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,997
You have the right
to an attorney.

549
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:01,137
If you cannot afford an attorney...

550
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,336
Annie, I get your jacket.
Can you check all the drawers?

551
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,697
We don't want to have
to come back.

552
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,222
Where are you going?

553
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:06,111
I'm taking the kids
to a hotel.

554
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,398
We'll be more comfortable there.

555
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,857
Away from me.

556
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,967
Like you've been
doing a perfect job.

557
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,087
Sean, come on.

558
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,056
You need to take care of
yourself right now.

559
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,058
You can't just take them
away from me.

560
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,161
I already lost one kid today.
I'm not losing the other two.

561
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,664
Oh, for god's sakes, Sean,
take a look at yourself.

562
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,162
You are wandering about
in some kind of haze.

563
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,507
You marry a woman
you don't even know,

564
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:36,294
someone who puts you and
your children's lives at risk,

565
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:38,061
who tries to kill you.

566
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:41,046
The saddest part is you refuse
to believe it.

567
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,048
I don't need a lecture
from you.

568
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,466
If you want to continue to live in the world
according to Sean, that's fine, ok?

569
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,691
But it's not a safe place
for your kids.

570
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,627
One day you'll see
that this is for the best.

571
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,141
I know it.

572
