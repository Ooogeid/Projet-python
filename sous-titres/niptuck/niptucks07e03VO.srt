1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:01,962
Previously on nip/tuck...

2
00:00:02,082 --> 00:00:03,688
Why are you with me,
Christian?

3
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:05,074
You think I'm stupid.

4
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,106
You hate yourself like I do.

5
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,532
I always go back to you
because you hate me the best.

6
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:12,829
Will you marry me?

7
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:15,852
Christian loves you,
and he is faithful to you.

8
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:18,203
I don't know who he is.

9
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:19,858
I don't know who I am.

10
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,944
We're bad.
Like, this is really bad.

11
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,710
Heck if I don't feel guilty.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,545
Curtis?

13
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:26,894
I got to tell you,
I was a little shocked

14
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:28,748
when I heard you won
the Poland award.

15
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,440
We're lucky, though,
you know, Sean?

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,685
Most poor bastards,
they never get to find out

17
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,871
what their true
purpose in life is.

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,612
Usually, we ask our new clients
what they don't like about themselves,

19
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,338
but in this case,
I think we can figure it out.

20
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,221
What happened?

21
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,257
- Car accident?
- Physics.

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,838
170 pound man
falls 245 feet,

23
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,819
quickly reaching a maximum
velocity of 86 miles an hour

24
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,773
before he hits the water
4 seconds later...

25
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,914
which, I know, doesn't
sound like a long time.

26
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,884
But it's a frickin' eternity.

27
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,583
And was this
a suicide attempt?

28
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:07,896
Yeah, at the most cliched
spot on the planet...

29
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,298
the golden Gate bridge.

30
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,421
And you survived the fall.
You...

31
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,938
must be one in a million.

32
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:17,187
Close. About 1,200 people
have jumped from the bridge.

33
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:18,830
Conservative estimate...

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,870
the current's so strong there,
they assume more than that

35
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,456
have jumped
without being seen,

36
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,852
have been swept out to sea
or taken by sharks.

37
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,823
Only about 40 of us
have lived to tell the tale.

38
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,839
Why'd you do it?

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,434
Uh, what my partner means is,
we're going to need

40
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,905
a complete psychological picture
before we can agree to operate on you.

41
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,894
I don't mind talking about it.

42
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,144
I'm as sane as the next guy.
My psychiatrist agrees.

43
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:46,926
You ever try and kill yourself?

44
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:47,780
No.

45
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,416
Uh, what about you,
Dr. Troy?

46
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:53,169
You know,
I've had, uh,

47
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,268
rough patches, but I guess
I've always been able to...

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,719
find pleasure
in my life somehow.

49
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,309
Well, that's lucky.

50
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,611
I guess I'm just
kind of a naturally

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,729
depressive personality.

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,986
I guess, obvious.
Just...

53
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,303
life's just been...

54
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,149
kind of hard for a while.

55
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:17,154
My son died...

56
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,640
of leukemia.

57
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,723
He was 14 years old.

58
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:23,659
You know, marriages don't
survive that kind of thing.

59
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,579
I just felt this kind of...

60
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,992
darkness building up
inside me.

61
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,778
The edges of it disappeared,
and...

62
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:35,016
it felt like it kind of
swallowed me up.

63
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:40,856
Wasn't even painful anymore.
Everything just was so hard.

64
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,395
Except jumping.
Jumping was easy.

65
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,031
I remember, I didn't want anybody
to see me go over the rail...

66
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,950
like I didn't want to get
in trouble somehow.

67
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:54,892
And I went over the rail,
and there's a lip,

68
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:57,411
and I stood there,
and then, I just stepped...

69
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,767
I mean, the way, you
know, you step out of...

70
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,923
bed in the morning,
I stepped.

71
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,333
And I thought to my self,

72
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:11,240
"no, not this. Go back.
Stop. Go back!"

73
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,959
By second 2,
I knew I wanted to live.

74
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,739
I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

75
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:21,647
What did you do?

76
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:26,270
Well, most of the people who've
survived landed feet first. So...

77
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,277
I somehow managed
to flip myself over and hit...

78
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:31,511
the water like
a blade of grass.

79
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,581
And it still felt like a cinderblock
to the balls, though.

80
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,331
Broke 2 vertebrae
in my pelvis

81
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,956
and, you know, obviously,
the reason I'm here.

82
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:48,314
Broke all 14 bones in your face,
but your jaw is remarkably intact.

83
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:50,420
Uh, Mr. Seabrook,

84
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:54,196
we may not be able to make you
look the way you looked before.

85
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:56,066
I don't care about that.

86
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,938
I just want to look normal.

87
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,667
Jumping gave me a second
chance to live my life,

88
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,245
to follow my dreams.

89
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,101
I want to go back to school,
maybe...

90
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,669
become a therapist,

91
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,936
start dating again.

92
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,708
You know, maybe, uh...

93
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,675
Maybe have another kid.

94
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,372
You must be
in a lot of pain.

95
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,529
You know how they say

96
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,334
when you die, your life
flashes before your eyes?

97
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,656
It's not true.

98
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,234
You don't see all the things
you've done. You see...

99
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,520
all the things you're never
going to get a chance to do,

100
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:44,624
all the opportunities
you're going to lose.

101
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,748
I didn't jump to my death.
I jumped to my life.

102
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,726
I just need you
to help me to live it.

110
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:50,290
Baby, that feels so good

111
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:02,833
Ok.
Come inside me.

112
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,335
Well...

113
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:07,670
Aren't you...

114
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,046
No. I mean, no.
I'm good.

115
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,940
I don't need to.
You do it.

116
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,638
Oh! Oh, oh,
my gosh, Sean!

117
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:31,141
Oh! Oh, my God.
Oh. Oh, my God.

118
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:33,577
That was insane.

119
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,238
That was weird.

120
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,051
Why?

121
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,402
I'm not used
to you not coming.

122
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:47,615
I don't always
need to come.

123
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:49,922
Well...

124
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,026
I do.

125
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,074
Honey, we're married.

126
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,573
We have, like, a lifetime
of orgasms ahead of us.

127
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:57,725
We're good.

128
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,510
It's good.

129
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:01,588
We're good.

130
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,784
<i>Why stay with him?</i>

131
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,971
Are you suggesting
that you and I...

132
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,037
No.

133
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,029
I want to know.

134
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,644
Why stay with him,
if it makes you so unhappy?

135
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:21,068
I don't know.

136
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,772
The same reason
you do, I guess.

137
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,036
Kind of feel sorry
for the guy, huh?

138
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:34,431
Unlucky bastard.

139
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,926
He survived a fall from
the golden Gate bridge.

140
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,201
How is that unlucky?

141
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,225
He went from being
depressed and suicidal

142
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,665
to completely delusional
in 700 feet.

143
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,349
He really thinks he's going
to change his life now.

144
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:46,483
And you don't believe him.

145
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:47,885
How many times have you
sworn off drinking

146
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,579
and then wake up
with a hangover?

147
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,755
Same thing, right?

148
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,323
Having a hangover and attempting
suicide are not the same thing.

149
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,353
You would know,
I guess.

150
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,892
What's that supposed to mean?

151
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,542
I'm just saying that people
don't change just because

152
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,012
they think they're going to die
and then get a second chance.

153
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,085
You had cancer.

154
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,737
You thought
you were going to die.

155
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:06,179
You're saying that
didn't give you

156
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,187
the courage to look
at life a little differently?

157
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,242
For about a week, yeah,
maybe. All right?

158
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,253
I think there's no way you can't
change after something like that.

159
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:14,276
So tell me,

160
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,792
how is your life so different
since you swam out to the buoy?

161
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:23,855
At a certain age, you just
accept who you are

162
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:26,357
and stop thinking there's
something better out there.

163
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:27,767
You're right.

164
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,087
You haven't changed at all.

165
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,428
You married Kimber,

166
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:33,815
and you still screw around
every chance you get.

167
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:36,510
Which reminds me, I was having
lunch at shutters the other day,

168
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,234
picked up these 2 hot sisters who
both want to go up 2 cup sizes.

169
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,487
They're coming in on Thursday.
Unbelievably hot, trust me.

170
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,359
I told them that'd be cool.
Is that cool with you?

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,933
Why don't you finish
up here? I forgot.

172
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,089
I have a meeting
I need to get to.

173
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:55,467
We have a consult after this.

174
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:01,585
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mr. Wise.

175
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,055
Uh, don't get the wrong idea.
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

176
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,611
Mr. Wise, the gash
around your neck

177
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,854
was clearly made by a belt,
probably spiked,

178
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,338
from the sharp indentations left
at perfectly spaced intervals.

179
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,482
The skin's been ripped
and twisted.

180
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,210
Not a surprising consequence
when you try to hang yourself.

181
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,860
Kudos, Sherlock.

182
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,499
Spiked belt it was,

183
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,633
although you haven't
solved the case just yet.

184
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,304
I wasn't trying
to commit suicide.

185
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,711
I was masturbating.

186
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,123
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

187
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:43,550
Gone awry.

188
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,236
My bad.

189
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:46,295
I just...

190
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,091
need you to fix this
so that I can

191
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,318
stop wearing scarves

192
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,602
and turtlenecks when
it's 18 degrees outside.

193
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,788
I liked you better when
I thought you tried to kill yourself.

194
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,385
You risk dying
for an orgasm?

195
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,050
It wasn't just an orgasm,

196
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,965
it was the orgasm
of a lifetime.

197
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,405
You have no idea.

198
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,697
Cutting off the blood
supply to the brain

199
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,728
provides an amazing high.
I do have an idea.

200
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:13,056
It's better than any drug
you've ever had...

201
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,518
I've ever had.

202
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,715
Includes quite an extensive list,
I can tell you.

203
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:20,076
Don't knock it
if you ain't tried it, doc.

204
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,369
Thanks, but,
you know,

205
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,221
I can usually find
someone to help me out.

206
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,258
Call it the perks
of being married.

207
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:26,611
Right.
Been there.

208
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:28,613
Divorced now.
Look, all I'm saying is,

209
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,923
you cut off the flow of blood
and oxygen to the brain,

210
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:33,377
your dick gets
unbelievably hard.

211
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:35,162
That's why these guys
who are hung get

212
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:37,888
these huge, stonking boners
and ejaculate when they die.

213
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,442
It's called induced...

214
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,571
induced cerebral anoxia.
I know.

215
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:42,953
That's right.

216
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:46,107
You get this euphoria.

217
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,197
It's like having
one foot in heaven.

218
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:56,487
So, I take it you're going to continue
with this practice even after I, uh,

219
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,707
repair the damage
to your neck?

220
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,136
Don't worry, doc.

221
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:01,968
I'll stick to silk ties
from now on.

222
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:05,070
Same high without
the ring around the collar.

223
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:10,446
Look, I'm asking you to fix this,
not how I choose to come.

224
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,536
Judge not,

225
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:14,021
right?

226
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,116
- Excuse me.
- May I help you?

227
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,205
Yeah. I'm looking
for Dr. Ryerson.

228
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,525
Is he expecting you?

229
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,054
We spoke earlier on the phone.
I'm Sean McNamara.

230
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:36,926
Oh! Dr. Mcnamara.
Yes. I'm Nsolo.

231
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,179
Curtis told me
you were coming by.

232
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,566
You and your partner

233
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,160
were the other recipients of
the other Poland award this year.

234
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,577
Congratulations.

235
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,607
Follow me, please.

236
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,742
Hey! Sean,
thanks for coming.

237
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,219
Hey,
how was your drive?

238
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,458
- Just fine.
- Good.

239
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,966
Let me know if there's anything
you need while in San Diego,

240
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,301
anything at all.

241
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,369
Thanks.

242
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,015
Nsolo stepped on
a land mine in Angola.

243
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,576
He was a beggar at the airport
when we met him, and now he...

244
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,987
practically runs the entire center
when I'm on the road,

245
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,940
which is about 10 months
out of the year.

246
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,603
Well, I'm glad
you were in town.

247
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:15,287
I've been wanting to see your
operation since we talked in Miami.

248
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:17,662
Well, here it is,
in all its glamour.

249
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,375
Not exactly
Beverly Hills, but...

250
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,261
That's a good thing.

251
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:23,997
So, uh...

252
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,436
What's going on
with Christian?

253
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:31,145
Oh, he's still sucking the
champagne and caviar out of life.

254
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,333
After the ceremony,
you guys took off so quickly,

255
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,785
- I thought maybe...
- Sorry about that, Curtis.

256
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,370
I had to jump
on the next flight.

257
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,167
There was an emergency
back at the office. So...

258
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:42,147
I cannot tell you how many trips
I've had to cut short and hop on a plane.

259
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,722
I remember once,

260
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:46,161
crop duster came and
picked us up on the serengeti

261
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,382
on the way to a malaria
outbreak in darfur.

262
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,078
An angry herd of wildebeests

263
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,474
chases us down the runway,
I kid you not.

264
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:56,843
Barely got out of there
with our necks.

265
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,408
The closest I've come
to anything like that

266
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:03,303
would be bumper-to-bumper
on the 405 with Christian,

267
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:06,474
who's in a bad mood 'cause
he's late for his massage.

268
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,128
That's why I called you.

269
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,834
I'm here because...

270
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,905
I want to help.
So what can I do?

271
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:22,644
Well, we are flying a 12-year-old
girl in from Jakarta on Thursday.

272
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,561
Her husband cut her
in the face with a machete

273
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,997
when she fought off
his rape attempt.

274
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,522
What we need
is a surgeon

275
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,019
and an O.R.

276
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:33,742
Consider it done.

277
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,428
You sure about this?

278
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:40,160
I mean, maybe think about it,
talk to Christian.

279
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,091
No, I don't need
to talk to Christian.

280
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,603
Just something
I want to do,

281
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,711
something I probably should
have done a long time ago.

282
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,034
All right. Well,
I'll set it up for Thursday.

283
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:53,419
Great.

284
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:56,272
This is really going
to make a difference, Sean.

285
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,101
What are you doing?

286
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,140
I want to make
my baby happy.

287
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,369
If my baby's not happy,

288
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:13,639
then I'm not happy.

289
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,030
- I'm half asleep...
- Look,

290
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,339
just tell me
what you want.

291
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,634
Anything.

292
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,633
I want you...

293
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,795
don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

294
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,849
You don't seem fine to me.

295
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,012
Come on.

296
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,706
Yeah.
Get it, baby.

297
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,575
What are you doing?

298
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,487
Oh, trust me. Trust me.
Trust me. Trust me, baby.

299
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,055
You got to trust me, ok?

300
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:04,043
You're going to have the come
of your life, I promise. Ok.

301
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:08,378
Trust me.

302
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,126
Look at me.
Look at me.

303
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,665
You got to trust me.

304
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:33,506
Oh, my God!

305
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,866
Oh, my God.

306
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,308
That's my baby.

307
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,030
Next time,
you do me, baby.

308
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:21,604
Sorry, partner.

309
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:23,840
I was performing
a slipindicktomy.

310
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,614
Are we in high school?

311
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:29,240
You have to brag about
having sex with your wife?

312
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,724
We are not talking
about sex, partner.

313
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:35,156
I gave Kimmie the orgasm
of her lifetime, ok?

314
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:39,102
I mean, Kimmie's toes curled up
like the wicked witch of the east,

315
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,622
and it's all because
of Mr. Wise in there.

316
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,808
Seriously. I mean, we were
having marital problems.

317
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,899
The sex was all,
you know, whatever.

318
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,537
Anyway, I took his advice
and tried erotic asphyxiation.

319
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:51,424
You choked your wife?

320
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:53,850
Ok, come on. It's not like
I'm O.J. or something, all right?

321
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,093
I know how to deal
with the pressure. I'm a doctor.

322
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,079
Oh, you're right.
That's very romantic.

323
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,632
Trust me.
Kimber loved it.

324
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,136
Not as much
as you did, though.

325
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:02,638
What's that
supposed to mean?

326
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,407
Everything is about
power for you.

327
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,138
You're not satisfied...

328
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,424
unless you're
dominating your partner.

329
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,295
You do live with your
hand on her throat,

330
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:12,264
might as well screw her
that way, too, right?

331
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:14,063
Jeez, what's up
your ass today, huh?

332
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,699
Kimber deserves
better than this.

333
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,275
You know,
if you're having problems,

334
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:18,610
why don't you try
talking about it?

335
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,957
Ok, Mr. Marriage counselor guy.
Ok. You're giving me advice, right?

336
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,916
Last time I checked,
you've been divorced...

337
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:25,562
how many times?
Same as me, right?

338
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:28,149
And since when do you care
about Kimber so much?

339
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,642
Guys,
are you clean enough?

340
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,837
The guy's been under
for 6 minutes.

341
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:06,864
Hey.

342
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,309
Sean... Sean...

343
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:12,470
No, no, no, no.

344
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,406
No... don't talk.
Don't talk.

345
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,472
Isn't that what you like now?

346
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,360
No.

347
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,120
Sean. Sean!

348
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,996
Ugh! Sean, stop it!

349
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:26,750
Jesus.

350
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:29,554
Kimber...

351
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:34,112
Hey, look. I know about
the choking. He told me.

352
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:35,826
I just want to know
if you're ok.

353
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,600
It's fine.
It's not as bad as it looks.

354
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,984
You should get somebody
to look at that, you know?

355
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:46,611
Sean,

356
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,080
stop it.

357
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:52,368
I really... I really don't want you
to touch me right now, ok?

358
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,644
I came here because

359
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:03,231
we need to stop doing this.

360
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:09,686
Ok.

361
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:13,502
Ok?

362
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:15,961
Just ok?

363
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:20,276
What do you want me to say?
"Stay, we can work it out"?

364
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:23,255
Well, I would have thought maybe
you'd have a little bit more feeling than

365
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,649
that, or for me.

366
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,669
It's never what this was about.

367
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,955
You know that.

368
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:33,756
Ok.

369
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:35,783
Then I guess that's it.

370
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,529
You're not going back to him,
are you?

371
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,784
He's my husband, Sean.

372
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,352
You deserve better.

373
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,108
I know.

374
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,239
And the only reason why
I haven't been able to get it

375
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,556
it is because I'm fooling around
with his best friend,

376
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,557
and I am just as much to blame
for my own unhappiness as anybody.

377
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,928
And if I'm going to get
what I deserve,

378
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:03,429
I need to take
a little bit of responsibility,

379
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,655
refocus on my marriage...

380
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:10,486
even if that means being
completely honest with him.

381
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,468
How long you been going behind
my back, you cheating bastard?

382
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,421
I come in this morning

383
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,746
expecting to be
waist-deep in double Ds.

384
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:31,741
Instead, I find my 2 bimbos out
in the lobby trying to reschedule.

385
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,121
Oh, cool your jets.
We'll fit your bimbos in.

386
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,378
And I promise, this operation
won't cost you a Penny.

387
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:37,511
Good to see you,
Christian.

388
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:38,992
I don't give a shit
about the money.

389
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,200
If you're operating on somebody
who needs it, that's fine.

390
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,318
There's a first.

391
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:43,712
And... and what about him?

392
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,128
I mean, where did
he come from, huh?

393
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,584
Last time we saw each other,
you were too embarrassed

394
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,889
to say good-bye,

395
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,223
and now you're working
together in our surgical suite.

396
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:54,301
Curtis said he needed some help,
and I jumped at the opportunity.

397
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,841
And you just
forgot to tell me.

398
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,590
Frankly,
I didn't think you'd care.

399
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,645
Bullshit.

400
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,936
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

401
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,165
Why don't you scrub in? You can
help us with these grafts here.

402
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,535
No, thank you, Curtis. I have
no desire to be around Sean

403
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,905
when he's got his tongue
so far up your ass.

404
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,470
Sorry about that.

405
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,494
Guess you never got
around to telling him

406
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:19,047
you're going to be gone
to Africa for a month, huh?

407
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,894
Sorry to interrupt.

408
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:44,981
We really do need to get
a "do not disturb" sign on that door.

409
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,075
You know, nurse Linda's
come in a couple of times.

410
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,660
She needs
to take your vitals.

411
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,963
That's fine.
I'm through.

412
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:55,105
You know, maybe you should
go finish off in the bathroom.

413
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,208
Really,
it's not worth the effort.

414
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:59,826
I've had farts that
were more exciting.

415
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,709
Why don't we take a look, huh?

416
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,378
How's it look?

417
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:18,870
Looks pretty good.

418
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:21,323
Very good, in fact.

419
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,028
How's the patient doing?

420
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,088
Depressed.

421
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,433
That's just the anesthesia
wearing off.

422
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,207
You'll be fine
in a couple of days.

423
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,240
Bullshit.

424
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,812
I've been rubbing myself raw,
fantasizing my ass off.

425
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:37,962
Sex without asphyxiation is
about as exciting as...

426
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,781
a day without sunshine?

427
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,483
Right.
I forgot.

428
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,029
You liked me better suicidal.

429
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,749
Oh, no, no, no. I don't.
I mean, I did, but...

430
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,236
I don't.

431
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:53,473
I've been having some trouble
in my marriage, and...

432
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:55,468
I think you might
have just...

433
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:56,709
helped it.

434
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,164
She was a little scared at first.

435
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:01,956
Thought I was trying to choke her
to death or something.

436
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:03,885
- And?
- It worked.

437
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:05,812
It worked.

438
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,822
Probably the greatest orgasm
I've ever seen. I mean...

439
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:11,266
And how was it when she did you?
Blow your mind or what?

440
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:12,437
No, no, no.

441
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,343
I'm better at giving
than receiving.

442
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:17,796
Well, it depends
what you're receiving.

443
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,118
Believe me,

444
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:23,302
if you want to discover your
capacity for limitless ecstasy,

445
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:25,516
go beyond what you
ever thought possible,

446
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,452
get her to return the favor.

447
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:31,091
Your marriage will last forever.

448
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,230
Well, I think the neck's
coming along fine.

449
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,493
As long as you stay off the windpipe
for a couple of months,

450
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,633
maybe forever,
you'll be good.

451
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:45,288
You know what it's like?

452
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:49,746
To have experienced heaven,

453
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:51,991
and now be denied entry?

454
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:57,504
You know, I think I'll get you a couple
of girl-on-girl action videos,

455
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:00,787
so I'll talk to my anesthesiologist,
get a recommendation.

456
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:23,694
Hey, handsome.

457
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:25,479
Hey, honey.
I'm just going to

458
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,935
jump on the treadmill
before I get some dinner.

459
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,269
What?

460
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:33,838
Come over here.

461
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,006
What?

462
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:36,058
Sit.

463
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,843
What are you doing?

464
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,335
You look like
a bitch in heat, Kimmie.

465
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,777
- Do i?
- Yeah.

466
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:44,187
Well,
I'm actually a tigress,

467
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,724
and you are a tortoise.

468
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:48,046
A tortoise?

469
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:49,504
That's exciting.

470
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:51,671
I've been reading
the kama sutra book.

471
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,051
You're not
the only creative lover.

472
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,061
I like creative, huh?

473
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,983
Why don't you get me off
like I got you off?

474
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:04,943
Well,

475
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,410
I'm not really into
that sort of thing.

476
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,431
Come on.

477
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:10,565
No?

478
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:12,404
But I want you to lay back.

479
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,666
Right here.

480
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:22,272
Spread your legs.

481
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,720
Give me your hands.

482
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,714
Come on.

483
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,464
Come on.
You're the tigress.

484
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:57,031
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

485
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:16,070
Oh, Christian.
Oh, that's so good.

486
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,677
What are you doing?

487
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:21,987
What?

488
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:25,150
You don't come
like that with me. That's...

489
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,554
but I'm having an orgasm.

490
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,067
You faked that.

491
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,888
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did. Bullshit.

492
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,880
- Filthy old porn trash.
- Oh, thanks.

493
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:44,416
I'm sorry.

494
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:47,029
This is the only time
I've done it, ok?

495
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,800
I've never done it before.
I promise.

496
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,465
And why should
I believe that, huh?

497
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:52,142
Well, because I'm not really
into the choking thing.

498
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,105
- It freaks me out.
- Well, why didn't you just tell me?

499
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:57,092
- Because I feel guilty.
- Guilty? What the hell for?

500
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:36,948
I think that you have
made the right decision.

501
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,580
There's not much choice.
It's...

502
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,135
peach or blueberry.

503
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,874
I overheard Ryerson
on his cell

504
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:49,983
after you 2 worked on
that girl the other day.

505
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,374
You're going
with him to Africa.

506
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:55,745
I just want you to know,

507
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:57,731
I think it's really great.

508
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,732
I mean,
I do hate you for leaving,

509
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,384
but I do understand.

510
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:05,521
And by the way, when the hell
were you going to tell me?

511
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,964
I mean, should I
update my resume?

512
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,451
It hasn't sunk in yet.

513
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:14,733
What did Christian say?

514
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,051
Haven't told him.

515
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:18,586
Yet.

516
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,391
Don't say anything, ok?

517
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,970
You know,
it's funny.

518
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,677
After all these years of you
changing people,

519
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,255
and you being the one
who needed it.

520
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,394
<i>Shithead was right.</i>

521
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:23,479
<i>Feels like an orgasm
everywhere...</i>

522
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,051
<i>in my feet,
shoulders.</i>

523
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,185
<i>Oh, God.
Going to come.</i>

524
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,331
<i>Get up and
take the belt off.</i>

525
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:45,352
<i>Shit. I can't move.
There's not enough...</i>

526
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,398
<i>I can't feel...</i>

527
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,280
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

528
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:53,011
<i>Stand up and take
the goddamn belt off.</i>

529
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,454
<i>Get up.</i>

530
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,277
<i>Get up!</i>

531
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:11,681
<i>Christian?</i>

532
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,593
Christian?

533
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,458
Jesus Christ

534
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,457
Christian!
Christian!

535
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,468
No.

536
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:42,888
Are you ok?

537
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,187
Are you sure you don't
want them to come?

538
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:48,558
Did you try
and kill yourself?

539
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,999
What is it,
the choking thing?

540
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,558
Honey, if it is,
I don't care.

541
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:55,672
I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want.

542
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,625
I'll be a slave,
if you want.

543
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,336
I don't want a slave.

544
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,508
I didn't mean it like that.

545
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,168
That's not what I meant.

546
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,357
Yes, it is.

547
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:08,245
I had this...

548
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,344
Moment of clarity
before I lost consciousness.

549
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:19,538
You'll never
make me happy.

550
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,674
I...

551
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:25,860
Can never
love you enough.

552
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,828
Oh, baby.
You are not...

553
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:28,716
thinking clearly.

554
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,332
You don't have enough
oxygen in your brain.

555
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:31,887
You don't know
what you're saying.

556
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,600
I've never felt so clear.

557
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:36,474
Christian, we've hit
a rough patch.

558
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,778
You don't break up
because of it.

559
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,298
We said "for better or worse",
remember?

560
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:42,249
Yeah.

561
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,316
I can't that part.

562
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:49,300
Ok, look.
This is my fault.

563
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,737
It's my fault.
I've been a bad wife,

564
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:54,095
and I've done
really bad things.

565
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:57,492
But I'm so sorry, and
I'll make it up to you.

566
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,466
And I know that
you'll love me again.

567
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,754
Can you hear
what you're saying?

568
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:12,829
I'm not good for you.

569
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,835
I'm meant to be alone.

570
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,921
He kicked me out.

571
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,174
That's it. It's over.
He's done with me now.

572
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,046
You've heard that before...

573
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,867
How many hundreds of times?

574
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,771
No, it's different this time.

575
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:14,626
You should have seen
the look at his face.

576
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:21,959
We're like 2 strangers. I mean,
the guy doesn't even like me.

577
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:25,845
Good.

578
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,918
He's doing you
a favor, Kimber.

579
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:31,673
It's a gift.

580
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,753
But I don't want
that kind of gift.

581
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:38,294
I want one that includes him,

582
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:39,966
one for us.

583
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,634
I mean,
he's where I belong.

584
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:44,806
Not anymore.

585
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:48,376
Maybe you never did, right?

586
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,852
Maybe it was just your fear

587
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:52,522
of not belonging anywhere
that made you so stuck.

588
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,644
Doesn't matter now.

589
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:57,726
All that matters now is,
what are you going to do?

590
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:01,974
This is your opportunity,
Kimber.

591
00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:03,994
Jump.
Take the leap.

592
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:07,583
Find out who you are without him
telling you you're not good enough,

593
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:09,636
pretty enough,
smart enough.

594
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,975
Do it before you get too old
and you can't.

595
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:19,225
I'm not like you, Sean.

596
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,715
I don't hate Christian.

597
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:27,022
And I certainly don't
want to be him, either.

598
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:51,866
Hey.

599
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,103
Hey.

600
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,690
What's the with bad mood?

601
00:34:57,302 --> 00:34:59,352
Well, I don't really enjoy

602
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,942
hanging out with a bunch
of Hollywood skanks.

603
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:05,134
Oh, come on.
They're nice girls, Kimber.

604
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:08,046
You said we were
going to be alone.

605
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,478
You'll get your turn.

606
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:12,082
There's more than enough
Mike to go around.

607
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:19,093
Ok. Just give me a second.
I'll be right there.

608
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:23,574
I believe April is next.
Excuse me.

609
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:27,697
I thought I was the one you wanted
to spend the rest of your life with.

610
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:29,953
So did I.

611
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,052
Wow.

612
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:34,972
Crazy times, huh?

613
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,028
I'll tell you what.

614
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,532
It's a good thing you kicked
my ass to the curb that final time.

615
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,025
I mean,

616
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:45,159
it's taken a shitload
of curbs, but...

617
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,971
I think I finally
got the message.

618
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:49,090
I'm sorry about that.
It was shitty.

619
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:50,977
And...

620
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:54,325
I don't have an excuse
other than I was...

621
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:57,532
obsessed with Christian.
But I don't feel that way.

622
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,218
And you're so good to me,

623
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:01,966
and we're good together,
and I just... I really,

624
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:03,617
in my heart,
feel that 2 people

625
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,186
that are right for each other

626
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,520
need to spend the rest
of their lives together.

627
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,018
Honey, I've got more bumps
and bruises than a rodeo clown.

628
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:13,320
I can handle the pain, but...

629
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,438
after a while, you just
get tired of being laughed at.

630
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,211
Listen...

631
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,121
do me a favor,
will you, Kimber?

632
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:29,432
I've got a Chateau Mouton
Rothschild 1986 over at the bar.

633
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,783
Why don't you be a sweetie
and go get it?

634
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:36,372
And bring a corkscrew.

635
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,204
Kimber?

636
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:49,392
The wine?

637
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:11,910
Not yet.

638
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,840
I plan to take him to
his favorite strip club and...

639
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:19,104
drop the bomb there,
let naked women soften the blow.

640
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,562
Uh, no.
Not anymore.

641
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,725
He kicked his wife out.

642
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,758
Listen, Curtis,
I was thinking

643
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:29,543
we could author an article
together based on this trip.

644
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:32,739
I have an idea for
a new procedure

645
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,493
on patients with
neurofibromatosis.

646
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,238
Great.

647
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:39,807
Ok.

648
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,326
Yeah.

649
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,052
Well, we'll talk about it
when I see you in a few days.

650
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:49,225
Ah. I got to go.
Ok. Bye.

651
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:51,044
What?

652
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:11,123
Kimber fell off a boat
last night. She's, uh...

653
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,318
She's missing.

654
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:15,657
What?

655
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:16,892
Whose boat?

656
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,362
Mike

657
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:24,645
coast guard thinks she, uh...

658
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,229
thinks she's dead.

659
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:31,355
Wait. I... don't understand
what happened. She...

660
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,009
She slipped and
fell off the boat?

661
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,011
I think she jumped.

662
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,226
Jumped?

663
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:39,081
Yeah.

664
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,502
Suicide?

665
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,871
Well, but the coast guard
is still searching,

666
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,786
so they could still find her.

667
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:51,618
Impossible.

668
00:39:51,738 --> 00:39:53,045
12 hours?

669
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,697
Can't survive in the water
that long, you know.

670
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,274
I kicked her out last night.

671
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,254
I told her I wanted her
out of my life.

672
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:17,411
I shouldn't have...

673
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,698
I should have...

674
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,895
I don't know what to do.

675
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,120
There you are.
Hey, Dr. Mcnamara, 

676
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,052
I wanted to thank you
and Dr. Troy

677
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,592
for the excellent care
I've received here.

678
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,042
Is he around?

679
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:04,525
No. He's...

680
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,424
You look like you're
healing well, Mr. Seabrook.

681
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,230
I feel great.

682
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:15,858
Today really is the first day
of the rest of my life,

683
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,965
and I'm not going to let
another day pass

684
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:21,601
doing things I don't want to do
or feeling ways I don't want to feel.

685
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:23,054
Good for you.

686
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,693
I wish you luck
with everything.

687
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,039
Hope the same for you,
Dr. Mcnamara.

688
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:34,410
Goodbye.
