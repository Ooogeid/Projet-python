1
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,520
Previously on Nip/Tuck.

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,710
Hi,julia.

3
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,660
I made some fruitcake as
sort of a peace offering.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,310
What's-are you all right?

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm rachel ben natan,your
burn rehabilitation counselor.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,320
How did it happen?

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,640
I sat down across the table from a very
handsome boy when he blew himself up.

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,410
Who knows you're screwing each other?

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,730
We love each other,sean.

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,460
I see some kind of calcification.

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,190
Well,rachel's not a complainer,dad.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,390
She's been through enough surgeries
that if she says the pain's bad.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,000
Ok.

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,220
Let's see.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,760
How does this-

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,110
We call that exquisite tenderness.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,740
Pain so bad it's been
causing me nightmares.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,560
I've been waking up
all edgy and hopeless.

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,860
The fact that the pain is shooting
indicates to me that it's a neuroma,

20
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,380
which means that the calcification
has severed the nerve,

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,020
and the 2 ends are trying to fuse,

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,240
but they've turned in on
themselves and become a ball.

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,690
Can you repair it
enough to stop the pain?

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,890
Absolutely.

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,210
We would,uh,reset the neuroma,harvest
a section of nerve from your leg,

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,420
which we would then use to bridge
that gap between the 2 nerve endings.

27
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,590
You need to remove a 
nerve from my leg?

28
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,211
Well,um,dad's one of the top

29
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,350
cranio-maxillo-facial
guys in the country.

30
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,200
Interesting.

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,950
So you do want surgery.

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,530
You just prefer daddy number
one over daddy number 2.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,350
It's cool. I get it.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,080
I'm not here for facial
reconstruction,dr. Troy.

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,440
We're fine here,christian.

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,790
I have it covered.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,500
Okey-dokey.

38
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,850
So how you doin',mattie?

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,320
Ah,gettin' better every day
with rachel's encouragement.

40
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,500
Well,that's good.

41
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,700
What's this?

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,960
I said we're good here.

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,140
Ok.

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,390
Looks like a tooth to me,big guy.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,250
Jesus. How did I miss that?

46
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,010
Based on the architecture of the
shape,I'd say it's a central incisor.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,790
Right.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,650
Must be one of yours dislodged
from the blast or something.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
No.

50
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,960
I lost 8 teeth in the
bombing,but no incisors.

51
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,680
No wonder I'm 
having nightmares.

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,970
My bomber is alive and
well,living inside of me.

15 blade.

57
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,970
The B.P.Is 180 over 60 and dropping.

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,130
Dr. Casey,I need that toe now.

59
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,830
Bone cutter.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,020
B.P.190 over 50.

61
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,860
Cut the toe,doctor!

62
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,160
Which one do you want?

63
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,610
We are rebuilding this
woman's clitoris,doctor.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,150
There was a terrible car accident.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,690
The vaginal canal was
severed by a gearshift.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,790
I'd say the big one.

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,530
I want this woman coming hard.

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Cut!

69
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,910
Damn it,he needs more class,
you know.

70
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,380
Think clooney.

71
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,350
I think you should
give the lines to sean.

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,810
Dawn,darling,I'm the director.

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,860
I say,"cut. "

74
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,990
If you have a problem,wait
until after the take,

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,930
and then we can discuss it.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,660
Yeah. Well,you know what?

77
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,990
Time is money,nigel,my money.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,930
I agreed to pay for all
the overages on this show,

79
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,420
which are considerable,in
exchange for a producer credit.

80
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,960
If I want your opinion,the
topic'll be bad teeth.

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,960
And,you,you know,this story
already strains credibility.

82
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,640
Can you try some freakin' reality?

83
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,200
I don't understand how they
let this beast on the lot,ok?

84
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,710
I mean,they don't let 
animals in here.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,470
Director,why don't 
you do something?

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Dawn-excuse me.

87
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,500
Dawn,this is a medically 
accurate story.

88
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,981
Uh,christian and I
operated on a woman who

89
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:12,630
suffered a female castration
in her native village.

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,700
You see that?

91
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,170
That is the way you play a leading man.

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,010
He has the courage of his
convictions,yet he is classy.

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,800
He is always classy.

94
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,670
I believe everything I say. I trained-

95
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,300
I have some good news.

96
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,700
I have some bad news here,freddie.

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,810
Glad you showed up,ok,

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,990
because your twin over here is trying
to mess up all of my magic sauce.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,050
Timeout. I really do
- I wanna share my victory.

100
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,080
As of today,we have officially
become a cultural phenomenon.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,747
I just got off the phone with the grand

102
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:45,570
marshal of the west
hollywood gay pride parade,

103
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,080
asking us if we would like
to ride on our own float!

104
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,460
Why would you wanna ride
in that parade,freddie?

105
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,350
Um,butter bean,it's not easy to grasp.

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,880
When you get embraced by the gays,

107
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,100
you officially become a card-carrying
member of the zeitgeist club.

108
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,600
No man of mine is ridin'
in a fruit float,freddie.

109
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,060
Hey,don't you call homosexuals fruits.

110
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,060
Don't you dare,woman.

111
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,720
I am loved by the homosexual community,

112
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,590
and I for one-freddie migh-I'm
gonna- I won't stand for it.

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,060
You know,sweetie,your publicist
got you a cover of out.

114
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,860
You know why?

115
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,540
They passed at people and us.

116
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,110
Big shit,ok?

117
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,070
Listen,I'm straight out of
the park,but I'm no bigot.

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,110
Bigots always say that.

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,370
- No,listen,
- Bigots always say that.

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,460
No,this is not personal.

121
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,390
It's not.

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,050
I know a lot of gay
people-my hairdresser.

123
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,340
- Oh,really?
- My stylist.

124
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,320
- Good for you!
- She does.

125
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,360
- How about father fabrizi from st. Simon's?
- Oh,father? How is he doing?

126
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,700
He gave me my first holy communion.

127
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,640
It was a fantastic event,just
for your information.

128
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,190
But see,we have to remember,darling,we
have o-our fan base.

129
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,290
What about the god-fearing
part of our fan base,freddie?

130
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,350
Start thinkin' like
a producer,sweetheart.

131
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,330
This parade could
really hurt your program.

132
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,530
I'm going back to my office,where
there are no buzz-killers.

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
- Um,freddie.
- What?

134
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,910
- Freddie.
- What?

135
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,603
Maybe-maybe all your girl
needs is an invitation

136
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,340
to sit up there next to you on the
- on the float.

137
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,380
Is that it,petal?

138
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,440
Well.

139
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,620
Is that all it is,because,honey-no,no,

140
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,480
because it's our first year,they
just give us a little,tiny float.

141
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,340
It's a tiny,little float,and there's
only room at the top for me and aidie,ok?

142
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,100
Back to work,everybody.

143
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,760
Yeah. What the hell
are you lookin' at,huh?

144
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,790
Chop-chop,people.

145
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,180
We got a clit to build.

146
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,190
Oh,my god!

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,070
What? What?

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,270
Oh,jesus!

149
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,390
Jesus!

150
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,650
What ha-what? Did i
knock you or something?

151
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,200
No,it's my third one in 2 days.

152
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,170
Maybe you need a humidifier in your
room at the chateau or something.

153
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,410
No. I don't think it's the dryness.

154
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,100
You know,sometimes
- no.

155
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,750
Nosebleeds are a sign of
elevated blood pressure.

156
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
Do you have a cuff or something?

157
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,220
We been to an internist,a
neurologist,a gastroenterologist.

158
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,600
Nobody thinks you're sick.

159
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,230
It's becoming pretty obvious.

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,270
I'm sorry. What is becoming obvious?

161
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,350
You're avoiding something!

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,690
You're hiding behind
these symptoms,all right?

163
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,360
I think you're scared to tell
olivia,because you're scared of us.

164
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,500
You finally get what you
want,and you can't handle it.

165
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,100
You are just
- you're such a bully.

166
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,180
No. I'm the only person
who tells you the truth.

167
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,700
Look,you're a grown woman,and you're
acting like a neurotic teenager.

168
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,920
You know,quite frankly,I'm
gettin' pissed off.

169
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah,well,you have
certainly pissed me off.

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,130
Jesus.

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,840
Look,I'm just frustrated,you know.

172
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,690
I just f-feel like I've
waited so long,you know?

173
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,240
I just want it to be us,you know?

174
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,460
Can you please forgive me?

175
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,930
Please.

176
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,070
Would you like your messages,dr. Troy?

177
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,690
And you are?

178
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,510
I'm betina,your new receptionist.

179
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,460
They're great,right?

180
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,260
They're not bad.

181
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,410
Who did them?

182
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,790
Dr. Sacks.

183
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,040
He's known for preserving full
sensitivity in the nipple area.

184
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,140
You need to fire the
new receptionist today.

185
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,170
Why?

186
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,480
She's bright,well educated,and
she's got a great attitude.

187
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,650
You didn't hire her
because of her M.B.A.

188
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,550
You hired her because you knew those
tits would be like catnip to me.

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,650
You're tryin' to sabotage me.

190
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,000
You know,I'll fall into my
old patterns,cheat on julia,

191
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,900
our relationship will blow up,

192
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,730
and you'll come swooping in like
some kind of knight in shining armor.

193
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,490
I don't have to lift a finger
to blow up your relationship.

194
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,750
You'll detonate it all by yourself.

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,900
Don't be a petty bitch.

196
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,950
Just fire her.

197
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,060
Do it yourself.

198
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,930
I already tripped over
those tits on my way in,ok?

199
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,020
She'll file for some kind of
harassment suit or something.

200
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,330
Sucks to be you,doesn't it?

201
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,820
I've been reading about suicide bombers.

202
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,390
They say most of 'em are
educated,hold down jobs,

203
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,140
and have no criminal history.

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,833
They make it sound like
almost anyone could be

205
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,990
a suicide bomber under
the right circumstances.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,074
Well,most of them are
raised in a misogynist

207
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,010
society and live in
cells with other men.

208
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,580
Imagine the thwarted testosterone
totally devoid of love and affection,

209
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,710
tenderness,all that
repression and bitterness.

210
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,610
Kinda like life at the
malibu compound,huh?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,410
That is my tooth.

212
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,330
You know,we're all smiling the
second before we blow ourselves up.

213
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
We need to clean this area.

214
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,240
God knows what filth the
bomber had in his mouth.

215
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,570
I looked around me at all the
students eating their lunch,

216
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,540
so arrogant,so sure that this
cafeteria belonged to them.

217
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,249
This cafeteria built
on land that belonged

218
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,300
to me was a source of happiness to them.

219
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,010
I looked at her smiling at me,

220
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,350
no cares at all except
for her own selfish desire.

221
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,230
Just before I push a detonator,

222
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,840
I ask allah to purify my spirit
and bless my mission so that

223
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,300
I can take out as many
students as possible with me.

224
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,220
And then all in an instant,

225
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,940
an exquisite and majestic instant,

226
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,650
all earthly pain exploded
into a million pieces.

227
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,890
The door to heaven
opened,and I was free.

228
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,930
I was free.

229
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,910
Come out to the beach. I'll take a look.

230
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,400
Uh,the spot's inflamed?

231
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,560
Any pus?

232
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,380
Well,I tell you what.

233
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,300
Why don't you let olivia apply
the goddamn calamine lotion?

234
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,810
Morning.

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,490
Would you like your messages?

236
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,360
Yes,in my office.

237
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,070
Who else called?

238
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,500
Your hairstylist.

239
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,050
She said it's time for a
trim,but it looks good to me.

240
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,180
And?

241
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,500
And the health club called.

242
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,540
God,you're in great shape.

243
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,100
Dr. Troy's office.

244
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,460
Can you hold,please?

245
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,650
Julie called.

246
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,390
She's not feeling good.

247
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,530
Oh,doctor.

248
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,630
Oh,doctor.

249
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,790
It's julia.

250
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,370
Not julie.

251
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,665
How can you even call
yourself a receptionist

252
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,220
when you can't say people's names right?

253
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,490
Are you-huh?

254
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,860
You're stupid.

255
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,960
What?

256
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,120
Be out of here by lunch.

257
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,590
You're fired.

258
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,270
Mr. Seidel,

259
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,260
dr. Mcnamara.

260
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,230
Pleasure to meet you.

261
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,290
Why don't you come back to my offi-

262
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,270
I need to talk to you.

263
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,610
Rachel,I have an appointment. I just-

264
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,900
He's still inside me.

265
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,590
He can't stay inside me.

266
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,050
Ok,I'm gonna ask nurse
linda to give you a sedative.

267
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,790
You can wait comfortably in recovery.

268
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,610
I'll get to you within the hou-

269
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,510
No!

270
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Think if a pill could
do the trick,I'd be here?

271
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,350
I haven't slept in 4 days.

272
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,960
She survived the blast,but
I can still ruin her life.

273
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,090
That's ok,doctor.

274
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,410
I can wait.

275
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,110
Thank you.

276
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,460
I don't know who I am.

277
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,020
I never raise my voice.

278
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm the one who makes
jokes to get my way.

279
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,070
Something's going on I can't control.

280
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,890
Did you ever feel like your anger
was a physical presence inside you,

281
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,650
like you're possessed?

282
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,560
Ok,ok.

283
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,610
Take a breath.

284
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,910
Sit down.

285
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,110
Tell me what's going on.

286
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,472
After the explosion,there was a lot of

287
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:21,280
detritus left inside
me,you know,fragments.

288
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,590
The doctor said we didn't
need to remove them,

289
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,460
that the metal shavings would work
their way out naturally over time.

290
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,440
And so many great things happened to me.

291
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,440
I came here.

292
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,820
I found my work.

293
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,520
I made a certain peace with my new face.

294
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,800
I actually had hope.

295
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,100
Rachel,you're a survivor.

296
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,720
You have a powerful spirit.

297
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,910
Nothing can change that.

298
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,060
And the cliches just keep on coming.

299
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,500
There are some wounds
that do not heal,you know!

300
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,050
You're not listening to me.

301
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,810
After I found out about this
tooth inside me,I did a body scan.

302
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,330
I was suddenly sure the fragments
inside me were not just metal.

303
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,650
I was right.

304
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,340
I am riddled with him.

305
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,080
He's human shrapnel.

306
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,710
Saaed hotary's bones
and tissue are inside me.

307
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,210
His anger and his
hatred are destroying me.

308
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,200
Please,take him out of me.

309
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,370
What are you doing here?

310
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,480
You're being ridiculous.

311
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,610
Why keep her under
for twice as long when

312
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,730
I can assist and cut
the surgery in half?

313
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,830
This should be treated as medical waste.

314
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,110
Technically those are the
remains of a dead person.

315
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,680
I think we should notify somebody.

316
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,510
My mother would like those.

317
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,580
Maybe she'll put them in
an urn in the living room,

318
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,150
and they'll inspire my
little brother to follow me.

319
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,430
Sure. Send the boy's bones
home to his nice family.

320
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,800
They may be
terrorists,but,hey,they're only human,

321
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,520
Didn't I fire you earlier?

322
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,080
She's still here,because apparently you
made an inappropriate sexual overture.

323
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,420
Rather than deal with a
lawsuit,I asked her back.

324
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,370
Could you excuse us for a moment,please?

325
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,830
You need to deal with
your resentment and anger.

326
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,770
What can I do to move this along?

327
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,260
Maybe try to avoid my
sightlines,definitely my surgeries-

328
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,760
Do we need some kind of mediator?

329
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,170
No.

330
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,150
You're right.

331
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,200
I'll work something out with
betina,some kind of payout,

332
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,220
and I'll find a suitable replacement.

333
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,010
Good.

334
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,120
Sorry to interrupt,but,uh,dawn budge
and her fiance are in your office.

335
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,270
They're in my office.

336
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,470
She's my friend.

337
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,300
I'm out for blood.

338
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,995
That lame lezzie is gonna
regret gettin' out of

339
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,340
bed and gettin' on her
harley,let me tell you.

340
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,430
I feel like this is all my fault.

341
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,770
This happened at the gay pride parade?

342
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,620
Can you believe it?

343
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,380
Something so terrible
on such a beautiful day.

344
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,090
Everybody was-was bursting
with joy,creativity,

345
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,950
the freedom to-to be themselves.

346
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,320
I guess I just got
caught up with the fans.

347
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,470
You certainly did get caught up.

348
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,170
The hearts 'n scalpels
float was next to last.

349
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,230
I was behind the protestors.

350
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,210
You were protesting?

351
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,260
Dawn,why would you do that?

352
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,250
I said I was behind the
protestors,dr. Troy,not a protestor.

353
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,620
I also wanted to be
close by just in case,

354
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,750
you know,he got dosed
and taken advantage of.

355
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,530
Dosed?

356
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah.

357
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,830
Roofies or some shit.

358
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,010
Dawnie,I was never in any danger
of being drugged by the gays.

359
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,700
I just wanted to make sure that
violation did not occur on my watch.

360
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,480
Freddie!

361
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,910
I was so concerned about
freddie's reputation,

362
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
what with the television
camera crews and all,

363
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,065
that I failed to notice
the approaching deadly

364
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:29,280
posse of ladies on their
hogs vroomin' by me.

365
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,390
Freddie!

366
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,120
Get your-freddie!

367
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,850
Freddie,keep your shirt-

368
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,580
Let me-

369
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,020
She purposefully ran me over.

370
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,380
Back up,people.

371
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,610
Give her some air.

372
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,060
I'm gonna take her house.

373
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,630
I'm going to take her power tools.

374
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,340
I'm gonna take her K.D. Lang cds.

375
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,530
If you ran right in front of her,dawn,

376
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,990
I can't imagine she did it on purpose.

377
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,520
And,sweetheart,she felt terrible.

378
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,520
She was so upset,she was crying.

379
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,720
Who is the injured party here?

380
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,400
I think dawn's outrage is
perfectly understandable.

381
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,190
She's got a face full of gravel.

382
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,260
She's lucky she's not
hemorrhaging internally.

383
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,660
Why is the onus on her to forgive?

384
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,340
Bravo,doctor.

385
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,870
It's a start.

386
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
Ok,camille.

387
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,730
If this doesn't make you feel better.

388
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,690
then I'm no doctor.

389
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,160
Sushi.

390
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,690
My favorite.

391
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,330
Oh,just a sip for me.

392
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,200
Just a sip.

393
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,590
Thank you.

394
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,480
Complain away if you
need to. I'm all ears.

395
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,300
And I promise nothing you say is boring.

396
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,370
How are you feeling,julia?

397
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm fine.

398
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,180
Um,better.

399
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,600
Christian brought home sushi.

400
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,640
Come on. Sit down,buddy. Have some sake.

401
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,910
Actually,I,uh-I want
to talk to you guys.

402
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,070
Good.

403
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,040
We should talk.

404
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,370
You two need your space.

405
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,920
I've decided to move out.

406
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,310
There was this sensationally
talented young man.

407
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,390
He was all dressed up like cher,

408
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,510
and he was singing if
you could turn back time.

409
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,930
I swear to god I thought it was her.

410
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,220
It was uncanny.

411
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,530
I- I wish
you'd have been-

412
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,260
mom,I've gotta call you back.

413
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,340
I love you.

414
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,840
How's my dawnie?

415
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,910
Oh,she's as good as new.

416
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,210
She's a little groggy.

417
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,310
You wanna come see her?

418
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,380
Of course I do.

419
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,440
You look good.

420
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,280
Freddie,I saw you at the parade.

421
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,760
I was there.

422
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,070
- Really?
- Oh,yeah.

423
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,880
You were happy like a pig in shit.

424
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,830
You were feelin' the pride,huh?

425
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,100
Oh,and I do.

426
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,390
I- I'm so proud of our
show,and-and the gays,

427
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,400
they've just been wonderful,the
way they've embraced us.

428
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,940
Freddie,look into my eyes and
tell me that you are not gay.

429
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,910
Um,you're lookin' away.

430
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,410
Uh,excu-excuse
me,but,um-

431
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,180
Aren't you sick of holding it all in?

432
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,090
Don't you wanna blow it sky-high
and be who you really are?

433
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,490
If you could have seen
yourself on that float.

434
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,540
You were beautiful.

435
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,540
No-do you have any takeout
menus at this clinic?

436
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,450
Um,dawnie and I have been
through such a traumatic event,

437
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,240
and we need a snack,a yummy snack.

438
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,550
The remains of saaed hotary.

439
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,270
Saaed hotary.

440
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,290
A suicide bomber.

441
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,318
My mother's still mourning the fact that

442
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,450
i don't look like
natalie portman anymore.

443
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,600
And I know your mother's really proud.

444
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,590
I thought it would be
easier once he was out of me.

445
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,970
That's why you're returning the
remains to his family,isn't it?

446
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,360
Look,hopefully this can be the
last chapter,rachel,forgiveness.

447
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,360
I hope so.

448
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,250
No,forgetting is easy.

449
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,410
Forgiveness is really,really hard.

450
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,230
You don't have to do this,you know.

451
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,490
It's not required.

452
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,510
No,I made a commitment to myself.

453
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,870
I'm in awe of your efforts,rachel.

454
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,220
I really am.

455
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,770
These are his parents-fayed
and reem hotary,

456
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,000
314 jerusalem road,ramallah,palestine.

457
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,050
"A hate crime is when a
perpetrator targets a victim

458
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,550
because of his or her membership
in a certain social group,

459
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,410
which is defined by race,religion
- " thank you.

460
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,920
"Ethnicity,gender identity,or
political affiliation. "

461
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,340
Honey,I was targeted by a
heterophobic,right,freddie?

462
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,340
I mean,think about it. It's right there.

463
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,340
Oh,speak of the devil.

464
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,180
Look who has the nerve to show up here.

465
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,630
Freddie,it is her.

466
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,640
It is her,the woman who ran over my
face and made it look like lunchmeat.

467
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,790
Freddie.

468
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,090
well,shame on you,sister.

469
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,220
Dawn and freddie,you
are being ridiculous.

470
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,720
This woman is not hannibal lecter.

471
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,900
Her name is jan tooney,

472
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,550
and she showed up asking
if she could speak to you.

473
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,930
You need to listen to
what she has to say.

474
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,110
You are takin' advantage of my
kind and generous nature,liz.

475
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,530
Fine.

476
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,700
You got 3 minutes,honey,and
it better be good.

477
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,340
I
- I appreciate your time.

478
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,290
To begin with,I'm very sorry.

479
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,120
See,what happened was-is
my bike's a crotch rocket,

480
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,630
you know,real fast,

481
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,846
and I told 'em I was
havin' clutch problems

482
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:07,690
and that I probably
shouldn't be up front,

483
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,650
in case somethin' like
this happened,which it did.

484
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,170
A bad clutch?

485
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,710
A lame lie if I ever heard one.

486
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,750
Well,my mistake was lettin' my
pride in my bike cloud my judgment.

487
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,050
I should have said no.

488
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,180
See,the thing is-is I've got a kid.

489
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,990
Her name's felicity.

490
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
What,is she one of those
turkey-baster babies?

491
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,220
Dawn! Dawnie.

492
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,220
What?

493
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,650
That's not nice.

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh,believe it or not,I was married.

495
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,920
I- I was a soccer mom in
my previous life,and I-

496
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,800
anyway,she got accepted
early admissions to yale,

497
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,800
and she's a good kid.

498
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,560
She's a good girl,and she
worked real hard to get in,

499
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,090
and so if you sue me,she's
the one who gets screwed.

500
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,474
Well,maybe you should have thought about

501
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,520
that before you
accelerated over my face.

502
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,000
Sweetheart,I think we all know by now

503
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,460
that ms. Tooney did not
accelerate on purpose.

504
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,540
Whose side are you on,freddie?

505
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,590
W- I just-this
is so unlike you.

506
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,390
I've never seen you like this.

507
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,520
It
- you're simply not yourself.

508
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,360
Is it possible that you
are angry at somebody

509
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:20,990
else and are acting it
out on this poor lady?

510
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,800
Someone like me,for instance?

511
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,300
Why would I be angry at
you,freddie christopher prune?

512
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,360
Ok,you know what,jan?

513
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,650
Let's give them a minute.

514
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,270
Ok?

515
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,220
Dawn,I think you're struggling
with a subconscious fear that

516
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,900
I'm gay that you're sublimating
into a vendetta against jan tooney.

517
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,430
There. I said it.

518
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,120
Subconscious?

519
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,430
Honey,I've been dreadin' this day since
the moment I fell in love with you,

520
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,520
and I knew if you went
to that gay parade,

521
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,200
that would be the end of us.

522
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,980
I- I never imagined it would be
such a glorious and profound event.

523
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,150
All the dancing and the
music and the feathers

524
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,240
and all these beautiful souls waving
at me and sending me so much love,

525
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,708
and they all just seemed so brave

526
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:29,240
and so unafraid to be who they were.

527
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,610
I felt this profound sense of
freedom,and all of a sudden,

528
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,037
my people's choice award just wasn't the

529
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,270
most important thing in my life anymore,

530
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,480
and that's when the light bulb went on.

531
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,430
The gay light bulb.

532
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,580
Oh,honey.

533
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,770
How did you know before I did?

534
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,110
Oh,it's the story of my life,sweetie.

535
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,940
You're not the first one.

536
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,010
I been fallin' in love with gay
boys since high school,you know.

537
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,500
They were the only ones
who seemed to get me.

538
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,920
They would laugh at all of my
jokes,spend time givin' me makeovers.

539
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,590
Oh,for hours,we would listen
to my streisand records.

540
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,110
I knew you were too good to be true.

541
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,670
Really,but I was just so lonely.

542
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,270
Dawnie,I will always love you.

543
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,340
I don't deserve your love,freddie.

544
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh,yes,you do.

545
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,590
I really don'T.

546
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,960
I talk a good game about
unconditional love,but you know,

547
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,480
I spend my nights at a
church lightin' a candle,

548
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,360
prayin' to god that you
don't come out of the closet.

549
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,410
What kind of love is that?

550
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,830
And I'm not a homophobic person,freddie.

551
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,130
I'm not. I'm just jealous,you know.

552
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,260
All you guys,you seem to know
where you belong,where you fit,

553
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,410
what club you're a member of,

554
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,050
but me,I'm not so sure.

555
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,800
Aw,sweetie.

556
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,180
I wish I could take your pain away.

557
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,280
That's just what tony famigliano said
when he left me for the tight end.

558
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,810
Hey,asshole.

559
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,400
To what shitty twist of fate do
I owe this extreme displeasure?

560
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,730
Sean called.

561
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,070
He offered me the job of receptionist.

562
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,380
Gina fits the job description perfectly,

563
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,710
if you recall your mandate.

564
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,633
Oh,you mean someone so
hideous that I'd never

565
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:41,180
even in the pain of death
be tempted to screw them.

566
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,030
That mandate?

567
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,850
Who wants to screw you,asshole?

568
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,320
I just got my california
real estate license,

569
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,540
and I thought what better place
to meet clients than in your lobby.

570
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,290
why don't you start off by
meeting people down at the carwash?

571
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,620
My lamborghini needs detailing.

572
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,470
Sure.

573
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,850
Your wish is my command,boss.

574
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,780
You know what they say
about holding a grudge?

575
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,700
It's like taking poison
expecting the other person to die.

576
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,920
I thought gina was a stroke of genius.

577
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,740
Not only is she not screwable,

578
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,490
but you've got
built-in child-care.

579
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,670
You and my ex-wife can
have more alone time.

580
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,930
Oh,why don't you stop being such a
bitchy little cheerleader,all right?

581
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,990
Let's get it all out right now,huh?

582
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Just say it to my face.

583
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,020
Come on.

584
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,760
Nothing I wanna say.

585
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,980
You're such a passive-aggressive
little shit,aren't you?

586
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,350
You can't even say it,can you?

587
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,900
You can't say it.

588
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,200
I'm done here.

589
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,590
Say it. You're not done here.

590
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,270
Do not touch me.

591
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,990
I'm sick of your
holier-than-thou bullshit.

592
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,700
I'm not gonna apologize-

593
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,090
She's all yours!

594
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,680
Just both of you leave me alone!

595
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,910
We gotta deal with this,sean.

596
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,470
Just an asshole.

597
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,310
What is going-stop it!

598
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,730
What is going on?

599
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,060
Stop! Oh,my god!

600
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,660
Idiots,stop!

601
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,710
Stop!

602
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,280
Damn it,boys.

603
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,950
You wanna take any of these?

604
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,770
Aw,no. They're all from freddie.

605
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,680
Just makes me sad,really.

606
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,160
You can have whatever you want.

607
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,770
Listen,do you mind if we
make a little stop here?

608
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,850
Just wanna show you somethin'.

609
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,190
just open that for me if you don't mind.

610
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,640
State-of-the-art
hog.

611
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,690
Dawn,I know that you feel
guilty about your behavior,

612
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,210
but I have a news flash for you.

613
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,290
Not all lesbians ride motorcycles.

614
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,250
I never got past my training wheels.

615
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,270
I know I owe you an apology,liz,but
the bike ain't for you.

616
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,020
It's for jan tooney.

617
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,310
You gotta be kiddin'.

618
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,220
No,it is,and it's a nice one,too,

619
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,440
so tell her no wheelies,ok,whatsoever.

620
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,250
Go ahead. Look at the card.

621
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,150
$30,000?

622
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,310
$30,000?

623
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,920
A year's tuition at yale.

624
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,030
I couldn't put my own kid
through college,so what the hell?

625
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,230
Dawn!

626
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,620
Listen,liz,I know I haven't
been really gracious with you,

627
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,030
so there's somethin' I gotta do.

628
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,030
The bad juju'll ruin
your health. I know that.

629
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,250
I hope that you can forgive me,too.

630
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,510
I really didn't mean those
things I said about you.

631
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,030
I should hope not.

632
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,080
It was making me feel
very uncomfortable.

633
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,760
It was like I was walkin'
around with a hostile kidney.

634
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,820
Come on,listen. I got a new
idea I wanna tell you about.

635
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,191
I'm thinkin' of puttin' my considerable

636
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:16,570
wealth and style behind
the-you know pflag?

637
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,210
Yeah.

638
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,240
The parents and friends.

639
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,780
Of the lezzies and the gays.

640
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,550
Well,I'm thinkin' of doin' odflag.

641
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,880
Odflag?

642
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,860
Odflag.

643
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,000
"Organ donors" is what the O.D.Is for.

644
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,580
Oh,that is brilliant,dawn.

645
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,364
Yes,thank you,because I think all of us

646
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:32,320
who have given our
body parts,our hearts,

647
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,980
and our soul to you gays,we
could all get together.

648
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,130
I think we're looking at 6 or 7
surgeries to restore your face.

649
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,600
We'd do a bone graft from
your skull to rebuild the nose,

650
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,850
but we'd start by
inserting tissue expanders-

651
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,960
what,matt?

652
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,340
Uh,dad,come on.

653
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,730
You look like you just went
10 rounds with mike tyson.

654
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,420
You should see the other guy.

655
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah,no,I talked to christian.

656
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,430
I know the whole story.

657
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,810
Look,I-I can't imagine what
that must be like for you.

658
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,220
I mean,christian being with mom now?

659
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,615
It's hard even for me,but still,you guys

660
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:14,060
have got to deal with this like adults.

661
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,760
I appreciate your concern,matt,but
we're not here to talk about me.

662
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,080
We're here to talk about rachel.

663
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,510
So let's talk about the
financial end of this.

664
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,700
Uh,people in your line of
work are famously underpaid.

665
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,380
Yeah,no,I told her you might
be willing to do this pro bono.

666
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,050
Matt,I can speak for myself.

667
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,910
Look.

668
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,460
Dad,if ever there was
somebody worthy-I mean,

669
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,210
she's become such an inspiration
for others and especially for me.

670
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,240
Matt,I'd like to speak
with rachel alone.

671
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,630
Could you give us a minute?

672
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,530
Ok.

673
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Uh,I'll be outside.

674
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,540
Rachel,between us,

675
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,140
what are your expectations
from this series of surgeries?

676
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,687
Something's,um,shifted in me since

677
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:16,580
my bomber's gone,dr. Mcnamara.

678
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,870
I've begun to think about a real life.

679
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,888
I've actually allowed
myself to have fantasies

680
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:25,110
about a life with love in it,you know.

681
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,620
Are you in love with matt?

682
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,110
Is he in love with you?

683
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,770
We don't discuss things like that.

684
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,600
We're just good friends.

685
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,350
Facial reconstruction is a long,

686
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,890
painful road filled with
huge psychological challenges.

687
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:55,220
You've had so much pain already
in your life,so much brutality.

688
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,410
I guess I just wanna be certain
that your expectations are realistic.

689
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,509
You need to be honest
with yourself whether

690
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,450
you're doing this for
you or someone else.

691
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,470
Listen,your son's a great guy,but
he's not the only fish in the sea.

692
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,120
As far as pain goes,I'm not afraid.

693
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,730
I've lived through the worst there is.

694
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,180
The pain of being betrayed
by someone you love

695
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,440
could in some ways be
worse than physical pain.

696
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,530
That's what your black
eye's about,isn't it,

697
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,140
a betrayal?

698
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,190
Because I'll tell you,when I sent
those remains off to palestine,

699
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,870
I slept through the night for the
first time since the explosion.

700
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,810
The trick is forgiving the unforgivable.

701
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,430
Let me do that.

702
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,290
Remember when we moved into
the dorm room junior year

703
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,860
and we dropped that
400-pound desk on my foot?

704
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,880
You were such a
baby,screaming,carrying on.

705
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,740
You were the first person who
ever really looked out for me.

706
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,890
My mom could handle only
so much when my dad left.

707
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,630
You carried me into that emergency room.

708
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:52,810
I felt so covered,like you
were the brother I never had.

709
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:02,570
Then julia showed up with margaritas
camouflaged in coffee cups.

710
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,790
You're a betraying son
of a bitch,christian.

711
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,320
but you still are my brother,

712
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,550
and I know you're just
tryin' to be happy.

713
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,710
I see you have rachel
ben natan on the schedule.

714
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,910
It's a big surgery.

715
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,550
Maybe you could use
an extra set of hands.

716
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,450
Yes,I could.
