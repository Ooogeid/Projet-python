1
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:53,136
The Albert Poland award.

2
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:55,746
Do you know how many doctors
have won that thing,

3
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:57,841
and then, they've gone on
to win the nobel?

4
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,663
Well, that's what
I'm talking about.

5
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,055
We are back in black,
buddy boy.

6
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:05,575
Nobody we care about is
dying and/or incarcerated, right?

7
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,833
We're about to head back
to our Alma mater and...

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,347
rub their snotty little noses in it.
I'm very excited.

9
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,881
Oh, come on.
It's not that big a deal.

10
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,202
- Oh. Excuse me. Ok. Lizzie?
- Yeah?

11
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,655
Would you just read this to him, ok?
Mr. Humble pie over there?

12
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,560
- I certainly shall.
- Ok.

13
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,108
"Dear. Dr. Mcnamara
and Dr. Troy,

14
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,081
for 40 years,
the university of Miami...

15
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,283
has been bestowing
the Albert Poland award...

16
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:35,114
to those physicians who have
made significant contributions...

17
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:38,059
to their medical profession
in their chosen fields."

18
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:40,944
- Significant contributions.
- Yes. Yes.

19
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:43,436
But isn't it kind of a lifetime
achievement award?

20
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:46,471
I'm 45. These things are supposed
to happen when you're 80.

21
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,257
What's the matter with this guy?
Ever since we met,

22
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,418
he's had this dark cloud
just hovering over him.

23
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:52,941
Well, the cloud
was called reality.

24
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,846
We were pre-med students.

25
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,816
It was non-stop
pressure and misery.

26
00:01:56,936 --> 00:02:00,039
And you spent your days just
whistling past the graveyard.

27
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,713
Want a bite?

28
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:05,713
Sean McNamara, right?

29
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,573
Christian Troy.

30
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,438
I'm pre-med, too.
We're in all the same classes.

31
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,149
I don't remember
seeing you.

32
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,200
Oh, yeah.
I have attendance issues.

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,257
But that is going to change.

34
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,435
Sophomore year, and I'm
turning over a new leaf.

35
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,166
And with that in mind,

36
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:27,893
my roommate just had
a breakdown or something,

37
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,716
and I've got an extra bed.

38
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,803
You want to bunk together?

39
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:34,504
I mean, I figured,
since we're in the same classes,

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,500
we can cram for exams,
help each other out with labs.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,552
And I suppose the fact that
I'm number one in our class...

42
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,562
has nothing to do
with your request.

43
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,403
Of course not.

44
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:49,423
- What number are you?
- 42, with a bullet.

45
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,320
Solidly in the middle.

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,225
Oh, sure,
now I am.

47
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,575
This is just school.
It's bullshit. I...

48
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,619
am the only guy here
who has seen the future of medicine.

49
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,261
Don't you get it?
This...

50
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,757
is the new ideal...
Barbie dolls,

51
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:10,165
plasticized,
flawless women, and...

52
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:11,861
it is catching
on with men, too.

53
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,704
- Plastic surgery.
- The way of the future.

54
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,141
It sounds like
meaningful work.

55
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,629
Oh, what, slaving away for
some insurance company for pennies...

56
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:20,516
while you grab some old guy's balls
and say "cough" is your dream?

57
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,690
No, but saving lives is.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,469
Making a difference
with my work.

59
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,366
You might want to consider
a different major.

60
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,218
And what would you suggest?

61
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:31,301
Do they offer courses
in used car sales?

62
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,790
How did I get him to room
with me? I blew him!

63
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,690
Seriously, you know me.
I didn't take no for an answer, eh?

64
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,702
You know what?
He harassed me.

65
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:47,264
Eventually, I agreed
just to shut him up.

66
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,325
And the rest...

67
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:52,962
the rest is history, right?

68
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:58,962
To another 25.

69
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:00,665
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

70
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,250
Cheers.

76
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,368
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself, Mr. Daly.

77
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,789
Go to hell, dickhead.

78
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,715
Dan.

79
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,291
He didn't mean to be
condescending. It's just...

80
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,801
- our way of...
- You too, shitface.

81
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,763
Uh-oh. Sorry. You can't
say that to the doctors.

82
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:14,282
The insults are just his way
of showing his admiration.

83
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:17,005
It's part of the condition
I mentioned on the phone.

84
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,013
Oh, yeah.
Uh, lesch-nyhan syndrome.

85
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,545
Had you heard of it before?

86
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,113
We did some research.

87
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,730
A rare genetic disorder
characterized by an excess of

88
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,317
uric acid in the blood.

89
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,668
Affecting the area of the brain
that governs impulse control.

90
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,606
Beside from
the muscle spasms,

91
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:36,974
the effects can often turn emotions
into opposing impulses.

92
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,030
Love is hate,

93
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,832
elation can become misery,
and admiration comes out as...

94
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:44,072
"Go to hell."

95
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,728
In that case,
we understand,

96
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,236
and it's a pleasure
to meet you too, Mr. Daly.

97
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,447
Can I see that...

98
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,355
thing on your desk?

99
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:56,925
You mean this?

100
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,082
I want it.
I really want it.

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,319
Sure.
You can have it...

102
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:05,330
I should have warned you...

103
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:09,766
self-mutilation is a primary
manifestation of the disorder.

104
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,554
You probably noticed that
with his lips already.

105
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,244
He chewed them off.

106
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:17,691
Asshole.
Oh, no.

107
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,891
It's why having a full-time person
to watch over him is essential...

108
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,395
which is...

109
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,940
not without its risks.

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,528
I... I don't want to hurt him,

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,341
but I... I can't stop myself,

112
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:38,275
even... when I... try.

113
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,806
It's just like
with my hands.

114
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:44,837
What happened
to your hands?

115
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,325
It started
when I was a kid.

116
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,885
They would just
make me so angry.

117
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,273
I had to have them gone.

118
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:15,170
I didn't even care
about the hurt.

119
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,721
I would have
lost them all...

120
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,960
if my mother hadn't
figured out a...

121
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:27,470
creative way
to make me stop.

122
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:34,978
Eventually,
they gave up on me.

123
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,882
They put me in a home.

124
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,894
I've been using assisted
living for 30 years.

125
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,303
If you hadn't,

126
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,419
you would have
killed yourself.

127
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,646
Most patients do.

128
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,539
Life expectancy is 45.

129
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,733
And you just turned 46.

130
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,890
Yeah.

131
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,087
I never thought
I'd make it...

132
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,169
that long.

133
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,714
But I did.

134
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,293
I did.

135
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:15,490
Now,
if we do fix your lips,

136
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,867
how do you know
it won't happen again?

137
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:20,957
We don't.

138
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,907
What do you mean "we don't",
asshole?

139
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,424
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,234
It's just...

141
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:37,057
I've been self-destructing
my whole life,

142
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:41,134
and despite all the odds,

143
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,481
I'm still...

144
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:45,456
here.

145
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,732
I think that means that
I deserve...

146
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,435
a fresh start.

147
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,670
Don't you?

148
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,077
Breaks my heart,
that guy.

149
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,814
This is one of those cases,
you know?

150
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,765
Makes me feel like
I actually did something,

151
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,955
earned that award.

152
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,730
You know what I like
about this case?

153
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,745
Sooner or later, nychen-schlichen is going
to bite those lips off again, and, well,

154
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:22,046
there's another 15 grand
from his trust fund in our pockets.

155
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,861
Do you have
any ideals anymore?

156
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,501
Any desire to heal or help?
I'm just asking.

157
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,988
Seanie, I was always a pragmatist
and a businessman, huh?

158
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:32,942
Did you ever hear me say
I wanted to save the world, hmm?

159
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:36,258
All I wanted was perks
and a glamorous lifestyle.

160
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:38,611
And you are never going
to guilt me or change me.

161
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,148
Don't you know that
by now?

162
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:42,202
I think I live in a kind of
denial about it.

163
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,594
Oh, come on.
Lighten up.

164
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:46,580
We're on the verge of
a great future here, my friend.

165
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,327
You're going to love the marble
I picked out for the retaining wall...

166
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,696
in the new recovery suite.
It is the perfect spot...

167
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:54,331
to showcase
the Albert Poland award.

168
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:00,349
Oh.
There you are, Christian.

169
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,856
- Put your eyes on this.
- Oh my...

170
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,129
Would you look at this?
It's so smooth, huh?

171
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,893
And decadent. Isn't it great, huh?
What do you think, Sean?

172
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,662
- How much is it?
- 1,500.

173
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:11,637
I love it.

174
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,310
Well, that's pretty good
for the whole wall.

175
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,884
A square foot.
It's chinchilla mink marble.

176
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:16,963
Forget it.

177
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,888
I agreed to this
because I thought a better,

178
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:21,602
state-of-the-art recovery suite
was a good idea.

179
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,546
But all this stuff...
the new lounge,

180
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,415
the marble wall
dividing the rooms...

181
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:29,377
10 times more chic than some
sloppy dividing curtain, my friend.

182
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,920
It's ostentatious.

183
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,107
It... is an investment,
all right?

184
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,711
This is rodeo drive.

185
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:37,652
We need the bling, my friend.
I love these colors.

186
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:40,978
For once, I'd like to be
ahead of the game financially...

187
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,445
instead of always having
debts over our heads.

188
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,465
And you want to put us back
in the hole for a wall...

189
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:47,577
that would serve the same
purpose if it was stucco.

190
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:51,389
I wasn't paid to do stucco, Sean.
You look cheap, you are cheap.

191
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,490
Uh, excuse me, Rebecca...

192
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:55,870
that's your name, right?

193
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,914
Um, what's with these skylights?

194
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:00,746
They're half the size that
I told you to make them.

195
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,152
Hi, hon.

196
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,086
Hi.

197
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,617
I downsized them.

198
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:07,746
Frankly, Mrs. Troy,
They were garish.

199
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,726
Oh.
Well,

200
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:12,832
they were actually modeled
after the ones Christian and I saw...

201
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,935
on our honeymoon
in provence, so...

202
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:17,500
you need to tear them out
and redo them now.

203
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,435
No. Just leave them
the way they are, ok?

204
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,327
It would cost thousands
to redo them.

205
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,872
Sean, you worry too much.

206
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,089
Besides, how can I do the Italian
motif in the new bathroom...

207
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,106
when I am out here
doing these?

208
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:29,530
What new bathroom?

209
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:31,773
Go look at it.
It's beautiful.

210
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:34,448
At least, it will be
when I'm done decorating it.

211
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,460
Sean...

212
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,515
Christian,

213
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,545
this one is going
to be a problem for me.

214
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,335
Why don't you just go talk
off the ledge,

215
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:46,594
please? Hmm?
Huh? Huh?

216
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,983
You don't have to worry
about Sean, ok?

217
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,585
- I'm not.
- Good.

218
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,410
But I don't care
how much you pay me,

219
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,960
I can't work
with that bitch.

220
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,060
Whoa.
That bitch is my wife.

221
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,094
Which is why you
should be thanking me.

222
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,123
For what?

223
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:04,646
For waiting for her to leave

224
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,175
before I told you that
I was pregnant, shitdick.

225
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,778
Nice job pulling out.

226
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,143
Nice work there, doc, huh?

227
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,858
That's why they say you got
the, uh, golden hands, huh?

228
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:11,473
They're the same color
they were yesterday.

229
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:13,428
Don't believe
your own hype.

230
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,769
I happen to admire
your hands,

231
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,056
which is why,
of all the surgeons in the country,

232
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,506
I'm going to ask you
to do my vasectomy.

233
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,756
Talk about
an unnecessary surgery.

234
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:28,488
Kimber can't even have
any kids anymore.

235
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,968
But our hot little
decorator can.

236
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,229
Apparently,
I have super sperm.

237
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,976
Every time I look at a chick,
she gets pregnant.

238
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,676
Jesus, Christian.

239
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,972
You're about to be given
a lifetime achievement award.

240
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,071
Could you possibly
just grow up?

241
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:44,347
We have made it, Sean.

242
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,655
The Gate to the garden of earthly
delights is wide open for us now.

243
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,425
You think I'm going to say no
to all that sweet nectar...

244
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:53,421
because of a silly little
thing like pollination? No.

245
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,469
What about a little thing
called marriage?

246
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,618
You're unbelievable.

247
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:01,702
Oh, come on.

248
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,532
Swelling looks good.

249
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,962
Blood flow's returning.

250
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:17,497
No sign of an infection.

251
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,794
I think you're
going to like it.

252
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:26,192
Here.
Just hold this.

253
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:35,200
So what do you think?

254
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,559
Yeah. They're going to be
a little tender at first,

255
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,658
but there are some exercises
you can do to help break them in.

256
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,844
Try saying "sea shell" for me.

257
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:55,189
See sell.

258
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:56,459
Good.

259
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,198
Basketball.

260
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:01,601
Uh, asket all.

261
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,047
Uh-huh. Now, this one's
a little bit harder.

262
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,672
Ping pong.

263
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,824
Huh...
f-f-fu...

264
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:10,670
ping.

265
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,879
Ff-ff...

266
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:14,014
Keep trying.

267
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:14,919
No.

268
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,415
F-fen...

269
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,119
fen...

270
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,556
fen too close.

271
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,493
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,233
What's going on?

273
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,853
The hell? We were just talking,
and then the next thing I know...

274
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,451
Jesus. Why doesn't he have
his restraints on?

275
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,471
I let him loose
just for a second.

276
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,190
You let him loose?
Why?

277
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,876
Well, he seemed...
I don't know... better.

278
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,496
Better?

279
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,991
He's got a genetic
disease, Sean.

280
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,958
What do you think,
'cause you fix his lips,

281
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,538
he's normal again?

282
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,121
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,260
No. You can't blame
this on him.

284
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,095
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,750
- You ok?
- Yeah.

286
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,651
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,649
Come on. Let's get
you some stitches.

288
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,023
Next time you're
being chased...

289
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,473
through campus by an angry
professor, wear pants.

290
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,875
How could i?

291
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:18,177
I think his wife broke the zipper
when she bit them off me.

292
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,678
I'm just lucky that
guy's so damn slow.

293
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,814
Hey, this isn't my fault, Sean.

294
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,999
I just went over there to
talk my "d" up to a "c"...

295
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,681
on that cellular
physiology exam.

296
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:29,783
Yeah? Well, how does that
lead to you screwing his wife?

297
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:31,391
He wasn't home.

298
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,549
Oh, hey, Sean, I need
to borrow your notes...

299
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,364
on that cellular physiology
term paper.

300
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,253
I'm already stuck with
a "d" now on the exam.

301
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,802
I got to kill on that paper.

302
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,377
What's in it for me?

303
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,742
You know that blonde
that you've been eying?

304
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:47,548
Julia?

305
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:49,793
I know her.
I can introduce you.

306
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:52,078
Did you sleep with her?

307
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,232
Not yet.

308
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:54,859
All right.
Fine.

309
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,102
But you have
to talk me up to her.

310
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,276
No problem.

311
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,364
I'm a born liar.

312
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,968
Ok. All right.

313
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,234
How am I doing down there?
Am I fixed yet?

314
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,899
Almost.
Just finishing up the keyhole.

315
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,146
You're lucky,
you know.

316
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,649
These hemostat vasectomies
are far less painful.

317
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,052
What's a little pain exchange
for a lifetime of free love?

318
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:20,106
Yeah. That's exactly
what you need,

319
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:22,540
even fewer reasons
to control yourself.

320
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:26,012
Well,
congratulations.

321
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,143
You are now medically prevented
from producing unwanted children.

322
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:31,479
Oh. Great.

323
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:33,859
3's my limit.

324
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,804
What are you going
to do about, um...

325
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,410
- What?
- Rebecca?

326
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,908
Yeah, well, she got
rid of it. Don't worry.

327
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,547
What are you guys
doing in here?

328
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:47,434
Hmm?

329
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,596
What are you
doing in here?

330
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:51,278
Nothing.

331
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,212
Sean was just...

332
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,814
burning off some genital warts,
that's all.

333
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,827
Well, I'm sure your wife
will be pleased about that.

334
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:01,364
She's in your office.

335
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,845
Shit.

336
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,527
She can't see me like this.
You need to cover for me.

337
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:07,420
But...

338
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,282
What do you want
me to tell her?

339
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:10,996
I don't know. Tell her I'm
with a patient or something.

340
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:14,039
I mean, you know... just... she finds
out I've had a vasectomy, she'll...

341
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,167
kill me.

342
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,570
What are you going to do
when it all catches up with you?

343
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,351
I've paid my penance,
Sean, all right?

344
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,863
Foster care,
breast cancer,

345
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,000
all the bullshit I've had to put up
with you for I don't know how long.

346
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,434
Just cover for me, please.

347
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,971
Hey, Sean.

348
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:32,674
Kimber. Um... uh...
Christian is just...

349
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:35,596
he's finishing up with
a patient, so, um... how are you?

350
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,691
- God, you look fantastic.
- Yeah ?

351
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,956
Marriage obviously
agrees with you.

352
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:40,956
Thank you.

353
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:44,019
Who would have ever thought
we'd be an old married couple?

354
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,374
So, how's the decorating
thing going?

355
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:50,247
You know, I don't think we've had
a chance to talk since the wedding.

356
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,224
You know, actually,
it's going really good.

357
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,033
I have a lot of really
good ideas.

358
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:58,170
I think I have a natural gift,
or at least my teachers think so.

359
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,117
Well.

360
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:03,366
What... what do you think of
that new marble wall?

361
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,018
It's, uh...

362
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,514
really Christian's thing.

363
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:08,457
Yeah.

364
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,460
He always has
to do what that fat,

365
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,121
untalented woman says
every time, doesn't he?

366
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:16,697
She's emperor's new
clothes, if you ask me.

367
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,536
Well, she does come
highly recommended, and...

368
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:22,462
you know how Christian is
about people and their...

369
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:23,463
credentials.

370
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:26,380
What do you think if we put
some food coloring in here,

371
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,186
make the tank prettier...
like, maybe an aquamarine...

372
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:30,608
make the room pop?

373
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,746
Bet that would
kill the fish, Kimber.

374
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,758
He's screwing her,
isn't he?

375
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,125
Wh... who?

376
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,415
I'm not stupid.
Christian. Rebecca.

377
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,106
They're having an affair.

378
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,988
Oh... you know,
he has turned a corner.

379
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,018
He wants it to work with you.

380
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:53,174
And I think he's had
his fill of all that.

381
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:54,921
Ok. So tell me
what you know,

382
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,055
tell me now,
and don't lie to me.

383
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:58,578
Kimber...

384
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:09,363
Does he have...
random Christian-like thoughts?

385
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:12,316
Yeah.
I'm sure he does.

386
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,043
But the bottom line
is that...

387
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,076
he loves you,

388
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,653
and he is faithful...
to you.

389
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,835
And you can trust him.

390
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,879
Well, you know that's why
I came here today, right?

391
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,411
To make him tell me the truth.

392
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,533
So, thank you.

393
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,699
Thanks for being honest
with me, Sean.

394
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,211
You have no idea
how relieved I am now.

395
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,707
Ahh, thank you.

396
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,561
Mmm.
You've had enough, Sean.

397
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,239
You're damn right,
I've had enough.

398
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,947
He doesn't need this.
Thank you very much.

399
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,493
Miss, don't believe a word that
comes out of this man's mouth, ok?

400
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:02,154
He'll tell you anything you want to hear,
and none of it's true.

401
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:03,646
Just ask his wife.

402
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,639
Look, I'm sorry if I put you
in an uncomfortable position...

403
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,335
- Uncomfortable position?
- Yes, uncomfortable position.

404
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,810
Oh, come on. You wouldn't care
if I squatted on glass,

405
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,694
as long as your ass is covered.

406
00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:19,814
Nothing's changed in 25 years.

407
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:24,786
You know, maybe you can't
help lying and cheating.

408
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,711
Maybe it's a genetic trait
like lesch-nyhan.

409
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,794
And you can't evolve into
a decent human being...

410
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,261
'cause it's not in your DNA.

411
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,327
Excuse me, honey,
get another one?

412
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,128
And can I get some ice?

413
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,252
My balls.

414
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:37,280
I had the ol' snippety-snip.

415
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,326
I want to make sure
I don't swell during the flight.

416
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,276
Thank God.

417
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,177
I almost missed it.

418
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,388
You have a much
more interesting job.

419
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,115
Now, what kind of
chocolate do you sell?

420
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:09,896
I'll give you a sample.

421
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:11,570
- Oh, you have some here?
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,932
Great. Yeah.

423
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,967
Well, let's see.
For you...

424
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:17,555
Ok.

425
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,217
This...

426
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:25,076
is made from criollo cacao,

427
00:22:25,196 --> 00:22:26,579
grown in Nicaragua.

428
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,425
Oh, I love how you say that.

429
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,102
It has higher levels
of phentolamine...

430
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:35,965
Mmm.

431
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:40,175
Which, besides
its decadent taste,

432
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:44,717
is known to have
a slightly psychotropic effect.

433
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:46,539
Oh, it is so delicious.

434
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,301
You want another?

435
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,062
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

436
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,508
I'll split it with you.

437
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,033
- Wow.
- Mmm.

438
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:08,183
You know, I need
to use the bathroom.

439
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:10,762
You want to come?

440
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,010
You saying you want to join
the mile high club?

441
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:17,942
Give me 2 minutes.

442
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,480
Ok.

443
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,131
Don't do it.

444
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:30,413
- Like you wouldn't.
- I have.

445
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,003
It's not worth it,
all right?

446
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:35,306
The bathrooms are too small
to get any rhythm going, and...

447
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,903
flight attendants are
very strict post-9/11.

448
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,886
I tell you what,
Buddy boy.

449
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,973
Why don't you
cover for me?

450
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:44,093
See how it feels
for a change.

451
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,783
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

452
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, God!

453
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,190
Oh, God.
Don't stop. Ahh.

454
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,810
Don't stop.
Ahh! Ahh!

455
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,009
Excuse me?

456
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,204
Open this door.
You need to come out of there.

457
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:18,666
Come out of there now, or
the captain will land this plane.

458
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,264
U.s. Marshal.

459
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,834
Wait. Wait. Wait.

460
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,066
U.s. Marshal.

461
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:38,826
- Are you armed?
- No.

462
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,276
You are being detained
under the u.s. Anti-terrorism...

463
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,764
provision of the patriot act
for disobeying a flight crew...

464
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,556
while in the air.

465
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:51,757
I have the authority to handcuff
to your seat if I deem it necessary.

466
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:53,707
Stay seated till
we land in Miami,

467
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,328
at which time you will be
questioned by homeland security.

468
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,696
- Do you understand?
- Yeah. Yes.

469
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,175
- Shut up.
- It's all right, Buddy.

470
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:07,480
Just shut up.

471
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,891
Why is it you never get caught,
and whenever I break the rules...

472
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,358
'cause you, my friend, are
an amateur. Thank you so much.

473
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:18,065
You can't expect to play like
Tiger Woods if you don't practice.

474
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,989
Thanks for doing nothing,
by the way.

475
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:22,221
Think of all the times
I covered for you.

476
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,144
If she hadn't convinced them...

477
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:25,915
that I was giving her the heimlich
maneuver, I'd still be in custody.

478
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,614
You know what? You need to put
that all behind you. Suck it all in.

479
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,294
Take a look around.
Can you feel it?

480
00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:32,305
- Respect?
- Envy.

481
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:36,149
Nothing says success more than
the jealousy of your peers.

482
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,717
- Dr. Troy?
- Yes?

483
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,588
Do you mind if I steal you
for a moment?

484
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:43,709
I promised Candace Delaureo I would
bring you over the moment you arrived.

485
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:46,148
Apparently, you made quite
an impression on her...

486
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:47,586
when you were a student.

487
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:49,226
Sweetie,
do you mind?

488
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:57,300
Hey, could I just get
a cup of coffee?

489
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,656
How do you take it?

490
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:02,255
Black, as I recall from
the all-nighters we used to pull.

491
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,247
Curtis?

492
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:04,714
Older, wiser.

493
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:06,665
Eh. Mostly older.

494
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,028
Oh, my God. Hey!

495
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,145
- How you doing, Buddy?
- I'm good. How are you?

496
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:12,171
- Congratulations, McNamara.
- Oh, thank you.

497
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,729
A beer, please.
I got to tell you,

498
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,164
I was a little shocked when
I heard you won the Poland award.

499
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,763
You must do one hell of a tit job.

500
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:19,778
Well, we do a little more
than tit jobs.

501
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,508
I'm just teasing you.
Relax, Sean.

502
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,909
You never could
take a joke, yeah?

503
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,618
Well, I'm not surprised
you're receiving it.

504
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,365
Work you've been doing,

505
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,263
treating fevers in Angola and
Pakistan is pretty incredible.

506
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,698
Oh, thanks, Buddy.

507
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:36,859
We're lucky, though,
you know, Sean?

508
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,415
Most poor bastards,

509
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:42,051
they never get to find out what
their true purpose in life is, eh?

510
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:46,260
So, uh, so how's Julia?

511
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:48,722
- She's good.
- Yeah?

512
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,444
We divorced.

513
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,582
Oh. Gee.
I'm sorry about that.

514
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:55,762
- You have kids?
- Yeah. Yeah. 3.

515
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:56,648
Oh!

516
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,533
There.

517
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,486
- There's Matt.
- Uh-huh.

518
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:03,603
That's conor there,
and there's Annie.

519
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,308
- Wow, good-looking.
- Yeah.

520
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:06,982
- You must be really proud.
- I am.

521
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:09,149
What, so the oldest one's
probably in college, right?

522
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,396
Uh, well, he's...
he's just taking a break.

523
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:12,865
Ah. Smart. Smart. 

524
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,865
Let me show you
my crew here.

525
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:17,005
This is Luke and Andrea.

526
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,620
Luke is at the old Alma mater
following in his dad's footsteps.

527
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,599
Oh, great.

528
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,742
But Andrea,
she's a rebel.

529
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,367
Nothing but trouble.

530
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,363
Heh.
I got one of those, too.

531
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:29,906
Just had to be different,
you know?

532
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:31,135
Yale.

533
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:34,408
I swear she did it
to break my heart.

534
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:38,010
Well, we can't all go
to Harvard, can we?

535
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,565
Well, some of us
could but didn't.

536
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,862
I never understood that, Sean.

537
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,255
What's this?

538
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,439
Ohh.

539
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:00,489
Harvard.

540
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,008
Congratulations.

541
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,772
While you're both freezing your
balls off in the frigid northeast,

542
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:11,620
I will be on the beach licking salt off of
the hot bodies of my fellow interns.

543
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:16,815
I'll meet you after biochem.
We still need to discuss housing.

544
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:18,947
See you, Troy.

545
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:23,235
Guy's a fag.

546
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:24,650
Guy's a genius.

547
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:28,790
So, you really want
to go to school...

548
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,823
with a bunch of
overachieving grade-grubbers?

549
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,126
As opposed to a bunch of
oversexed tit-grabbers?

550
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,555
I just don't want to see you
turn into a grind.

551
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:38,431
You have that potential,
Buddy boy. Trust me.

552
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,190
Hey, um,

553
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,800
there are direct flights from
Miami to Boston, you know?

554
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,366
Yeah. I just...

555
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:48,659
I thought we were going
to be in this together.

556
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,157
So we going to do
this thing together or what?

557
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,629
Come on.
I got a surprise.

558
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:06,324
- Sure this is it?
- Yes.

559
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,876
Yes.
I'm sure this is it.

560
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,872
Oh, my God.
Third floor, room number 12.

561
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:15,178
The original home of McNamara/Troy.
Can you believe it?

562
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,904
Look. It's been painted
a couple of times, and...

563
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,562
the cupboard used
to be over there.

564
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:20,768
The carpet's been replaced.

565
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,884
They didn't get rid of that
bong water stench.

566
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:25,653
No, they didn't!
Isn't that great, huh?

567
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:27,366
I love it!
It's great!

568
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:31,256
You know how many hours
we spent studying in this room?

569
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,154
Do you remember
this bed, huh?

570
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,077
It's the first time
I ever had a threesome.

571
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:37,253
I remember.

572
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,914
I had midterms
the next morning.

573
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:44,234
Oh. Hold on.

574
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:49,824
- Oh, my God.
- No.

575
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:52,068
Yeah. It's still here.
It's still here!

576
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:53,708
Come and check it out.

577
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,334
- The scoreboard!
- Oh, the scoreboard!

578
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:58,057
Ahh! The scoreboard!

579
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:02,048
209 of Miami's finest coeds
represented right here.

580
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,602
Of course, you know,
if I banged them at their place,

581
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:06,426
I didn't notch it
down on there, so...

582
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:07,913
- Yeah.
- There's a lot more.

583
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,687
Ok. Let's go grab
some dinner.

584
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,642
Go? What?

585
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,944
What are you talking about?
We're sleeping here tonight.

586
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:16,465
I already paid the schlubs who
room here so that we could stay.

587
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:18,569
- Sleep here?
- Yes, sleep here.

588
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,385
Relive old times,
you know. Like,

589
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:22,940
order some pizza
and drink some scotch,

590
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,878
get a little drunk, right,
like we did in senior year.

591
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,459
All right?
Come on.

592
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:29,497
We're getting
a big-ass award tomorrow.

593
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:31,966
We should at least relive some
of the good old days, you know? 

594
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:33,985
The things that kind of
got us here. I mean...

595
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:38,116
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
It could be fun.

596
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,799
Could be fun?
I mean, come on!

597
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,388
This is great, huh?
Come on. Let's play darts.

598
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:49,159
You're not going
to fit in that bed.

599
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,548
You know, the showers
still have that...

600
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,019
Whoa, ho, ho.
Hey, Buddy boy.

601
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,446
Look who I found while
you were taking a shower.

602
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,734
Winona and...

603
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,331
Ryder.

604
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:05,578
Come on, man. We just started
a game of strip poker.

605
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,018
Here, join us.

606
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:14,121
Oh, hold on, ladies.
Yeah.

607
00:31:15,096 --> 00:31:16,716
You know what that means?

608
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:19,678
Yeah, both of you, get going.

609
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,028
Seanie, you
enjoying yourself?

610
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,200
Partner?

611
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,830
I think it's your turn.

612
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,654
They're barely old enough
to have their driver's licenses.

613
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,024
They're 18.
I carded them.

614
00:31:32,698 --> 00:31:34,586
I'm going for a walk.

615
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:38,974
I thought he wanted
to be more impulsive.

616
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:07,818
I really didn't expect this
out of you, Mr. Mcnamara.

617
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:10,370
The entire semester, you've
been a model student...

618
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,313
an "a" on your midterm,
an "a" on your lab work.

619
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,115
Now, I wonder if you
cheated on them, too.

620
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:20,223
Just give me another chance,
professor Silvestre. I'll do anything.

621
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:22,015
I know this stuff.
Test me right now.

622
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:23,646
Ah, it's too late
for that, Sean.

623
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,314
But I'm supposed to go
to Harvard in the fall.

624
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,351
If you flunk me, I won't get in.
You know that.

625
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:29,685
You should have thought of
that before you and Mr. Troy...

626
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:32,002
handed in the exact
same final papers.

627
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm failing both of you.

628
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:49,310
Mcnamara/Troy has set new
standards for reconstructive surgery,

629
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,627
repeatedly doing procedures
once thought impossible.

630
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:59,549
They pioneered the first face
transplant procedure in 2005...

631
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,525
Don't say anything undignified
about playing strip poker...

632
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:04,683
with 2 freshmen the night
before the Poland award?

633
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,397
Dignity is overrated,
my friend. 

634
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,599
The freshmen,
on the other hand, are not.

635
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,973
Ladies and gentlemen,

636
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:15,101
it is my pleasure to present
the 2010 Albert Poland award to...

637
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:20,211
doctors Sean McNamara
and Christian Troy.

638
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,186
Thank you.

639
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,269
Whoa. Lucky she
didn't drop it, huh?

640
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:40,357
Uh, greatly honored
to receive this award.

641
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,868
It's really...
quite daunting.

642
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:45,982
However, I wouldn't be up
here if it weren't for...

643
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:47,866
one particular man,

644
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:50,207
Sean McNamara.

645
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:54,686
This man right here is the real
talent at McNamara/Troy...

646
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:56,442
and always has been.

647
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,021
You... are the man.

648
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:10,739
Even when we were
at school here, every day...

649
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,504
and everybody knew that Sean
was born to be a physician,

650
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:16,898
and as I watched him grow
over the years and become a master,

651
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,914
I could only hope
that some of that...

652
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:23,993
extraordinary talent
would rub off on me.

653
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,256
Not too sure any of it has,
but...

654
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,297
I guess, at the end of the day,
my biggest contribution...

655
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,959
to our practice is letting
the world in on...

656
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:36,669
his gifts and his talent.

657
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:40,934
And I look forward to enjoying
the view from his coattails for...

658
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,347
many, many years to come.

659
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:49,241
We are both
humbled and grateful...

660
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:53,754
for the jury's selection,
and we will strive to...

661
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,268
remain worthy
of its honor,

662
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:59,103
if we can.

663
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:02,982
Thank you...
Thank you very much.

664
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,144
Hey, dude.
Look sharp.

665
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:17,511
Someone's here to meet you.

666
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:22,260
Julia Noughton,
meet Sean McNamara,

667
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,150
the best-looking,
smartest,

668
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,508
most all-around
awesome guy on campus.

669
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:30,531
Wow. You certainly have
a friend in Christian, Sean.

670
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,776
Very nice to meet you, Julia.

671
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,949
Thanks for the kind words,
Christian.

672
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,693
Just telling it
like it is, partner.

673
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,933
Thank you. Oh.
Thank you so much.

674
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,763
- It's unbelievable, huh?
- I know.

675
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,322
What'd you think of the speech huh?
I was a little nervous, but...

676
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:55,612
Oh, it was something.

677
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:57,244
So I didn't suck?
Hey, thank you.

678
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,004
All right.
Congratulations.

679
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,938
Did you mean
everything you said?

680
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:01,847
Thank you.

681
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:04,112
Um, Dr. Troy?
Dr. Mcnamara?

682
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,256
- Yes?
- Can we get a picture together?

683
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:07,694
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

684
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:08,937
Yeah.
Of course.

685
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:11,402
For the cover of
the alumni report.

686
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:14,067
Ahh, the cover.
I like the sound of that.

687
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:16,189
Can we get a couple of copies
for the waiting room?

688
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,905
Are you kidding me?
That's the least we can do.

689
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:22,313
Your donation was above and
beyond anything we ever expected.

690
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,423
What donation?

691
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:26,030
Yeah, especially this year,
with the economy where it is.

692
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,592
I'm just glad we had
something to offer in return.

693
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:30,627
Well, this is fantastic.
Thank you.

694
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:34,339
Thank you.
Both of you. Very much.

695
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:37,580
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Take care.

696
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,579
Yes. Oh.
Thank you very much.

697
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:43,263
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

698
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,332
- How much did you give them?
- Appreciate it. What's that?

699
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,445
- How much did you give them?
- A reasonable amount for...

700
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,098
a couple of...
thank you so much...

701
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:51,170
successful surgeons...
thank you.

702
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,911
- Thank you.
- How much?

703
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,923
Thank you. Huh?
What does it matter?

704
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:56,590
Tell me how much.

705
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,230
200.
Thank you.

706
00:36:58,297 --> 00:36:59,601
- Thousand?
- Yeah.

707
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:01,630
It's tax-deductible.
Thank you.

708
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,778
You bought this.

709
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:07,063
I guaranteed us another 20 years
in this business, my friend.

710
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,100
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

711
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:11,547
Untie your panties, ok?

712
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:14,151
This was supposed to be
something to make you happy.

713
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:16,592
Oh, yeah. You're always
looking out for others, aren't you?

714
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,394
How much did
Ryerson donate?

715
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,555
Ryerson works with kids in Africa.
He doesn't have any money.

716
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,325
Just the dignity to let his
success earn him the honor.

717
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:26,124
Not be forced to buy it.

718
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:29,121
Which makes this thing just
a complete joke and a waste of time,

719
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:31,187
just like everything with you.

720
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,092
Sean, would you come
back here, please?

721
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:45,541
Come on.
You can't do this.

722
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,648
Watch me.

723
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,717
All right.
I should have told you.

724
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:50,141
This is bullshit.

725
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,799
I said you could look
at my notes,

726
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,911
and you copied my goddamn
paper word for word.

727
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:55,837
You knew what was
going to happen.

728
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,432
You know, I should have known better.
When you came into the library that day,

729
00:37:58,552 --> 00:37:59,440
I knew you were trouble.

730
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,042
I should have seen this coming.

731
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,414
I should have known that getting
the Poland for plastic surgery...

732
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,434
was a farce.

733
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:05,650
It's not a farce.

734
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,197
 We did good work, and
we're being recognized for it.

735
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,957
- That's the truth.
- The truth is, you paid for it.

736
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:12,333
and I should thank you...

737
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:14,778
because you finally did
something so asinine...

738
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:17,644
that I can see what
my problem's been all along...

739
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,071
listening to you.

740
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:21,718
Oh, give me a break.

741
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,852
Meeting me is the best thing
that's ever going to happen to you,

742
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:25,670
and I think deep down inside,
you know that.

743
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,034
It's because of you I'm not
going to Harvard.

744
00:38:28,154 --> 00:38:29,956
Harvard is overrated, Sean.

745
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:31,824
You ruined my life.

746
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,483
For God's sake, Sean.
Grow up.

747
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,409
The only one you have to blame
for your life is yourself.

748
00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:46,150
You finished?

749
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,988
With the hammer
or with you?

750
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,797
I did it because...

751
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:58,897
I don't know.

752
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:08,451
I wanted you to be happy
about the work we've done.

753
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,706
I want you to be
happy about us.

754
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:19,419
It's not all bad, Sean.

755
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,887
Sean.
We have a problem.

756
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:43,188
Mr. Daly carved
his face off.

757
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,153
What an awful disease.

758
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:53,958
Can you imagine
doing this to yourself,

759
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,913
inflicting such pain?

760
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:00,296
Just sutures?

761
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,164
You're not going
to fix him up?

762
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:05,573
What's the point?
He's just going to do it again.

763
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:08,376
You're just going
to give up on him?

764
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:13,447
Big difference between giving up and
accepting someone for who they are.
