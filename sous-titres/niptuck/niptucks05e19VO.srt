1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck.

2
00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:03,377
Married?

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,202
- What kind of a joke is this?
- This isn't a joke.

4
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:08,189
Matt and I exchanged our vows
3 days ago.

5
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:09,464
That's right.

6
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:10,968
We're pregnant.

7
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:13,077
We going somewhere?

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,430
You are going nowhere,
which is why I am leaving.

9
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:18,261
What about jJenna?

10
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,954
Jenna will be at Ram's
with the nanny,

11
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,629
and that's where she will be staying
when I am not with her.

12
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,108
Mr. Mcnamara?

13
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,191
I'm Colleen Rose.
You have a very naturalistic process.

14
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:31,941
Seanie, I need you tomorrow morning,
6 a.m. reshoot.

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,663
- Excuse me.
- No, excuse me.

16
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:36,373
I'm executive producer and creative
at Hearts and Scalpels.

17
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,192
And I'm Sean's agent.

18
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:40,500
Next week you have a nude scene.

19
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,042
- It's undignified...
- I told that Freddy, forget it!

20
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,349
You get to keep that scrumptious weenie
of yours under wraps.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,873
Hey, cookie.
Got us some jamba juice.

22
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:54,169
I've got bana berry or razzmatazz
which one do you want?

23
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,305
Eden, right?
Are you looking for Sean?

24
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,933
I think he's hanging out
with the extras, somewhere...

25
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,602
No, actually,
I took the studio tour and snuck away.

26
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,815
I've always wondered if the big stars
have beds in their trailer.

27
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,301
I am big, darling.

28
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:13,781
<i>- Do we have enough time?
- They'll wait. I run this show.</i>

29
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,575
<i>In fact,
I run the whole goddamn network.</i>

30
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,204
- Is this some sort of joke?
- I just don't understand why I'm here.

31
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:23,708
You are here because you are
the new star of Hearts and Scalpels!

32
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,089
You put that bitch up
to it to set me up!

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,954
- I'm in the middle of a surgery here.
- Hi, Sean.

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,579
We're CAA, and we want to be
in the Sean Mcnamara business.

35
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,887
You will not take away my star!

36
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,098
Not take away my Sean.

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,489
What are you doing here, Colleen?
I'm calling 911.

38
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,573
I think it's a good idea.

39
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,298
I'd rather stick
with the cold phone call.

40
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,519
I want to look younger,
like I did when we met.

41
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,378
That's kind of what New York's about,
too.

42
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:06,549
New York?

43
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:09,379
I accepted a position
at NYU's teaching hospital.

44
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,380
We're moving back in 3 weeks.

45
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,366
- She's in v-tac. Her rate's 150.
- Call 911.

46
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,703
We lost her. Olivia's dead.

47
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:21,390
New York's gonna be so strange
without her now.

48
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:23,203
You're still going?

49
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:27,354
Yeah?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,816
Can you stay a while?
Just until I fall asleep?

51
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,197
I'm not your significant other.

52
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:39,825
Well, you are kind of.
I mean... not really, but sort of.

53
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:41,827
Christian, I don't like men.

54
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:45,039
- I like you.
- I feel exactly the same way.

55
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,583
Most of the time
you drive me batshit,

56
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,543
but you're the only woman
I really trust.

57
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,841
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Liz won't be coming over tonight.

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,302
She resigned.
She's moving back to miami.

59
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:10,564
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself, Mr. Skerritt.

60
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:12,111
The size of my penis.

61
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:15,112
- A penis enlargement, great.
- Not an enlargement,

62
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,530
a reduction.
I've got a tyrannosaurus prick.

63
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:22,145
I'm a yoga instructor, a few months ago
I was at a retreat up in Big Sur.

64
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,971
It was 6 weeks, intensive,
my body really started to open up.

65
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,682
And one day I was in plow,

66
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,074
and I just started sinking
deeper and deeper...

67
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,797
So was your penis prohibiting you
from achieving certain poses?

68
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,959
No.

69
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,884
I can't stop sucking on it.

70
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,268
- You mean metaphorically?
- No, I mean,

71
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:46,642
I spend almost all day in my apartment
with my dick in my mouth.

72
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:50,249
Giant penis
plus incredible flexibility

73
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,898
equals the best blow job
you have ever had.

74
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,569
Self fellatio, that's impossible.

75
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,914
- Mr. Skerritt, that's not...
- No, no, wait, wait.

76
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,908
You can... you can do that?

77
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,911
I can't hold down a job.

78
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,956
And forget about a relationship,
because...

79
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,324
nobody gets me off the way I can.

80
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,016
You guys have to help me.

81
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,255
I spend almost...

82
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:19,063
every waking hour with myself.

83
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,603
I know, it sounds like a joke.

84
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:29,157
But, it's a goddamn curse.

85
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,523
Don't you think
you should maybe see a therapist?

86
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,906
You know,
to deal with your compulsive behavior?

87
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,587
I've tried shrinks.
I even tried the drugs they prescribe.

88
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,944
But nothing
is as strong as the impulse.

89
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:42,248
Look, you guys staple fatty's stomachs
so they won't eat.

90
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,613
What's the difference?

91
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:46,094
Well, the difference is
there's no known surgery

92
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,537
for a penis reduction.

93
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,133
You can understand how that procedure
might not be in high demand.

94
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:52,727
So...

95
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,711
how many inches do you want to lose?

96
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,029
I don't know.

97
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:00,662
Just enough so I'd have
to break my back to get a taste.

98
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,292
2 inches?

99
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:10,142
Well, we're gonna have to research
some options and get back to you.

100
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:12,478
Just do it quick.
I'm desperate, man.

101
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,054
Will you stop
with the judgmental looks?

102
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,321
Don't tell me
you guys have never tried it.

103
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:26,659
That close.

104
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,129
What?

105
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,341
Let me be clear, Kimmy.

106
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:22,162
I will never,
ever do another surgery on you again.

107
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,983
That's great,
because I look and feel fantastic

108
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:27,155
these days.

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,468
I'm not the one
who needs the touch-up.

110
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:30,593
She does.

111
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,204
Hello.

112
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,511
I see. So you've gone from stupid

113
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:39,606
- to completely insane.
- Make fun of me all you want, grandpa,

114
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,050
but thanks to my...

115
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,944
tireless devotion,

116
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,565
your granddaughter
has just been signed

117
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,892
to the hottest baby modeling agency
in town.

118
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,970
But in order
to book the high-end campaigns,

119
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,341
we're gonna have
to do something about her mouth.

120
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,739
- Her mouth?
- The Steves, her agents...

121
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,918
Steve Meyer and Steve Freedman
said she was perfection, right?

122
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,797
Other than her thin,
villainous lips.

123
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,508
Which she did not get from my side,
by the way,

124
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,510
so it had to have come from
that witch.

125
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:14,151
Linda, do you mind

126
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,844
stop practicing your putting
and get your butt in here, please?

127
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,897
Are you gonna give her the injections
right now? That's fantastic.

128
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,022
Love of my life.

129
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:25,794
Would you do me a favor and take
little Jenna, and give her a fruit bowl?

130
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,999
Come here, you sweet little thing.

131
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:30,479
Oh, my goodness.
Aren't you so sweet?

132
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,117
Why don't you go with her

133
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,787
while I have a little chat
with Joan Crawford.

134
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,216
I knew you would have issues
with this!

135
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,017
There is not a plastic surgeon alive
who would operate on a baby,

136
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,087
including me.

137
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,748
There are a number of plastic surgeons
right here in Beverly Hills

138
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,591
- who do work on babies.
- Really?

139
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:49,259
Name one.

140
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,777
I don't know their names,
but I know that

141
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:56,018
the Steves refer all their clients
to them. They do restylane,

142
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,778
botox, lipo.

143
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,228
Kimber, get out.

144
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,190
Answer me this,

145
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,915
who's gonna pay
for her college education?

146
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,052
Your son, that zero?

147
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,793
You touch one flaxen hair

148
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,490
on the head of that baby,
and I swear to you,

149
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:14,567
I will get custody of Jenna.

150
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:22,530
You and I have gone
to such tragic lengths to feel loved

151
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,971
because we weren't valued
as children.

152
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:30,770
Now, I am determined to give our Jenna
a shot at feeling special,

153
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,054
and to develop her sense of self
and her value.

154
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,522
And I will move heaven and earth
to give that to her,

155
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,697
because nobody did that for me.

156
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,407
So are you on board with that?

157
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,077
Botox on a baby?

158
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,241
It's criminal. You need to go talk
to those modeling agents.

159
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,244
Kimber would never touch Jenna now.
 I'll put the fear of god in her.

160
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,190
It's not just for Jenna.

161
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,880
You have a moral obligation
to find out the names of the quacks

162
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,823
they're using
before they hurt any more kids.

163
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:05,952
You figure out how to turtle
Mr. Skerritt's dong,

164
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,430
and I'll get right on it.

165
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:10,679
The principal would just be
the inverse of the funditory

166
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,968
and suspense religament release
we do for a penis enlargement.

167
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:16,610
Makes sense. Tighten the ligaments,
shrink the wang.

168
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:17,967
Yeah.

169
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,842
You know, if Liz were here,

170
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,266
she'd be giving us a lecture
right now

171
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,549
about how Mr. Skerritt's
compulsive self-fellating

172
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:30,829
is just another example
of our narcissistic society.

173
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,142
Isn't it nice not to hear
her vagina monologues anymore?

174
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,491
I tell you, screw Liz.
She walked out on us.

175
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,412
No, she walked out on you.

176
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,872
How can someone as self-involved as you
not see that this is all your fault?

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,417
I accept responsibility,

178
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,754
which is why I'm taking care
of finding a replacement.

179
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:49,182
I talked to a headhunter yesterday,
he's sent over a stack of resumes.

180
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,256
And what qualifications
did you give him?

181
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:54,009
Must have big tits
and a willingness to give blow jobs?

182
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,519
No.
You put the resumes on my desk, OK?

183
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,104
I'm not getting stuck
with some mediocre doctor

184
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:03,227
just because she happens to be
a nice piece of ass.

185
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:21,089
- If I may ask, Theodora...
- Call my Teddy.

186
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,892
- Who is Harley?
- That's my hog.

187
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,704
It's a motorcycle.

188
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,379
I race in the desert.

189
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,841
That would explain
the motto on your other arm.

190
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,929
I got that after a wild night
at Coachella.

191
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,767
And how do your patients react
to these uplifting tattoos?

192
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,437
I've only ever gotten complaints
from other physicians.

193
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,457
Uptight old farts.

194
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,443
Well, Dr. Rowe...

195
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,613
you certainly like to live
dangerously.

196
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,532
I like to live, period.

197
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,535
Look, I am very good at what I do.

198
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:05,539
To get this job, do I need
permission from you to be who I am?

199
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,556
If so, let me know now.
I'm out the door.

200
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:13,213
- You were first in your class at UCLA?
- I cheated.

201
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,136
Kidding.

202
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,137
I just happen
to pick things up pretty fast.

203
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,265
- You're lucky.
- Maybe.

204
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,268
Maybe I just get bored quickly.

205
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:28,607
I see. So...

206
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:33,265
what guarantee do I have
that you'll stay if we hire you?

207
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,195
There are no guarantees in life,
doctor.

208
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,548
But I do promise if I take the job,

209
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:44,178
I will only take it
if I find the place interesting.

210
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:49,869
And, how...

211
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,246
how do we seem so far?

212
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:54,384
So far, so good.

213
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:56,408
What about you?

214
00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:00,929
Your vitae is certainly outstanding,
so...

215
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,098
Anything else you find interesting?

216
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:11,134
Why do I suddenly feel
like you're interviewing me?

217
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,399
I am.

218
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,019
Oh, my.

219
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,322
She said granddaddy had good genes,
but we're talking extra special genes.

220
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,872
I don't know if Kimber's filled you in,
but she's getting in on the ground floor

221
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,785
of a billion dollar industry...

222
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,751
make-up, accessories,
and of course, fashion.

223
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,614
Armani, Gucci. Everybody wants in,
everybody's paying.

224
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,839
We think Jenna can be the next baby
Cindy Crawford.

225
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,280
So what's all this talk
about changing her?

226
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,030
Dr. Troy, in theatrical parlance,

227
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,726
Jenna has thin, villainous lips.

228
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,863
People don't like
that look on babies.

229
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,085
They like full, bee-stung,

230
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,592
sensual lips.

231
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,445
That is really sick.

232
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,658
Try to think of it in another way.
You were circumcised, I presume?

233
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:08,912
Would you call yourself scarred
or traumatized by that procedure?

234
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,920
Probably what scarred you was
more about being misunderstood

235
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,495
or unloved
by your friends and family.

236
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,505
That's a good answer, Steve,
that's very good.

237
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,927
So who you go to, baby plastic surgeons?
I'm curious if I know any of them.

238
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,100
We don't disclose that information.

239
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:27,225
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,570
I thought we came here today because
you're interested in Jenna's future.

241
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:32,745
Right, yep.

242
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:34,649
<i>It's the baby Dior people.</i>

243
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,897
<i>They want to book little Amber
for the fall collection.</i>

244
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:43,439
Hello, Mary, we're thrilled.
What's the offer?

245
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:47,380
We're looking for 5 digits, Mary.
10,000 a day.

246
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,286
10,000! I had to do anal
for that kind of money.

247
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:53,218
A limo with a fully stocked bar
for mom

248
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:56,293
and all wardrobe becomes
property of baby Amber.

249
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,674
Love you, Mary.
Stevie sends kisses.

250
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:01,243
So...

251
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:03,008
where were we?

252
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:08,680
What type of augmentation
did baby Amber receive?

253
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,891
She was a scowler.

254
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,685
There's cute crying,
with the tender little tears,

255
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,481
and then there's angry, scowly crying.
People don't like that.

256
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,527
So she was given a little benadryl lolly
to keep her calm,

257
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:23,987
and 4 units of botox.

258
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,556
She was a beautiful girl
before the botox.

259
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,315
She's a beautiful girl now.

260
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,640
The only difference is,
now her college fund is full.

261
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:41,421
Could you tell Christian how horrible
and demeaning catalog work is?

262
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,726
The kind that you said
that Jenna would only book

263
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,444
if she didn't do the lip filler.

264
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,719
It only pays about 275 a day.

265
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:49,808
And be prepared to wait in hallways

266
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,517
with a sea of snotty tots
and poorly-groomed moms.

267
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,147
I'm onto you guys.

268
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,908
Why actually go out and hustle
when you can beat the competition

269
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,133
with chemicals? Come on, Kimmy.

270
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,907
We're out of here.

271
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,867
We are not sharing Jenna's fortune
with these lazy scumbags.

272
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,670
I'll be her manager.

273
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,166
Good luck with that.

274
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,795
Sean bear!

275
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,511
Oh, man.

276
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,762
I could use a cigarette right now.

277
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,061
Or a jamba juice.

278
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,285
You're insatiable, Colleen.

279
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,240
You're what fills me up,
Seanie bear.

280
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,246
You, and your scrumptious,
super-sized weenie.

281
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:02,226
Let's do it one more time before
we eat, OK?

282
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:03,841
I'm gonna make you hit an E flat.

283
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,547
Then you can run out to hooters,
you can pick me up some hot wings.

284
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,671
Oh, hooters. Oh, my god.

285
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,220
Aidan, this is insane.

286
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:16,348
I know. I wrote the shit
out of that script.

287
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,393
No. It's completely inaccurate.
I never slept with Colleen.

288
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,933
That's artistic license, dude.

289
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:23,331
It's called increasing the stakes,
raising the drama.

290
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:26,400
What we're doing is we're taking
the viewer on a journey, Sean.

291
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,825
Keep reading, you're gonna like it.

292
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:36,949
No, Julia.

293
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,445
I said no, goddamnit!

294
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:43,542
Yes, I screwed a hot teen,
but I'm not losing my children over it.

295
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,212
The only way you'll get custody
over my children

296
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,390
is over my dead body, woman!

297
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:50,906
Damn it!

298
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,525
Why?

299
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,727
Hey, Christian, I didn't see you
there, buddy.

300
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:15,853
How was your day, partner?

301
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:20,606
Rough one, huh? Yeah, me too.

302
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,458
I got a face transplant
at 7 A.M. I better hit the sack.

303
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:26,877
Don't stay up too late.

304
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,421
You killed Christian?

305
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:32,925
I didn't know what to do
with his character anymore.

306
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,036
What did you do?!

307
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,696
I gave you everything, cookie.

308
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,836
How could you leave me for the CIA?

309
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,555
The CIA?

310
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,037
- I left colleen for CAA!
- I know.

311
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,713
How cool is it that
I made you a spy?

312
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,332
What's the big diff, anyway?
CIA, CAA.

313
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,502
They're both big and scary
and they think they rule the world.

314
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,367
No. I'm not selling you
the rights to my story, no way.

315
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,132
Look, Sean.

316
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,550
You owe me.

317
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,553
Ever since I got out of sex rehab
cause of your little set up with Eden.

318
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,337
- I didn't set you up...
- Don't even go there.

319
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,760
Next thing, I can't get a job.

320
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,518
Freddy replaces me with
Ricky Schroeder. I am depressed.

321
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,318
And I say, you know what,
screw him, I'm Costner, man.

322
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:32,192
I'm a triple threat. I write
this script on spec, lifetime.

323
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:35,863
The network picks it up.
The Fairchild attaches herself

324
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,470
to play Colleen. Come on, Sean!

325
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,025
This is my comeback!

326
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,904
<i>Deadly Tightrope</i>
the Sean McNamara story

327
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,699
It's my dances with wolves, man.

328
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,803
I'm giving myself to you,

329
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,923
I'm sacrificing myself
for you. I'm unarmed.

330
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:55,762
What we are gonna do?

331
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,696
We're gonna kill some indians?

332
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,889
We're not going to kill them.
We're going to help them.

333
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:03,891
You're going to read it.

334
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,115
Just read it, Sean.

335
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:09,063
Just read the whole thing.
The ending's amazing.

336
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:14,609
Then we'll talk. I'll call you
in the A.M., or you call me.

337
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,649
I'll let you sleep on it.
I love you.

338
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,657
See ya.

339
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,085
Maybe she needs some food.
We've been here over an hour.

340
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,775
No, I've fed her twice already.

341
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,194
I'm just trying to keep her
from napping. She's hot.

342
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,081
Honey,
do you wanna play Patty Cake? No?

343
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,305
I'll be right back.

344
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,135
Excuse me, miss? Miss,

345
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,542
excuse me. Why did that lady just go
straight in there?

346
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,947
- We've been here since noon.
- She had an appointment.

347
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,162
An appointment! We had
an appointment an hour ago.

348
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:05,584
You're not with the Steves, are you?
They always get in first.

349
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:11,048
That is bullshit!

350
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,982
Come on, Kimber, we're going in.
Let's go. Get the kid, we're going in.

351
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,841
I'm sorry, we still have
one more mom...

352
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,802
Listen, lady. They're not
going to get the job. We are.

353
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,225
This is so Hollywood.

354
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,813
See, honey, look. That's called
a fake beach.

355
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:35,357
Hi. I'm Christian Troy.

356
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,778
I'm the little starlet's manager and
this is Kimber Henry, her mother.

357
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,406
- Next. Thank you very much.
- Excuse me?

358
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,214
Not what we're looking for.
Have reception show the next one in.

359
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,291
Is it because she's too fat?

360
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,780
Because she doesn't need to eat
the day of the shoot.

361
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,464
You can't just dismiss us like that.

362
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,163
She's the most beautiful girl.

363
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,752
'fraid not. Thanks for comin'.

364
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,005
This thing's for those
sunglasses, right? Over here.

365
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,590
Let's take a look, all right?

366
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,074
Hey, come on, sweetie.
Show this lady.

367
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,716
Hey, look, the kid is a star.

368
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,985
You want the honest truth?

369
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,872
Cover her ears, sweetie.

370
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:15,907
You'll never get her
a national campaign.

371
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:18,483
Not with those thin,
villainous lips.

372
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,298
That's my job.

373
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,977
Since when is the anesthesiologist
not allowed to see the patient's body?

374
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,002
I would just prefer it
if we followed protocol.

375
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:52,910
Oh, my god in heaven!
Linda, get over here.

376
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:55,605
Linda, you stay right where you are.
Teddy, that's enough.

377
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,688
Why would a guy write
"nam" on his dick?

378
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:01,063
He looks way too young
to have ever served over there.

379
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,747
It doesn't say "nam," OK?

380
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:13,616
Namaste.

381
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,773
Namaste home at night
and play with that thing,

382
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:19,205
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, that's enough.

383
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,947
I've gotta get a picture
of this first.

384
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,258
Absolutely not. That's unethical.

385
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,191
Then I won't ask you to take it.
You do it, linda.

386
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:29,472
- It's not funny, Teddy.
- Oh, Sean, relax.

387
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,892
- No one will find out.
- Ah, give me that.

388
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,396
Now I know why Linda said
the other guy's the fun one.

389
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,984
Fine.

390
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,577
I'll get in there.
I'm not a tight ass, you know?

391
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,781
- I can kick back.
- Stretch it out.

392
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:49,158
I'll do it.

393
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:52,861
OK, that's great. Fantastic.
Come on, smile.

394
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,272
Get down, oh, yeah.

395
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:56,874
Oh, guys, that's fantastic.

396
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,392
I love that one. Oh, my god.
One more. Come on, just...

397
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:04,465
Holy shit!
Take one of me with that monster!

398
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,845
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- I'm shadowing you, bro.

399
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,531
- For the movie.
- OK. Great. Perfect.

400
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,446
Get one of me with my lips on it.
Wait, maybe that would make me gay.

401
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:16,350
We just took a picture
for our medical records, OK?

402
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,417
Oh, all right. But what is he?
Is he like a circus freak?

403
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,542
- I've never seen anything like it.
- A yogi,

404
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,817
addicted to sucking himself off.

405
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,744
God, if I could do that,

406
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,570
I swear, I would never watch tv.
Let's see how long it can get.

407
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:32,285
- That's enough.
- Don't... you're suffocating him.

408
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,892
- Did you read the script yet?
- I told you,

409
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,290
I'm not interested in having
a movie made about my life.

410
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:39,140
And that script is full of lies.

411
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:42,322
Come on, at the end of it,
you come out looking amazing.

412
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,454
The last scene,when you read it,
you're the hero. You off Colleen,

413
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:47,518
you save your daughter.
What else could you want?

414
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,593
And don't forget the nuclear bomb
under the operating table.

415
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,601
- You don't like it? Easy lift.
- That's it.

416
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,788
- It's an easy lift.
- This negotiation is over. That's it.

417
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,413
- Out, out.
- What?

418
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,812
Well...

419
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:03,232
you know what, I don't like
your fancy costumes, anyway.

420
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,200
And your... medical jargon,
your fancy talks.

421
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,281
Doesn't even fit me!

422
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:12,214
None of this fits me!

423
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,412
I'm gonna scrub up.

424
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,243
Prep him.

425
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,950
Collagen's a natural substance.

426
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,283
Babies get their ears pierced, right?
Do you consider that child abuse?

427
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,108
No. Come on, do it.

428
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,225
No. I'm not doing this.

429
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:12,093
You are a stupid wimp
just like your pathetic son.

430
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,707
To baby Jenna.

431
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,715
To baby Burberry.

432
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,827
To my new best friends.

433
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:57,696


434
00:25:58,589 --> 00:25:59,589
Cheers.

435
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:23,975
Dude. Watch it,
you're gonna strain your milk, buddy.

436
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,250
Oh, it's OK.

437
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:28,252
Stretching helps the circulation.
I'll heal up faster.

438
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,755
Are you here to check my stitches?

439
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:37,733
I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm not really a doctor.

440
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:40,932
OK. I'm sorry. Who are you?

441
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:45,311
Get your head out of the ashram.
Watch some television. Seriously.

442
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:47,825
I can't. I don't own one.

443
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,942
You... neither would I
if I were swinging your club.

444
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:56,739
I guess doctor-patient confidentiality
doesn't mean shit around here.

445
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,454
No, you know what,
you're absolutely right.

446
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:02,177
You know, your doctor,
Sean Mcnamara,

447
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,870
narcissistic prick.

448
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,930
He's a ruiner of lives.
I've observed this firsthand.

449
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,886
I've been following him
in anticipation of a television event

450
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,411
I'm about to film.

451
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:15,693
I was there when he snapped
a photo of your super dick.

452
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,510
- What?
- Yeah, he did.

453
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:19,576
I am a...

454
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,002
phenomenal actor.

455
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,785
And even I couldn't hide my distaste
at his despicable actions.

456
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,710
- Why would he do that?!
- That's a great question. Why would he?

457
00:27:29,844 --> 00:27:31,044
Is he jealous?

458
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:33,296
Is he?

459
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,517
Is he jealous of your god-given gift,
your beautiful, beautiful gift?

460
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:38,792
I don't know.

461
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:41,367
It's possible.
I can understand that.

462
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,535
OK...

463
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:45,720
- does he still have the pictures?
- I don't know.

464
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,151
I don't know, but don't worry,
I am on your side.

465
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:50,584
- Thank you.
- We are going to figure this out.

466
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:55,673
We're gonna figure...
you know what you should do?

467
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,399


468
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,567
This is your chance to cash in.

469
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,890
I know you guys take
a vow of poverty or something.

470
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,753
All you own is a pair of sweaty shorts
and an incense burner, am I right?

471
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,978
- Cash in!
- Oh, my god. I should get a lawyer.

472
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,577
Yes, yes! You should get a lawyer.

473
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:13,399
You should sue the pants off them.

474
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:18,454
Now teach me how you did it, myagi.

475
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,182
<i>- ... your hands on it, looks good.
- And the arms.</i>

476
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,622
Put down that coffee cup.
You don't work here anymore.

477
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,458
- Excuse me?
- You're fired.

478
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,128
- You can't fire her.
- I can do whatever I goddamn like

479
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,088
when it comes to violating
the rules of the american board.

480
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,467
One of which just happens to be
taking pornographic photographs

481
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:41,635
of a patient under anesthesia.

482
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,373
I just got an earful from suck
me off in there,

483
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,432
and he's threatening
to get a lawyer.

484
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:48,734
Aidan.

485
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,645
So you did. You actually took
a sears family picture

486
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:55,191
of you two and that guy's dick.
That is just not funny.

487
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,610
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not!

488
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,569
Look, it was terrible what we did.

489
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,565
We weren't thinking.
But it wasn't meant for publication.

490
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,868
We were just trying to relieve
the stress of being snake-wranglers.

491
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,904
When did I become the responsible one?
Do you realize how ugly this could get?

492
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,752
Relax, there is no evidence
I erased all the pictures.

493
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,767
This guy is a yoga teacher.
He lives off canned lentils.

494
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,468
Throw him a bone. He'll leave
here thinking he won the lottery.

495
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,303
I don't want to relax, sweetheart.

496
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,139
And where am I gonna get
this bone from? Petty cash?

497
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,475
We could sell a pair of your shoes.

498
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,601
Yeah, that's real funny.

499
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:33,688
You hired her.

500
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:35,606
You fix this.

501
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:46,325
- That's terrible.
- Sorry, it is.

502
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,737
- We should never have done that.
- Sorry.

503
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:10,738
You eaten yet?

504
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,487
There's nothing to eat.
I was gonna grab some dinner.

505
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:18,149
- You want to come?
- Nope.

506
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,318
I ordered chinese for me.

507
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,742
Come on.

508
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,867
I'm sorry about what happened.

509
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:30,411
It was stupid and immature,

510
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,367
and how can I be talked
into something that was just...

511
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:34,532
so much fun?

512
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,891
When's the last time I cut loose?

513
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:47,781
Before Julia left?

514
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,352
Maybe I'm just not supposed
to give a shit about having fun.

515
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:58,230
Maybe you reach
a certain age, and...

516
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,851
fun just isn't what life's about.

517
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:05,029
Certainly hasn't been
what my life's about.

518
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:15,846
Hurts, doesn't it?

519
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:19,176
Probably not as bad as when you stuck
a needle into my daughter's mouth!

520
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,179
What the hell is wrong with you?

521
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,997
It's sterile
and there's nothing in it.

522
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:25,257
Very different from the crap
you shot into Jenna's lips

523
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,256
so she could sign
some modeling contract.

524
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:29,435
- Did you actually do that?
- Of course not!

525
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,181
Stop lying, man!
I just picked her up from a play date

526
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,788
she looks like she's got
a damn innertube in her upper lip!

527
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,094
That was my daughter,
how could you do that?

528
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,774
It wasn't me, you asshole.

529
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:41,142
Did you ever think about Kimber?

530
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,255
Where's your phone?

531
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,322
- I swear to god...
- Shut up!

532
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,333
What do you want? I'm shopping.

533
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,750
It's Christian on speakerphone
with Matt so he can hear.

534
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,801
Who did you get
to shoot up my granddaughter?

535
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:12,858
Both of you need to calm down.
There's nothing wrong with Jenna.

536
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:14,082
Her lips are fine.

537
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,504
- I'm the one who gave her the shot.
- You did what?!

538
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:18,520
I've been injected a thousand times.

539
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,263
I know where to aim
and I know how hard to squeeze.

540
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:22,569
It's completely safe.

541
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:25,731
<i>I simply borrowed the supplies from
Christian when he refused to do it,</i>

542
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,304
<i>and now Jenna's a star.</i>

543
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:31,115
Alley cats who dump their litters
in gutters make better mothers than you.

544
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,346
Then why don't you sue me, Matt?

545
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:36,412
On second thought you better not,
because I'll haul your ass into court

546
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,415
<i>for the months you're behind
on Jenna's child support.</i>

547
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,125
Why don't you shut up

548
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,919
<i>- and say thank you?</i>
- What... thank you for what?

549
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,363
Your daughter is only 18 months old

550
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:50,084
and she's already more
of a success than you'll ever be.

551
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:51,263
Be grateful.

552
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,311
I'm sorry I stabbed you.

553
00:33:08,245 --> 00:33:10,832
Don't pop
any champagne corks just yet, Aidan.

554
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:12,716
I'm not saying yes.

555
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:15,534
I just wanted to know
what the numbers might be.

556
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:17,577
All right.

557
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:19,111
I'll call you.

558
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:24,126
Aidan says they're willing
to pay 300,000 for the rights,

559
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,378
and another 50 to consult on
the production.

560
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,713
Holy shit.

561
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,494
I don't know. If you could have
read this script, it is terrible.

562
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,049
So have them hire
someone else to rewrite it.

563
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,508
- Or don't, who cares?
- I care.

564
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:38,080
I mean, I don't want
my image misrepresented.

565
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:41,101
I've performed some of the most
interesting surgeries of all time.

566
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:43,134
Of all time?

567
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:47,399
Go hang out with Mr. Skerritt,
you two have so much in common.

568
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,417
You both like blowing yourselves.

569
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:53,072
I don't need to listen to this.

570
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,104
You don't understand
the pressures I'm under.

571
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,325
Trying to raise 3 kids,

572
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,913
trying to save up,
buy a place of my own.

573
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,865
And you're willing
to turn down $350,000?

574
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,288
You walk around here like you have
a camera on you, Mr. Perfect.

575
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,589
The dirty secret is, no one cares.

576
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,299
Take the cash,

577
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,011
give half of it to Manny Skerritt
and blow the rest on a trip to Vegas.

578
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,180
Stop worrying about
how people are going to react,

579
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,349
and do what you want to do.

580
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:22,935
Really. It's that simple?

581
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:25,270
It's that simple.

582
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,053
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself.

583
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,521
I'll tell you what I don't like
about LA, bro...

584
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:46,678
doing 95 down sunset's
against the law.

585
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:50,462
What happened to your neck?

586
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:52,622
Funny story.

587
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,723
I was...

588
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:57,529
I was out bird dogging
with my greatest bro, Patty D...

589
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,099
Dempsey.

590
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,149
And paparazzi
stops us at a stoplight,

591
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,732
and then...
we peeled out when the light changed.

592
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:07,330
Got some distance on those jerks,
and then...

593
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:10,435
my Maserati hits an ice pass.
And the next thing I know,

594
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,569
we're slammed against a phone
poll at Beverly Glen. So weird.

595
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:17,025
You hit an ice patch
on sunset boulevard?

596
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:20,993
Anyway, broke my neck.

597
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,756
Wait, does this mean that

598
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:25,236
the Sean Mcnamara story
is not happening?

599
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:28,290
- Do I have to give the money back?
- Jesus, is it always about you?

600
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:29,579
I broke my neck.

601
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:32,995
The producers pushed the start date.

602
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,424
It was a good thing for me,
I can rewrite the script

603
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,782
and, make it better,
more honest, more real.

604
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:40,404
Ret rid of all that
boring bullshit with...

605
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:41,710
what's her name...

606
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:43,550
- Julia?
- Julia and the kid.

607
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,989
Let's make it more
about my character.

608
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:49,480
- Really flesh it out. Workshop it.
- So what are you doing here, Aidan?

609
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,565
I get these things out tomorrow,

610
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:56,257
and I know that they're gonna leave
a nasty scar right at my temples.

611
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:59,179
That's easy. I think we can
fit you in friday morning.

612
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:02,716
Great. That's perf...
yeah, I gotta get back to work.

613
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,188
Which reminds me...

614
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,607
you know, when I'm under,

615
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:17,091
you guys wouldn't mind adding
a couple inches in my pants?

616
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,227
You want a penis enlargement?

617
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:22,387
Unless you can leng then my tongue.

618
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:29,434
You broke your neck trying to
suck your dick, didn't you?

619
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:31,775
What?

620
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,636
Where did you come up with that?

621
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,536
That's... what are you...
that's just...

622
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,406
I can't keep the charade up.

623
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,099
I wasn't bird doggin'.

624
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,269
There was no ice patch.

625
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:53,293
Ever since Manny Skerritt taught
me how to pleasure myself,

626
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,151
I've been a man possessed.
I have gotten so close so many times.

627
00:36:57,823 --> 00:36:59,886
But I just couldn't...
I just couldn't...

628
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,330
get to the... you know,
I just couldn't...

629
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,979
I just wanted to give it little
baby kisses, that's all I wanted.

630
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:08,141
- I didn't ask much.
- Then what happened?

631
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:12,729
I fall of my goddamn bed
and I break my c2 vertebrae.

632
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:18,193
I just want to taste some nectar,
guys. That's all I want.

633
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,071
Can you make that happen?

634
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:36,788
So, we have some scars from his
neckbrace that we'll have to revise,

635
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:38,715
as well as the penis enlargement.

636
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,246
And I always say,
start with the hard stuff first.

637
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,371
15 blade.

638
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,545
A 15 blade? Are you sure
you don't want a paperclip?

639
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,308
I mean, Linda, have you ever
seen anything that small?

640
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,236
Looks like 2 blueberries
and a cocktail weenie.

641
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:54,683
He doesn't need surgery.
He needs a miracle.

642
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna...

643
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,515
don't need to cause anymore trouble.

644
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,603
Actually, you know what,

645
00:38:02,728 --> 00:38:04,791
he's the one
that caused all the trouble.

646
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,672
He almost cost you your license.

647
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,660
- Prick.
- Little prick.

648
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:13,156
Do you have your phone on you?

649
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,263
- What are you doing?
- Just a little insurance policy

650
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:25,213
just in case my fee
on the Sean Mcnamara story

651
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:27,024
doesn't quite cover my expenses.

652
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,806
Heh, here we go.

653
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:33,071
Yeah, now I can offer up
a little blackmail of my own.

654
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,983
Have dinner with me tonight.

655
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:42,428
Sorry, not interested.

656
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:46,990
I was thinking of something
a little more adventurous.

657
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,893
You're so beautiful.

658
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:16,721
You are perfect.

659
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,489
And I love you.

660
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,401
I love you very much.

661
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,536
I want you to know that...

662
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,943
that everything I do for you,
I do...

663
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,495
I want you to know that there's somebody
who would give their life for you.

664
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,388
You know?

665
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:48,816
Christian, come on, get out of here,
we have a shoot to do.

666
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:55,104
Her lips are impeccable.

667
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:56,766
And just the right plump.

668
00:40:31,414 --> 00:40:34,473
- What the hell are you doing?
- What need to be done, Christian.

669
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,094
It's lopsided,
you sick, twisted bitch.

670
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:41,139
I've had filler a thousand times.
It just needs time to spread.

671
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:43,380
Right?

672
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,076
Give me the goddamn needle.

673
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:48,943
She looks deformed.

674
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,380
See, she's not even crying.

675
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:01,491
Like they said,
when you mix it with lidocaine,

676
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,094
it just feels like a kiss.

677
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,053
Now, you are perfect,

678
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,545
aren't you, sweetie?

679
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:17,574
By the time I turn around,
you better be gone.

680
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,162
Don't worry, grandpa.

681
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,169
Your reputation's safe,
I'll take the fall.

682
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,490
Everyone thinks
I'm a horrible mother anyways.
