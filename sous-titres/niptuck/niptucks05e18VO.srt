1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,296
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,399
You've enrolled
at Santa Monica College?

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,068
I want to try the pre-med thing.

4
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:08,226
I missed being the youngest person
to graduate from Harvard by 12 days.

5
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:11,588
His name is Raj. He kind of reminds me
of myself when I was in med school.

6
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:13,765
What does breast cancer have to do
with anything?

7
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:14,890
I have it.

8
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:17,475
Can you stay a while?

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,169
Is it really so terrible for Wilbur
to wake up to aunt Lizzie?

10
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:32,866
Less teeth.

11
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,481
No. More hand.

12
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,336
That's it.

13
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:40,597
No, no. Settle down.

14
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,834
For somebody with such a big mouth,
you sure suck at this.

15
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,300
It's only my third blow job.

16
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:50,475
But if you give me some pointers,
I can get better.

17
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:53,426
Listen to me.
I think it's about me. I...

18
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,429
It's not you. I think I'm just nervous
about the surgery.

19
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,216
Got you.

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,040
This is not a big deal.

21
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:06,941
There's more to our relationship
than sex.

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,629
In a way, it kind of interferes
with the intimacy.

23
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:10,563
My god.

24
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,446
- Don't you think?
- We have L.B.D.

25
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:15,599
- English, lizzie.
- Lesbian bed death.

26
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,216
It happens after a year or so.

27
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,616
There's just too much talking
and not enough screwing,

28
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,709
except with us,
it's happening after the first week!

29
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:28,050
You're overthinking this.
You were great today with wilbur.

30
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,548
We laughed ourselves silly at the pier,
right?

31
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,539
I mean, how much more fun
do you want to get out of a day?

32
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,472
Put on "project runway."
I got to go pee.

33
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,390
Hey, lizzie. Here, put this on.

34
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:48,094
You can't even look at me naked.

35
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,726
It's chilly.
I don't want you to get cold.

36
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:42,310
So, Ricky, tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

37
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,973
I want to look older.

38
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,132
Mrs. Wells,
children do mature at different rates.

39
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:51,311
Have you and your son considered
just letting nature run its course?

40
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,065
She is not my mother.

41
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,778
She's my wife.

42
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,417
We were married a few weeks ago.

43
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,574
Congratulations.

44
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,442
Obviously,
you are attracted to Ricky,

45
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,326
youthful appearance and all.
Why would you want to change that now?

46
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:10,951
I don't.
I like him just the way he is,

47
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,750
for what's inside.

48
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,053
What's between us is ageless,

49
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:16,963
but the world doesn't see it
that way.

50
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,957
We can never make people understand.

51
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,169
I've been in love with her

52
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,967
from the first moment we met.

53
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,764
I was teaching 2nd grade,

54
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,822
and this sweet 8-year-old boy

55
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,812
walked into my homeroom
and entered my heart.

56
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:36,532
- You fell in love with an 8- year-old?
- No, of course not.

57
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,286
We just...

58
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,187
we had a rapport.

59
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,291
But then later, when I was teaching
seventh grade and Ricky showed up

60
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,394
- in my class again...
- I was 13.

61
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,819
But he was very mature for his age.

62
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,833
He seemed to understand me
in a way that no man ever had.

63
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,959
Do you believe in soulmates, doctor?

64
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:58,745
I believe that little boys have crushes
on their teachers

65
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,050
and that those teachers are supposed
to have boundaries.

66
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,696
But that's the thing
about falling in love.

67
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,269
There are no boundaries.

68
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,473
My life was transformed.

69
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,893
You think I would have picked
Ricky if I had a choice?

70
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,332
It was as if I finally found
happiness,

71
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,940
and I was not going to let
that go...

72
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,984
even though
everything conspired against us.

73
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:33,152
I pled guilty to two counts of
statutory rape.

74
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,483
I was let go after 6 months
for good behavior

75
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,358
on the condition
that I not see Ricky again.

76
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,576
I... I couldn't stay away.

77
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,323
I just...

78
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,678
I couldn't.

79
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:55,747
But I was a convicted sex offender.

80
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,702
So they were monitoring
my whereabouts.

81
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,227
Yes, sweetie. God.

82
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,617
Shit.

83
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,616
I went back to prison
for the full term.

84
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,453
The minute I turned 18,

85
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:14,728
I applied to the court
to lift the no-contact order.

86
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,133
The request was granted, and...

87
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,712
we got married a week later.

88
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,920
Well, we're free now.

89
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,385
Who gives a shit what people say?

90
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,431
Sorry.

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,722
Once a teacher...

92
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,562
If you don't care what they say,
why do you care what you look like?

93
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,730
Because I'm gonna be a father.

94
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,566
I'm 4 months along.

95
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:45,316
I don't want people to think
I'm my kid's older brother.

96
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,363
That would be disrespectful
to carrie may

97
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,307
and the family
we're trying to build.

98
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:52,589
Our love has been legitimized
in the eyes of the law, but...

99
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:54,564
we can't transform society.

100
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:59,393
So we'll do what we need to do
so that people leave us in peace.

101
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,342
- What?
- Just focus. You're getting careless.

102
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,983
I'm never eating bacon again.

103
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,691
There we go.

104
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,530
There.

105
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,041
- Done.
- Good job...

106
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,216
if you were asked to remove a lung,
not the liver.

107
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,775
If this was your biology final,
you'd fail.

108
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:26,277
I told you, I want to help you prepare,
but I thought you'd at least study.

109
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,946
I did study.
I just don't understand it.

110
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,765
It takes practice and repetion,
all right?

111
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,129
If you want to be a surgeon,

112
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:38,106
you're gonna have to know
all this stuff backward and forward.

113
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,792
And this is how you start.

114
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,125
Now,

115
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,733
give me the heart.

116
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,595
It's too hard, dad, OK?

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,849
I'm just not smart enough
to understand it,

118
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:52,224
and I want to gag every time
I have to cut something open.

119
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:55,272
- I was squeamish at first, too.
- I guess I'm just not you.

120
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:58,097
I didn't inherit your brains
for this shit.

121
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:15,474
- Is our patient prepped and ready?
- Yes, he is, Dr. Paresh.

122
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,162
I must say I'm very much looking
forward to this operation.

123
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,833
This kind of pectoral reconstruction
is very rare.

124
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,040
I almost feel lucky.

125
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,087
Christian might disagree with you.

126
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,665
But what he cannot disagree
with is the good hands he's in,

127
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,801
both yours and mine.

128
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,761
Like Michelangelo, Rodin...

129
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,849
we are master sculptors at work,
are we not?

130
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,267
Except you're not working with stone,
but human flesh.

131
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,521
You must be greater
than the sculptor.

132
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:46,201
Father. What are you doing here?

133
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:48,363
The convention isn't
for another couple of weeks.

134
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,828
I came here to see my son at work.

135
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,370
Dr. Sean Mcnamara,
this is my father,

136
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:56,797
the renowned cardiothoracic surgeon
Dr. Vijay Paresh.

137
00:08:56,922 --> 00:09:00,247
- He's just arrived from Bangalore.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

138
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,415
Raj speaks very highly of you.

139
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,376
That is pleasant to hear.

140
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:05,703
May I ask,

141
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,147
what is the operation
the two of you will be performing today?

142
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,925
Pectoral reconstruction,
post-mastectomy,

143
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,794
on my partner, actually.

144
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,013
I am only assisting Dr. Mcnamara.

145
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,307
Is it OK if I watch?

146
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,392
Of course.

147
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:30,145
I was thinking we should order
from the grill. What do you think?

148
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,614
On me, since you guys are doing
all the work and I'm just laying here.

149
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:35,387
This one's pretty relaxed.

150
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,946
He's about to have invasive surgery,
and all's he can think about is food.

151
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,579
Can I put him out now? Please?

152
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,957
Make me beautiful.

153
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,677
You're in good hands.

154
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,587
I know.

155
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,515
Count back from 100.

156
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,090
From 100?

157
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:57,614
- 100.
- OK.

158
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,652
{\100.
99.}

159
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,164
I wanted to tell you
you look very beautiful today.

160
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Have you lost a few pounds?

161
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,962
I have. Now I just have to figure out
something to do with my hair.

162
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,900
Yes, and your clothes.

163
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:36,818
Hit it.

164
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:39,627
15-blade.

165
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,379
- Who's that in the hallway?
- My father.

166
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,338
You two must have
a great relationship.

167
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,134
A son following
in his father's footsteps.

168
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,095
And speaking of sons,
there's yours, Sean.

169
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:25,426
Raj, come over on this side.

170
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,687
Why don't you anchor the implant?

171
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,106
Use horizontal mattress sutures,
and then close.

172
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,028
Show off for your father.

173
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,494
What's going on?

174
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,812
I wanted to be here
for Christian's surgery...

175
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:50,406
- you know, for when he wakes up?
- Don't you have a midterm today?

176
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:55,044
And I wanted
to stop by to let you know in person

177
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,965
I decided to drop organic chemistry.

178
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,080
- No, matt, you can't.
- I have to.

179
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,346
Between Jenna and classes,
something has to give here.

180
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,951
Look. I know having a kid
at your age is hard.

181
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:11,640
I wasn't much older when you were born.
But you can do it, matt, OK?

182
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,806
And I want to help you
as much as possible.

183
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,692
I'm gonna ask Raj to tutor you.

184
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,802
He's a whiz with this stuff.

185
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,529
I got to go pick up jenna.
I'll see you back at the house?

186
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,688
Children can bring much headache,
can't they, Dr. Mcnamara?

187
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:45,432
If Matt had
half the ambition your son has...

188
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:50,143
I know some of it's my fault. We've had
some hard times over the years.

189
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,221
You and Raj just seem much...

190
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,011
closer.

191
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,331
I didn't fly 8,000 miles
just to see my son operate.

192
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,030
I'm here to get surgery myself.

193
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:05,200
Now, your office does
penile enhancements, don't they?

194
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,976
Very impressive setup, Dr. McNamara.

195
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,937
My son has many more advantages
than when I started.

196
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,648
But you made so much
with the little you did have, father.

197
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:38,037
True.

198
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,142
Still, you are very lucky.

199
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:41,682
First born...

200
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,157
they hold all your hopes
and dreams hostage, don't they?

201
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,493
Which is why you must be the one
to perform my penis enlargement.

202
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:52,615
Where can I get something to drink?

203
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:03,651
Father,

204
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,925
to ask me to perform that surgery,
I'm...

205
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,097
I'm s... I'm very...

206
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,308
- Honored?
Freaked out.

207
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,392
About touching my lingam?

208
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,290
You are a doctor.

209
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,758
There would be no problem
if I were any other patient.

210
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,640
It's not that. I just... I...

211
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:24,498
- Why would you want such a thing done?
- When your mother was alive,

212
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,778
I never had a problem with my size.

213
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:29,534
Now she's gone,
and I'm traveling the world,

214
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,370
and I want something more substantial
to wield in my intimacies.

215
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,843
- You mean you want to whore around?
- I loved your mother dearly.

216
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,977
And she was
the reason for my living.

217
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:40,502
And I want
to enjoy myself some more.

218
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,715
You'll understand when you're married
for 20 years yourself.

219
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:48,969
Am I embarrassing you?

220
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:52,469
Dr. Paresh, maybe because
of the delicacy of the operation,

221
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:56,592
you'd be more comfortable with a senior,
more experienced surgeon like myself

222
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,146
to perform your surgery.

223
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,957
Surely you can understand what an honor
it would be to have my own son,

224
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:06,238
the benefit of all my teaching,
perform the surgery on me.

225
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:10,033
Could there be no prouder moment for
a father?

226
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,453
I'd just be happy
if my son passed biology right now.

227
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,860
Matt. Yes, I have to tutor him.

228
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:19,338
I won't be available to operate
in the time that you're here.

229
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:22,045
- Sorry, previous commitment.
- The only true commitment you have

230
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,880
is to your family, Rajeesh.

231
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:30,877
Very good.

232
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,472
I will do the surgery.

233
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,889
You are right.
What other duty do I have?

234
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:39,951
You are my father,
and I owe you everything.

235
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,539
My boy, you have made me so proud.

236
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,182
Christian Troy is back in action.

237
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:32,741
Hello?

238
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,949
Guess what, honey?

239
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,283
I am in full girl drag!

240
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:48,525
You look great.

241
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,985
Could you close the door
on your way out?

242
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,840
Oh, I don't think so.

243
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:56,482
Get your goddamn skinny ass
up off that tub,

244
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:57,940
and get out of this house!

245
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,120
Does your mom always yell
at your girlfriends?

246
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,415
Mama is a little possessive.

247
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:07,768
Well, are you just gonna stand there
smiling like a cheshire cat?

248
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,631
Yeah. Yeah. Actually...

249
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,718
I don't want mama mad at both of us.

250
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,073
You'd better go.

251
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:18,198
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,037
Here you go.

253
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:24,731
So...

254
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,593
I hold your head over the toilet,

255
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:32,189
I mop up your stinky vomit,
I rub your back fill in

256
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,647
when you're too sick
to take care of your child,

257
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:36,906
and this is the way you treat me!

258
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,390
I even took a class
on the goddamn art of fellatio,

259
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:41,665
you dickhead!

260
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,455
What is wrong with you?

261
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,875
Has the chemo killed every bit of class
that you ever had?

262
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:48,416
Settle down, killer.

263
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,102
We never, ever talked about a...
a monogamous relationship.

264
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:55,077
I mean,
that was just never even on the table.

265
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,885
I'm not talking about monogamy.

266
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,191
I am talking about respect.

267
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,956
I know you. You haven't been faithful
since the year John Lennon died.

268
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,895
I don't expect to be the person
who's gonna change any of that.

269
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,993
But should I have
my face rubbed in it?

270
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,780
Do I have to remind you
that this is my house?

271
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,281
Do I have to remind you

272
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,149
that you invited me over here
this evening?

273
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:25,901
You look great.

274
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:28,666
Those pumps... fantastic.
Did you lose weight?

275
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:32,311
- Bite me.
- Come on.

276
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,669
Look, I'm an asshole.
I'm a dickhead.

277
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,842
Let's just go out to dinner or
something...

279
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,315
before you turn back into a pumpkin
and your hair goes brillo again.

280
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,535
Come on, Lizzie.

281
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,185
You can buy me dinner.

282
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,033
And when we get back,

283
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:06,992
you clean the tub.

284
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:31,631
Whatever happened to kids his age
just trying to score a fake I.D.?

285
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:33,439
It's just so sad.

286
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,255
This is not
about him wanting to buy beer.

287
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,995
Looking older is about wanting
to be taken seriously,

288
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,706
as a man and a parent.

289
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,769
I've had my share of beards, and
they didn't fool anyone except for me.

290
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,968
Look how well that turned out.

291
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,874
Things not going so well
with Dr. Troy?

292
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,716
Let's just say that no matter
what you do to the outside,

293
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,686
the inside never really changes...

294
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,842
which is bad news for him.

295
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,328
Maybe.

296
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:04,794
But any advantage you can get
when you're 18

297
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,140
and you're about to have a kid,
I'm all for.

298
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,452
You had Matt when you were pretty young.
How'd you cope with all the pressure?

299
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,725
I guess I just did the best I could

300
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:17,816
and hoped everything
would turn out all right.

301
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:21,298
Wouldn't that be great
if that's all it took?

302
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:24,228
Just doing the best you can
and hoping.

303
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,708
- Hey, Raj.
- Dr. Sean Mcnamara, hello.

304
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,691
I was just researching
my father's surgery.

305
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:57,484
Where's Matt?

306
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,609
Aren't you supposed
to be tutoring him right now?

307
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:02,892
For the last hour, yes,
but he has not shown up.

308
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:07,283
- Perhaps he forgot.
- I reminded him again last night.

309
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:10,716
As did I. He was meant
to be bringing dinner, too.

310
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:13,391
- I have been famished.
- Yeah, me, too.

311
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,917
It's been a long day.

312
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:23,298
My mouth is on fire,I can't stop
eating these amazing poultry samples.

313
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,267
You've really never had
chicken wings before?

314
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:29,805
Got to try that blue cheese.
It takes it to a whole other level.

315
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Right?

316
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,175
And the best combination...

317
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,066
is when you wash it all down
with a cold beer.

318
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,343
My father kept me
on a strict vegetarian diet growing up.

319
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:49,071
Have to keep the mind focused.
He'd never have allowed me to eat these.

320
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:51,077
He'd be very upset
if he saw me eating these.

321
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,626
These, I call soul food,
because they taste great,

322
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,569
they're bad for you,
but they keep your spirits up.

323
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,394
Sometimes you need that.

324
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,341
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, one sip's OK.

325
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:08,647
I've brought you this far.

326
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,938
Yeah, OK. All right.

327
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,026
- Can we get some more?
- No.

328
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:27,093
Your father would kill me
if he found out.

329
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,459
Matt is very lucky
to have a father like you.

330
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,741
Now, if only he could get your grades,
we'd both be happy.

331
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,126
Chicken wings anonymous.

332
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,547
Where are you?
I thought we were working tonight.

333
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:47,425
Matt! Your father and I
were just talking about you.

334
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,958
<i>Tell me, have you ever had beer?</i>

335
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,054
What? I can barely hear you, man.

336
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,976
Hey, we waited at the house
for over an hour. What happened?

337
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:01,251
Yeah. I got held up.
I'm sorry about that.

338
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,707
Wait a minute.
Are you guys at a bar?

339
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,683
Yes, and, Raj and I are having
a little soul food.

340
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,784
So we'll have to catch up
when I get home, OK?

341
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,787
Well, wait. I can come
and meet you guys. Where are you?

342
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:16,955
Hello?

343
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,584
That's awesome, dad.

344
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,235
Some things never change.

345
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:44,313
Smooth.
Compliments to your trainer.

346
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:00,516
- What's this scar from?
- A knife wound.

347
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:03,175
I stopped a bank robbery.

348
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,234
My God! What is that?

349
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,609
- What?
- Your tit... it's moving.

350
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:31,742
Jesus.

351
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:58,014
- Who is it?
<i>- It's Christian.</i>

352
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:01,057
- Don't you believe in calling?
<i>- It's impolite to call after 12:00.</i>

353
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,964
<i>- It was a joke, Lizzie. Let me in.</i>
- No.

354
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,400
No! I'm asleep.
I'm only pretending to be awake. Oh, no.

355
00:26:11,143 --> 00:26:13,993
Casa de la Cruz is closed,
and so are my legs.

356
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:18,764
Oh, Jesus Christ! What is that?

357
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,955
It's my implant.
It has a life of its own.

358
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,550
I tried calling Sean,
he wouldn't pick up, the asshole.

359
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:26,125
Well, you know what?
It's no big deal.

360
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,485
The sutures tore. They got loose.

361
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,881
You weren't supposed to be engaging in
anything strenuous. You know that?

362
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,649
What's going on, babe?

363
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:40,473
- Are you cheating on me?
- You're straight?

364
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:41,737
No.

365
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,602
And yes. Now go.
You know what, honey?

366
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,938
I'm gonna be right back in.
Just one second, OK?

367
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,129
I promise.

368
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:53,068
I mean it, Christian. Now, go.

369
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:57,484
When you get in the office
in the morning, we'll re-suture...

370
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:58,991
half an hour, tops.

371
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:02,066
I can't believe you've gone
back to muff diving.

372
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,704
At least if it was a man,
I know I could win.

373
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,029
And winning is what counts, right?

374
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,888
Do you love her?

375
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,066
Good night, Christian.

376
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,047
Good morning, baby.

377
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,935
Look who came to see your unveiling.

378
00:27:26,304 --> 00:27:27,895
Hey, bro. What's up?

379
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:31,983
Good to see you, pop.

380
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,819
I missed you, son.
We've all missed you.

381
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,438
Really?
Then how come mom didn't come?

382
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,158
She wanted to,
but I said that's too many people.

383
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,162
She wants you and Carrie
may to come over.

384
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,716
She told me as soon as you got out,
she's gonna make a big Jambalaya feast.

385
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:49,020
I guess I'm not the devil anymore.

386
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:52,128
We just,
we just want to know our grandchild.

387
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,630
- Isn't that great, baby?
- Wow. That's fantastic.

388
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,695
Hello, everyone. So,

389
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,490
are we ready to unveil the new,
mature Ricky?

390
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,983
We certainly are. Oh, and,

391
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:06,892
this is
Ricky's little brother Chris.

392
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,917
He's always been a supporter
of our relationship. He's young,

393
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,492
but he understands.

394
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:17,473
- I'm Robert, Ricky's father.
- Good to meet you.

395
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:18,598
OK.

396
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,449
Let's see.

397
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:50,896
Can you believe it?

398
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:54,148
What do you think, babe? Do I look
more like a husband and father?

399
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:55,475
My God.

400
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,236
You look so different,
it's kind of shocking.

401
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:03,616
I hope it's what you were looking for.
I think it's natural. It's still you,

402
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,009
but with a little more gravitas.

403
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:09,038
I think it'll give you
that leg up you want.

404
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,357
It's amazing.

405
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:13,417
I mean,
don't take this the wrong way, but...

406
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,931
- You look like dad now.
- Yeah.

407
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:18,818
You certainly do.

408
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:40,265
Wait, please. What exactly
are your percentages,

409
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,208
and what depth of Guedel's stages
are you taking me?

410
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:44,948
Medical info to follow.

411
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,952
I'm not a horse you're putting under.
Who taught you your job?

412
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,913
Father, Dr. Liz Cruz is a
fantastic anesthesiologist.

413
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,596
Liz and I have done thousands
of surgeries together.

414
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:56,571
I assure you
you could not be in better hands.

415
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:59,797
Sean! How long
until you're gonna be done in here?

416
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,672
My tit is falling all over the place.
It's underneath my ribcage.

417
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:05,052
- You need to fix it.
- You ruptured your sutures?

418
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,097
- What did you do, run a marathon?
- Bagged another bimbo.

419
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,988
This is your fault, not mine.

420
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:12,243
You obviously didn't secure
the implant properly.

421
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,368
How could you be so careless?

422
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,154
Sean did not do that to you,
Dr. Christian Troy. I did.

423
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,956
My sutures were clearly substandard.

424
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,053
You let Doogie Howser operate on me?

425
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:35,623
Oh. Do you realize
if I was a regular patient,

426
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,170
- you could be sued for malpractice?
- It is completely my mistake, sir.

427
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,508
You were the one who fouled up
this man's surgical implant?

428
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,387
Yes, but I was a big enough man
to admit it.

429
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:50,689
It doesn't take a big man
to admit his mistakes

430
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:53,402
when only a fool makes them
in the first place!

431
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,309
Since you are the one
who taught me everything I know,

432
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,584
perhaps it is your fault as well.

433
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,735
Don't you ever blame
your incompetence on me!

434
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:12,988
My apologies.

435
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,390
He deserved that.

436
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,076
Get me out of here.

437
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,692
So you really know enough
about hydrocarbons to do this?

438
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,974
I told you if got me high, I'd write
the organic chemistry paper for you.

439
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:38,104
Just dumb it down before you hand it in.
Nobody will know the difference.

440
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:43,001
I love this refreshing
alcoholic beverage.

441
00:31:43,126 --> 00:31:45,498
I never had one before your father
bought one for me.

442
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:49,073
I don't think that guy ever bought me
a drink in my entire life.

443
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,500
My dad's a complete hard-ass.

444
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,168
Does he hit you?

445
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:58,082
Yeah,
it's been known to happen, sure.

446
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:00,565
Really?

447
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:04,612
- That is a surprise to me.
- Well, it was only once.

448
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,740
I lied to my parents.

449
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,994
I was drunk, and I shoved my mom.

450
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:14,678
And I dared him to do it.

451
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,650
- So you deserved it.
- Yeah.

452
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:26,944
I remember one day my father hit me
when I came home with a "B"

453
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:28,904
for my midterm physics exam.

454
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,492
He said I'd embarrassed him.

455
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:34,509
Not one studentgot an "A."
The highest mark was a "B,"

456
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,234
but I embarrassed him.
I was 9 years old.

457
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,781
Ever since I was old enough to hold
a baby rattle,

458
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:45,044
my father has pushed, pushed,
pushed me to be a surgeon.

459
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,765
He always said I had
such a great gift

460
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,614
and that if I didn't work
as hard as I could to become a surgeon,

461
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,598
that it would be
the equivalent of murder,

462
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:55,350
that I would be murdering people
if I didn't work

463
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,925
as hard as I could
to save more lives.

464
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,926
- That's insane.
- Exactly.

465
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:03,675
What do you say to that?

466
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,692
You'd think when I told him that
I was going to become a plastic surgeon

467
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,482
instead of a heart specialist like him,
he would have gotten the hint, but no.

468
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:14,950
He just said, "son, you will only
be doing reconstructive operations?

469
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,952
"None of this cosmetic bullshit."

470
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,456
This coming from a man
who wants his dick made bigger!

471
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,589
Sometimes I think...

472
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,440
the only way for
me to stop him is...

473
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,850
is to cut off my hands.

474
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,389
Look. I get it, man.

475
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:39,892
Your dad pushed you really hard.

476
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:41,555
That sucks.

477
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,271
But you're already
a plastic surgeon.

478
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:47,561
That's a pretty sweet way
to live a life, Raj.

479
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,359
But it's not my dream.

480
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,460
And now I'm 17, and I have
my entire life planned out for me.

481
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,492
I don't have a choice.

482
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:03,791
I always thought it would be cool
to be a "playboy" photographer.

483
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:10,702
Meanwhile, my entire sexual history
consists of a single blow job...

484
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:13,050
from a man.

485
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:18,091
Oh, my life sucks, Matt.

486
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,420
Don't worry about it, man.

487
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,118
I had sex with a transsexual once.

488
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,565
Several times, actually.

489
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
It's true.

490
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,738
Oh, man.

491
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:38,847
I got to call my sponsor. I sh...

492
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,334
should not be doing this.

493
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,238
What a joke, you know?

494
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:49,086
I'm closer to my sponsor
than I am my own dad.

495
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,935
You've got to do me a favor.

496
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,839
What?

497
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:03,684
Get out of the car
and come over to my side.

498
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,853
- Why?
- Matt, please.

499
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,308
- Over to my side.
- Yeah, OK.

500
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:22,236
- Slam the door on it.
- Dude, you're totally baked.

501
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:23,524
No. No way.

502
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:26,449
Do it. I won't tell anyone
you were involved.

503
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,003
- What?
- Matt, I have been thinking about this

504
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:34,131
for a very long time,
and it is the only way out for me.

505
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:37,841
- Do it.
- Look, Raj, this is nuts, man.

506
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:38,966
Do it!

507
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:43,453
If you don't do it,
I'll just find someone else who will.

508
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:44,811
Do it.

509
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,934
Do it because your father hit you.

510
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:50,814
Do it because he is pressuring you
to be a doctor.

511
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:54,651
Do it because he likes me
better than he likes you.

512
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,529
Do it because next to me,
your life is a failure!

513
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:00,532
You are a loser, Matt!

514
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,408
You are an embarrassment!

515
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:05,412
You are nothing!
Your father told me!

516
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:10,058
I was able to reattach
most of the severed nerve endings...

517
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,439
but he'll never have
complete use of his hand.

518
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,667
That's tough.

519
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,620
I know he was like a son to you.

520
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:35,511
The son I have is the son I love,

521
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:38,577
whether he shares my dreams or not.

522
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:42,646
You don't have to be a doctor
for me to love you, matt.

523
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,263
Just comes with the territory.

524
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:49,835
I can't understand

525
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,610
how Raj could have slammed the door
like that on his own hand.

526
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,824
If you're desperate enough,

527
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,114
I guess you'll do
whatever it takes to be heard.

528
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:12,289
Come on.

529
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:14,082
I'll walk with you.

530
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:19,361
So if you don't want to be a doctor,

531
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:21,136
what do you want to be?

532
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,772
- You'll laugh.
- I might.

533
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,063
But try me. I'm listening.

534
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,272
OK. Well, you know,

535
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,974
last year when you were
on "hearts'n scalpels,"

536
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,399
I thought, well,

537
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:35,832
maybe that's what I should be,
you know, a doctor.

538
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,463
Then I realized
I don't actually want to be a doctor.

539
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:42,488
I just want to play one on tv.

540
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:45,524
- You want to be an actor?
- Yeah!

541
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:48,310
Look, man.
You were awesome on that show.

542
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:49,541
So in a way,

543
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:52,111
I'll still be
following in your footsteps,

544
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:55,793
just without the organic chemistry
and cutting up fetal pigs.

545
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,430
Believe me, Matt,
after a year of acting,

546
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:00,405
you're gonna miss that pig.

547
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:07,238
- Be good.
- I'll try.

548
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:13,144
Honey, I'm home.

549
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,543
I sold two copiers today.

550
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:30,927
Can I talk to you about something?

551
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,484
Hey. Long day?

552
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:49,061
Very.

553
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,928
What are you doing?

554
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,600
Liz won't be coming over tonight
for your kiss-and-make-up dinner.

555
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,980
- How do you know?
- She told me,

556
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:03,755
right after she resigned.

557
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,354
She'll get over it.

558
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,970
I thought
she was differentfrom the others.

559
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,301
You mean lacking sensitivity?
Impervious to your bullshit?

560
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:16,095
Sorry, pal. Women are women,
even if they used to be lesbians.

561
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,467
I don't need your opinion on this.
I know you don't approve.

562
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,165
I kept my mouth shut
about your relationship the entire time.

563
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,944
I thought it was a terrible idea.
You don't shit where you eat.

564
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:27,184
Oh, look. Spare me the cliches
and the sensitivity, would you?

565
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:29,089
- I don't need it.
- You do.

566
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:31,863
You break hearts and you hurt people
with your narcissism,

567
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:34,592
and the sad thing is,
Liz thought you would change for her.

568
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:37,408
Love and sex don't have to be
interchangeable. Lizzie knows that.

569
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:40,035
Apparently not,
because right after she resigned

570
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,597
and I lost the best anesthesiologist
I ever had,

571
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:44,626
she informed
she's moving back to miami.
