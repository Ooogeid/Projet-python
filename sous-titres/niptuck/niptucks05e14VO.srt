Bob Levitz, creative artists agency.

3
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:06,761
You thought, "I'll just
make a few snide remarks

4
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:09,013
and then Sean will be all yours!"

5
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:12,141
this is the end of our relationship.
Do you understand?

6
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:14,311
Darling, what have you done?

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,228
- Emme, this is Matt.
- Hi!

8
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:19,231
These last dates have
just been so amazing.

9
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,118
- I met my father.
- Who is he?

10
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,235
My plastic surgeon. Dr. Troy.

11
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,030
You've been poisoning me.

Season 5 Episode 14
<i>Candy Richards</i>

13
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:36,719
- Ms. Richards, tell us...
- What the hell happened to you?

14
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:37,833
Jesus.

15
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:41,170
Yeah, I assume
you're referring to my tits...

16
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,275
Gale and Bozina.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,633
Look at this.

18
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,511
I'm like a leaning human tower of Pisa.

19
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:51,054
I have to use every bit of my strength
not to keep

20
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:53,526
going around in circles.

21
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:55,559
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- What?

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,436
You mean my deer-in-headlights look?

23
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:00,741
All I wanted was a little fat
sucked from my lids.

24
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,234
Now I look like Liza on crack!

25
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:05,152
And my lips.

26
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:09,115
I mean, I just wanted my lips to
be more kissable for my co-stars.

27
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:12,369
They've been over-injected
with silicon would be my guess.

28
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,981
- Who did this to you?
- Dr. Kunchai.

29
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,112
He's the chief resident at the

30
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:20,835
top reconstructive surgery
center in Bangkok.

31
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:24,414
Why would you go to Thailand for plastic
surgery when you could've come here?

32
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,133
What? And let the tabloids
get wind of it?

33
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,009
Oh, come on, I have an image to protect.

34
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,595
I'm a goddamn icon.

35
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:33,764
I'm sorry. I have no idea who you are.

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,678
Tell him. Tell him who I am.

37
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,189
- Candy Richards.
- Damn straight.

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,943
- Right.
- She did an arc on <i>Hearts'n Scalpels</i>,

39
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,778
pussy lips.

40
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,592
I have had a recurring role

41
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:54,658
on every nighttime drama since
<i>Judging</i>... goddamn... <i>Amy</i>.

42
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:58,082
I've been murdered on
<i>Law and Order: S.V.U.</i>

43
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,456
and <i>Trial by Jury</i>.

44
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:02,106
And I've been hacked to death on <i>C.S.I.</i>

45
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:05,337
they still talk about how terrifying
my head looked in the freezer.

46
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,134
You know, I suppose I'm going to
have to kiss that <i>Cold Case</i> goodbye.

47
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,415
I mean, how can I play a
Supreme Court justice with

48
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,267
one big oversized tit and pop eyes?

49
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,311
Look, we can try to fix what
was done to you in Thailand.

50
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,980
OK. But you know I have to be
protected from the press.

51
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:24,931
The press cannot know about this.

52
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,859
If you don't tell them, they won't know.

53
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,778
Ms. Richards, I know how busy you are,

54
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,739
how soon would you like this done?

55
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,917
Ladies and gentlemen, Candy Richards,

56
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:03,865
legend in her own mind.

57
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:06,397
She's just chasing what
everyone else is chasing.

58
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:09,718
At least she gets work. You should see
some of the people in my acting class.

59
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,024
- You're taking an acting class?
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:14,850
Don't you do enough acting
in the bars picking up the women,

61
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,808
pretending that you're
charming and likable?

62
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,790
Jesus, you've really fallen for this
Hollywood shit, haven't you?

63
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,541
Hypocrisy doesn't become you, Sean.

64
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,983
Fame is the V.I.P. pass
to whatever you want.

65
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,871
And everybody wants it, including me.

66
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,132
Well, take mine.

67
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,507
People come up to me
and want my autograph

68
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,413
because I play a doctor on TV.

69
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,293
I pretend to do the thing I actually do

70
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:35,831
and suddenly I'm cool.

71
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,259
What happened to becoming famous

72
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,275
for being really good at something?

73
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:42,179
It doesn't matter what you do anymore.

74
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,390
It's how many people hear about it.

75
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:09,932
Close it up.

76
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:11,529
Julia's been shot.

80
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,939
She put the gun to her head.

81
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,721
I begged her not to.
I kept saying how much

82
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,006
mom loved her and Annie.

83
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,462
What did she say?

84
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,386
She said she had become
a burden to everybody.

85
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:13,888
That she was hideous.

86
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,747
That she couldn't look in the mirror.

87
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,907
She didn't even recognized
herself. I mean...

88
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,395
It's OK, baby. You tried to stop her.

89
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,425
Is that when you called 911?

90
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,351
I was about to...

91
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,735
when she pulled the trigger.

92
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,633
Then she fell to the floor.
There was blood everywhere.

93
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,082
The bullet entered at a strange angle.

94
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:36,703
If she was holding a gun
to the side of her head...

95
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,737
I tried to knock her arm away. But...

96
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,221
- I couldn't stop her.
- Doesn't make any sense.

97
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,210
If the gun was in the night table
by the bed,

98
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,212
why didn't she just
shoot herself in there?

99
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:49,340
- To shoot herself in front of you?!
- She's upset, Sean.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,885
Don't push her. She can't know
what was in Julia's mind.

101
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:54,807
The Julia you and I know wouldn't
try to take her own life.

102
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,764
She wouldn't do that to her kids!

103
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,725
Why didn't she leave a note?!

104
00:05:58,886 --> 00:06:01,030
There's something you're not telling us.

105
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,271
You're upset. Dr. Mcnamara,

106
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:06,296
why not leave the investigation
to the police?

107
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,673
Look, I've treated enough
suicide attempts to know that

108
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,487
women don't usually choose a gun
to end it. They're much too vain.

109
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,656
She had no vanity left, Sean!

110
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,498
You're lying! What really happened

111
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,022
- goddamn it!
- Dr. McNamara.

112
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,238
My 18-year-old daughter's been
traumatized. Do you understand?

113
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,683
Could you try to remember that and stop
deflecting your own guilt onto her?

114
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,326
My guilt? For what?

115
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:29,130
Well, clearly you didn't understand
how depressed Julia was.

116
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,342
You never accepted the depth of her
despair during your marriage either.

117
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:34,532
Your lying, cheating.

118
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:37,662
She said the only way for her
to get your attention was to

119
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,557
scream at you or screw you.

120
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,309
So the fact is,

121
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,358
you never knew her well enough
to know she would do this to herself.

122
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,397
They're trying to play this off
as a suicide attempt.

123
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,671
Maybe she was depressed.

124
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,525
Are you kidding?

125
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,756
We've seen patients
with chronic illness.

126
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,242
Takes the life out of you.

127
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,635
That plus the fact that for
the first time in 25 years,

128
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,642
she didn't have either of us to turn to.

129
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:22,204
Jesus, Christian,
I know you're an ego maniac,

130
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:24,564
but even you must know that
she wouldn't kill herself

131
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,032
just because you dumped her.

132
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,190
The only thing you're responsible for
is helping her buy that gun.

133
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:30,521
All right.

134
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,584
Here's what we know.

135
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,426
The bullet penetrated the calvarium
near the temporal lobe.

136
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:41,175
It seems to have grazed
the dura and exited

137
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,037
without any direct brain penetration.

138
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:46,006
- Is there a subdural hemotoma?
- Well, that was our major concern.

139
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,731
We inserted a ventriculostomy
to relieve the pressure.

140
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,620
But there was considerable swelling.

141
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,714
Will there be any long-term damage?

142
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,173
Probably.

143
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:58,636
How long will she be comatose?

144
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,433
You're both doctors,
so I won't bullshit.

145
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:04,684
I don't know.

146
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,964
Could be an hour, month. Could be

147
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,844
considerably longer.

148
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,971
Nice office.

149
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,371
We like to make all our patients
feel comfortable.

150
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,043
You were very good at that
if I remember correctly.

151
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,207
So, Darlene,

152
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,885
tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

153
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,765
You really don't rember me, do you?

154
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,209
Of course, it has been 25 years.

155
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,811
And they've been a lot
kinder to you, I must say.

156
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,770
We've met before.

157
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,269
1982.

158
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:57,078
Ft. Lauderdale. Spring break.

159
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,259
You were just starting college, I think,

160
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,160
and I served you a drink at the Sand Dab
even though I knew you were under age.

161
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,319
Still not coming to me.

162
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,498
Well, that's funny because
it's so clear in my mind.

163
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,898
But a woman never does forget her first.

164
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:17,719
Your first, really?

165
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,297
It might have been a long time ago,
but I think I would remember

166
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,866
sleeping with somebody as...

167
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,224
dynamic as yourself.

168
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,333
I didn't lose the legs until'98.

169
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,645
Diabetes.

170
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,877
Everything else just sort of

171
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:34,599
followed suit after that. But

172
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,712
I was quite

173
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:39,779
a knockout in my heyday.

174
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,201
Here. This'll jar your memory.

175
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,120
- That was you.
- Yeah.

176
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,165
You haven't changed much And that's how

177
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:52,990
I was so sure it was you when I saw you

178
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,335
in Playgirl Magazine.

179
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,884
My subscription is

180
00:09:57,004 --> 00:10:00,424
kinda the only action I've been getting
these days, if you know what I mean.

181
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,999
Does look a lot like me.

182
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:06,611
You still don't believe me?

183
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,882
My first years in college were
memorable in the sense that

184
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,986
I don't really remember that much.

185
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,947
I'd be lying if I said that I did.
Even if we had a thing

186
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,415
once.

187
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:28,120
- But why don't we get back to how...
- A thing?

188
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:32,412
We had more than just a thing,
Christian.

189
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,791
We had a daughter.

190
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,170
Emme lowell came in here
a couple of weeks ago.

191
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,933
Had that birthmark
removed from her face.

192
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,050
Well, she slept with your son.
And now I'm here to tell you

193
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,182
they are in love, and we gotta
do something about that.

194
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,783
Don't give 'em too much, sweetheart.

195
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,487
So what'd you want to talk about?

196
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,234
First of all,

197
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,495
I need you to know
how much I love you.

198
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,372
No matter what,

199
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,224
I'm your dad.

200
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:18,348
I'm here. And...

201
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,957
I am not going anywhere.
You understand?

202
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,175
What's wrong?

203
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,981
Daddy, what's wrong?

204
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,600
Is it mommy?

205
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,657
You're lying! I know he's in there
and I want to see him.

206
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,327
I'll be right back, honey.

207
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,134
Get your fat ass out of my way!

208
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,529
OK, listen,
you have a restraing order, OK?

209
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,231
You gotta get off
the premises right this way.

210
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,367
You need to leave right now, Colleen.
You're breaking the law.

211
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,327
Sean, I just need your help, please.

212
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,830
I apologize, liz. I didn't mean to
talk like that. It's just...

213
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,874
I'm emotional.
I didn't mean to scare you.

214
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:59,096
I've got a family crisis
and real patients

215
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,569
who require my attention.
You need to leave.

216
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,214
I just need you to fix these for me.

217
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,257
Please, you owe me that much.

218
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:08,013
We've got no more business together.
Zero!

219
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:09,758
You should be in a hospital.

220
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:12,390
They kicked me out
because I don't have any insurance.

221
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,892
Look, I don't know what happened.
All right?

222
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:19,052
I'm just some girl from Ohio.
And I didn't know how to protect myself.

223
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,849
It's just like those twisters back home

224
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,692
when families where carried away
in their beds.

225
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,883
I got caught up in the insanity
of the fame game.

226
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,419
And it destroyed me.

227
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,784
Colleen, come on.

228
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,157
No. Please, Sean,

229
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,118
just help me start over.

230
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:33,995
Just some place new.

231
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,788
I could open up a bed and breakfast.

232
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,039
But I can't do anything
with these scars.

233
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,420
Every gash just screams,
"She's some suicidal lunatic."

234
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,884
"She's a self-pitying loser!"

235
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,759
I am walking to the phone,
and I am calling the police right now.

236
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,065
You did this to me.
And you will fix them!

237
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,017
Let's go. Come on.
Come here. Give me a hand.

238
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,321
Come on, you stupid old bitch.

239
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:02,648
You're a murder!
You destroyed my soul.

240
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,082
You'll be sorry for this, I swear!

241
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:10,420
Leave me alone, you understand?
This is it for us!

242
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,506
This is it!

243
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,132
I'm going inside
and i'm calling the police.

244
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,289
Freak.

245
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,054
Mom, I can't believe you
actually got on a plane.

246
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,995
What was I supposed to do?

247
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,550
Leave you here alone
while I knew what was going on?

248
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,543
I can't believe you actually told her.

249
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:38,547
I tell mom everything.

250
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,164
You know, by the way,

251
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:43,675
mrs. Lowell, it is nice to meet you...

252
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:46,469
All right, you need to stop
the ass kissing. You hear me?

253
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,411
You're not going to
score any points here.

254
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,489
You know what, man?
Things are stressful enough

255
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,434
as it is right now
with mom being in the hospital.

256
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,627
- You really need to get so wound up?
- Wound up?

257
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:57,689
If you're mother was here, her head
would be spinning right around.

258
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,817
I can't believe I have to say this, but
you can't sleep with your sister again.

259
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:04,779
You have no idea
what's going on here.

260
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,285
Enlighten me.

261
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,283
Just so that I'm clear.

262
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,989
You did tell me
that you slept together, right?

263
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:13,622
But we didn't know
we could be related at the time.

264
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:16,583
- We just felt this connection.
- Yeah. It's called D.N.A.

265
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,129
If you mean it was the most intense
real chemical like joing of 2 souls

266
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,192
that I've ever felt,
that's exactly what it is.

267
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,217
What? What is the matter with you?

268
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:27,135
You have some kind of mental illness.

269
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:28,762
Every decision you make
is absolute bat shit.

270
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:30,305
Like father like son.

271
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,158
Look,

272
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:37,771
How many women have you bedded
in your lifetime, huh? Couple thousand?

273
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:41,483
Now other than me, no mistakes
have come forward claiming paternity.

274
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,902
So when emme told me
her story, quite frankly

275
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,067
I didn't think it held water.
I'm sorry, Darlene,

276
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,717
but I didn't believe you.

277
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,825
If your father and I handed you proof,
would you believe me?

278
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,668
Look, I know that
you are both in denial,

279
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,324
but that's why we had
the blood work done

280
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,129
and matched against
your medical records.

281
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:04,794
Emme,

282
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,008
he's your father.

283
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:09,135
Really?

284
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:12,681
So then you and I are really...

285
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:14,908
That's OK.

286
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:17,230
Step kids separated a few years

287
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,757
exchanging family fluids
is not the end of the world.

288
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,728
But you have to stop now. All right?

289
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,400
You need to settle things down.

290
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,030
We're all family now?

291
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,304
Let's not get sentimental, all right.

292
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,869
Connect the dots when we need to...
where are you going?!

293
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,292
I gotta see mom.
I can't be here right now.

294
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:39,101
You let him go, sweetheart.

295
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,927
He's my brother.
I can still be there for support, right?

296
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,536
Do you drink?

297
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:52,988
Where do you keep the good stuff?

298
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:56,099
What are we looking at, nurse?!

299
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,309
33-year-old male photographer
was outside the ivy.

300
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,634
Made the mistake of
trying to photograph Russell Crowe,

301
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,772
wound up with a camera
imbedded in his rectum.

302
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,233
Who are those people?

303
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,537
Those are his friends, doctor.
The other parazzi.

304
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:08,862
He's going to need surgery.

305
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,157
We'll make a small Pfannensteil
incision, do a laparotomy,

306
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:13,651
and we'll have him back

307
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,977
on the boulevard compromising
celebrity privacy in no time.

308
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,078
And people,

309
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,705
let's try and save that camera.

310
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,415
It's a damn good Leica.

311
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:22,250
15 blade.

312
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,094
Cut!

313
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,995
How'd you get back
on the lot, Colleen?

314
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:37,265
Your old pass?

315
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:40,036
You know me, Sean.
I never take no for an answer.

316
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:43,164
Somebody get security.
Get this crazy bitch out of here.

317
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,857
There's a restraing order out on her!

318
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:53,865
You will recognize me

319
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,338
as the true greatness in your life

320
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,587
if it takes me to my last breath.

321
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:01,858
Sean, please don't let
them take me. Please,

322
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:04,259
No!

323
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:10,523
You need to press charges, Sean.
She needs to be locked up.

324
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:21,731
... and then Emme says, "it's not mine,
officer. It's my raccoon."

325
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:31,820
She must have been a funny kid.

326
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,201
Do you realize that
the only one of my 3 children

327
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,954
that I actually take care of

328
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,747
is the only one that isn't mine?

329
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:47,093
After getting to know you,
I think that's for the best.

330
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,497
How's Matt's mom doing?

331
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,384
- She's fine.
- No, don't you pee

332
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:56,010
on my back and tell me it's rain.

333
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,264
Are you all right?

334
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,031
It's kinda weird.

335
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,840
I feel responsible.

336
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,615
With her and Emme,
it's been kind of a surreal week.

337
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,865
Well, to Hollywood...
land of the surreal.

338
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,708
You know what, Darlene?

339
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,462
I can't remember doing you,
but I can see why I did.

340
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,104
What's the matter?

341
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,644
It's nothing.

342
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,645
It's just... I'm such an idiot.

343
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,029
I haven't gotten
many compliments since...

344
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,240
I figure

345
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:01,700
I am an 8.

346
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,571
But since half of me is gone,
I'm only a 4.

347
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,601
You're beautiful Darlene.

348
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,377
**** mean a little wet **** edges.

349
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:13,524
But you're still very beautiful.

350
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,024
Seriously.

351
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,983
I haven't been kissed
like that in a long time.

352
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:15,246
I haven't had that much
to drink in a long time.

353
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,236
Do you have to go to work?

354
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,644
Surgery in an hour.

355
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,662
You gonna be OK getting out
of here on your own.

356
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,623
I mean, do I have to order you
some kind of special cab or something

357
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:33,231
- because of your legs?
- I can handle myself.

358
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:34,836
That's not what I meant.

359
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,510
I know.

360
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,218
I do every night.

361
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:45,138
Excuse me.

362
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,040
You said you never drank like that.

363
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,001
I do every night.

364
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,560
12 pack of beer helps me sleep.

365
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,027
I'm sorry, Darlene.
I shouldn't have done this.

366
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,448
No, I'm glad you did.

367
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:06,034
The truth is I haven't been
laid in a long time.

368
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,703
And last time wasn't half
as good as that ride.

369
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:14,034
God, I'm so old.

370
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:18,221
You know, I spent the last 25 years

371
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,946
fantasying about you,
wondering how'd you turn out.

372
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,647
How's reality compared to fantasy?

373
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,554
I have a really good imagination.

374
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,977
Will you do something for me?

375
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,348
Sure.

376
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:37,184
Will you make me look
like you made me feel last night?

377
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,569
You want me to operate on you?

378
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:47,924
I spent my youth on Emme.

379
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:51,269
And that was a good deal.
I would do that again today.

380
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:55,015
But I think some how
I just thought it would all come back.

381
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:58,419
And then I lost my legs
because of the diabetes.

382
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,422
It all slipped away.

383
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:05,396
I know I'm not going
to get that time back.

384
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:08,593
And I also know that
I'm surely not getting my legs back.

385
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:12,049
But maybe you can give me
my face back.

386
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:19,816
You want to take a shower first?

387
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:32,704
Oh, doctor, I love you!

388
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,624
You're the bomb.

389
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,294
And I am the bomb.

390
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:44,680
Actually, I'm a ghost.
My agent just called.

391
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:45,974
And I just got an offer

392
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:48,482
to play a russian ballerina
on The Ghost Whisperer.

393
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:50,972
She has a very bad brain aneurysm.

394
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:53,640
She dies during
a very tragic "pas de deux".

395
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:57,383
That's why I have to perfect
my "ronde de jambes".

396
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:01,748
When can I start ballet class?
We shoot in a week.

397
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,849
Candy, you need to get back into bed
or your swelling won't go down.

398
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:12,115
You won't even be able to shoot
from a wheelchair.

399
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:14,828
You know this is going to be
such a great role for my return.

400
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:17,706
Excuse me.

401
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:20,206
Hey, excuse me!

402
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:23,714
This is a private room
and there will be no autographs.

403
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:27,214
I'm sorry.
My name is Gary Gold. And I'm...

404
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:29,509
I'm Bob Levitz's partner.

405
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:36,798
So, you worked with Bob at C.A.A.?

406
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,853
Uh, no. No. I meant life partners.

407
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:45,706
Uh, please forgive me
for this intrusion. But, uh,

408
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,402
I'm going insane.

409
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:50,572
You're one of the last people
to see him. And

410
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:53,154
I'm sorry but I really
can't wrap my mind

411
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,362
around this whole I'm leaving
you and going to Darfur thing.

412
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:58,413
His sudden departure was a surprise.

413
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:02,209
There were no signs
that he was dissatisfied with his life.

414
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,836
A surprise? How about your could have
knocked me over with a feather?

415
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,255
Look, I love Bob. He's a ton of fun.

416
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:11,416
He's great in bed. But a humanitarian?
We don't even recycle.

417
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:15,305
Look, I'm at my wits end.

418
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:17,641
The police refuse to consider him
a missing person,

419
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,281
- and they're sick and tired of me...
- Wait, wait...

420
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:21,019
go back a second. The police?

421
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,273
Are you saying you suspect foul play?

422
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:27,020
Yeah.

423
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:32,318
I don't mean to be insensitive, but

424
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,471
have you considered...

425
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:37,769
Oh, no. No. No.

426
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,315
He didn't run off with some twink or

427
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:43,537
disappear to a caribbean island
with a new identity.

428
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,293
No. Didn't happen.

429
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:50,677
I know someone
forced him to write that email

430
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:53,510
or someone else wrote it
on his blackberry pretending to be him.

431
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:58,379
I just don't know who
that person would be.

432
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,596
Yes, this is Dr. McNamara.

433
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,911
I'm calling about Julia McNamara.

434
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:14,338
Yes... How's her I.C.P. looking?

435
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:18,529
And how much C. S. F
have you tapped off...

436
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,537
that's good...

437
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,236
all right.

438
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:25,754
And the ventric is working properly?

439
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:34,421
No. I'm not in favor
of putting her into a hypothermic coma.

440
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:35,870
No.

441
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:40,356
I... I think it's too risky.
And it's too soon...

442
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,447
I'd rather stick
with the current protocol...

443
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,968
You're paying for a new armoire.

444
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,291
She stuffed him?

445
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:14,004
Jesus, what a horrible way to go.

446
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,988
Anything?

447
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,023
Her passport was scanned
at the Tijuana border crossing.

448
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:21,119
The feds are on it, though.
They gotta lot of good connections

449
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,654
with the policia down there.
We'll get her back.

450
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,199
How deluded could I have been?

451
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:31,527
I'm not stupid.
I know how to read people.

452
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,732
I can spot a nut in a consult
before they sit down.

453
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:37,125
I guess you were just blinded
by the light of your big shining star.

454
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:39,830
Let's face it, that's show's been
nothing but problems since day one.

455
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,418
It's not the show. The show's been
good for business and for me.

456
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:44,499
You see? You're so drunk
on your own 15 minutes,

457
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,093
you can't see this is
wrecking your life!

458
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:09,787
I apologize for attacking you
back at the house.

459
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:15,447
I got caught up in that bullshit just
as much you did. Maybe even more.

460
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,100
If I hadn't, none of this
would have happened.

461
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,180
If I hadn't done that
stupid play girls pread,

462
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,481
she wouldn't have seen it,
then her daughter... my daughter...

463
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,204
she wouldn't have come looking for me.
I wouldn't have introduced her to Matt.

464
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,653
I mean, I practically forced them
to sleep with each other.

465
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,073
I'm gonna give her some insulin.
Her pulse is eradicate.

466
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,834
I don't know what they hell
we're gonna do about Matt.

467
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,028
- He's not still...
- Mm-mmm.

468
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,605
It was one dumb thing, all right.

469
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:50,090
Once he found out
he was his... whatever...

470
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,869
he's done with it... her.

471
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,599
I can't believe a word
that comes out of his mouth.

472
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,667
It's the one good thing about
Julia being in a coma,

473
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,646
she doesn't have to know what he's done.

474
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:06,941
Look.

475
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,028
I know you guys got stuff going on
that you don't want to share with me,

476
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,200
and I respect that. I always have.

477
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:15,699
But there's something I want
to say to the both of you.

478
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,744
If we say no, will you say it anyway?

479
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:22,498
Here's the thing.
Every idiot out here wants to be famous.

480
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:26,126
But you... you guys got
something better. You got respect...

481
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,799
as doctors, as skilled physicians.

482
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,511
And you didn't get this recognition
by going out and looking for it.

483
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,736
You got it because you got talent.
You got integrity.

484
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:36,944
OK. Maybe not integrity.

485
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:39,265
But because you took
on some pretty amazing cases

486
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,434
that no one else would touch
with a 10 foot 15 blade.

487
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,874
So do what you do best.

488
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:47,089
Do what you do better than anyone else

489
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,482
and screw the rest.

490
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,947
The hospital just called.
Julia's awake.

491
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,512
Thank you. I'm on my way.

492
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,997
- Who was that?
- Julia's awake. Thank God.

493
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:06,087
I'm going over if you want to come.

494
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:08,886
I need to go sweetheart.
If you're coming...

495
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:09,966
Wait.

496
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,966
There's something I have to tell you.

497
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:19,680
You have to help me, mommy.
I need your help.

498
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:25,105
- We'll take one car. It'll be faster.
- If I drive it will.

499
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:28,355
Hey, please, don't go out there.
They're swarming. The locusts.

500
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:29,982
- The what?
- The paparazzi.

501
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,849
They're right outside the door.
And they know I'm in here.

502
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,794
And they are dying to get a photo
of me post-surgery.

503
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,915
Just go back to recovery
or take the side door.

504
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:41,702
No. No, what I meant was I don't want
you blocking my big exit.

505
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:45,539
They're all setting up for me right now.
And I told them to come here at 2:00.

506
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:46,891
You called them?

507
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,501
I thought you didn't want anybody
to know you were getting work done?

508
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:52,630
You know, doctor,
if a tree falls in the woods

509
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,601
and 2 dozen nerds with cameras
aren't there to put it online,

510
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,177
does it really make a sound?

511
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,226
I don't think so.

512
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:02,293
And you want to know why?

513
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:05,945
Because that tree doesn't know
what it takes to be famous.

514
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,436
And I do.

515
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:10,064
So if you don't mind,
I'd like you do stay right here.

516
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,590
I don't want you to ruin my entrance.

517
00:30:27,903 --> 00:30:29,041
It's me.

518
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:35,157
Dr. McNamara, what can you tell us
about Colleen Rose?

519
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,091
Is it true she had Aiden fired
to further your career?

520
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:38,842
Did you tell her to kill your agent?

521
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,412
What about your wife? Were you involved
in her shooting as well?

522
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,767
Buck off...

523
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,512
Why are they doing this?

524
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:55,383
You're a public person now, buddy boy.
They own you.

525
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:57,613
Nothing is off limits.

526
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,744
- Hey do we know anything?
- Only that's she's awake.

527
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:16,880
Hey, Jules, how ya doin'?

528
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:19,550
You look good.

529
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,804
How's it going, mom?

530
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,413
I'm so glad you're OK.

531
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:31,061
I was so scared.

532
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,149
You're a lovely girl.

533
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:38,026
Does she belong to one of you?

534
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,323
The doctors call it retrograde amnesia.

535
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,828
All her memories... everything before
the gun shot have disappeared.

536
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,042
For how long?

537
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,044
No one knows.

538
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:15,608
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, of course not.

539
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:19,921
I'll take her for a bite to eat
and meet you back at the house.

540
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,709
Just feel like I wanna stay
a little bit, keep her company.

541
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:24,798
I get it.

542
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:27,745
Hey, you. You feel like going
to Johnny Rockets? Huh?

543
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:30,611
Come here.

544
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:33,517
I'll catch up with you guys later, OK?

545
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,962
Come on. Let's go get
some burgers and fries.

546
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,451
Why don't I take a look
at all that stitching they did?

547
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,373
See how it's coming along.

548
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:17,546
They did a good job.

549
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:20,255
I couldn't have done it better myself.

550
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,186
It's good to keep it lubricated.

551
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,065
Are you a doctor?

552
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,467
Plastic surgeon.

553
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:48,964
Is that how we know each other?

554
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:51,662
Because I had plastic surgery?

555
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:55,418
No.

556
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,506
I'm you're husband.

557
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,094
We met in college.

558
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,672
College sweethearts.

559
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:15,952
That's when we got married.

560
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,068
We're still married?

561
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,586
We're still married.

562
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:36,762
And we have 3 beautiful children.

563
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,724
And we're as happy now as we were then.

564
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,297
And everything is just...

565
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:49,928
Perfect.

566
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,178
Music?

567
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,613
You know, the fact that you're
mom's talking is a great sign.

568
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:10,761
Even if she doesn't
recognize you right now.

569
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,202
You know it's not personal right?

570
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:17,956
Doesn't matter. She doesn't really
know who I am anyway.

571
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,651
Look, I know how hard this is for you...

572
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:31,720
- What the hell?
- Behind you!

573
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,684
Wait here, all right.

574
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,858
Look, just leave us...
what the hell are you doing?

575
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:42,234
All right, look, I'm not Sean.
And you're scaring his daughter.

576
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,449
That's whose picture we want.
Get out of the way!

577
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,652
What are you doing?! Jesus Christ!

578
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,225
Get out of my way.

579
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,497
- Why won't they leave us alone?!
- I don't know honey.

580
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,199
Just put your head down. OK.
We're gonna be fine, all right?

581
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:55,756
Get the hell out of my way, you asshole!
Get out of the way!

582
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:25,315
Thanks for lunch, Matt.

583
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,760
I'm glad I got to see
those handprints in the

584
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,285
cement at the Chinese Theater
before I left town.

585
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:32,823
Yeah, me too.

586
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,745
What time's your flight?

587
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:43,876
11. The Redeye is pretty much
all I could afford.

588
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:50,090
I still have a few hours.

589
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:55,762
- We could...
- We can't.

590
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:11,561
Look, Em, we just need a clean break.

591
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,460
You know, maybe

592
00:37:13,729 --> 00:37:17,257
in a few months I'll come to Georgia and
we can figure this whole thing out

593
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:21,400
on how to be brother and sister.
But now our feelings are just too strong

594
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:30,464
It's not like we'd be the only
inbreds in the mountains where I'm from.

595
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:35,771
You could get a job in a coal mine.
I could pull out all my teeth.

596
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,882
Yeah. I just don't think I'm ready for
the Appalachian lifestyle just yet.

597
00:37:56,455 --> 00:38:00,410
I've been trying to get away
from those freaks my whole life.

598
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:14,552
You are going to go home
a beautiful, confident woman.

599
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:17,359
And guys are going to be falling
all over themselves for you.

600
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:20,514
And your life is going to open up
in a whole new way.

601
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,434
It already has.

602
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,607
Yeah, mine too.

603
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:38,277
I gotta go.

604
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,349
Matt!

605
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:08,119
- You all right?
- What are you doing here?

606
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,480
I don't think you're going to be
much help with a broken collar bone.

607
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:15,307
I thought I could at least
lend some support in there.

608
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,283
You mad at me?

609
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:28,018
I'm mad at myself.

610
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:30,807
I feel like a fool.

611
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:33,253
I lost myself.

612
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:36,883
Lost my priorities, my values.

613
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:41,031
I chased a dream like a silly teenager.
Now look what's happened.

614
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,972
Can't blame you for anything.

615
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,910
We both got caught up.

616
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,772
It's what happens out here I guess.

617
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,656
Yeah, but...

618
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:59,452
don't you think the measure
of a man is his

619
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:03,116
ability to maintain his core values
no matter what's going on around him?

620
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,954
Easier said than done.

621
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,804
I called Freddie.

622
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:13,627
I told him I want out of my
"Hearts'n Scalpels" contract.

623
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:15,962
Really?

624
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,996
Really.

625
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:29,034
Would you mind if I handle this solo?

626
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:31,728
I just feel like I want to be
alone with my daughter in there.

627
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,188
Of course.

628
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:37,340
I should check on Darlene anyway.
She's had a tough recovery.

629
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,568
A lot of pain.

630
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,656
Everyone's going to be OK.

631
00:40:58,795 --> 00:40:59,965
Hey, baby.

632
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:02,625
What?

633
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,678
I'm afraid I'm gonna have an ugly scar.

634
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,473
I was just telling Annie that you are
a very famous plastic surgeon.

635
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:12,381
And that people come from all over
the country for your expertise.

636
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:15,772
That's about all I want
to be famous for ever again.

637
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:20,694
I promise you'll be
good as new, sweetie.

638
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:24,389
Now auntie Liz is going to give you
something so you don't feel any pain.

639
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:28,493
You'll go right to sleep,
and your dad will sew you up.

640
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,372
I want you to count back
from 100 for me, OK?

641
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:35,618
100... 99...

642
00:41:56,605 --> 00:42:00,581
Liz can you get me
gauze and tape, please?

643
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,486
It's going to be good
from now on, I promise.

644
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:18,719
I've been thinking, Liz.
Maybe it's time to put down some roots.

645
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:21,456
Find a place of my own.

646
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,633
My kids need a real home out here.
And so do I.

647
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,980
What do you think
of the Hollywood hills?

648
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:02,213
