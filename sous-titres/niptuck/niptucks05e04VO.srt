00:00:00,622 --> 00:00:01,916
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,146 --> 00:00:03,586
I had gastric bypass,

3
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:06,253
and after I lost a hundred pounds,
this is the result.

4
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:08,333
Did she lose 100 pounds
in a week or something?

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:11,159
I happen to like her, and I don't
give a shit if she was once fat.

6
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:14,067
How do you know that girl?
Eden? She's Olivia's daughter.

7
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,910
If Julia's my new mommy,

8
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,155
that practically makes you my daddy.
Don't you wanna be my daddy?

9
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:21,788
What I want is for you
to stay away from my daughter.

10
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:25,202
Annie wants to go to Preston,
the school where Eden goes.

11
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:28,109
Campbell, isn't it?
I think that's what Helen said.

12
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,827
Although she said you'd be sitting
at the other end of the bar.

13
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:33,199
I'm afraid I've never paid
for someone before.

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,494
It's been a long dry season.

15
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:40,216
Well, I hope you brought an umbrella,
because I'm predicting thunderstorms.

16
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,955
What happened to you, Dawn?
Did you have a face-off with your ex on

17
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,410
Jerry Springer?

18
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,487
I was attacked by a
giant wedge-tailed eagle in Calgary.

19
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,111
She thought I was poaching
her man-eagle.

20
00:00:56,888 --> 00:01:00,505
OK. So you've been doing
peyote for how long?

21
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,805
I was hang gliding.

22
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,661
We're a long way from Calgary, Dawn.

23
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:05,654
Money shortens the distance, Doc.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,175
They medevaced me to a private jet.

25
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,251
There was a doctor onboard waiting

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,448
with an I.V. full of antibiotics
and painkillers,

27
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,078
and here I am several hours later

28
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:19,010
with the only 2 surgeons
in the world I would trust

29
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,929
with my gorgeous mug.

30
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:25,084
You are charming, by the way,

31
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:26,717
on Hearts 'n Scalpels.

32
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:28,265
Who knew?

33
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:30,242
That Aidan Stone,

34
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:33,992
Oh, you have to introduce me to him
when I'm more presentable.

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,839
OK, so you're up in the sky
just sailing along, singing a song.

36
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:42,309
I was at 8,200 feet, actually.

37
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:45,597
I had just caught this
delightful updraft, you know.

38
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:50,134
I was thinkin', "hey, life does not
get any better than this."

39
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:58,084
Suddenly I heard this horrible
screeching sound.

40
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,917
What the hell?! Jesus christ!

41
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,312
After she bit my face off,

42
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,718
she went after my canopy lines.

43
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:36,621
I was in free fall for 1,600 feet
before she freed herself.

44
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:40,063
- You must have been terrified.
- Terrifi-- try scared shitless.

45
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,653
And I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

46
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,241
I never felt so alive in my life

47
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,096
It was like time stood still.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,303
Everything was more real
and less real at the same time.

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,768
Colors were brighter.

50
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,884
And for that moment, I forgot

51
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,162
just how lonely and depressing
life truly is.

52
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,235
So I've upped the ante, boys.

53
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:25,991
You are looking at the second
female civilian lady ever

54
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,351
to go off in space.

55
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:29,470
Takeoff's in 2 1/2 weeks from Russia,

56
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,712
so you gotta get me
sewn up and lookin' good

57
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,761
before all the photographers,
the TV appearances, all that.

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,060
the main concern is your lower lip.

59
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,992
I Imagine we'd do an abbe flap.

60
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:42,603
- What the hell's an abbe flap?
- We cut a flap from your upper lip

61
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,837
and sew it onto your lower lip defect.

62
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:48,381
In other words, Dawn, we're gonna
have to sew your mouth shut

63
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:49,987
for 2 weeks.

64
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,166
Listen, whatever it takes, boys.
Whatever you need to do.

65
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,391
Really.

66
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,810
You are the reason, both of you,
that I traveled all this way.

67
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:01,559
Well, you and possibly the chance
to maybe meet Aidan Stone.

68
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:06,356
And, hey, what's the deal with that
female surgeon on that show?

69
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:08,923
She's goin' up, like, a size a week.

70
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,692
Somebody's gotta tell her
lay off the mallomars.

71
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:13,907
God, they're gonna start oinkin' at her.

72
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,941
It ain't easy to get a swimsuit.
Tell her that.

<i>Dawn Budge II</i>

77
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:25,372
I love you, Sean.

78
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,734
It's OK. You don't have
to say it just because I did.

79
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,168
Well,

80
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:38,949
we're definitely kinda
headin' in that direction.

81
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,053
Is this a peanut M&M?

82
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,965
Why are you eating peanut M&M's in bed?

83
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:53,352
- 'Cause I don't like the plain ones.
- Well, I'm serious, Kate.

84
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,256
I was starving.

85
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,344
We got home from work
at 3:00 in the morning.

86
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,930
I didn't have dinner. I ate
a stupid bag of M&M's. So what?

87
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,952
5 bags of M&M's?

88
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,982
I mean, that's-- for someone
who's had a gastric bypass

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,863
and all the surgery we just did,
and now you're gaining weight?

90
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:15,238
I'm your boyfriend. I care about you.
I worry about your health.

91
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,128
And who wants
a girlfriend with a fat ass,

92
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,398
especially a thin, handsome
plastic surgeon, right?

93
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,080
Maybe.

94
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,260
I'm not proud of it,
but there's some truth there.

95
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,286
Do you know how many hours in the day
I am basically sleepwalking,

96
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:36,094
alienated from everyone? people around
me are talking, but I can't hear them,

97
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,799
because my mind's back on the
krispy kremes I passed on the set.

98
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:43,431
I know how screwed up I am.
I'm not an idiot.

99
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,464
You've got a problem, Kate.

100
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:51,640
Oh, no shit, Sherlock.

101
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,119
Nobody's perfect.

102
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:59,594
Just takes commitment
and faith in yourself.

103
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,888
Faith.

104
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,357
Maybe I can help.

105
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,215
Where's your secret stash?

106
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:20,865
Marshmallow fluff?

107
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,240
it's easily digestible.

108
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,526
- Jesus, sweetie. This could kill you.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:32,649
All right. We'll get rid of that,
and we move on. Phase 2.

110
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,671
First we take a shower.

111
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,916
Then we get in the car,
and we drive to whole foods,

112
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:41,249
and we buy you some easily
digestible health food, OK?

113
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:46,749
You must love me.

114
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,384
- Count back from 10 for me.
- Hold it, sister.

115
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,326
I am not going under until the doctor
promises me a visit to the set.

116
00:07:57,525 --> 00:08:01,073
Dawn, we've been over this. I make
a point of not mixing the 2 worlds.

117
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,195
Are you ashamed of me, Dr. Mcnamara?

118
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,212
Frankly, yes.

119
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,870
Okey-dokey. We ready to rock 'n' roll?

120
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,571
We've been ready for 20 minutes.

121
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:23,774
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

122
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:26,561
Wilber and I were out on the balcon
this morning just mesmerized

123
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:29,989
by these 3 whales that were spouting
right in front of the house. It was a...

124
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,692
Is this the life or what, huh?

125
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,628
Who is this new and improved Christian?

126
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,980
Are you datin' the little mermaid?

127
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,773
I like it. I like it.

128
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:41,741
So how's our little eagle temptress
doing this morning?

129
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,320
- Pissed off.
- Pissed?

130
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,772
Your partner over here
just gave me a line of bull

131
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:48,397
about how I can't go
to the set of Heart 'n Scalpels.

132
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,581
Oh, well, he's just grumpy
because the only whale

133
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,364
he saw this morning
was between the sheets.

134
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,607
15 blade.

135
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:27,871
And for several days,
as Dawn Budge heals,

136
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,936
the world is a peaceful place.

137
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,135
Sorry to interrupt, Sean.

138
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:40,109
Your daughter's here.

139
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:44,395
Honey, the simple answer is no,
I can't do liposuction on you.

140
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,798
First of all, you don't need it.

141
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,729
- Secondly--
- If you love me, you'll do it.

142
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,005
Oh, it's got nothing
to do with love, sweetheart.

143
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,462
There's not an ounce
of extra fat on you,

144
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,958
and even if there was,
you're still growing.

145
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:58,834
- I'll go to someone else, then.
- OK. All right. Come back. Sit down.

146
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,985
Tell me, miss Mcnamara,

147
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,131
what you don't like about yourself.

148
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,032
This.

149
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,281
Annie,

150
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,993
where did this idea come from?

151
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,164
You're a beautiful girl.

152
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:25,278
Have you talked about this
with your mother? Is she here?

153
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,175
Eden dropped me off
while she's getting waxed.

154
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,890
Is Eden the one putting
this negativity in your head?

155
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,608
She told me you'd blame her.

156
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:35,853
She's my sister,

157
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,368
and she's the only one in this family
who really cares about me.

158
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,843
Give me the surgery.

159
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,296
oh, sweetie.

160
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:17,082
You must be Campbell.

161
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,505
I'm Marcia's friend, Gwen.

162
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,232
Hi, Gwen.

163
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,086
You're a very attractive lady.

164
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,499
Marcia tells me that you're

165
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,729
open to unusual scenarios.

166
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:40,928
Tell me what you had in mind.

167
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,484
It's a fantasy that I've had
for a long time,

168
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,085
but I need a partner,

169
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,563
someone who's cool,

170
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,868
calm, and trustworthy.

171
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,213
You have to be like a surgeon almost.

172
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,515
I think I could do that.

173
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:03,393
I've researched it down to
the very second,

174
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,857
and it'll take about
an hour and a half.

175
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,472
I've already booked a room upstairs.

176
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:12,968
We'll start

177
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,410
by calling room service.

178
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,248
While you're emptying
the buckets of ice

179
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:25,872
into the bathtub,

180
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,079
I'll be injecting myself with ketamine
in order to dull the senses

181
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,561
of my physical body.

182
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,272
It will take 20 minutes.

183
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:44,004
After that, you'll have to help me
into the bathtub.

184
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:52,010
The next part's going to
be difficult for you,

185
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:56,394
I'd imagine more difficult
for you than it is for me.

186
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,786
We'll have to wait for
my body temperature to drop.

187
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,053
I'll start to shiver when
my body tries to keep warm.

188
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,799
That means that I'll be
in moderate hypothermia.

189
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:20,367
Once my body temperature drops,

190
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:22,048
i'll stop shivering,

191
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,043
and you'll have a very limited
amount of time before

192
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,756
I lose consciousness.

193
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,723
At this point, do not give

194
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,896
in to your desire to wrap me up.

195
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,058
That's very important.

196
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:40,542
My trust is completely
in you at that point.

197
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,489
The warmth of your body,

198
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:50,280
the intensity of your thrusting

199
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,911
Will bring me back to life.

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,310
I'll need double my fee.

201
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:20,269
That's not a problem.

202
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,647
You're one kinky bitch, aren't you?

203
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,321
My mother committed suicide
when my little sister died.

204
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,203
My shrink seems to think
that my fantasy

205
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,636
is to become my sister

206
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,079
so I can bring her back to life

207
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,259
in order to save my mother.

208
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,006
And what do you think?

209
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,453
I think

210
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,613
for $8,000,

211
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,354
you'll bring me back to life.

212
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,504
To life.

213
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,797
Eden needs therapy, serious therapy

214
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,577
and not the touchy-feely kind of
new age bullshit Olivia favors.

215
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,219
I don't doubt that
all our kids have issues, Sean,

216
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:25,713
but let's not get carried away
with the finger-pointing.

217
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,251
Your daughter is suffering
from body dysmorphic disorder

218
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,368
brought on by a sociopath
she considers her only real ally.

219
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,852
I don't call that issues, Julia.

220
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:34,925
I call it a serious goddamn crisis.

221
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:36,773
I can't just sit quietly
in the other room

222
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,431
and listen to a character assassination
of my daughter.

223
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,600
Honey, let's not escalate things.

224
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,013
- Sean is just worried about Annie--
- But how is it that

225
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:46,487
My daughter is being blamed
for Annie's low self-esteem.

226
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,611
Eden's self-esteem is her most
extraordinary quality.

227
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,452
Why would she teach Annie
to hate herself?

228
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,664
These girls are my thinspiration.

229
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,192
Ok, get on the scale.

230
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,922
According to friends of <i>Ana and Mia.com</i>,
you are

231
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,473
6 pounds overweight.

232
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,256
And I can see it right
there on your ass.

233
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:15,472
Your dad needs glasses.

234
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,611
Who are Ana and Mia?

235
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,565
Anorexia and Bulimia.
Did you learn anything in Miami?

236
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,483
What am I gonna do?
Chris'll never like me.

237
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,484
He always bags
on Evan 'cause she's fat.

238
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,339
Well, I couldn't live
with myself if I let you do coke,

239
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,804
My own personal savior.

240
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:39,120
I guess we're looking at Mia
if your selfish father won't help.

241
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,087
Look, the point is

242
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,667
is that annie needs help.

243
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,118
Now, we're all agreed on that.

244
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:48,170
Ok, well, to me, it's like there's
a giant elephant in the room.

245
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,066
It's obvious that Annie's problems
were inevitable.

246
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:51,968
What does that mean?

247
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,762
The whole plastic surgery ethos
is undermining to women.

248
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:58,135
You undermine her just by going
to work every day, Sean.

249
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:00,959
You've aligned yourself with
the cultural misogyny

250
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,461
that is poisoning your daughter.

251
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,071
Are you trying to create
a rift between me and my daughter?

252
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,316
Sean, you can't pretend
this is a new idea.

253
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,702
You know, you and I have talked
about this many, many times.

254
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,746
You never really had a problem
with it before,

255
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:15,705
with my poisonous,
underming misogyny.

256
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,574
After all, it financed all
your spiritual-slash-identity crises

257
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,221
You couldn't get enough of.

258
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,662
This is not between you and me, Sean.

259
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,634
Keep your voices down. The girls are
studying in the other room.

260
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,118
Use your stomach muscles to help.

261
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,137
You don't stop when you gag.

262
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,649
You have to keep
your fingers there, Annie.

263
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,207
Jesus, you're hopeless.

264
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,001
Can't do it. It feels horrible.

265
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:40,803
What am I gonna do?

266
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,126
I have to make him like me.

267
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,971
You're a real challenge,
you know that?

268
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,857
We have to move to plan "C".

269
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,439
Wipe your mouth.

270
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,035
Good afternoon, ms. Budge.

271
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:03,448
I'm Dr. George.

272
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:07,126
<i>Who do I need to screw to get
a goddamn smoothie???</i>

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,760
I'm not here for sex and treats.

274
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm here to collect a sample.

275
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,264
<i>Blood?</i>

276
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,137
It's a stool sample.

277
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,149
Since you had a run-in with
a wild bird, the docs are

278
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:37,167
concerned about avian flu.

279
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,772
<i>Bird flu?</i>

280
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:47,115
Listen, this'll just take
a few seconds.

281
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:55,846
Roll over for me.

282
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,028
Knees up for me.

283
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,910
That's it.

284
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,793
And breathe.

285
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,651
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Sister.

286
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:17,431
My oversized breasts.

287
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,868
I'm here for a reduction mammaplasty.

288
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,237
You experiencing back problems?

289
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:26,116
Be a whole lot easier if
I could just say yes, but

290
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,995
lying's not an option anymore.

291
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,948
I mean, since taking my vows,
I've become aware that

292
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,082
my breasts are a source
of confusion for people,

293
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,216
just like they were for you just now.

294
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,743
I wanna remove that confusion

295
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,373
so that I can be seen as
a vessel for god's light

296
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,834
I wanna inspire people with my faith,
not my bust line.

297
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,235
Reduction mammaplasty is
definitely a modern way

298
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,025
of deepening your spiritual life.

299
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,719
Well, I'm a modern girl,
so I'm a modern nun.

300
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:56,984
Then why the antiquated look?

301
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,844
I thought modern nuns
didn't have to dress like

302
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,600
Sally Field in <i>The Flying Nun</i> anymore.

303
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,598
Well, it's actually a trend now.

304
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:09,179
I mean, many of the younger women
going into the church

305
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,658
feel the need for something more...
radical

306
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:16,632
I mean, if I'm gonna give up
sex, freedom, and money,

307
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,093
I'm not gonna pretend it's no big deal.

308
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,765
And I wanna wear my wedding dress

309
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,793
every single day.

310
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:28,999
Feel like I need to ask for higher
permission to examine your breasts.

311
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:41,323
I think we can get you down to

312
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,600
a small "C" or a large "B."

313
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,181
We make a small incision
in the nipple,

314
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:53,052
cut straight down through the middle
of the breast, along the bottom.

315
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:58,614
And I'm curious. Why woul
a beautiful women like yourself

316
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:01,256
give up all the pleasures in life?

317
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:04,213
I mean, that is what you're doing,
no matter how you spin it.

318
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,516
Well, it's hard to describe
to someone who hasn't felt it.

319
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,351
Felt what?

320
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,251
Well, when you're called.

321
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,592
It's like a real falling in love.

322
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,303
Loneliness disappears,

323
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:28,260
And you have an overwhelming
desire to be with God,

324
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,024
and that makes everything else pale.

325
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:37,465
Have you given everything else a chance?

326
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:42,430
Has anybody ever held these and
told you how exquisite they are?

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,815
Is that what it takes to make
you feel alive, doctor,

328
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:54,150
Bagging a nun?

329
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,092
You think God saw what I just saw
in your eyes right now?

330
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,760
If it's God you want, then go for it.

331
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,556
We're all just trying to get
through the night, sister.

332
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:14,712
I was a heroin addict.

333
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,880
I lived on the street for 2 years.

334
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:23,417
I'm sure your imagination can tell you
what got me through the night

335
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,384
until god found me, saved me.

336
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,268
When you...

337
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:33,256
have a minute, there's some kind
of misunderstanding with ms. Budge.

338
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,636
Dawn, nobody ordered a stool sample.

339
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:43,806
It doesn't make sense. You can't get
the bird flu from an eagle in Calgary.

340
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,139
I already told her that stool samples
are not used in a diagnosis

341
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,084
and certainly not retrieved
with a rubber glove.

342
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:50,836
This whole episode was most likely

343
00:22:50,956 --> 00:22:52,946
a hallucination triggered
by the anesthesia.

344
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:55,325
- Exactly.
- Excuse me.

345
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,839
Guys, may I see you
in the break room, please?

346
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,398
Give us a sec.

347
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,641
- An actual ass bandit?
- How did you find out about this?

348
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:10,366
I just had a conversation
with a sergeant Montgomery

349
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,972
over at the Beverly Hills P.D.

350
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:18,238
He told me that there have been
3 identical ass bandit episodes

351
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,190
at the Rodeo Drive Cosmetic Institute.

352
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,147
An unknown intruder enters
during off hours,

353
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:26,961
politely says
he's there for a stool sample,

354
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:33,169
at which point, he digitally diddles
the patient, and then he leaves.

355
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,038
Why would someone do that?

356
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,331
For the thrill of getting
away with it or maybe because

357
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,343
brown is the new black.
How the hell am I supposed to know?

358
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:42,826
- So this pervert is still at large.
- Yseah, and get this.

359
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:47,748
The owners of the Rodeo Drive Chop Shop
made huge payouts to the victims

360
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:51,016
so that their already astronomical
malpractice insurance

361
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,447
doesn't go sky-high.

362
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:55,781
Looks like everybody's gettin' raped
thanks to this fudge-finder.

363
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,881
Dawn could sue us because
we don't have enough security.

364
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,395
Our carrier could drop us.
No insurance, no practice.

365
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:05,833
You think she's litigious?

366
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:08,241
You guys need to make nice, and fast.

367
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,642
She's hitler in uggs, and she's smelly,

368
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:16,004
and I need you to protect me
from her, ok? That's all I'm asking.

369
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:19,728
That's Freddy Prune, the show's creator.
And this is the set.

370
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,919
This is where Mr. Stone and, uh--
Oh, look who it is.

371
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,132
Please, nothing about her weight.
She's very sensitive.

372
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:27,751
Hi, Dawn. Kate. Nice to meet you.

373
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,169
Sean has told me
so many nice things about you.

374
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:31,604
- Hey, you.
- Hey. Hi.

375
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:33,053
You look so handsome.

376
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,530
Oh, thank you.
Dawn, that's really sweet.

377
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:42,553
I hear that you are hoping to meet
my handsome costar.

378
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,611
I happen to know where he hangs out, so,

379
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:47,726
You know, I'll take her over
to Aidan's Trailer.

380
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,958
Yeah. Let's go. I know.
He's so cute and nice.

381
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,284
Hello?

382
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:57,373
Annie's been expelled, Sean,
<i>and we've gotta drive up there.</i>

383
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,382
- She what?
- Even prettier than me.

384
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:01,776
- Hey, hey, hey! Heads up!
- Dawn!

385
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,542
Hey! Heads up!

386
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:10,498
- Come on.
- What happened? Oh, my God.

387
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,900
Goddamn it-- are we insured for this?
Somebody check the insurance right now.

388
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,247
How the heck did-- we just had
a safety meeting. Goddamn it.

389
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:32,201
<i>Hi.</i>

390
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:35,089
<i>I'm Freddy.</i>

391
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:37,019
<i>Are you ok?</i>

392
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:46,982
The world we're passing along
to this generation creates a challenge.

393
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:51,410
There's so much darkness and corruption,
and as we see here today,

394
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,661
they're responding in disturbing ways.

395
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,723
Clearly many of them are desperate
to breathe life into their bleak

396
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:58,470
vision of the future.

397
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,422
Let me ask you this, Mr. Blunt.

398
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:08,380
What if a student's problems aren't
about this dark world, but rather

399
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,362
were instigated by a disturbed
psychopath right here at Preston

400
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,889
- who set her sights on my daughter?
- Sean,

401
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,534
now Annie has got problems
that we cannot blame on someone

402
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:18,991
who she's only known for a few months.

403
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:23,270
A few months ago, Annie
was a very sane and innocent girl.

404
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:27,734
It's always difficult to face
the shortcomings of our children.

405
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:31,504
Your daughter was caught
in a highly inappropriate liaison.

406
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,323
It's a zero-tolerance offence.

407
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,736
Both Annie and Chris Solomon,
the young man

408
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,612
with whom she was found
in the north stable,

409
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,918
are being asked to pack up
and vacate immediately.

410
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,832
This is all your fault.

411
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:04,489
- Why are you trying to destroy us?
- I don't wanna destroy you, Sean.

412
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,275
I just wanna have a little bit of fun.

413
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:19,577
Put your clothes on.

414
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:21,839
We're going to the headmaster's office,
and you're gonna explain

415
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,524
that you're the one who's been teaching
my daughter about oral sex.

416
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,695
You know what Blunt likes?

417
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:28,930
Blunt likes when I suck his balls.

418
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:32,188
He wouldn't wanna hear
anything bad about me.

419
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:36,210
- He likes me.
- What happened to you?

420
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:40,201
I don't understand. You're attractive.
You're smart.

421
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,438
Your mother tries to be
a responsible parent.

422
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,692
You've got it all backwards, Sean.

423
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,255
I'm the fairy godmother.

424
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:52,930
Annie needs to learn how to attract
the boy she's been fantasizing about.

425
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:55,030
I know you fantasize about me

426
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,398
while you're pumping away
on little Miss Jenny Craig.

427
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,706
- Jesus Christ.
- Does fatty dumpster swallow?

428
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,407
Bet she's too worried
about the calories.

429
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:04,537
- You leave Kate out of this.
- All that anger.

430
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,879
It's 'cause you're fighting
what you want, Sean.

431
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,397
I love to swallow.

432
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:13,164
I taught myself to deep-throat
using a numbing spray.

433
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:14,907
You listen to me.

434
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,319
The people who take advantage
of you are predators.

435
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:23,260
They're pathetic predators.
I do not lust after you.

436
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,042
In fact, the harder you try,
the more you turn me off.

437
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,869
- Just stay away from me.
- Stay away from you

438
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:36,178
or from annie?

439
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,588
What's your real fear, Sean,

440
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:41,927
that I'll corrupt Annie

441
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:44,153
or that I'll corrupt you?

442
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,895
Saying a few last-minute
Hail Marys, Sister?

443
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,298
It's a waste of time.
You're gonna be fine

444
00:28:58,418 --> 00:29:01,593
thanks to good, old-fashioned
surgical expertise.

445
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:04,152
You'll need to take
that off before surgery.

446
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,084
- Will you help me, doctor?
- Of course.

447
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:13,475
There you go.

448
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,666
I want you to take it.

449
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,881
Pray with it every now and then.

450
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:21,094
I gave up praying
when I was 10 years old.

451
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,411
Prayer is very powerful, Dr. Troy.

452
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:26,149
- Did you read about what happened
in Australia? - No, I didn't.

453
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:27,818
Well, they're having a terrible drought,

454
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,648
and the prime minister asked everyone
to pray for rain, and the next day,

455
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,006
it rained all across
northwestern Victoria,

456
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:34,897
the very next day.

457
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:38,400
Well, that's good to know that
the solution to global warming

458
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,254
is just a rosary bead away.

459
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:43,033
Well, even a man of science
can respect empirical evidence.

460
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,191
Here's a piece of empirical evidence
for you.

461
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,705
Every night when I was a kid, I used to
kneel in front of my bed and pray to God

462
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:52,941
that my foster father wouldn't
come back into my room,

463
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:56,245
and every night, he came back in anyway.

464
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:59,279
So God listens to the australian
farmers, but he doesn't listen

465
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,937
to an innocent boy who's being
sodomized by an evil psychopath.

466
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:09,664
I'm so sorry.

467
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,828
There's no way I can know
what God's plan was,

468
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,234
but I know he had one,

469
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:22,156
and sometimes we have to focus our
prayers on having that revealed to us.

470
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:24,277
That's how I was saved.

471
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,867
The truth is I don't wanna
be saved, Sister.

472
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,864
Maybe you should've found yourself
a more pious surgeon.

473
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,735
Nope. I'm glad it's you.

474
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:39,345
There's a glimmer of true light
in those eyes,

475
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:42,546
and I can see it fighting
for a place at the table.

476
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:44,620
Just take it.

477
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:46,929
For me.

478
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:57,265
Whatever makes
the patient more comfortable.

479
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,296
How are you feeling, Dawn?

480
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:04,679
Tthey say I'm lucky I didn't die,
but you know what?

481
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:07,593
I'm lucky I got hit
by that 300-pound light.

482
00:31:07,714 --> 00:31:09,611
Had I been anywhere else in the world,

483
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,788
I never would have found
my raison d'etre.

484
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:15,027
It's my bliss.

485
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:18,706
- Frederic Christopher Prune.
- She saw stars, gentlemen,

486
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:20,300
and so did i.

487
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:22,550
Tell you the truth,
I'd given up on love.

488
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:25,417
I made up my mind that romance
was gonna have to break down my door

489
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:27,354
and drag me kicking
from my Pratesi sheets.

490
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:30,192
I certainly was not gonna waste
any more time on the caliber of woman

491
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:33,638
you normally meet in this town
And then...

492
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,044
I met my Dawn,

493
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:40,344
a real woman with a real soul
and a heart of gold.

494
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:44,681
And Jesus Christ, take one look at her.
You know what you do to me, darling?

495
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:46,005
Tell me.

496
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:49,132
You look like a buttercup,
and you turn my freaking crank around

497
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:50,716
and around and around and around.

498
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:54,864
Well, that crazy Cupid
is just full of surprises, isn't he?

499
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:02,482
What, are you 90?! Jesus.
It's a text message.

500
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:07,005
I guess I should read the manual. Sorry.

501
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,796
Uh, family stuff.
Anyway, congratulations.

502
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:18,138
Yeah, we're thrilled for you,
envious, in fact.

503
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:23,236
- Boy, Freddy.
- You know, doctors, I'm very intuitive,

504
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:25,684
extremely intuitive, and I do happen
to know what you're thinking.

505
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,249
Well, Freddy, you have to admit,
you do have a certain...

506
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:31,913
What? Sense of style?
Way with a bon mot?

507
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:35,048
Passion for the genius
of Stephen Sondheim? Come on.

508
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,755
Give me a break.
Let's get in the 2007s, will ya?

509
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,718
I mean, frankly I'm disappointed in you,
especially you. Don't know why.

510
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:44,456
From you, I expect this.
I mean, what do I have to do,

511
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,109
show you my fantasy football roster?

512
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:49,157
Terrell Owens is stinkin' up the joint.
You want him? Take him off my hands.

513
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,389
Maybe I can jump over
that faggy table of yours

514
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,733
and beat the living shit out of you.
How about that? I'm sorry.

515
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:55,188
- It's just a little ignorant--
- Listen,

516
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,335
let me cut to the chase, ok, fellas?

517
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,696
Freddy Prune is packin'.
Freddy Prune gives wicked head.

518
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,649
Freddy prune rides me like he is
the king of the freakin' rodeo.

519
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:08,282
Any questions?

520
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,390
Ok.  Now that we've cleared
that up, Freddy,

521
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,411
why don't you tell us
what you don't like about yourself.

522
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:16,747
He needs as ass-lift.

523
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:21,562
I call him Mr. Waffle butt.
Flat as a pancake, cute little craters.

524
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,157
Show him, sweetheart.

525
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:28,464
Christ, what is this,
homeroom at Hollywood high?

526
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:30,446
Answer it, already.

527
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:41,105
Look, uh, my partner'll have to finish
the consult. I got nanny problems.

528
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:23,724
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

529
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:28,354
<i>I wanna report a woman in severe
hypothermia. Her body's been in ice.</i>

530
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,471
<i> - Does the patient have a pulse?
- No.</i>

531
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:34,674
<i>You need me to talk you through C.P.R.?</i>

532
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:38,447
<i>No. I'm a doctor. She needs warming
fluids. How soon will they be here?</i>

533
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:39,912
<i>5 to 10 minutes.</i>

534
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:46,669
Please, God.
Please, God, don't let her die.

535
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,943
Christ, I'll never--
I'll never play with people--

536
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:52,540
people's lives again. I promise. I'll...

537
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,850
Look at that gorgeous bumper.

538
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:39,034
Freddy is tasty and delicious
as a cinnabon, but half the calories.

539
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,596
- Cinna-bun. You get it?
- Oh, Jesus, believe me, I got it.

540
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:45,842
Yeah, no sitting for a week, and I want
you sleeping on your side, ok?

541
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,455
- Tell me about it.
- What, so no humpy-humpy?

542
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,297
Princess, for God sake,

543
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:54,824
my ass feels like it just got attacked
by a swarm of killer bees. No joke.

544
00:36:55,175 --> 00:36:57,119
Oh, baby. Baby.

545
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,793
Dawn, could I, um, talk to you
in my office? Just to go over some,

546
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:03,087
- uh, billing details.
- Billing?

547
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:07,300
You said this surgery was on the house
because of my ass bandit trauma.

548
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,353
I'm still having flashbacks,
aren't I? Aren't I, Freddy?

549
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,884
Look at me. It's all in the past.

550
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:16,302
Look in my eyes and say,
"it's all in the past".

551
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:18,888
- It's all in the past.
- Just some minor details while

552
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:21,729
- Freddy rests.
- You get 5 minutes, ok, honey?

553
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,657
Close your eyes. Count to 10.

554
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:26,078
- Ok. Come back quick. Come back quick.
- It's all in the past.

555
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:28,430
I don't actually need
to talk to you about payment.

556
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,290
I wanna talk about you and Freddy.

557
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,532
Stop right there.

558
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,388
I'm way ahead of you, doc.
I know he's out of my league.

559
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:38,390
He's too good for me. He's too smart.

560
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,420
He's too famous. He's too sexy.

561
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,545
You know, he could be bangin'
Jennifer Aniston right now,

562
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:44,848
but he's not.

563
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:46,812
He chose me for the moment.

564
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,644
I don't think it's Jennifer Aniston
you should be worried about.

565
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,556
Could be right. He's always
had a thing for busty blondes.

566
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:56,103
You know, he still cries
over Anna Nicole.

567
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:59,333
Dawn, please, listen to me.
Just listen to me.

568
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:01,693
Ok, you're a very lovable person,

569
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:05,221
and I just wanna make sure
you're with a man who

570
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,621
loves you for the right reasons.

571
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:10,772
I'm fine, Dr. Troy.

572
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,897
I'm walkin' on air.
It's a rush you can't imagine,

573
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,671
truly, giving yourself over
to another person,

574
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,530
scheming to make
all their dreams come true.

575
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,940
It's called unconditional love.

576
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,061
You should try it.

577
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,397
Good evening, Mr. Prune.

578
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:54,758
Are you the night nursey?

579
00:38:56,363 --> 00:38:58,461
I'm Dr. George.

580
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:07,419
I'm here to collect a stool sample.

581
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,486
If you'll raise your knees for me.

582
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:38,251
And breathe.

583
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:51,212
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

584
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:54,599
First let me tell you
what I like about her.

585
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:56,973
Her pussy.

586
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,899
It's soft and tight and pink.

587
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,572
I don't wanna hear this.

588
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,614
Nothing good will come
from this kind of talk.

589
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,625
- Now, what can I do for you?
- It's too late, doc.

590
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:13,296
The damage is done. I slept with her.

591
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:17,280
I was weak. I couldn't--
I couldn't resist.

592
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,327
I thought I could trust her.

593
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:22,786
I thought she'd keep the secret,
but she told everyone.

594
00:40:22,906 --> 00:40:24,323
She told everyone.

595
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:28,140
I'm not even a doctor anymore.

596
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:32,324
She lied. She told 'em that I raped her,
and they took everything away from me,

597
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:36,054
my license to practice. My...

598
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,151
Family, they despise me now
for what I did.

599
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:47,922
And my partner's done with me, too.
He called me a rank piece of shit.

600
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:52,988
Can you help me?

601
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:55,455
There's no cure
for your kind of weakness.

602
00:40:56,345 --> 00:40:59,662
- I'm a surgeon, not a witch doctor.
- Please,

603
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,362
- cut them off.
- I'm sorry?

604
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,366
My balls, you idiot.

605
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:08,230
Just cut 'em off.

606
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,609
I mean, have some goddamn pity
and cut 'em off before they kill me.

607
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:14,558
Listen to me. Get ahold of yourself.
I'm not cutting anything off.

608
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,698
It's my only hope.

609
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,511
I have no will, no strength.

610
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:22,886
If you don't cut 'em off,
I'm a dead man.

611
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:32,435
Fine. You won't do it,

612
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,608
I will.

613
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:40,689
Hey, sexy, I was over
at the farmers market.

614
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:42,474
I thought I'd surprise you.
Are you ok?

615
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,834
The tomatoes were so gorgeous,
and they had some really fresh basil, so

616
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,802
I thought I would surprise you
and make us a caprese salad for lunch.

617
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,716
Oh, and I also got
the most amazing organic peaches.

618
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,510
They're the last ones of the season.
Aren't they amazing?

619
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:15,314
you look pretty today.

620
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,987
- Thanks.
- It was a weird day.

621
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,731
I do love you, Kate.

622
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,915
41/2 pounds down, and I'm lovable again.

623
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:30,750
You're always lovable.

624
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:33,232
You're a wonderful girl.

625
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,200
Woman.

626
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:40,040
I think we should get married.

627
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:06,324
- Dr. Troy.
- Hey, Sister.

628
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,530
I, uh, brought your St. Christopher.

629
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:14,522
Well, actually, the one you gave me,
I forgot about

630
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:17,088
and left it in a pair of pants
that went to the cleaners,

631
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:21,834
and somebody there must have need
some kind of salvation, because, uh,

632
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,603
it didn't come back.

633
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:28,613
So I got you this one. It's, uh,

634
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:31,860
22-karet gold.

635
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:38,844
I got it from an estate jeweler.

636
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:43,438
That wasn't necessary, but thank you.

637
00:43:53,016 --> 00:43:54,213
How are you feeling?

638
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:59,482
Itchy, but, uh, signs of healing.
You mentioned that.

639
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,444
Yeah. Yeah, it can definitely
be uncomfortable.

640
00:44:03,564 --> 00:44:07,888
So look, I owe you an apology.
I, uh-- I treated you disrespectfully.

641
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:11,224
Apology accepted,

642
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,775
and again, it's not necessary,

643
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,826
but appreciated.

644
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:18,849
So I guess I'll see you
for the stitches removal.

645
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,884
Yeah. Yep. That you will.

646
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:27,196
Would you consider praying with me?

647
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,153
I'm always interested in praying.

648
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:33,489
What are we praying for?

649
00:44:41,268 --> 00:44:42,382
I don't know.

650
