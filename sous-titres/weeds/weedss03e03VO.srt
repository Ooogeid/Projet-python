Did you take something
that doesn't belong to you?

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:05,989
- I want in.
- That's him.

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,109
Hey, what the hell?
You can't do that.

5
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,221
I did this for your own good.

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,112
- They want to send me to Iraq, Lupita.
- Bye.

7
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:20,354
Oh my God, stop him, oh my God!

8
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:22,212
I need someone I trust
to handle my money.

9
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:23,877
- What money?
- From my commercials.

10
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,163
<i>I'm the new Huskaroos girl.</i>

11
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:26,824
- You were traded.
- I was what?

12
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,450
I bought your chain,
you're about to grow me some shit.

13
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:33,807
The way I see it,
you still owe me 150 G's, lady.

[ www.seriessub.com ]

18
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,902
How long have I been asleep?

19
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:00,987
- Not long.
- 22 hours.

20
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,502
What?
Like she wouldn't figure it out?

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,050
It's absolutely delicious.

22
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:07,835
- I made this.
- Lupita,

23
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,623
- you're fired.
- What?! But I cooked.

24
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,486
I can't afford to pay you anymore.

25
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,923
What if I tell the police what you do?

26
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:17,078
Then, the guy I owe money to,

27
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:18,941
might decide to kill you.

28
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,953
Maybe we should not discuss this

29
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:24,025
in front of the younger members
of our audience.

30
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,671
I'm not keeping any secrets anymore.

31
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,834
Kids need to know what's going on,

32
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,411
so they can be aware...

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,367
- of this danger.
- What kind of danger?

34
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,885
Big scary men with the guns who
want a lot of money from Mummy, so...

35
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,770
let's just be alert, and talk about...

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,142
how much money
we can all raise now.

37
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,099
Andy... speak to me.

38
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,757
If you stake me the ten grand buy-in,

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,780
there is a World Poker Classic
at Commerce this week.

40
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,268
Silas, what you got?

41
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,040
I can crack saves.

42
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,466
Too soon, my son. Too soon.

43
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:06,521
I have a stock portfolio worth $2,600.

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,823
Cash it then.

45
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,789
But if I liquid it now,
I'll pay penalty.

46
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,783
Shane, now.

47
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:18,818
The three of you keep thinking.

48
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,341
Now, there's not much here
in the way of assets.

49
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:25,621
But you do have
Isabel and her Huskarros contract.

50
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,197
Now, that is a cash cow right there.

51
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,586
- You got the cow part right.
- Hey, that is no way to talk...

52
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,404
about your greatest asset.

53
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:37,536
If you have a lousy relationship
with your income-generating child,

54
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:39,554
you need to turn that around, right now.

55
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,162
Spend some time with her,
charm her,

56
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,432
you want sole custody.

57
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,840
- I do?
- You do.

58
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,580
You're not the one that...

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,236
cupped her pubescent breast
after a few too many chardonnays.

60
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,829
What?

61
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:56,682
Never.

62
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:59,913
Well, just thought I'd... float it
out there, see if it caught wind.

63
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,730
Doesn't matter, we'll get him.

64
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,345
Allow me to illustrate.

65
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,776
This is your husband.

66
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:08,980
Watch,

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,391
how he struggles
for the slightest hint of sustenance.

68
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:16,834
Slouching to a Bethlehem of mercy
that never appears.

69
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:20,037
And just when
he's about to resign himself

70
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,952
to his miserable, doomed fate,

71
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,021
we allow this son of a bitch
to escape with his life.

72
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,393
In the end, he'll thank us

73
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:34,779
for not crushing
his sad little testicles in a vise.

74
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,385
Do fish have testicles?

75
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,431
Fish have internal testicles.

76
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,266
... only real downer,
besides the residual pain,

77
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,098
is the issue of warm weather footwear.

78
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,467
I support the flip-flop,
the summer sandal...

79
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:52,441
I get stares.
Children cry and run away...

80
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,138
- Can we go to the arcade now?
- Well, Mr. Botwin.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,848
While an injury such as yours may have
rendered you unfit for duty in the past,

82
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:01,359
- I'm afraid times have changed.
- What do you mean?

83
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,382
In case you haven't read
a newspaper in 4 years,

84
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:06,061
this country, your country, is at war.

85
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,341
Actually, technically,
operation "Iraqi Freedom"

86
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:13,169
is an extended military engagement.

87
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,876
War's not been declared.

88
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,209
Actually, technically,

89
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:20,883
authorization for use of military force
has been given by Congress,

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,472
that's enough to activate
your uncle here into service.

91
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah, I'm clearly not fit.

92
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:28,404
- You can walk, can't you?
- Not in lock step, no, I tend to weave.

93
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,119
- Didn't notice.
- I'll fail the drug test.

94
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:31,467
- We'll clean you up.
- I'm gay.

95
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,862
We got a unit for that.

96
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,264
Look son,
truth is that you'll never see combat.

97
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,923
- We wanna win this war.
- It's not a war.

98
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,758
My point is...

99
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,289
You're headed for a desk job, son.

100
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,374
So quit your whining
and prepare to serve,

101
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,967
'cause we got you,
and we ain't gonna let you go. Now...

102
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,561
to report back here at 05:00
tomorrow morning

103
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,224
with this papers properly filled out.

104
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,543
You must bring with you

105
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,003
your social security card,
birth certificate, and driver's license.

106
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:59,853
Do not bring iPods, watches,

107
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,860
jewelry, excessive cash,
or any other valuables.

108
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,359
This is bullshit.

109
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,798
Welcome to the army, soldier.

110
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,505
All the MILF weed's destroyed?

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,938
There's nothing.

112
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,385
I was gonna buy a boat.

113
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,369
Doug, can we just focus on me
for a second please?

114
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,114
- I'm in serious trouble.
- Alright.

115
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,107
Lots of cash, real quick,

116
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,048
no boat.

117
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:27,468
Why aren't you dressed?

118
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:28,992
Dana threw me out of the house,

119
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,869
I've been sleeping here,
in the office.

120
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,576
- She threw you out?
- Yeah,

121
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,491
she found out
that I was fucking Celia.

122
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,363
I'm repulsed.

123
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:41,878
Fascinated.

124
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:44,901
I need to hear about this.
Not now, definitely later.

125
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,334
Now, we need to focus.

126
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,213
How much could I raise
if I liquidate all my stocks and bonds?

127
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,495
You don't have stocks and bonds.

128
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,655
Yes, I do.
I have stocks and bonds.

129
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,196
Judah left me stocks and bonds.

130
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,279
He did, but then,

131
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,844
you had me sell everything
so you could start up the bakery.

132
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,428
- Everything?
- There wasn't much.

133
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,313
Judah was lousy at playing a market.

134
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:06,158
I mean, a company that sells
morning afterpills for dogs...

135
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:08,291
You were the one advising him, Doug.

136
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,833
Okay, that one do not come from me.

137
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,867
Credentials, yeah, me.

138
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,054
But he went rogue on our few 486.

139
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,125
Anyway, you're broke again.

140
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:21,220
Unacceptable, there has to be something,
there's always something.

141
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,265
How much money can I get in if I...

142
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,142
sold my house?

143
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:28,126
Not much.
The bubble's bursting in Agrestic.

144
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:29,916
Majestic next door,
that's a new hot spot

145
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,700
with the chartered schools
and a mega church,

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,247
it's crucifying her property values.

147
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:34,404
How much, Doug?

148
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:38,694
If you even found a buyer,
you can net... maybe 50 Grand.

149
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,124
But then any places you'd rent

150
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,912
would be more than
the mortgage that you're paying now.

151
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,012
It's not smart.

152
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,401
- It's cash in hand, let's do it.
- Where will you live?

153
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,142
I can only deal
with one thing at the time.

154
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:48,528
If I deal with one thing at the time,

155
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,295
I'm less inclined
to shot myself in the head.

156
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,127
Don't do that, your life insurance
went out a few weeks ago.

157
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,163
I sent you an e-mail.

158
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:58,703
Get it back, Doug,

159
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,827
my kids may seriously need it, too.

160
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,171
I've got to go.

161
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,406
The cock wants what it wants.

162
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:11,418
5000 square feet of raw space,
and 250 a foot is a good price.

163
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,615
I could retrofit the climate control.

164
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,469
Put 3 or 4 generators in the wood so
we don't have to worry 'bout the sound,

165
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,690
put the cover business up front,
for appearances,

166
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,449
secure the back for crops.

167
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:25,824
Downtown is supposed
to be blowing up right now.

168
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,028
Lady said they'll build
a Whole foods just off the blocks,

169
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,914
so you can get
all that gourmet shit you like.

170
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,171
Boy, look at here.

171
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,032
How you like that view?

172
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,802
He gonna kill those nice plants.

173
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,887
Why you started smoking again?

174
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,352
I ain't see you smoke
since back when I was in junior high.

175
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,958
And goddamn, Mores no less.

176
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:51,053
I started smoking I was long and brown,
like these cigarettes.

177
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,893
Everything's changed.

178
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,437
You don't like it. Come on.
Let's tell her we gonna keep looking.

179
00:08:58,702 --> 00:08:59,757
Can you grow here?

180
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:04,604
Hell, yeah. It's perfect.

181
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,304
Fuckin' shame
it's all gonna be for U-Turn.

182
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,314
Let me worry about U-Turn.

183
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:13,985
Just grow.

184
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,438
How are we doing out here?

185
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:18,949
We'll take it.

186
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,731
That toilet paper's like wiping yourself
with a brown paper bag.

187
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,936
Are your... parts okay?

188
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,186
My parts are fine.

189
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,140
Can I go home, now?

190
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:32,955
- This place is a pity.
- No, it's not.

191
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,079
It's... kitschy.

192
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,320
Like we're in a "film noir".

193
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,639
It's a walk on the wild side.

194
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,815
Didn't you like any manucures?

195
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,743
You wouldn't let me get color I wanted.

196
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,137
- Black is not a color.
- Tell that to black people.

197
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,276
I don't know any.

198
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,923
Maybe there's something good
on television.

199
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:00,688
<i>Over 2 sizzling hours of hot, young
girl and girl action...</i>

200
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:04,154
- Sweet.
- No, no, we're not watching that.

201
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:07,686
Might as well just go to bed.

202
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:09,666
Fine.

203
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,855
Here.

204
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:13,784
How come I have to sleep on the cot?

205
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,402
Because I'm the mother
and you are the child.

206
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,748
Unless...

207
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,663
you wanted to share the bed.

208
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,393
You know, we haven't done that
since you were four.

209
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,951
How fun!

210
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,650
Yeah, well, I'm not four.

211
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,450
And I don't have any desire
to share a bed with my mother.

212
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,753
Why am I even here?

213
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,386
Because we're spending time together.

214
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,947
But we don't like each other.

215
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,631
Maybe we just don't know
each other very well.

216
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,632
Now, this is a chance for us
to improve our relationship.

217
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,111
I'll get in my bed,
you'll get in your bed,

218
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,798
we'll shut off the lights,
and we will really talk.

219
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,294
That's a condom.

220
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:00,196
Pearl inlay, on the frets parts.

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,252
That's handmade, that's a '56 Lespaul.

222
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,765
It should bring in
about 3,000 bucks on eBay.

223
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,311
- You should have kept running.
- Hey, let's keep up alive.

224
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,126
And Oregon be 3 hours away,
it's on American soil,

225
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,159
I can come visit every weekend,

226
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:16,429
and... you can hang out in my room,
whenever you feel sad.

227
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,568
Don't open the nightstand drawer.

228
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,496
Actually, your room isn't gonna be here.

229
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,871
I decided to put the house up for sale.

230
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,154
It's a good time to rent,
with the market, and all...

231
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:32,037
We all need to embrace change.

232
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,718
Good luck in the court today, champ'.

233
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,760
Fingers crossed for a female judge,
cry if you can.

234
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:06,577
I'll keep that in mind.

235
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,971
It's good to embrace change, right?

236
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,642
Lady brings me 7 Grand.

237
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:36,948
What'd I do with 7 Grand?

238
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:39,306
You'd wipe your ass with 7 Grand.

239
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,039
This is bullshit.

240
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,568
Marvin, go pick up one of her kids,
and break his leg.

241
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,222
That's all I've got.

242
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,174
I'm waiting on some...
paypal payments.

243
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:51,840
I promise I'll have more for you
to wipe your ass with, soon.

244
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,367
You go work this off and trade.

245
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:55,904
What kind of trade?

246
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:00,608
White... slave trade.

247
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,135
Here.

248
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,715
Go there. Tell'em I sent you.

249
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,604
They gonna give you a package.

250
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,545
Bring the package back to me.

251
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:14,972
A package of what?

252
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,466
Package of whatever the fuck
I tell you to pick up, bitch.

253
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,394
You don't have to yell at me!

254
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,417
- When do you need it?
- Right now.

255
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,216
My son's beeing sentenced today.

256
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:26,457
That's just sad.

257
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,345
You know, you should really get him in
one of those after shool programs,

258
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,547
instead of letting him
all run wild and shit.

259
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,438
- I'm glad you understand.
- I don't understand a shit!

260
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,227
Move some stuff around.

261
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,403
I'll do my best.

262
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,493
Why did you send her?

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,747
I want to see how she do.

264
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,922
Please, talk to me.

265
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,824
Listen, I am really trying here.

266
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,038
Just sitting here,
like some little shit ball.

267
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:18,492
Can I help you?

268
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,068
My name is Miriam Walters.

269
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,215
I'm an officer with the state of
California Child Protective Services.

270
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,350
Are you Mrs. Celia Hodes?

271
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,217
It's pronounced Hodes.

272
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,914
May we have your permission
to enter the premisses?

273
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,801
- What for?
- I must warn you

274
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,172
that if you do not allow me
entering to the premisses,

275
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,831
I will return with a court order.

276
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,624
If you still refuse me entry,

277
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:42,679
you may be subject to prosecution
under California State law which...

278
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,608
Alright, obviously,
there's some mistake.

279
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,380
No, there isn't.
I called them.

280
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:54,481
You little... jokester you.

281
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,600
I must ask you once more, Mrs. Hodes,

282
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,963
- do I have permission
to enter the premisses? - Sure.

283
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,395
Enter away.

284
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,280
I have nothing to hide.

285
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,209
What are you writing?

286
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,703
I'm here to determine whether
this is an unsuitable environment

287
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:13,250
in which to house a child.

288
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,181
There was a used condom in my bed.

289
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,989
That was not a condom!

290
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:20,222
- Then what was it?
- A plastic wrapper!

291
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:21,568
With a reservoir tip?

292
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,032
Just because this establishment

293
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:30,331
may be on the lower end
of the economic scale

294
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:33,224
does not mean
that it's unsuitable.

295
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:38,377
If you are suggesting that anything
less than affluence is somehow...

296
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,333
untoward, Ms. Walters,

297
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,672
I think that I need to...

298
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,585
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

299
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,803
<i>Fuck me harder!</i>

300
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,416
... should speak to your supervisor.

301
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,672
<i>Fuck me harder.</i>

302
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,415
<i>- Fuck me harder!
- Yeah, yeah!</i>

303
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:58,898
<i>- Harder, harder, harder!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

304
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:14,381
<i>Hola.</i>

305
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,459
U-Turn sent me,

306
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,313
I'm supposed
to pick up a package.

307
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,096
U-Turn...

308
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,806
para obtengo el paqueto...

309
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,808
- Any chance you speak french?
<i>- Ven aqui!</i>

310
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,963
You say U-Turn sends you?

311
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:57,055
Yeah, U-Turn, he sent me,
I'm supposed to pick up a package.

312
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,174
Will you please tell him
to open the door?

313
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:07,185
What's the matter?
You don't speak Spanish?

314
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,618
No, I don't.

315
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:13,444
How can you live in Los Angeles
and not know Spanish?

316
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,130
We're almost half the population here.

317
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,544
<i>Por ejemplo,</i> if I told you...

318
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,742
<i>Conozco a este hombre
que se llama U-Turn.</i>

319
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,061
Would you not like that?

320
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,141
Well, that depends.
What does that mean?

321
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:31,694
It means that maybe I do know
this man who calls himself U-Turn.

322
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,801
Then maybe you also have
a package for me.

323
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,599
Maybe... I do.

324
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,329
I have to be in court right now,

325
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,175
so, let's just pretend that
I reached for it another few times,

326
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,545
and each time,
you grabbed it away, so...

327
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,816
Where does that leave us?

328
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,309
You ever get something
for nothing in your life?

329
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,052
I don't think so,

330
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:57,903
and...

331
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:00,497
it ain't gonna happen
for the first time here.

332
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:07,260
What do you want?

333
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,966
I want you to do
the brick dance for me.

334
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,111
A brick dance?

335
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,053
You must dance
to the Great God of Mota.

336
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,991
And if you do it right,

337
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,328
then you get your brick.

338
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,009
And if I refuse?

339
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,236
<i>No baila</i>, no brick.

340
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,428
This is not a real brick dance.

341
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,249
Man, that's a shot of
cheap tequila dance.

342
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,148
Now, show me a real brick dance!

343
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:58,738
Now, what, that's a...

344
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:01,007
a loose joint dance at best.

345
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:04,303
You know what?
I've been way too sweet with you.

346
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,434
If you'll not do
a real brick dance for me,

347
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:10,468
then I cannot give you the brick.

348
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:19,763
Hold your horses, Pedro.

349
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,291
My name is Guillermo,

350
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,073
not Pedro.

351
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,131
That was a very nice brick dance.

352
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:29,608
Tell your friend U-Turn,

353
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:31,966
you tell him
he's a lawn jockey now.

354
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,778
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

355
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,459
Yeah. <i>Adios.</i>

356
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,787
- The fuck is this?
- Your pot.

357
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:53,181
He said to tell you that
"you're a lawn jockey now".

358
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:56,184
I'm not sure what that means
but I figured you 2 have some sort of...

359
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,751
drug dealer shorthand
that I'm not privy to.

360
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,589
You were supposed
to pick up a key of Jag.

361
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:04,163
- Jack?
- I had it all promised out.

362
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:07,783
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with this?

363
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,704
That would be euphemism for...

364
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:12,274
heroin?

365
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,211
I'm gonna kill
that bean-farting motherfucker.

366
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,071
This is your fault, bitch!

367
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,249
My fault?

368
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:21,847
Bet your ass and
you gonna make it right to me.

369
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:24,205
Look.

370
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,061
I'm not a gangsta, all right?

371
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,786
You never told me
what I was supposed to be picking up.

372
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,214
There's really...

373
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:35,773
only so much you can reasonnably
expect from me in these situations.

374
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:39,213
I did a fucking brick dance
for you, okay?

375
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,038
I got a parking ticket!

376
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,852
- A brick dance?
- I did what you told me to.

377
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,936
Let's just... sit down my...

378
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,584
rational people and start...
dialing down my debt.

379
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,269
You done?

380
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:57,300
Chop that shit up, move it.

381
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,203
Bring me back 12.5.

382
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,487
12.5?
No way I'm gonna get 12.5 for a brick.

383
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,290
You got 4 days.

384
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:09,672
And I'm taking the money that I gave
that fucking wetback for my Jag,

385
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,333
and I'm adding it on your tab.

386
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,065
Yeah. I'm not stupid, okay?

387
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:15,289
I know what this is worth,
and it's not 12.5.

388
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,416
8, maybe.

389
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:17,553
13!

390
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:20,209
I'm back,
so now I got a fuck to shit up.

391
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:23,378
I ain't got anymore
"shit to fuck up", okay?

392
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,890
I've got kids, I've got bills!

393
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,060
How am I supposed
to put food on my table?

394
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,635
You keep upping my debt.

395
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,017
Get a fucking job.

396
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:40,893
<i>Young man,</i>

397
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:44,654
the theft you commited of
those surveillance cameras

398
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:47,590
was more than just
a simple act of vandalism.

399
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,238
It was a slap in the face
to this community,

400
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,536
and the citizens who
have dedicated their time

401
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,875
ridding Agrestic of drugs.

402
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,600
So I'm inclined to
make an example of you

403
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,013
and your wanton disregard
of civic property.

404
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,205
Excuse me, judge.

405
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,979
I'd like to speak out
on behalf of my son.

406
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,406
- He's normally very responsible.
- Save it, Mrs. Botwin,

407
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:08,560
Mrs. Hodes has already
beaten you to the punch.

408
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,319
She's explained that your family
has gone through enough, and...

409
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:14,032
asked me to go easy on the boy.

410
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,333
Silas Botwin,
you're hereby sentenced

411
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:19,152
to 6 months of community service.

412
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:24,462
Both you and your mother owe
Mrs. Hodes a great deal of gratitude.

413
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,585
I think we really need to talk.

414
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,694
Fuck yourself, Celia.

415
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:34,439
All right, listen up.

416
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:37,885
It's my sorry-ass job
inform you ass-felching

417
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:40,357
salad-tossing, cum-guzzling faggots...

418
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:43,683
that the butt ugly face
you're staring at this very moment

419
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,212
is one of the most important
goddamn face

420
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:47,747
you'll ever lay eyes upon.

421
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,884
That is your Battle Buddy.

422
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:53,284
Your Battle Buddy
is like your Siamese twin.

423
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,526
He shits, you shit.

424
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,497
He fucks up, you fuck up.

425
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:00,608
He goes down, you go down!

426
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,525
This is just like 'Nam.

427
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,288
Yeah, you got that right.

428
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,467
I can't wait to kill me some terrorists.

429
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:08,920
Are you kidding me?

430
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,883
This isn't about terrorism.

431
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:15,130
We are just pawns in a chess game
for control of the oil production.

432
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:16,395
Who cares?

433
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,385
Bring it on, man.

434
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,967
Please, don't talk to me anymore.

435
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:22,583
You gonna shit when I shit.

436
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:24,212
6 weeks from today,

437
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,535
this entire troop of girl scouts
will be shipped off to Irak.

438
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,820
So you best pay close attention
to every goddamn word

439
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:32,253
that comes out of my godly mouth!

440
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:34,390
Sergeant Bilko, hi.

441
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,939
I'm in the wrong place,
they promised me a desk job.

442
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,205
Who in the hell gave you permission
to break rank, you flaccid little dick!

443
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,598
I just wanted to make sure...

444
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,914
They promise everybody a desk job,
you useless twat!

445
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,459
- I have eight toes.
- And I got four dicks!

446
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,006
So you better fall back in line

447
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:51,374
before I use one of them
to fuck you up the ass with!

448
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:53,113
Now fall back in line!

449
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:56,408
You people are losers,

450
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:57,750
you are scumbags,

451
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,079
and I am God.

452
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,630
It's gonna be great!

453
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:04,244
Because I won't be responsible
when you get to Irak

454
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,505
and if you don't listen to me,
guess what,

455
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:07,743
you will die!

456
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,971
What are you looking at,
you piece of shit!

457
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:14,841
Well...

458
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:17,544
In light of this incident,
we intend to petition the judge Inas

459
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:20,210
that Mrs. Hodes only have access
to her daughter Isabelle

460
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,139
on weekends, at the house,

461
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:24,119
in the presence of Mr. Hodes.

462
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:25,720
That's outrageous.

463
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:28,809
Weekends at the house
unsupervised by Mr. Hodes.

464
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,985
- Nope.
- Fine.

465
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:32,366
Fine?

466
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,112
What do you mean, "fine"?

467
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,702
I'm the mother.

468
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,600
Why aren't his internal fishballs
in a vise ?

469
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,185
What happened to the fish?

470
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,717
The fish gasps but the cow gives milk.

471
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,533
You dried up the cow.

472
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,033
- Oh, so now I'm the fish...
- What the hell are they talking about?

473
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:52,264
She's dumping your wife
cause she doesn't think she'll get paid.

474
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,256
This is great.

475
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,236
I am nobody's fish.

476
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,135
She's right, Gina,
she's not a fish.

477
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,731
She just drinks like one.

478
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:06,697
Fuck you all.

479
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:20,337
You want me out of your life.

480
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:22,542
Fine.

481
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:25,806
I'm out of your life.

482
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:42,308
Can we talk about this?

483
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:44,329
No, we can't. Silas...

484
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,837
I told you this is too much.
Make the bags lighter, okay?

485
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:51,235
Hey, biddings are up to 28,000
on Uncle Andy's guitar.

486
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,819
That's great, sweety.

487
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,239
- I was just trying...
- To what, Silas? Help me?

488
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,674
No, didn't help.

489
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,573
Matter of fact, made it worse.

490
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:03,596
A lot worse. But...
I'll tell you how you can help me now.

491
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,114
Make bags lighter.

492
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,596
- Pizza!
- Wait here, I'll get it.

493
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,323
- Nancy Botwin?
- Yes?

494
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,143
Agent Fundis, DEA.

495
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:22,656
I'm here to talk about
Peter Scottson.
