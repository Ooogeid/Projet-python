00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,580
Give me that fucking thing!

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,197
There aren't any bullet in it!

4
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:08,846
Don't come out of here,
no matter what, don't come out.

5
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,297
If she doesn't find the pot,
ain't nobody gettin' shit!

6
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:13,024
Guns on me. I stay.

7
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,830
This is a fucking police station!

8
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,136
- Where is it?
- It's all in the trunk of my car.

9
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,035
- The car that Celia's driving?
- That would be it.

10
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,125
<i>He's my nephew,
I called in an AMBER alert.</i>

11
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:24,609
She left with Bear, and then
the kid drove a blue van

12
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,896
around the parking lot
for an hour before taking off.

13
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:28,026
Come on, we gotta jam !

14
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,089
We're having a great time,

15
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,082
we gonna grab some dinner,
then we'll be home.

16
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:34,585
- 50 percents on the dole, final offer.
- Fine.

17
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,465
Your ass and your grass is all his now.

18
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>Silas' phone.</i>

19
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,722
I borrowed some garden shears,

20
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:47,212
- you know, they were really helpful.
- He gonna be mad!

[ www.seriessub.com ]

24
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:51,280
I did this for you, Nancy.

25
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,299
You should be thanking me
for not having you arrested.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,882
Hi, I'm Celia.

27
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,110
- And you are...
- Marvin.

28
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,349
Are you one of Nancy's
drug dealer friends?

29
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,360
No.

30
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,094
No, he's not my friend.

31
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,162
He's gonna kill me.

32
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,491
Isn't that right, Marvin?

33
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:19,413
But please, do me this one last favor.

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,787
Kill her too,

35
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,521
first, in front of me, please.

36
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,166
No one will know it's you.
Just blow her fucking brains out.

37
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:30,624
And let me watch, and then,
you can do whatever you want to me.

38
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,676
- She's just kidding.
- No, not kidding, here.

39
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:37,857
If you throw that fucking rock at me,
I'm going straight to the police,

40
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:41,329
and you can rot in jail, with Silas.

41
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,496
I'm trying to help you.

42
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,290
We just know each other
from the grocery store.

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,995
- I'm a bagger, and...
- Bullshit.

44
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,178
Like if there is an obese black bag boy

45
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:02,536
in any market
in a 30 mile-range of here.

46
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,786
In Agrestic, the people are white,

47
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,498
and the helpers, brown, not black.

48
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,320
You know, you nasty.

49
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,317
Get the fuck out of my yard!

50
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,559
Okay, I can see that you're upset.

51
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,219
Being a drug dealer and
just being caught and all...

52
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:20,459
Well, this must be
very embarassing for you.

53
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,412
I'll come back,

54
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,422
when you'll have a chance to think,

55
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,130
and we'll talk.

56
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,245
And if you need a pool man,

57
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:31,629
I have a really great guy.

58
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,795
Holy shit!

59
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,513
That's one crazy bitch!

60
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,027
You think she's gonna tell?

61
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,374
No way.

62
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,637
She'd never wanna give up
having this over me.

63
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,979
Grab the other skimmer and help me.

64
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,608
I don't think this is gonna work.

65
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,071
Marvin, I don't need your...

66
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:56,373
fucking negativity right now,
just grab the fucking pool and skim!

67
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:04,262
I will kill your boy with pain.

68
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,571
As it is, I just might have to kick him,

69
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,223
in his kidney
because you ain't here yet.

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,632
Next one goes in his fucking head.

71
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,940
I don't appreciate
being inconvenienced like that.

72
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:20,460
Now, put Marvin back
on the goddamn phone.

73
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:25,538
With or without the jewbie,

74
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,477
you and her get back here
by nine o'clock, you understand me?

75
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:31,378
Light a fire into that bitch's ass,
I'm getting crunky.

76
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,089
- Why are you so quiet?
- Why are you pointing a gun in my head?

77
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,889
I'm sorry,

78
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:48,989
friend.

79
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:55,872
Is that better?

80
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,506
No?

81
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,309
How about now?

82
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:05,849
I ain't playing, Lewis.

83
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,876
All you gotta do is snatch it.

84
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,810
You might be quicker than I think.

85
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:20,534
What happens
when you got the gun, farmer?

86
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,240
You think you can aim at me?

87
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,607
You think you got any dog in you?

88
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,068
C'mon, farmer bro'.

89
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:29,978
End this shit now!

90
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:40,719
See!

91
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:46,446
That's the shit right there that makes
me owe Marvin a fucking flat screen.

92
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,659
Can't pick up the gun!

93
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:50,058
When it counts!

94
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:53,183
Can't fuck the white bitch
when she's right in front of you!

95
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,640
We're just friends.

96
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,380
- Marvin said you kissed.
- What you want me to say, Lewis?

97
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,556
You boss in here,

98
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,083
trying to rip me off,

99
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,776
holding me hostage, trying to kill me...

100
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,703
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

101
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:09,592
You should be kissing my ass in space.

102
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:13,010
Cuz' instead of owing'em hummus-eating
motherfuckers, you only owe me.

103
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,154
Now see, Nancy's gonna
bring the weed back in,

104
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:16,846
then, we don't owe you nothing.

105
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:19,773
And I don't want nothing
to do with you after.

106
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:23,235
Now, see, now you just hurt my feelings.

107
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,142
I just wanted to know how she kisses.

108
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:31,825
She look like she kisses real sweet.

109
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,276
Cut the shit,

110
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,986
coz it's getting old real fast.

111
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,246
I tell you what.

112
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,969
I let you keep
a couple bricks of that pot,

113
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,303
if you let me fuck her...

114
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,907
on this corner...

115
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,807
right here.

116
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,167
I mean, seing that
the two of you just kissed.

117
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,522
I don't see you having
a problem with that.

118
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,345
- Shit.
- What the fuck was that?

119
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,743
What the fuck?!

120
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,903
Yo bitch, in the closet!

121
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:08,820
Open it.

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,556
Open real wide.

123
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,503
I'm gay.

124
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,306
Well?

125
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:26,146
Micro-wave wrecked everything.

126
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,913
And the stuff in the oven
just gonna stuck together in a clump.

127
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:30,802
Would you get in here and try this?

128
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,792
- What you got to smoke your weed?
- I don't know, I don't have a bowl.

129
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,640
- I'm not really a smoker.
- Seriously?

130
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,835
- Control issues.
- You got something like a can?

131
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,504
There's diet coke in the fridge,
dump it in the sink.

132
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,896
- You got root beer?
- Does it matter?

133
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,893
I like root beer, I'm thirsty.

134
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:48,341
Try the pot first, then you can
raid the fridge for whatever ou want.

135
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,136
- Hello.
- You want a plate for that?

136
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,719
Thank God, I thought
you were Shane and Andy.

137
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,504
Listen, what setting
do you think is best

138
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,485
for drying pot that's been
in a swimming-pool?

139
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,705
Are you trying to make some cash,
or something?

140
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,136
Because I don't think
this is how you do it.

141
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,577
Oh yeah, you and me,

142
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:13,626
we're doing our jobs.

143
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,572
Right.

144
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:21,828
Hey, it's the "Drugs Are Wrong" lady!

145
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,138
Hey, kids.

146
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:24,805
That's right,

147
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,587
that's me.

148
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,725
Getting recognized.

149
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,392
Drugs are wrong.

150
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,950
And you feel so right...

151
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,605
to not do them.

152
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,234
Just throw them away.

153
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,657
I'm a crusader, you know?

154
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,241
Ma'am, could you move?
You're blocking the goal.

155
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,060
Crusader.

156
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,637
Celia Hodes!

157
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:51,673
Doing it <i>pro bono</i>.

158
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,746
I'm not asking for a... accolades.

159
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,736
Bend my ankle.

160
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,067
Oh man, that's fucking awful!

161
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:05,964
It's like all harsh and no high!

162
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,860
It's wet, we fucked!

163
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,476
Common', let's go see U-Turn.

164
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,373
You said we had until 9 o'clock.

165
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,396
You will grow a new crop
between now and 9?

166
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:15,509
- Uh, uh, let's go!
- No!

167
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,130
Saying "no" to me is not a good idea.

168
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,916
Look, I think you're cool enough,
but I will hurt you!

169
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,291
I'm a thug, that's what I do!

170
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,428
- I think you need to go with him.
- No, wait!

171
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,058
I have one more idea.

172
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,374
No, listen!

173
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:31,988
Best case, we actually
show up with something,

174
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,029
worse case, you deliver me on time.

175
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:36,632
What do you got to lose?

176
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,312
I didn't bring back the right thing
from 7-Eleven once.

177
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,201
Now, I got an artificial patella.

178
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,376
- Man, I'm outta here!
- Marvin, please.

179
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,237
Give me one more chance
to make this right.

180
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:50,668
Please.

181
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,802
Shit!

182
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,268
Hello?

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,615
What? He's where?

184
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:05,186
Thank God, the... Great!

185
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,273
I'll come get him.

186
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,849
Tell him uncle Andy
is coming to get him.

187
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,797
Great, thank you so much,
thank you officer.

188
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,697
Was that a great party, or what?

189
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,636
How would you know? You spent
the whole time in the bathroom.

190
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,093
I'm sorry, honey. I was just working
some stuff out with your uncle Doug.

191
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:43,976
That's alright. You weren't even
the most embarrassing parent there.

192
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,308
Martha Strangley's mom
wasn't wearing any underwear,

193
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,780
and fell over the ottoman
while doing the cha-cha slide

194
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,179
- and everyone saw her.
- I'm sorry, I missed that.

195
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,876
- Could we make hot fudge on sundaes?
- Oh my God,

196
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,976
that's the best idea ever.

197
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,537
- Dad...
- Yeah, hon'?

198
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,459
Mom's passed out in the atrium.

199
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,298
Mom? Mom!

200
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,436
I'm a winner.

201
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,103
Hi, sweetie.

202
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,145
How was the rest of your party?

203
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,809
What the hell are you doing here, Celia?

204
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,348
I was...

205
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,045
I was wanting
to pick up a few things, but...

206
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,394
I couldn't get in,

207
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,774
alla the doors were locked.

208
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,987
That has been a real wrong day.

209
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,914
- I bet.
- Can I just...

210
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:43,432
Do you think...

211
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,575
I could take a bath?

212
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:50,749
My motel just has a shower,
and I really could use a bath.

213
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:52,824
Fine.

214
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,681
Take a bath,

215
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,348
then please, go.

216
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,362
Could you unlock
the door to the bedroom?

217
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:13,399
Son of a bitch.

218
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,866
You wanna another man's dick up
your ass, that's what you' telling me?

219
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:19,240
Well, I don't know,
I've never tried that, I just...

220
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,320
I think I've always liked... boys.

221
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,992
I thought you was in love with Nancy.

222
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,404
Now, who are we talking about, Conrad?

223
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,681
I think that was a...

224
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:30,628
Judy Garland, Joan Crawford,

225
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,025
- Sarah Jessica Parker kinda love.
- So, you're a sucker dick?

226
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:37,545
Yes, I think I would,
if there was a right dick.

227
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:38,849
Ain't no right dick!

228
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,394
All dick sized on is wrong, boy!

229
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,099
You know, you need Jesus!

230
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,803
No, I think I just need
to admit to myself what I am,

231
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:50,912
what I've always been, no matter you,
or my family, or anyone thinks.

232
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,795
So let me ask you this

233
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,314
- you ever fuck a girl?
- Excellent question.

234
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,427
Any pussy in your past?

235
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:01,537
My cousin Rishma had this friend Mita
who let me play with her nipples.

236
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,102
I found it kinda gross.

237
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,965
Yeah, some women got ugly titties.

238
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:07,849
Don't mean you're a cock smoker.

239
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,936
I got your limonade,
but I ain't add Cayenne

240
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:19,594
coz I ain't know how much...
I brought it, so you can eat it.

241
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,665
- Who's got the tuna mayo?
- Tuna mayo's mine.

242
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,888
Well, look at you.

243
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,650
Do I know you?

244
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,516
- You work for U-Turn?
- He do, now!

245
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,979
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Oh no?

246
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:36,039
Oh shit, U-Turn,
if you don't fuck him up,

247
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,158
leave that pretty face, would you?

248
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,890
- Turkey and whole wheat?
- Oh yeah, that's me.

249
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,323
- Is there mustard?
- Should be on there.

250
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,629
Clinic, let me all let you for a second.

251
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:47,673
What?

252
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,248
Get your ass over here, now !

253
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,770
What do you think they're talking about?

254
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,053
Look, I need
to get the fuck out of here.

255
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,824
I grab U-Turn and put a gun
on his head, and you need...

256
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,680
I think they're talking about me!

257
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,710
What did you say?

258
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,621
Just nothing, nothing...

259
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,636
Hurry up and finish that sandwich,

260
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,764
Clinic here, gonna take you to another
room and fuck the gay outta you.

261
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,083
- Excuse me?
- You heard me?

262
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,844
Man, hmm...

263
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,172
- I don't think it works that way.
- Clinic will make it work!

264
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,024
You sure you don't think
you're a faggot?

265
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,368
Positive. Thank you, though.

266
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,923
Ok, game is over.

267
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,485
The two of you,

268
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,267
get in that room and get busy.

269
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,580
Ok baby, put your pants off,
let's see what you got!

270
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,327
Oh God, help me!

271
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,904
And where is Conrad?

272
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,076
He's at the grow house.

273
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:48,313
- Damn, this is some good pie!
- You enjoy now,

274
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:49,988
cause if anything happens to my nephew,

275
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,522
you gonna be eaten through a tube.

276
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,570
I'm just an employee!

277
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,112
- I ain't management.
- Could you people keep it down?

278
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,886
I just got the baby asleep.

279
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,514
- Marvin?
- Vaneeta?

280
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:01,566
Holy shit, how are you doing?

281
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,297
I should have killed you
when I had a chance!

282
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:05,929
Really?

283
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:08,521
Would you have done it yourself
or hired Armenians?

284
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,864
Oh, I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

285
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,249
You fucked this up, and you know it.

286
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,977
I had it under control!

287
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,951
And then without consulting anyone,

288
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,953
completly outside the huddle,

289
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,563
you made this deal,
and that was a mistake.

290
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:29,259
Your mistake,
and you need to make it right!

291
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,699
So you need to gather up

292
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,418
all the weed in this house,

293
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,711
and we need to take it to U-Turn,
that's what the fuck I'm talking about!

294
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:44,439
You go to come in my house
and drop blame on me.

295
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:45,676
Me?

296
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,754
Oh hell no, bitch!

297
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:50,860
Get the fuck off me!

298
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,903
You think you can take me?

299
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:56,124
She fucking bit me!

300
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,793
Jesus, do something!

301
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,580
Bitch, have you lost
your goddamn mind?

302
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,496
What the fuck?

303
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,440
Fine, you're gonna kill each other!

304
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:08,104
I'll go back to U-Turn
and say the shit's gone,

305
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:11,222
and you'll keep both visit
pieces of Conrad all over the town.

306
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:12,258
I'm outta here!

307
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,084
Marv', what are you talking
about Conrad?

308
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,260
What the fuck is going on in here?

309
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,672
Oh, this is serious!

310
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:38,026
Let's go.

311
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:39,509
Let's go!

312
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:47,969
Thanks for the bath.

313
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:49,884
Sure.

314
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,315
I'm gonna go.

315
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,528
Bye.

316
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,287
<i>If you are on the road tonight,</i>

317
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,863
<i>be on a look out
for a 1972 Ford Supervan,</i>

318
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:12,074
<i>California license plate number 51SB310.</i>

319
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:14,008

320
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:19,030

321
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:31,519
Hello!

322
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,447
So you like little boys, huh?

323
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,263
What?

324
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,682
The AMBER alert? Yeah!

325
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:41,135
- He's my nephew.
- D'you hear that?

326
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,369
He abducted his own nephew.

327
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:45,910
No, no, I'm the one who called it in.

328
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,786
- What are you doing in the vehicle?
- And where is the little boy?

329
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,660
He must be tight up in the back.

330
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:55,161
- Look, he's buying chocolate milk.
- No! I like chocolate milks.

331
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm rejuvenile.

332
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,867
Yeah, the police have him.
I'm on my way to pick him up.

333
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,132
Bullshit!

334
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,932
I just saw the AMBER alert
5 minutes ago out on the highway.

335
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,177
If the police had him,
they'd have called it off.

336
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,561
That's what they do.

337
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:11,253
Maybe they forgot, I don't know.
Come! Ask them yourselves.

338
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,391
We'll do that.

339
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:14,937
Yeah, after we kicked
your pervert ass we'll do that.

340
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,094
My who?

341
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,247
Jesus!

342
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:22,273
I drove a car.

343
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,143
Yeah?

344
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,549
How far did you get?

345
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,447
About ten blocks,

346
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,884
then a cop pulled me over
for going too slow...

347
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,227
and being twelve.

348
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,113
Where were you trying to go?

349
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,457
I don't know anymore.

350
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,204
Do you think mum is gonna be mad at us?

351
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,052
I think...

352
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,149
we're all gonna be mad
at each other for a while.

353
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,261
Yeah.

354
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,520
Damn!

355
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:12,978
You look like hell.

356
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,720
Where's my drugs?

357
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:17,880
There was a little problem.

358
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,360
Some crazy bitch drown
all the shit in the swimming pool.

359
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:22,498
- Wait! Whose swimming pool?
- Mine.

360
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,683
You got a swimming pool?

361
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:26,205
With a waterfall and
a raft for her kids and everything.

362
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:29,410
- What the fuck happened?
- It's... it's a long story.

363
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:32,038
So no drugs, huh? So...

364
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,885
So you got my money instead,
that's what you say?

365
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:36,806
Here you go.

366
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,126
Game over!

367
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:41,031
- Son go home.
- I wasn't talking to you, was I?

368
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,461
Was I talking to her? No!

369
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,597
I was talking to Janet Evans, here.

370
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,160
- Where is my money?
- Heylia's paying you back

371
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,805
for the money you laid out
to the Armenians so...

372
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,703
So, she's paying your debt?

373
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,802
I'm here to pay Conrad's debt.

374
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:56,954
She can go fuck herself.

375
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,356
See, that's not gotta work for me.

376
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,816
I take cash for the white lady but...

377
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,009
I don't want no money for Conrad.

378
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:06,831
No.

379
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,017
He is the goose that lays
the golden MILF weed.

380
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,956
He's my farmer, now.

381
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:16,929
I'm gonna buy him some overalls
and a straw-hat. Yee ha!

382
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,476
Fuck this ! You just takin money...
and let's end this.

383
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,383
That's not a way to talk
to your new boss, sharecropper.

384
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,091
You'd better watch your tongue !

385
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,682
I bought your chain,

386
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:29,039
you're about to grow me some shit.

387
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,481
Are we clear?
Cause if we're not,

388
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:35,311
then, I can blow a nice big space
out your ear to your ear,

389
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,500
- maybe you'll hear me better!
- Come on, Conrad.

390
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:38,950
Let's go.

391
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,208
Looking forward to my crap.

392
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,490
I'll be in touch.

393
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,422
Where do you think you're going?

394
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:56,407
The way I see it,
you still owe me a 150 G's, lady!

395
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,086
I don't take checks.

396
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,319
What?

397
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:08,082
We're altogether, we...
we grow together.

398
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,044
Let's go, Conrad.

399
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,510
You gotta get some rest
so you can wake up tomorrow,

400
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,928
plant some weed and
work on your slave name.

401
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,363
Conrad.

402
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,008
Yeah, looks like
you don't grow with them no more.

403
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:28,787
What the fuck?

404
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,260
You had that the whole time ?

405
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,741
It ain't got no bullets.

406
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,980
What am I supposed
to do with a empty gun?

407
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,028
You okay?

408
00:21:58,232 --> 00:21:59,250
Yeah.

409
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:01,491
She is fine.

410
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,743
Cuz' she's still breathing.

411
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:08,346
She gonna give my money too.

412
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,872
Otherwise, I will come there
in her nice house,

413
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:15,629
with her pool... and her kids.

414
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:20,035
And I gonna float them all
where my weed was drown dead.

415
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:22,926
You remember where she lives,
right, Marvin?

416
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:24,472
I'm not so good with directions.

417
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,016
Fucking useless!

418
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:28,022
I'll deal with you later.

419
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,339
I'll take this
off your shoulder for you.

420
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:39,770
Nice picture.

421
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:51,079
I'm gonna leave $20 in case you run in

422
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:53,751
any kind of problems
on your way home or you need to...

423
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:56,587
stop and
get some frozen yoghurt and shit.

424
00:22:58,828 --> 00:22:59,928
There you go.

425
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:02,798
Now you just owe me...

426
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:08,415
$149 927.

427
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,688
Well, we did it, but...
if you want my professional opinon,

428
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:23,320
that boy gayed in a handbag
full of rainbows.

429
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:25,792
I see you later, U-Turn.

430
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,629
I got rid of Dana.

431
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:39,677
I am free, now.

432
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,589
Please forgive me for being so stupid.
I was a fool.

433
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,826
A fool.
I shouldn't have left you, that night.

434
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,745
And you were so brave.

435
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,557
And you're the one for me.

436
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:53,712
We can be together now.

437
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,340
I love you Celia,
I love so much.

438
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,635
Please, Celia.

439
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:10,586
Can I come in?

440
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,306
Up here to pick up Silas Botwin.

441
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:27,941
Shane as well?

442
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:29,711
What do you mean?

443
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,836
Both my chlidren are in jail.
Perfect!

444
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,636
Shane Botwin! I'm here for...

445
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:45,341
Nancy, hi. You are here.

446
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,472
Did... you two had a fight or something?

447
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,837
Yes, he hit me. Arrest him.

448
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,471
She's kidding.
Tell him you're kidding.

449
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,029
I'm kidding.
I walked into a door.

450
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:58,156
Really?

451
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:02,721
- And you, sir?
- Oh, a door.

452
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,650
Same door.

453
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:20,265
What have I done?

454
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:23,985
I love my wife! I love Dana!

455
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:26,784
This is too much!

456
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,028
She's the most wonderful woman.

457
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,133
I wrecked my life!

458
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,440
What happened?
Is everything okay?

459
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,249
She didn't say a thing
the whole ride home.

460
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,804
Mum!

461
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,961
Say something.

462
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:21,733
OK, guys,

463
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:24,583
let's get mummy some space alright?
