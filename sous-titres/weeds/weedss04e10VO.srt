3
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,483
- I have to go.
- Can't you stay?

4
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,653
I have a breakfast meeting
in another country.

5
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,001
Go back to sleep.

6
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,617
Maybe I can push my meeting.

7
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,670
My kids will be up soon.

8
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:25,799
Can't really push my meeting.

9
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:29,912
I'll call you later.

10
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:31,253
Okay?

11
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:48,012
That smells so good!

12
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,341
Pharmaceutical or street drugs?

13
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,452
Both.
Mostly Xanax and Coke.

14
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:58,384
We got a Heroin detox in room 603
and meth in 412.

15
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,457
Good luck to you.

16
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,376
What's going on?

17
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:10,048
Your family and friends
love you

18
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:12,427
and are very concerned about you.

19
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:14,470
Now, there's no reason to be scared.

20
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,108
We are all here
to help you.

21
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,099
Who the fuck are you?

22
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,001
My name is Lee Milne,

23
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:25,064
and I'm a family intervention
specialist.

24
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:31,629
Jesus.

25
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,471
You are fucking
kidding me!

26
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:38,534
- Unlock this shit now!
- Those are mine. Aren't they cute?

27
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:41,369
This initial reaction
is quite normal.

28
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,021
- Fuck you.
- It's for your own good, Celia.

29
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,174
You've become a danger
to yourself and others.

30
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:49,506
It's such an unexpected pleasure
to see you, loser.

31
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,424
Honey, honey.

32
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,298
Uncuff me, baby.

33
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,304
I'll give you a cookie.

34
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:59,682
- Hold firm.
- Pam, do something.

35
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:03,144
- Why don't we start with you, Pamela?
- Oh, right.

36
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:05,814
"Dear, Celia.

37
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,608
"Since you began abusing drugs,
our friendship has changed."

38
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:09,996
Hey, on TV,

39
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,946
they don't handcuff people
for their interventions.

40
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,322
"I miss the old Celia,

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,575
"who bettered the community
through her work on city council,

42
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:19,531
"who crusaded tirelessly

43
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,639
"to keep children off drugs,

44
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,257
"and who created excellent distractions,

45
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,417
"so I could shoplift at Forever 21.

46
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,294
"I miss that Celia.

47
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,465
"She was my best friend.

48
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:32,494
"Please get help today."

49
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:33,977
Fuck.

50
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,719
You scan the price,

51
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,116
then hit return, tax,

52
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:40,807
total. Got it?

53
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,892
Yeah, I know. I can scan shit.

54
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,592
She worked at JCPenney's.

55
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:49,065
I was almost floor manager
till I met this pimp named Silky.

56
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,192
Well, thank you for doing this.

57
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:52,591
Hey, I get it.

58
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,488
Gotta go with who you know so you don't
get ass-raped, business-wise.

59
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:00,827
That baby's just gonna tip you over!
Hello, baby!

60
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,676
Fuck back, bitch!
Don't you touch my child!

61
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,373
- Clinique.
- What?

62
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:08,290
People like it
when you treat 'em like shit.

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,269
She gonna come back
and buy a blouse.

64
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,464
Nancy, I need to get going.
Jimmy Jam has kindermusik in 40 minutes.

65
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:15,908
Let's get you going.

66
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:22,121
This is Ignacio.

67
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,725
- Ignacio, this is Sanjay.
- And Jimmy Jam.

68
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,604
Say hello, Jimmy.

69
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,221
<i>El Diablo.</i>

70
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:36,529
Okay, time to go.
Say goodbye to Jimmy Jam.

71
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:38,429
Did he just call my baby Satan?

72
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,909
'Cause I gotta be honest,
sometimes I have the same thought.

73
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,785
Your baby isn't Satan.

74
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:45,072
He projectile vomits,
and once, it was blue.

75
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,174
<i>El Diablo.</i>

76
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,792
He probably just ate blue jello
or a Thomas train.

77
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,166
He'll be fine.
Go sing with him.

78
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,298
- What are these?
- Snacks.

79
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,217
Heavy snacks.

80
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,053
We're very hungry. Back the fuck up.

81
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:03,760
<i>Hey, carnal.</i>

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,445
<i>Hola.</i>

83
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,439
This is my cousin Amparo.

84
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:12,674
Amparo.

85
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,610
She going to massage school
in San Bernardino.

86
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,237
I'll see you
on the way back down, <i>Blanca</i>.

87
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,045
He comes
from a broken home.

88
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,504
A lot of anger
from childhood.

89
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,097
Like he's special.

90
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,101
- I want rotelli.
- I'm not a short-order cook.

91
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,186
You're a sucky babysitter.

92
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:51,771
Less talk, more eat.

93
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,483
My mom still loves my dad, you know.

94
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:56,538
Oh, yeah?

95
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,654
They talk to each other
on the phone all the time.

96
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,963
She usually calls him
after you leave

97
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:04,150
to talk about adult stuff.

98
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,415
That's me,

99
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,216
that's him, and that's you.

100
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,754
I do that and you do that
and he does that?

101
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,298
Unless you do that and I do that.

102
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,032
I'm the only one who can do that.

103
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:24,053
Unless we use one of those,
but I don't know where we'd get that.

104
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,723
- We could use a...
- Mom!

105
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,059
Shane.

106
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,219
Two...

107
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,399
pierced strangers.

108
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,618
- I'm Simone.
- I'm Harmony.

109
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,237
We're working on a science project.

110
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,823
- For science.
- About volcanoes.

111
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:44,907
And wind.

112
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,389
Are you okay?

113
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,048
Migraine.

114
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:03,843
I bought...

115
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,133
medicine.

116
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,275
My mom says you dress like a prostitute.

117
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,535
- Shut up.
- That's what she said.

118
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:23,374
Why are you here?

119
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,407
My mom's at a custody mediation
in Ventura with my dad.

120
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,225
He wants me weekends.

121
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:32,789
- They still love each other.
- Oh, no kidding.

122
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,564
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I heard.

123
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,024
I'm going out tonight.

124
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,221
Can you make sure Shane
and his two...

125
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,346
lab assistants...

126
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,164
don't trash the house?

127
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,598
You mean do your job?

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,995
Yes,

129
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,768
only better.

130
00:07:57,064 --> 00:08:00,401
Ladies whose names
are escaping me right now,

131
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,671
I assume your parents
are coming to pick you up?

132
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,486
Okay, nice meeting you.

133
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,242
Go, science.

134
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,264
- When's she leaving?
- Soon.

135
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,963
I told my mom
I was staying at your house.

136
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,843
- I told my mom I was staying at yours.
- Awesome.

137
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,712
Wait.
Is my mom with your mom?

138
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:25,007
My mom's doing her Landmark Forum summit
at a hotel by the airport.

139
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,218
Like a self-improvement pyramid scheme.

140
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,994
My mom's in Borrego conducting
a sound bath in a biospheric dome.

141
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,103
It's like a sonic-healing session.

142
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:36,021
My mom's probably going
on a date with a drug kingpin.

143
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,645
He's like the mayor of Tijuana.

144
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,531
I know just how you feel...

145
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,119
dead inside.

146
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:52,924
Oh, shit.

147
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,821
Hey, somebody here
wants to talk to you, buddy.

148
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,548
- Señor Doug?
<i>- Mermex?</i>

149
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,176
- Is that really you?
- It's Maria.

150
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:09,940
Maria!
That's what I meant!

151
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:14,974
So, how are you doing?

152
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,101
I'm good.

153
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,576
- How are you?
- Good!

154
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,132
Good!

155
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,528
What are you guys up to?

156
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,016
Standing on the street.

157
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,265
It's sunny.

158
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,353
Yeah, yeah,
it's sunny here, too.

159
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,187
- Is Andy there?
- Uh, yes.

160
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:41,934
<i>Cool.</i>

161
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,185
Could I talk to him, please?

162
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,135
- Is it really her?
<i>- It's her.</i>

163
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:54,347
The bartender's cousin's nephew
used to date her friend.

164
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,099
- She didn't get fat, did she?
- No, she's beautiful.

165
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:00,102
- She's holding your flip-flop.
- She kept my flip-flop?!

166
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:02,104
She kept your flip-flop.

167
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:08,060
Border patrol's working my sector today,
but the coast should be clear tomorrow.

168
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,364
Bring her to me, man.
Bring her home to Daddy.

169
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,983
Done, big guy.

170
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,072
<i>Hi, it's Lisa.
Leave me a message.</i>

171
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,003
So, you'd sit facing me.

172
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:38,853
With my butt in his face?

173
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,394
I don't think so.
I think I'm on my side.

174
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:42,687
The camera.

175
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,340
Strike a pose, Harm.

176
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,986
I think we're gonna need some water.

177
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,238
- I'll be right back.
- You have vitamin water?

178
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:53,656
Something like that?

179
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,492
- Reddrox? Green tea?
- Something with electrolytes.

180
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,165
I'll check.

181
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,042
Do not wake this little fucker up.
I just got him down.

182
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:07,753
They really want to have sex.

183
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,257
- Both of them? With you?
- Yeah, with me. They dig me.

184
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,413
Then what's your faggy ass doing here?

185
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,470
- Can't get it up?
- Oh, it's up.

186
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:18,180
But I'm freaking out. I mean...

187
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:19,434
what do I do?

188
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,559
Do I have sex with both
at the same time?

189
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:25,062
Unless you've grown an extra dick,
I don't think that's gonna be possible.

190
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,486
Go figure it out.

191
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:28,858
Use condoms.

192
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:30,955
They're in the desk drawer.

193
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,367
If you don't wanna do it,
you don't have to.

194
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,869
I wanna do it.

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,800
Then go do it.

196
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,587
Don't bring shame on the family.

197
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,786
Five bucks says he pusses out.

198
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:20,623
What?

199
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,091
What's wrong?

200
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:25,495
Migraine, I think.

201
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,416
I took something.

202
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:29,011
I guess it wore off.

203
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:30,938
Come sit.

204
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,952
I swear I'm not trying
to get out of sex.

205
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,556
No, of course not.
No one tries to get out of sex with me.

206
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,462
You've never had this before?

207
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,094
Come on. Lay down.

208
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,008
All right.

209
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,114
I have more pills in my purse.
Could you get them, please?

210
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,826
Pills are not gonna help.

211
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,355
This is stress.

212
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,100
You have too much stress now.

213
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,371
I just need more Excedrin.

214
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:12,002
No, the headache is merely a symptom.

215
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,225
I know a man

216
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,967
with an unconventional medicine.

217
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,754
It will help you.

218
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,916
And I'll take care of you
every step of the way.

219
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:25,933
Do you trust me?

220
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,446
I trust you.

221
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:41,740
Good.

222
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:49,915
"And you have ruined
the best years of your life and mine.

223
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,146
"You can't have your family back.

224
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,586
"You can't have me back.

225
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:57,562
"But there is still one person
you can have back.

226
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:01,594
"Do you know who that person is?
That person is..."

227
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,477
How dare any of you judge me!

228
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:11,615
- Fuck!
- You!

229
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,008
You with your low-testosterone,

230
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,942
hump-shouldered victim shit!

231
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,642
You are the reason I started drinking
in the first place!

232
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,907
And you.
You and your sister

233
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,136
sucked me dry.

234
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,681
Want, need, demand...

235
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,497
a constant drain!

236
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:33,524
Who could resist
a little capsule-shaped escape?

237
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:36,170
And you...
I don't even know why you're here.

238
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,923
You're my bitch. I use you,
and you're too stupid to realize it...

239
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,884
I realize it!
But I don't care.

240
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,691
Will she still be fun when she's sober?

241
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,754
- This is pointless.
- It's your turn, Isabel.

242
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,237
Give me...

243
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,322
the... fucking...

244
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:52,591
key!

245
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:01,849
"You put me on liquid diets

246
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,648
"and snuck laxatives

247
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,699
"into my chocolate stash.

248
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:09,036
"You made me do ultra tae bo
when I was 6.

249
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,851
"You told me I would never be loved

250
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,374
"when I was fat."

251
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:14,916
What's your point?

252
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,003
"You instilled in me the same things
your mother instilled in you:

253
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,630
"deep anger, distrust,

254
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:22,688
"and self-loathing.

255
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:26,387
"But at least back then
you gave a shit.

256
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,000
"Now you're just a zombie."

257
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,485
If you don't deal with this,

258
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,775
I will call your mother.

259
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:45,631
Is it tea?

260
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,661
It's ayahuasca.

261
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,479
Made from plants
from the Amazon rainforest.

262
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:53,815
Kucho will take care of us.

263
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:56,184
I drink it when I need healing,

264
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:57,598
clarity.

265
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,966
I drink it to learn.

266
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,804
It's magic.

267
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,698
Peyote magic?

268
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,160
Like hallucinogenic magic?

269
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:08,408
No, peyote is a bicycle.

270
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,373
Ayahuasca's a rocket ship.

271
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:13,468
Like 30 years of psychotherapy
in one night.

272
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,638
But I only have a headache.

273
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:20,508
You have a tightly wound knot
in your soul.

274
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:22,775
This will unwind it.

275
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,602
- What's wrong? What did he say?
- Nothing's wrong.

276
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:23,003
Everything's okay.

277
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:24,795
Drink.

278
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:32,465
Go ahead, drink.

279
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,851
<i>You know. You know. You know.</i>

280
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:49,657
<i>No more hiding.</i>

281
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,178
<i>No more hiding.</i>

282
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:05,706
<i>It's out.</i>

283
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:23,850
Hi. I am so sorry.

284
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,092
After the mediation,
Henry and I went out for dinner.

285
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,910
You went out with your ex-husband?
I'm here babysitting your insomniac son.

286
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,861
Silas, you don't understand.

287
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,407
- Life gets a little more complicated...
- Did you fuck him?

288
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,848
- Do you want the truth?
- Yes, I want the truth.

289
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:52,147
The truth is in 10 years,
I'm gonna be almost 50,

290
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,856
and you won't even be 30.

291
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:59,184
The truth is that you and I
have a lot of fun right now,

292
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:01,913
and neither one of us
wants that to end...

293
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,531
right?

294
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,740
Do you want me to go?

295
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,616
You made him rotelli?

296
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,378
Penne.

297
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,599
And, no...

298
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,247
I don't want you to go.

299
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,379
No, I'm good. I got it covered. Go.

300
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,449
- You sure?
- Yeah, go, go, go.

301
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:56,820
I'm on the job.

302
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,051
Never fear. Doug is here.

303
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,350
I'm gonna go troll the gym
for some strange.

304
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:04,325
America first.

305
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,737
America first!

306
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,779
The cat's away.
Bring me my baby.

307
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,329
You're as beautiful as I remember.

308
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,664
And you are as tall as I remember.

309
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:46,701
And you are very handsome!

310
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,519
Andy, what's he doing?!

311
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:53,374
- Thinks it's part of the protocol.
- Tell him to fuck off.

312
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,409
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

313
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,818
Come on. <i>Andale!</i>

314
00:21:58,627 --> 00:21:59,876
Look at you!

315
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:01,849
Come on. Come on.

316
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:06,487
You're gonna love this country...
the land of freedom and opportunity.

317
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:07,922
And...

318
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,858
And... air-conditioning.

319
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,836
You like that?

320
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,781
That's the cool breeze of freedom
right there.

321
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:36,817
How are you feeling?

322
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,317
No headaches.

323
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,783
No pain ever again.

324
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,036
Not if I can help it.

325
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,985
You just relax now, okay?

326
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,735
Soon you can get up
and take a nice, long bath.

327
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:57,705
There's plenty of food for us
in the kitchen.

328
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:00,775
Did I make everything better?

329
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,452
You think I'm an idiot, Wilson?

330
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,242
Double-crossing,
anti-American piece of shit!

331
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,424
Cornholing your way
into our good graces?

332
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,559
You got it wrong.
I'm rounding them up.

333
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,428
Rounding them up with hugs?

334
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:23,195
Love knows no borders, man.

335
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,266
Come here.

336
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,134
You see this girl here?

337
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,665
This is the love of his life.

338
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,906
She's the woman he's gonna marry.

339
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:34,241
Rushing things a bit. Be cool.

340
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:35,910
You break my heart.

341
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:37,452
I let you in,

342
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,246
and you shit on my face.

343
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:40,915
Look, Tex,

344
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,875
I bet you would risk life and limb

345
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:46,720
for your steroid-pumped snow white.

346
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:48,656
You told him about Hope?

347
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:54,462
Look, pal, this is my Hope.

348
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,668
This is Desert Eagle.

349
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,773
We got <i>mojados</i> in sector five.

350
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,176
I repeat... <i>Mojados</i> in sector five.

351
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:14,091
You got five minutes
before the border patrol gets here.

352
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,283
I never want to see your face again.

353
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,057
Thank you. Thank you.

354
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:21,021
Wait.

355
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,571
Give me one...

356
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:24,590
just so my day's not a total loss.

357
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,633
"Give you one"?

358
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:27,928
These are people.

359
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,429
Just give him the guy who hugged me.
He's annoying.

360
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:34,154
<i>Yo, hombre.
Rapido.</i> Let's go.

361
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,170
You, come on.
Let's go. Out.

362
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:44,774
Now get the fuck outta here.

363
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,395
Let's go, Andy, come on.

364
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:01,252
You wanna take a walk or something?

365
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:02,706
Come on.

366
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,502
Come on.

367
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:09,203
Sure, why not?

368
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:17,244
I'm a fucking liar.

369
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:19,079
I was a bad coyote.

370
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:21,415
I lie to myself all the time.

371
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:24,752
I let Doug sacrifice one of my people.
He did it for love, but...

372
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:27,689
I negotiate things
that shouldn't be up for debate.

373
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,191
I make little compromises
with myself.

374
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,359
And why don't I have a girlfriend?

375
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:35,063
I tell myself I'm not doing harm
when I am.

376
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,110
I so am!

377
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,958
I want a girlfriend.

378
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:41,070
I mean, I'm a good guy.

379
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,309
I'm cute.

380
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,472
Am I too old for a girlfriend?

381
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,375
Nancy, has my window
of opportunity closed?

382
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,445
Is my window shut, Nance?

383
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:54,548
- How did you open your own window?
- Do you see her?

384
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:56,283
Who?

385
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:57,585
There.

386
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,387
Do you see her?

387
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:04,124
- See... see who?
- There!

388
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,263
There's no one there.

389
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,685
Right.

390
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,139
Of course not.
