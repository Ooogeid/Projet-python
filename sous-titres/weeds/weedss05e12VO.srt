<i>Previously on </i>Weeds...

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,724
- Get down!
- Mom.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,385
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,763
- Shane, you got shot.
- I'm okay.

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:15,640
I fucked up my kids.

6
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:19,185
- Who's that?
- This is Adelita.

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:20,769
Our stepsister.

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,083
Hey, Adelita.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,440
- I hear Silas tried to hit on her.
- Why is that so funny?

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,236
He's not exactly in her division.

11
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,208
Weed. I need a steady supply.

12
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,366
And I'm not talking nickel
and dime bags here.

13
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,825
She squeezed me out.
I was gonna be a drug kingpin.

14
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,329
You two idiots want
to get back at mom, right?

15
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,790
All right, then.
Let's do this right.

16
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,668
- What's that?
- I filled out all the forms

17
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,212
to put Esteban's name
on the birth certificate.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,812
Do you have... a plan?

19
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,338
Maybe call a girl
who calls me on my shit.

20
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:55,925
- You're a frozen margarita, Andy.
- Why did you go out with me?

21
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,540
I'm fascinated by how all this is gonna
play out with the gangster baby-daddy.

22
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:05,089
The people have spoken.
They support Esteban Reyes for governor.

23
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,566
Look at him.
That's what he's meant to be doing.

By the Fumistes team.
lesfumistes[at]gmail.com

26
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:37,088
Are you drinking?

27
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,280
Yes, Shane, I am drinking.

28
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,100
I've been drinking all night.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,728
- Can't seem to get drunk.
- Why?

30
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:47,204
Don't know. Not for lack of effort.
I can tell you that.

31
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,901
Why have you been
drinking all night?

32
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,057
Because that's what I do
when my husband...

33
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,531
God, it feels weird to say that.

34
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,549
I'm drinking because

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,559
they took him away in handcuffs

36
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:03,524
and I'm waiting for Cesar
to find out who "they" are,

37
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,338
where he is, why his phone is off,

38
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,419
and whether or not
I'm a widow... again.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,255
Which of his many crimes
did they arrest him for?

40
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,845
I don't know.

41
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,342
Do you think Pilar set him up?

42
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,095
I don't know.
They just took him away.

43
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,198
About fucking time.

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,898
Don't you ever wish
that you could go back

45
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:33,903
to right after dad died
and do things differently?

46
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,113
I try not to think about it.

47
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,394
I think about it a lot.

48
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:51,151
Okay.

49
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,761
I'm coming now.

50
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,758
I'll fucking GPS it, Cesar.

51
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,811
The <i>polícia judicial</i>
are holding him.

52
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,343
Should you be driving?

53
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:04,567
Probably not.

54
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,710
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

55
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,320
Seriously, mom, you're losing it.

56
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,277
Au contraire... I'm on top.

57
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,059
And I am staying on top this time,

58
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,685
like Nancy.

59
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,646
In fact,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,333
I'm gonna out-Nancy Nancy.

61
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,610
Is that why you're dressed
like a prostitute?

62
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,697
See, Nancy had the right idea.

63
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:38,217
Life is not about
making good choices

64
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,313
in order to get good things.

65
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,078
Life is about admitting
what you want

66
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,723
and not being afraid to take it.

67
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,643
So... I'm off to meet my connection,

68
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:52,748
swap this cheddar
for some heady nuggets,

69
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,378
and then perhaps I'll eat a salad

70
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,653
and get my sapphic freak on.

71
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,114
I actually threw up
into my nose that time.

72
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,347
Well, you know, throwing up
is slimming down.

73
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,934
Wait! Before you go,
there was a detective,

74
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,084
downstairs, asking about you.

75
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:15,171
A black guy...
Brown fedora, leather jacket.

76
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,673
Mentioned your name,
flashed a badge.

77
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,092
Maybe he thinks
you're turning tricks.

78
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,034
Yeah. Maybe.

79
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,790
Have fun with the whole Nancy envy
and the drug deal

80
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:33,135
and the taking and the wanting
and the not being afraid.

81
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,901
No consequences, no regrets.

82
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,257
Have you seen yourself
in that dress?

83
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:42,189
One regret.

84
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,748
One big-haired, big-boned,

85
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,036
big loudmouthed regret.

86
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:58,254
Some idiot is standing
in front of the car.

87
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,307
That's no idiot, that's my...

88
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,347
Actually, you're right.

89
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,642
I was parking.

90
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,816
When you were pulling away,
I was all, "Hey, Nance!"

91
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,254
but you couldn't hear me,
so I started running,

92
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,191
which is harder than it looks.

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,906
- Should I keep driving?
- Yeah, sure.

94
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:19,365
On a bit of a buzz here...
Adrenaline rush or...

95
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,741
anticipation.

96
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:23,989
I'm a man on a mission, Nance.

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,723
I'm a man with a plan.

98
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:30,788
"What could that plan be?"
she asks herself,

99
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:34,657
intrigued, yes,
perhaps even captivated by the...

100
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,504
Shut... up!

101
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,053
- Okay, here goes.
- You never listen.

102
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,889
- I'm trying to tell you something...
- You're like a child yanking...

103
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,483
... that's happening in my life.

104
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,949
Major life event for Andy?
You going to Candy Mountain?

105
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,853
It doesn't always
have to be about you.

106
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:58,226
- Today it does. Today it's ...
- There are other people in the world.

107
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,542
- You don't even ask.
- People with lives of their own...

108
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,763
"Hey, where are you going?
Why so serious?

109
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,323
- "Something bothering you?"
- Something's always bothering you.

110
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,543
My husband...
God, that sounds weird!

111
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,747
... is being held somewhere
by somebody for some reason.

112
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:11,987
Okay, that's Major.

113
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,915
I kind of don't know
if I'm ever gonna see him again,

114
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,791

if my children are safe,

115
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:18,668
what's happening in my life,

116
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:21,949
so I kind of don't give a shit
about your shenanigans.

117
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,989
"Shenanigans" is a bit rough.

118
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,708
Sorry about Esteban.

119
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,342
I'm sure he'll be okay.
He's too big to fail.

120
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,714
I'm sorry I shenanigan'ed
your Major life event.

121
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,772
What is it?

122
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,188
- I'm going to Candy Mountain.
- Come on.

123
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,402
I'll tell you later.

124
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,107
You just made a huge deal about it...
Mission, running, mystery.

125
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,908
- No, it's nothing, really.
- Spill it.

126
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,234
I'm gonna ask Audra to marry me.

127
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,155
I want to give her
my mom's engagement ring,

128
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,028
the ring that Judah gave you.

129
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,732
So, can I have it?

130
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,477
What's with the lockdown?
The suited ogres won't let me leave.

131
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,475
Ask your mother.
She gave orders.

132
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,068
Yeah, she does that.

133
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:19,730
Made a mess of my plans.

134
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,737
She does that, too.

135
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,266
I was gonna go jogging.

136
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,239
Jogging.

137
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,418
It helps me... clear my mind.

138
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,245
Clear your mind of what?

139
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,760
Don't be so serious
about everything.

140
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,162
Since I can't leave,

141
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,927
some friends are coming over
for a little party.

142
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:48,707
You should join us.

143
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,392
Hang out, loosen up...

144
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,056
Clear your mind.

145
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:57,888
Cool.

146
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,048
But...

147
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,400
You might want to change
your clothes.

148
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,915
He is in this building.

149
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:22,418
I will find out why.
You will wait here.

150
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,836
I'm going with you.

151
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,922
It's better for me to go alone.

152
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,174
The local color is not white.

153
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,293
Okay, I found <i>Siempre Mujer</i>,

154
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,453
<i>TV y Novelas</i>,

155
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,854
and, for the rare
English-speaking customer,

156
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,975
<i>Woman's You-Niverse</i>, from July 1974.

157
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,115
"I was frigid.
Now hear me roar."

158
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,041
"The diet that makes you
grow younger. "

159
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,866
"Is bisexuality thinkable?"

160
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,325
Can I please have the ring?
I know it's bad timing.

161
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,919
I'm still processing,

162
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:00,349
and, yes,
this is incredibly bad timing.

163
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,291
It was Bubbie's.

164
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,211
It went to my father, to my mother,
to Judah, and then to you.

165
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,547
It has history.
It has meaning.

166
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,544
It's free.

167
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,855
- "Are you truly in love?"
- Yes, without a doubt.

168
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,762
I'm not asking. I'm reading aloud.
Magazine quiz.

169
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:17,848
You never even wear it.

170
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,516
Judah gave it to me.

171
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,393
Eh, and Esteban gave you a new one.

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,399
We must go to the sixth floor,
speak with a registration clerk.

173
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,567
Let's go.

174
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,193
We need a pass.

175
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,696
- Where do we get a pass?
- We get a number.

176
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,364
What number did we get?

177
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,782
167.

178
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:41,796
Here.

179
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,043
Buy a better number.

180
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,394
Let's do the "truly in love" quiz...

181
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,884
Winner take all,
and by "all," I mean that ring.

182
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,912
Quizzes are bullshit.

183
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:57,804
And it's 1974.

184
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:01,444
Do the criteria for amor
ever really change

185
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,937
or are you just worried
that my love for Audra

186
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,138
is like a red, red rose?

187
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,642
- Question number one.
- Bring it on!

188
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,253
"When you're away from your love
and you think of him,

189
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:18,176
do you feel...
'a,' joyful, 'b,' sad,

190
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,702
'c,' lonely, or, 'd,' horny?"

191
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,965
You smell like... You won.

192
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,885
Perro Insano always triumphs!

193
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,264
You were defeated by El Conductor
on two separate occasions.

194
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:45,978
No more autograph for you.

195
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,446
Get out of here!

196
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,943
How does this work?

197
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,868
Leave your bag of money.
Take my bag of weed.

198
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,458
Simple enough.

199
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,384
Where you going?

200
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,502
Wrong wrestler.

201
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,754
I know where you live, bitch!

202
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:15,757
Question 27.

203
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:18,138
"Friendship in true love is...

204
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:21,101
"an overblown concept,
a fundamental concept,

205
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,431
a waste of time, a bonus?"

206
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,018
I'm glad you asked that.

207
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,353
This would go a lot faster
if you'd answer the questions.

208
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,896
I do answer the questions.

209
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,088
You discuss.

210
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,067
It's fricking multiple choice.

211
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,820
I feel there are certain nuances
that merit examination.

212
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,205
- Here we go.
- What?

213
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,198
- This.
- You and Esteban aren't friends?

214
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,328
- We're friends, I guess.
- You don't know.

215
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,392
You don't think it's important?
'Cause I think it's fundamental.

216
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,376
- It was one of the fucking choices.
- Friends and lovers can watch a movie,

217
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,783
- play cards, dominoes.
- Sit in the dark and not talk?

218
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:54,473
Otherwise, it's just about sex.

219
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:56,451
It's always about sex with you.

220
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,092
- That's not... That's not fair.
- You spent a few days banging her,

221
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:02,306
- now you think you got to get married.
- I don't think that. I'm gonna do it.

222
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,834
- When?
- Tomorrow!

223
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,809
That's why I want the ring.

224
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,212
Tomorrow.

225
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:16,068
Jesus, Andy, you just... I mean...

226
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,360
- You're not in love with this person.
- What if I am?

227
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,777
What if this is my shot
for a nice, normal life

228
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:25,285
with a doctor
and a family of my own?

229
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,964
It's me. I need help.

230
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:36,419
- <i>I'm hanging up now.</i>
- No! Wait!

231
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,256
The cops are after me.

232
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:40,825
<i>It's not safe to use my cellphone.</i>

233
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,970
<i>I've had way too much caffeine,
and now I have to piss like a racehorse.</i>

234
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:47,224
I don't know how you drank those lattes
and didn't wet yourself.

235
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,466
Goodbye, Celia.

236
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:51,617
No, just... Just tell me...

237
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,294
Where do I hide out
when the heat is on?

238
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,769
Do I go home? Do I motel?

239
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,277
Mexico?

240
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,738
Can't really recommend Mexico
at the moment.

241
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,324
I'm not going back to the slammer.

242
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,993
Would you say friendship
is a fundamental part of true love?

243
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
What?

244
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:12,124
<i>If you want my help,
answer the fucking question.</i>

245
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,718
Wrong answer. Have fun in jail.

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,266
What's going on?

247
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,601
Esteban is not on this floor.

248
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,645
You said six. This is six.

249
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,273
We must go up to 11,
criminal division.

250
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,607
Is he under arrest?

251
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,984
Held for questioning.

252
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:42,455
Questioning...
Might be a ray of sunshine there.

253
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,730
If we squint.

254
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:47,993
Are you from L.A.?

255
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,537
North of there, actually.

256
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:52,998
Like Malibu?

257
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:54,424
Like Agrestic.

258
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,370
Where did you prep?

259
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,609
Agrestic... High.

260
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,633
Public institution of learning,
cabrón.

261
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,886
There's nothing wrong
with public schools.

262
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,804
Then why did your dad
send you to Dana Hall?

263
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,100
So she wouldn't get boned
by public dick, cabrón.

264
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,459
I'm just playing, Adelita.

265
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,449
You want to smoke?

266
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,451
- I'll smoke some weed.
- All out.

267
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,996
But I do have
some delightful heroin.

268
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,050
Number 43.

269
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,473
"What is the glue

270
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:43,710
that holds your relationship
together for life?"

271
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:47,746
I don't even need to hear the choices.
I'm gonna go with Elmer's.

272
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,881
Glib, and not a choice.

273
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:53,112
Love is a choice,
a choice that I'm making.

274
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,310
And now you'll tell me why.

275
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,022
'Cause I believe that true love
can overcome any problem.

276
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,151
That's fairy-tale stuff,

277
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:02,943
not real life.

278
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,411
All I know is...

279
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,160
Audra makes me feel like
every other woman in my life

280
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,991
was wrong, a mistake.

281
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,703
How about Judah?
Was he a mistake?

282
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:17,290
There are different loves and marriages,
and they're not ranked.

283
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,293
I have been married for 27 years.

284
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,991
We have three beautiful children

285
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,478
and a deep, abiding love,

286
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,502
but our glue's made from sharing,

287
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,205
connecting, communicating,

288
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,848
and I never bring my work home.

289
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:59,630
The jungle fuzz!
Shit! Fuck!

290
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,083
I should be hiding.

291
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:03,654
Good idea.

292
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,719
That's a fucking hard door, man.

293
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,982
We're talking about my husband.
I am trying to find...

294
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,671


295
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,437


296
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,958


297
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,740
We're told that you have him back there.
Can you just...

298
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:33,742


299
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,285


300
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,412


301
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:40,924


302
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:42,250
My husband!

303
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,879
The father of my child!

304
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:46,338
We have a baby!

305
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,215
{\Keep talking to me in English.
It's obviously getting you somewhere.}

306
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,009
I need you to help me.

307
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,473
I want to talk to somebody
who speaks english.

308
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,559
I want to talk to somebody
who speaks english!

309
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,436
Let me deal with this.
Go sit down.

310
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,688
Getting angry is not going to help.

311
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,608


312
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,174


313
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,738


314
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:16,284


315
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,003
You ever want to go back
and do things differently?

316
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,664
Yeah, I want to teleport to 1974.

317
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,429
"What to wear to an orgy. "

318
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,694
Apparently,
the presence of underwear

319
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,740
signals your desired level
of participation.

320
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,309
You've moved on from your lame quiz?

321
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm not giving up on that.
I'm totally kicking your ass.

322
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,929
- Read.
- Number 65.

323
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,682
"At our core, the search
for true love is driven by...

324
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,554
"passion, need for sex,

325
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,329
"need for financial
and emotional support,

326
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,495
"or, 'd'...

327
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,746
"the basic human need
to feel connected

328
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,916
and leave the prison of aloneness?"

329
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:16,756
These fucking dicks are still here?

330
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,845
My thoughts exactly.

331
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,308
They smoked heroin.

332
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,394
You smoked heroin?

333
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,971
Nope to dope and ugh to drugs...

334
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,817
Deputy dog.
I took it to heart.

335
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,610
Except for weed.

336
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:38,762
Her friends suck.

337
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,289
She kind of sucks.

338
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,709
There are two more
just like her in France

339
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,165
who could drop by at anytime.

340
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,856
The potential for douchebag party buds
is exponential.

341
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,276
- Want some?
- Why not?

342
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,620
Here's to this thing we're doing now

343
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,818
here in this ridiculous place.

344
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:11,976
Thanks...

345
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,360
For not leaving.
I know you could have.

346
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:19,991
I'm actually leaving tomorrow.

347
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:21,075
Shut up.

348
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,873
Will you look at this shit?

349
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,960
Should we do something?
She's totally out of it.

350
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,934
Apparently, these are the guys
her dad wants her to fuck, so...

351
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,176
Oh, shit.

352
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,015
Don't tell anyone I was noble.

353
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:48,770
Come on! Let's go!

354
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:50,939
Party's over. Out.

355
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,107
Get up!

356
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:53,636
Out!

357
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,778
Don't worry, Agrestic?

358
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,780
Back of the line, public.

359
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,665
Shit.

360
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,792
Why are you still here?

361
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,331
Run, dummy.

362
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:20,051
Badass motherfucker!

363
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,511
Summer school.

364
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,406
The results are in.

365
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,241
Goodie.

366
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,704
Me... 89!

367
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:37,077
"You understand what love is
and are truly in love!"

368
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,570
That's nice.

369
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,349
Guess they didn't count
your orgy fixation against you.

370
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,737
I guess not.
Nancy Bot...

371
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,220
Yikes... 62.

372
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:48,037
Bullshit!

373
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:49,409
"Don't feel bad.

374
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:50,873
"You still have the chance

375
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,248
"to reexamine your priorities
and understanding of love

376
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,518
to make a positive change
in your life. "

377
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:56,921
Or I could kill myself.

378
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:01,384
Look, it's a silly quiz, you know?
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

379
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,095
Obviously.

380
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,306
For you, I mean.
For me, it's pretty accurate.

381
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,019
- Because you're truly in love.
- Truly in love. That's right.

382
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,313
For now.

383
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,403
Why do you have to do that?

384
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,631
I know you.
This is what you do.

385
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:24,645
You love to be loved.
You pull all this love in.

386
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,382
You build it all up in your head.

387
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:30,371
And when it gets too close, you run.

388
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:37,545
I just want the ring, Nance.
Spare me all the brilliant insight.

389
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,619
You're not gonna give it to me.

390
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:54,270
You cannot get it together to treat me
like somebody you actually care about.

391
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,664
That's not it.

392
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,231
You're a fucking coward.

393
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,686
Do you know that?

394
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:01,778
You think that all this crazy shit
you get into makes you brave,

395
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:06,647
but you're fucking terrified
of being ordinary.

396
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,773
I would love...
To be ordinary.

397
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,667
I would love to be back in Agrestic
waiting for Judah to come home.

398
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,127
You burned that town
to the ground and your house.

399
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,011
- Yeah, I did that.
- You did that.

400
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,345
I made some sacrifices
for my family. Fine.

401
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:26,302
What you sacrificed was your family.
That's what you did.

402
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:27,796
Look where you are.

403
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:30,807
Are you watching Shane play soccer?
No, 'cause you fucked that up.

404
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,060
Don't sit here and tell me
you want to be someone else

405
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,103
when you do fuck all
to change what's going on.

406
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,849
It's your turn.

407
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:53,496
I'm sorry. There's nothing more
I can do to help you.

408
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,097
You can tell me where he is.

409
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:56,903
We're closing.
The whole building is.

410
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:00,545
- It's 4:00. It's 4-fucking-o'clock!
- That clock is broken.

411
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,364
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know!

412
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:04,850
Tell me where he is.
Tell me where he is!

413
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,803
Thank you.

414
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:16,769
- He's not here.
- What?

415
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,995
He was released four hours ago.

416
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,851
Look, I...
You know that I don't like you,

417
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:41,148
and I know that you don't like me,
but I need your help.

418
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:45,225
I have this bag full of plants.

419
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,803
I need it gone.

420
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,729
Exactly.

421
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,139
No, I will not suck your dick.

422
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,256
Bingo!

423
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,045
I'd appreciate it if you didn't ask
my mom to blow you in front of me.

424
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,596
Had to, or she would have known
something was up,

425
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,281
right dark and lovely?

426
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:04,406
Word.

427
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,488
- Why are you still dressed like that?
- Yeah. Why are you, Tito?

428
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,935
Thought I might go out for a bit.

429
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,743
White women
been sweating me all day.

430
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,038
I'm gonna hit a hot spot,
turn it loose.

431
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:20,124
Turn what loose...
Your small white penis?

432
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,015
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

433
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,380
No, it's cool.

434
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,564
Robert Downey Jr opened the door.

435
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:28,682
Now, I'm gonna walk
through that door,

436
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:31,636
get me some bathroom sex
at Applebee's.

437
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:33,930
That might work.

438
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,432
Where's the rest of my yo pretty at?

439
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,351
I could use a little more snake bite
for my lips.

440
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:40,770
What do you think?

441
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,607
I'll let the hospital know
you're coming.

442
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:50,002
You're drinking?

443
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:53,036
- Are you kidding me?
- Yes, I am...

444
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,471
Drinking, not kidding.

445
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,120
Count me in.

446
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,798
Where's Silas?

447
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:01,958
Holding Adelita's hair
while she pukes.

448
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:06,751
I get five feet in the door
and shit's already falling apart.

449
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,131
Relax.

450
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,429
We're celebrating
the big announcement.

451
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:12,137
What big announcement?

452
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,685
I'm getting married.

453
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,261
What?

454
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,932
Don't listen to him.
He's high on infatuation.

455
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:22,517
No, look.
There's <i>el governor</i> to be with Pilar.

456
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,069
He's back on the ticket.

457
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:31,946
She pulled him back in.

458
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:41,789
Are you really getting married?

459
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,333
Yes, he is,

460
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:46,751
and he's using my ring...

461
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,250
With my blessing.

462
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,090
Congratulations.

463
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,696
Congratulations.
