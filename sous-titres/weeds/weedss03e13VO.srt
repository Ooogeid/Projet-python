2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,679
- "Whore"?
- Fucking pregnant again.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,462
Some Indian kid
I mercy fucked for U-Turn.

4
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,750
Ain't nothing to say, faggot,
except "send money."

5
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:16,552
- I thought you were dating me.
- I am.

6
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,659
I'm just something for you
to rub up against.

7
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,013
Don't do this.

8
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:22,516
"Thug" means never having to
say you're sorry.

9
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:24,298
Kids need to know if there's danger.

10
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,062
- What kind of danger?
- Big, scary men with guns.

11
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,295
I've been doing some research
on the internet,

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,775
and I really think Pittsburgh
is the place for us.

13
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:33,152
That thing's a camera?

14
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,529
I can broadcast the image
to any computer in the house.

15
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:39,505
Dumb name will know my wrath...
The wrath of Doug.

16
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,661
- It's comin'.
- Andy, meet Chess.

17
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,413
You want to buy from me?

18
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,802
Why don't you let Mrs. Botwin know

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,709
it's available if she's interested?

20
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,341
Yeah, I'm bad. Punish me.

21
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,967
You will start paying
for the many sins against me.

22
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,226
I need to rent your empty house.

23
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,370
We need a grow house.
Can you deal with that?

24
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,187
Slut.

29
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,317
And where were you last night,
young lady?

30
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,558
Sinner.

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,813
Why is this cross in my house?

32
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:34,561
Andy said I could put it here.

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,086
- Andy?
- Let me ask you something.

34
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,988
You think our customers
might be interested

35
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:43,991
might be interested in some
lovely outdoor-grown biker bammy?

36
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:46,192
How did it get in here?

37
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:48,370
Oh, it wasn't easy.
Let me say that right now.

38
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:49,955
And getting it out of here?

39
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,666
I'm gonna say
near-impossible on that one.

40
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,756
Make the impossible possible, Doug.

41
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,362
Why don't I come back later,
after you've had your coffee?

42
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:02,186
- Why don't you do that?
- I think it wouldn't be a terrible idea

43
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,753
if we had an alternative
source for weed.

44
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,577
- Bikers?
- Motorcycle club.

45
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:11,268
They're great. It's a family business,
brother and sister.

46
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,520
- You met a biker girl?
- No.

47
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:18,699
- No, she's not a girl. She's a woman.
- Of course she is.

48
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:19,966
Discussion over.

49
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,487
This has nothing to do with her.

50
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:24,198
- It's an opportunity.
- Where were you all night?

51
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:25,616
I was working.

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,785
You have a working mother, Shane.

53
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,115
Them's the breaks.

54
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:32,247
What's wrong with offering
another choice to our clients?

55
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:36,240
They aren't looking for more choices.
People are too overwhelmed by choice.

56
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:38,212
- They seek simplicity.
- I'm not buying it.

57
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,662
This is a culture where you can order
coffee 80 million ways,

58
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:43,101
and people love it.

59
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,010
Chess just wants you to think about it.

60
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:49,263
Chess... wants me to think about it?

61
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:53,936
How does... how does Chess
know what I do?

62
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,428
That was kind of creepy.

63
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:58,065
He seemed to know a lot about you.

64
00:03:58,728 --> 00:03:59,818
That's not good.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,891
Right, Shane. Very observant.

66
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,091
That's not good.

67
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:06,913
Don't cock-block me on this, Nance.
She's really hot.

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,290
See how many bricks he'll
trade me for a giant cross.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,539
How the hell did he get it in here?

70
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,989
I believe it's a miracle.

71
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,213
I don't believe in miracles.

72
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,594
I believe in Pittsburgh.

73
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,274
I swear I think
the sky is bluer over here.

74
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,817
No graffiti, no drunks
and junkies... shoot.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,084
I'll take it.

76
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:35,055
- How long we staying?
- This is temporary, little girl.

77
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:38,373
And don't kid yourself. There's plenty
of drunks and junkies out here.

78
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,222
They just ain't on the corner
'cause they got air-conditioning.

79
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,568
- Morning.
- Morning.

80
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:48,819
- Did you hear how high her voice got?
- She think we gonna jump her.

81
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,126
- That's why we gonna be just fine.
- How you figure?

82
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:56,093
There's only one thing
more powerful than white fear,

83
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,617
and that's white guilt.
Now, they say, "good morning,"

84
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,982
but what they're really
saying is, "I'm not racist."

85
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,906
Look at this one.

86
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,108
Hello there. How are you?

87
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,814
Good morning to you.

88
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,307
They gonna treat us like Maya Angelou
and Condoleezza Rice.

89
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,658
So...

90
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:28,114
How we doing here?

91
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,579
Well, a lot of the plants
that were ready for harvest

92
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,696
didn't make it,

93
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,798
and we're dealing
with a lot less space here.

94
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,566
You are asking about the crop, right?

95
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,482
Yes. I'm asking about the crop.

96
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,037
I'm running low.

97
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,003
I can't fill you back up right now.

98
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,964
I'm thinking of opening up
another supply line.

99
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:47,835
With who?

100
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:51,033
There's this biker chick
that Andy wants to fuck and

101
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,485
a guy named Chess.

102
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,905
18-foot cross in my house. I don't know.

103
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:58,527
Well, it's gonna be a little dry
around here for a while.

104
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,360
Then I'll do it.

105
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:05,726
Lord!

106
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:09,821
I can smell this house
from two fuckin' blocks away.

107
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:13,354
Smells like a skunk massacre
happening up in here.

108
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,634
- What you gonna do?
- Well, how about this for a game plan?

109
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,374
I grow inside, you and Vaneeta
grow outside

110
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,231
Rosemary, Lavender.

111
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,514
Fine. As soon as I make
a little something to eat,

112
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:25,898
I'll get to it.

113
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,723
You need a shower.

114
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,771
- What, you don't want to stay and help?
- I haven't got the green thumb.

115
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,066
She just got the white attitude.

116
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,728
That's all I'm saying, Bill.

117
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,618
We substitute the cheap drywall
from China,

118
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:45,941
it'll save us a ton.

119
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:56,583
Hey, there. How you doing?

120
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,039
I'm gonna have to call you back.

121
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,143
You know, I hope for Nancy's sake

122
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,163
that you used a condom.

123
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,947
God forbid you should replicate.

124
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,072
God bless y'all.

125
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,751
My decorator.

126
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,459
We're doing a little remodeling.

127
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,283
I want to be part of the team...
One of the cool kids.

128
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,681
What can I do?

129
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:01,616
Ain't nothing for you to do but
collect your rent every month.

130
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,332
Oh, sure. Everyone gets
to have fun except me.

131
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:07,022
Well, fuck that shit.
I am here to kick ass!

132
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,778
- Whose ass?
- Whoever gets in my way.

133
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:14,002
Come on. Let me do something fun.
Come on. Please.

134
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:17,157
I am on a real high here.
Do not bring me down.

135
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,493
Okay, gangsta barbie,
I will figure something out.

136
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,154
You'll see. I'm good, and I'm ready.

137
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:25,482
I will not disappoint you.
I'll be a great soldier.

138
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sure you will. Hold this.

139
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:32,251
I'm helping daddy, aren't I?

140
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,771
What took you so long?
I texted you over two hours ago.

141
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,193
You're not my only customer, Sully.

142
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,610
- I really need to smoke out.
- Oh, I'll bet.

143
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,336
What happened?

144
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,462
It's just a signal that
it's time for me to move on.

145
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,508
Forward to my next,

146
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,267
shitty, prefab Jesus town.

147
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:10,232
Hey. You know I take
this Jesus stuff seriously.

148
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,850
- Sorry.
- Shame you have to go.

149
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,349
You're one of my best customers.

150
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,304
You could go with me.

151
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:19,970
No, thanks.

152
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:24,117
I'm happy here in my shitty,
prefab Jesus town.

153
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,462
Shame.

154
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,682
What can I do for you, pot mommy?

155
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,587
My horny lieutenant tells me

156
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,061
you may have some product for me.

157
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:37,779
Low on the MILF, huh?

158
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,740
You seem to know so much about me.

159
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,278
I know nothing about you.

160
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,159
Doesn't seem fair.

161
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,148
You should have checked out
my facebook page.

162
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,457
Hey. Want to play some "Risk"?

163
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,208
I'm in. What?

164
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,330
Mommy's all business I see.

165
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,418
Let me show you what I got for you.

166
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,037
"Risk" is all about Kamchatka.

167
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,681
It's your gateway to the west.

168
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,138
Think you're telling me
something I don't know?

169
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,354
Your housewives will love it --

170
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,393
Make them forget that their
husbands won't fuck 'em.

171
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,525
- How much?
- Five for a pound.

172
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,523
That's a fair price.

173
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,536
Yeah...

174
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:18,026
For a full pound.

175
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:21,095
It might be a little short. You're good.

176
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,399
I tell you what -- 10% discount.

177
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:28,062
Take the first one on consignment.

178
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,093
Why would you go and do
something like that?

179
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,417
I can tell you're gonna be
a loyal customer.

180
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,006
I'm all about loyal customers.

181
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:38,211
But, hey, you bring me back
that five grand real soon.

182
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,956
Um, 10% off is, um,

183
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:43,303
$4,500, right?

184
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,347
- Yeah.
- Chess, is it?

185
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,935
- Yeah.
- Is that short for Chester?

186
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:51,891
- No.
- It is.

187
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,535
He hates it.

188
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,815
See you soon, pot mommy.

189
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,490
See you soon, Chester.

190
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,820
Hey, I challenge you to a game,
one-on-one.

191
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:02,489
Winner takes all.

192
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,071
All of what?

193
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,918
Winner takes all, Nance.

194
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:26,734
Uncle Andy?!

195
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,065
Silas?

196
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,120
Mom?

197
00:11:37,717 --> 00:11:38,762
Mom?

198
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:43,837
Mom?!

199
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:45,375
Mom?!

200
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:56,793
Back door...

201
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:58,777
Side...

202
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:09,568
Hey.

203
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,442
Yeah, it's just a bug in the system.

204
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,281
This is so not what I had in mind.

205
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,660
Conrad said you wanted to get dirty.

206
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,810
Now you're dirty.

207
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:35,909
Hand me some more of that sage,
princess.

208
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,626
Make it smell Italian out here
instead of Jamaican.

209
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,007
These hands went to college.

210
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,936
Majored in english lit.

211
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:48,554
These are not farm hands.

212
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,963
What? I'm part viking.

213
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:00,959
I miss my ice floe.

214
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:03,321
Look to me like hot flashes.

215
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,496
- You taking estrogen?
- Can't.

216
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,386
Cancer.

217
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,253
You?

218
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:16,677
Shit. I tried HRT, ERT, and herbs.

219
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,085
Vodka and cigarettes --
Only thing that works for me.

220
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,339
Fuck this. Let's light up.

221
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,757
Here you go.

222
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,992
Conrad expects us to finish
this planting today.

223
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,428
Fuck Conrad. He in the shade.

224
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:32,667
Yeah, but --

225
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,624
You got a boyfriend, Heylia?
Husband, lover?

226
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,772
Is he a piece-of-shit lying asshole?

227
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,738
I had my share of them,
but I'm taking a break --

228
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,363
Maybe a lifetime break.

229
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,697
I think I'm doomed to be alone.

230
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:50,664
Ain't no shame in it.

231
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,325
But I get lonely.

232
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,094
Buy yourself a dog.

233
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:56,537
I'm not good with animals.

234
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,279
Men and animals.

235
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,123
Men are animals.

236
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,599
Listen to both of you.

237
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,021
Two of the scariest bitches
on the planet.

238
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,813
No wonder nothing with a dick wants to
come within 100 yards of either of you.

239
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,899
I don't see nothing
that has to stand up to pee

240
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,038
in your life, neither,

241
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,588
So shut the fuck up, Vaneeta.

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,706
Yeah, shut the fuck up... Vaneeta.

243
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:29,046
"And Herod with his soldiers treated him
with contempt and mocked him.

244
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:32,365
"Then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel,
he sent him back to Pilate."

245
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:34,192
Oh, for god's sake,

246
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:37,456
get to the punch line already
before I die.

247
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,979
It's no joke, Mr. Mertes,

248
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,529
it's the crucifixion story.

249
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:42,683
Luke: chapter 23.

250
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:45,782
You remember where we left off
last week?

251
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:48,025
You read the bible to me last week?

252
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:50,550
Yes. I read it to you every week.

253
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:53,511
Okay. This weed sucks.

254
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:57,308
We were low on MILF,
so we had to go to a new grower.

255
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,327
Well, it's ditchweed dreck.

256
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,894
Don't let it happen again.

257
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:02,562
I'm on borrowed time.

258
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,030
This is not quality.

259
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,962
I am so sorry, Mr. Mertes.

260
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,310
Silas, make her give me my money back.

261
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,130
This new weed sucks.

262
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:11,910
I know. Nobody wants it. I told mom.

263
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,574
We'll refund you, Mr. Mertes.

264
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,880
Good.

265
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,410
Now I got to take a whiz.

266
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:20,124
If I'm not out in 10,

267
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:21,463
do not resuscitate.

268
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,714
So you're talking to me?

269
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:27,730
You missed me.

270
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:29,214
You pissed me off.

271
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,622
'cause you like me.

272
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,935
- Because I like you.
- I like you, too.

273
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,026
I'm not good at sharing.

274
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:44,438
Well, this you don't
have to share with anyone.

275
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,502
It's only for you.

276
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:52,989
A little help here!

277
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,527
You should go help him.

278
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,148
In a minute.

279
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:58,113
Bad boy.

280
00:15:58,372 --> 00:15:59,745
- You love it.
- I do.

281
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,721
Wait, hang on.

282
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:04,239
There's more.

283
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:09,696
This is inferior product.

284
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,134
Planning a big night
on the town, are we?

285
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,581
Not with this shit I'm not.

286
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,325
You got to hook me up
with some better weed.

287
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,192
They wouldn't even buy this
at the manhole,

288
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:19,411
and they smoke everything.

289
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,061
I'm sure they do.

290
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,010
I've got unsatisfied customers.

291
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,520
My reputation is suspect.

292
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,272
That outfit is suspect.

293
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,383
Don't try to change the subject.

294
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,179
We're out of MILF.

295
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,187
Gonna be at least a week
before we have more.

296
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:36,865
Well, hurry up, okay?

297
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,014
Clinique is putting the screws to me.

298
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,881
We're having a sonogram tomorrow,

299
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,412
and those things aren't cheap.

300
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,516
You think you're ready to be a father?

301
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,373
Do I look like
I am ready to be a father?

302
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,737
Terrific.

303
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,932
I'm always curious
about my customer's choices.

304
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,881
Yeah.
I think this one chose me.

305
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,812
- Care to elaborate.
- It just reminds me

306
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,557
that "thug" means never
having to say you're sorry.

307
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,301
- Don't you mean "love"?
- Absolutely not.

308
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:20,420
"love" means
you're constantly apologizing.

309
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,602
Tell me about it.

310
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:27,658
I should get "I'm sorry, baby"
tattooed on my ass.

311
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:28,987
Why don't you?

312
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,578
I already got a giant eagle
chained to a rock there.

313
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,756
Looking good.

314
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,592
- Want to take a look?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,795
- Came out nice.
- Yeah.

316
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,044
You have something for me?

317
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,115
Thank you, pot mommy.

318
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,963
And here you go.

319
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,780
I don't think our business
arrangement's gonna work out.

320
00:17:59,518 --> 00:18:00,535
And why's that?

321
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,261
My customers
don't seem to like your product.

322
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,254
- Wait. My shit is good.
- Oh, no. Don't take it personally.

323
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,124
You grow merlot,
they prefer cabernet.

324
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,996
Your customers sound gay.

325
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:13,238
Some of them are.

326
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,365
Most of them
just don't like your weed.

327
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,545
Here's for the pound
you loaned me on consignment.

328
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,602
Good faith.

329
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,909
I wish you luck
in all future endeavors.

330
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,218
So, see you around.

331
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:29,852
Wear a helmet.

332
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:31,480
Follow safety laws.

333
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,047
Wait, wait.

334
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:35,078
I'm disappointed.

335
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:38,189
Are you absolutely sure
that we can't do business.

336
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:40,817
I am.

337
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,285
That's a shame.

338
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,308
But just to show you that
there's no hard feelings,

339
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:50,393
I'd like to take you to dinner,
give you a chance to get to know me.

340
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:52,571
I don't mix the business
with the personal.

341
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,211
According to you, we're not
doing the business anymore.

342
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,231
We're not doing
the personal, either.

343
00:18:57,364 --> 00:18:59,009
Tell you what --
You think about it,

344
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,941
you weight the pros
and the cons, and I'll be in touch.

345
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:04,230
Touch yourself, Chester.

346
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,911
I got to go.

347
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:07,593
Bye.

348
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,650
Girls got balls.

349
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,903
Yes, she does.

350
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,016
But who wants a chick
with fuckin' balls?

351
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,140
Jesus, Doug.

352
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:54,234
Whore.

353
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,083
Hello to you, too.

354
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:58,658
I've been doing a little
light reading.

355
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,808
How the hell did that cross
get in there?

356
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:05,381
Don't know how the fuck.

357
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,888
Doug snuck it in
on sanjay's shift,

358
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,213
wired it, the whole thing.

359
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,576
Mangoes, apricots --

360
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,258
Nice supermarkets y'all got.

361
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,977
Yes. We blow a loud
horn of plenty out here.

362
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,202
- That kind of day?
- Only kind I know.

363
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:32,492
What the fuck...

364
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:36,463
Oh, yeah.

365
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,691
Please tell me you have
a thing for traffic signs.

366
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:42,276
I got a thing for these figs.

367
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,306
- They're delicious.
- You fucked him?

368
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,908
That's none of your business.

369
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,283
Okay.
Get the fuck out of here.

370
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,788
You think you're the first
black man I've been with?

371
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:52,987
I'm not?

372
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:55,336
- You know why they called him U-turn.
- You're just obscene.

373
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,638
Come on.
I never slept with U-turn.

374
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,878
I just gave him a hand job.

375
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,243
So now you're fucking with me.

376
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,192
- You think?
- Do I believe you?

377
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:09,131
You'd better if you want
to get lucky tonight.

378
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,449
Why would you do that?

379
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,320
- What, mess with you or get the tattoo?
- The fucking tattoo.

380
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,222
I thought it would make me stronger.

381
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:22,878
Question is...

382
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,896
You got a thing for women who
got a thing for traffic signs?

383
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,956
Motherfucker
caused us nothing but pain.

384
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,245
Motherfucker's dead.
We're alive.

385
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,692
- That's true.
- Now shut up and taste this.

386
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:47,992
What city has 720 bridges
and 15 in its downtown alone?

387
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,453
- I'm gonna guess... Pittsburgh.
- Correct.

388
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,638
What city had the first
robotics institute?

389
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,035
Nance?

390
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,267
Pittsburgh.

391
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,727

397
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:08,333
Wrong. Pittsburgh.

398
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,021
My God, what happened to you?!

399
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,424
I was driving home.
Stopped at a light.

400
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,538
- I stopped at a light.
- I heard. And what happened?

401
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,061
Oh, look at you.

402
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:21,923
Three guys on motorcycles
pulled me out of the car.

403
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,525
How many motorcycles
in Pittsburgh?

404
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,508
They're coming after you. They said
they're coming after all of us.

405
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,666
I don't know.
I need to look it up.

406
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:32,042
You need a doctor.
We're going to a doctor.

407
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,247
Jesus christ, Shane!

408
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,341

ethnically diverse neighborhoods

00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:38,926

410
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:40,873
