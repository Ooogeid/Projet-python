1
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:03,544
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,591
All I know is some stiletto-heeled
Mexicunt screeches at you,

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,343
and suddenly the marriage is off.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,679
They want me to have this baby totally
off the grid, no birth certificate.

5
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:17,975
If I disappear, if the baby disappears,
nobody knows, it's <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,823
We gotta go to Dr. Lehman's.
I have to have this baby right now.

7
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,561
- My boob.
- Deal with it.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,154
I need to ask you a question.
Are you a closer or a loser?

9
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:33,171
You're Pretty! will front you
all the products that you need

10
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,409
to put yourself on the road
to financial freedom.

11
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:38,954
Very impressive.
Thanks for involving me, dickhead.

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,123
- You're fucking jinx.
- You're a douchebag.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,951
- Everybody down!
- Shit.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,294
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's no joke, fat-ass.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,088
You have the right to remain silent.

16
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,548
I need you to get the baby out of me
as soon as possible.

17
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,759
You're two days away
from your due date.

18
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:54,136
The father is a drug kingpin,

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,180
which could pose a problem
if he decided

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,247
to kill its mother
the minute she gives birth.

21
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:00,866
He has your eyes.

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,504
Weeds 508
A Distinctive Horn

23
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:23,108
By the Fumistes team.
lesfumistes[at]gmail.com

24
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,601
This is a very handsome boy.

25
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,521
You must have a very beautiful life.

26
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,941
- Do you want...
- What the fuck are doing?

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,777
Don't interrupt me, Nancy.

28
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:53,571
It's impolite.

29
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,365
And breaches in etiquette
make me want to

30
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,200
throw things.

31
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,579
Right, <i>mi rey pequeño</i>?

32
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,084
Do you want to know
why I've never had children?

33
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,969
Because you'd eat them
and children are super fattening?

34
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:12,673
Children are inconvenient.

35
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,912
They complicate
even the simplest things.

36
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:17,133
And they want, and they want,

37
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,264
and if you let them,
they'll take everything you have.

38
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:23,851
This little milk ball was a mistake.

39
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,905
A mistake that would end the career
of a very promising politician.

40
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:31,192
I am here to correct that mistake.

41
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,904
You can help me,
or you can try to stop me.

42
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,972
Which do you think would be better
for the handsome man

43
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,575
in your beautiful life?

44
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,057
Raylene, I need to talk to you.

45
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:55,897
There is a Q&A after the seminar,

46
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:57,885
I'm sure it'll answer
all your questions.

47
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,970
No one is buying this shit.

48
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,806
I'll be just a minute.

49
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,696
It's like the depression out there,
all right?

50
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,036
Women are pinching
their cheeks for blush.

51
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,142
Trannies,
they're staining their lips

52
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:16,705
with plum juice.

53
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,978
I cannot sell makeup

54
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:22,243
when civilization is collapsing.

55
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,150
Cee-Cee!

56
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,387
Economic downturns
are great for beauty.

57
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,626
Poor people wear the most makeup.

58
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,810
Then they're stealing it,
because I can't move anything.

59
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,257
And it's Celia.

60
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,274
Well, I'm not interested in Celia.

61
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,928
I'm interested in Cee-Cee.

62
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,596
See, Celia

63
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:43,890
is a quitter.

64
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,101
But Cee-Cee, she sells a life style.

65
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,187
Cee-Cee sells self-esteem
in small doses,

66
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,272
a positive reflexion
in a floor-length mirror,

67
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,527
confidence, happiness, sex.

68
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,689
Well, bully for Cee-Cee.

69
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:02,236
I am returning your shit product.

70
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,119
I will pay for what I used.

71
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,443
Doesn't work that way.

72
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,096
You signed a contract.

73
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,043
Meaning you owe for what you have
and you owe for the deliveries

74
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,189
you'll be receiving
for the next 12 months.

75
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:18,226
If you break the contract,
if you do not pay what you owe,

76
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:20,494
then you will go to jail
for defrauding our company.

77
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:23,095
- Is that you want?
- I will not go back there.

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,431
I will die first.

79
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,309
No, you will sell cosmetics first.

80
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,437
Come on! You just need

81
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,397
to remind Cee-Cee
that she is selling

82
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,207
the You're Pretty! dream,

83
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,132
so that Celia doesn't have to live

84
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,007
the "You're ugly and behind bars"
nightmare.

85
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:45,980
Who's pretty?

86
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,564
You're Pretty!

87
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:54,668
I am

88
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,765
the father of this child.

89
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,141
Not according
to your dear friend Pilar.

90
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,300
And the birth certificate.

91
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,910
She's jut protecting
my public image.

92
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,971
And she has a point.

93
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,368
Did you break an ankle
backpedaling that fast?

94
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,603
She threatened our son, your son.

95
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,434
We can leave the father's name blank

96
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,225
until after the election.

97
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,280
- Then...
- Another election and another election.

98
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,658
- I will speak to her.
- She was very clear.

99
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,328
Your name will not appear
on that birth certificate.

100
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,103
There'll be no public record
linking you to me,

101
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,415
to your son.

102
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,408
I will not allow
another man to sign this.

103
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,585
Then you sign it.

104
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:38,832
Tell that cunt to eat shit and die.

105
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,173
We'll live happily ever after,
the end.

106
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:42,800
It's not that easy.

107
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,574
Because she owns you.

108
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,119
But you love me.

109
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,018
And I love you.

110
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,688
- I'll have Cesar...
- That's okay.

111
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,249
My family's coming.

112
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,483
I'll go with them.

113
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,530
- I...
- Okay then, Mrs. Botwin.

114
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,152
I've got your discharge paperwork
all set up for you.

115
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,930
Just need a few scribbles
on a few dotted lines.

116
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,599
Hi, there.

117
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,797
I'll get you a wheelchair up here.

118
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,391
No, I don't...

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,052
I don't need
a wheel... thing... chair.

120
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,265
Now... Hospital policy, you know.

121
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:35,746
Did you get that birth certificate form
all filled out for me?

122
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,169
Fuck it.

123
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,386
Great, thank you, baby.

124
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:56,749
Why the hell should I help you?

125
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,794
As opposed to the many multinational
corporations you represent?

126
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:02,796
Business has been just fine.

127
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:06,050
Customers from the tea place next door
been wandering in here by accident?

128
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:08,807
- Suck it.
- Mr. Hodes, please help us.

129
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,699
We can't get our weed back
without a court order.

130
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,225
My rate is $500 an hour.

131
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,561
That better include a rim job.

132
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:21,065
Look, when we're back in business,
we'll lay a couple ounces on you.

133
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,350
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

134
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:27,738
and fuck you.

135
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,522
I know what this is about.
You're pissed off

136
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,237
because I did not cut you in
on the pot club.

137
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:35,662
But that's just
'cause you're cursed with schmuckness.

138
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,541
- You're an asshole.
- Okay, look...

139
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,710
The truth of the matter is,

140
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,214
you're cursed with schmuckness.

141
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:51,178
You want my help?
Is that what you want?

142
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,180
Fine, I will help you.

143
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,723
My gosh! Thank you.

144
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,852
After I slam his dick
in this drawer.

145
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,358
- Let's go, he's not gonna help.
- No, I will.

146
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:05,984
Seriously.

147
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,514
But first, his dick, this drawer...

148
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,197
slam.

149
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:14,827
- And then we get the pot back?
- Guaranteed.

150
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:19,336
- This is bullshit.
- No, it's cool. I can do this.

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,657
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- If I'm hard, it won't be so bad.

152
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,002
- Give me a second.
- Take your time.

153
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,550
In the meantime, Silas, I need you
to sign this power-of-attorney form.

154
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,521
Great, I will go
see the judge tomorrow.

155
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,897
Now...

156
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,694
Ready.

157
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:54,992
Right up in there.

158
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,258
You're good?
Okay, here we go, one...

159
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,306
two...

160
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,721
Nice job baby-proofing, Shane.

161
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,045
I got the diapers
just like you asked.

162
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,681
They're eco-friendly.

163
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,683
It got a name yet?

164
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,352
It's a he and for right now,

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,417
he's still baby boy Botwin.

166
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,274
- Do you want to hold him?
- No.

167
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,736
- He's your brother, get used to it.
- I thought you said it wasn't an it.

168
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,195
Fine, get used to him. I gotta...

169
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,819
take a fucking shower.

170
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,875
- He's kind of cute.
- Who cares?

171
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,127
He's probably gonna
want to play soccer.

172
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,265
I've to reclaim
my territory, Superfly.

173
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,595
You mean the piece of land

174
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,104
that my grandmother
left to my thieving father

175
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,649
to whom I am now
the closest living relative?

176
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:11,271
You in my house, lady.

177
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:14,821
I have a baby.

178
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:18,575
There's a lovely empty bedroom
just across the hall.

179
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,498
With your name on it.

180
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,746
Funny you should say that.

181
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:25,249
- What do you mean?
- It means...

182
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,897
I just got an interesting call

183
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,220
a little while ago,
from a lady at the hospital.

184
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,424
Phoned me to tell me
about their new daddy classes,

185
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,422
perhaps I should check them out.

186
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:39,221
I was of course confused.
Asked her if she had the right person.

187
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,738
"Is this Andrew Botwin," says she.

188
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:43,115
"Why, yes!" I reply,

189
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,352
as I usually do
to that particular question.

190
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,688
So, riddle me this.

191
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,740
Why would some lady from the hospital
you were just discharged from

192
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,153
be under the impression
that I'm a new daddy?

193
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,615
I couldn't put Esteban's name
on the birth certificate.

194
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,367
So you put my name on it.

195
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:02,812
Congratulations.

196
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,080
A little presumptuous,
don't you think?

197
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,736
No, you're always talking
about how you want to...

198
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,891
carry on the Botwin name.

199
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,754
Mazel tov, you're a father.

200
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,420
No, I'm not.

201
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,050
And I'm not signing a fucking thing.

202
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,052
What is the big deal?
It's a piece of paper.

203
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,202
It's not a piece of paper.
It's a fucking birth certificate.

204
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,851
The kid's first I.D.

205
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,938
You want to make it a fake one.
Way to start him off on a life of crime.

206
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:31,481
Come on.

207
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm through playing
baby-daddy to your kids.

208
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,487
Andy, I don't have anybody else.

209
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,159
Whose fault is that?

210
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:57,132
You gotta get me
out of this contract.

211
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,718
- Is this thing scented?
- Jesus, Dean!

212
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,817
Isabel would like to go to college.

213
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,931
You can't be spending
the last dime you have on weed.

214
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,226
No, that belongs to a client.

215
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:13,137
This contract is signed,
countersigned and notarized.

216
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,443
- Looks like you're fucked.
- Isn't there something you can do?

217
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,028
I can get you high.

218
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,322
No, I'm clean.
Do you have any booze?

219
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,330
I got some scotch.

220
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,035
Don't... Come on. God.

221
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,835
So tell me, who is this client?

222
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,546
I can't divulge
privileged information.

223
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,757
But it rhymes
with "drug" and "hilas."

224
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,694
Their "pop" club got "rusted."

225
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:45,222
They need me to get their "schmarijuana"
back from the "grolice."

226
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,642
Of course, they have
a roomful of "shmarijuana"

227
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,644
and I have a roomful
of You're Pretty!.

228
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,397
I'm so fucked. I sell a product

229
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,524
that nobody wants.

230
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:57,211
And you,

231
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,947
you have all of this pot

232
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,702
that belongs to fucking...

233
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,742
assholes.

234
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,833
Hilas is not an asshole.
He's a nice kid.

235
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,719
Really, he is?

236
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,421
What did Silas pay you

237
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,920
for all of your valuable
legal advice, Dean?

238
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,506
- I'm smoking it.
- Tell me something.

239
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:23,135
Are you a closer or are you a loser?

240
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,594
I like to close drawers.

241
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:29,725
Well, close the drawer then
and open your mind.

242
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:31,935
I could sell

243
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,600
a lot more makeup

244
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,149
if I give a free gift with purchase.

245
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,694
I... I can't steal their weed.

246
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:44,072
Just tell them that you got
ripped off by black people.

247
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,200
- They won't buy that.
- They will when they see the bruises.

248
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,327
What bruises?

249
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,415
Putz.

250
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,416
You know, I admire you.

251
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:57,919
Go away.

252
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,309
This is my spot.

253
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:02,373
Despite the backwards nature
of your convictions,

254
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,263
you're tenacious and that bespeaks

255
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,928
a certain something of something,
so bravo.

256
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,932
- Which side are you on?
- On the side of sticking to one's guns.

257
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,898
I finally said no to her.

258
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,115
Oh, God!

259
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,939
The wave of relief that washed over me,
weird protestor guy.

260
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:19,441
I'm buoyant.

261
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,626
I'm a buoy.

262
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,737
Bluebirds on my shoulders.

263
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:28,283
- How's Nancy? Is the baby okay?
- Baby murderer.

264
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,701
25 feet, Gayle.

265
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:34,341
The baby's fine.
A thousand suns in those chubby cheeks.

266
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,092
You're wearing armor.

267
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,711
- You can never be too careful.
- And you're smoking.

268
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,363
Sometimes you can be too careful.

269
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:44,857
Can I help you with something?

270
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,762
You want to go out?
I'll buy you dinner. I shaved.

271
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,723
- When?
- Just now, right before I came.

272
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:53,892
When do you want to go out?

273
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,311
Tonight.

274
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,067
Pick me up here at 7:00.

275
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,526
- How will I know your car?
- It has a distinctive horn.

276
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,592
You're in the cross hairs
of the righteous.

277
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,191
Ignore the dark warnings
at your own peril!

278
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,964
Take a Claritin, Gayle.
Today's pollen count is off the charts.

279
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,247
- I'll see you at 7:00.
- Yes.

280
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:18,833
She likes me.

281
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,221
She's gonna burn in hell
for all of eternity.

282
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,714
I'd rather laugh
with the sinners, Gayle.

283
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,386
For now.

284
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,479
Lupita, thank you.

285
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,902
Good timing!

286
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:44,734
William Moris just merged with Endeavor
and Mr. Kaplan, out on his ass.

287
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:50,031
Look like a dyke bar.

288
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:54,119
- I haven't had time to redecorate yet.
- So where is my bedroom?

289
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,733
We're a little short on bedrooms.

290
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,876
Upstairs, your bedroom's upstairs.
I'm sleeping on the couch.

291
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,963
I had my last baby when I was 52.

292
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:07,966
The women in my family
bleed forever.

293
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:10,802
- How old are you?
- 37.

294
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,846
So, the baby?

295
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,849
- One-night stand?
- A little more complicated than that.

296
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,685
- Maybe he leave his wife.
- Even more complicated.

297
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:21,062
Good to see you, Nancy.

298
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,189
You pay me cash, you feed me,

299
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,983
I no work on Sundays

300
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,319
or when Secretos Houston is on TV.

301
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,237
- Done.
- No cleaning,

302
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,739
no laundry, just baby.

303
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:35,535
- Done.
- I like it, this is nice.

304
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,496
Ocean...
Maybe I start surfing again.

305
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,292
<i>Dios mío</i>! Shane!

306
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,461
- So tall!
- Hi, Lupita.

307
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,962
- You surf too?
- No.

308
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,505
- I teach you.
- Okay.

309
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,467
- Surfing lessons extra.
- Of course they are.

310
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:57,358
- Oregon.
- Yeah.

311
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,559
And then West Germany.

312
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,077
And then Uruguay.

313
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,953
You?

314
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:04,389
Tarzana.

315
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:07,367
And then, the other side of Tarzana.

316
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,946
What did you want to be
when you were a kid?

317
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,239
Jane Goodall. You?

318
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,407
A dog.

319
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,254
This is fun. I'm having fun.

320
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,210
It's getting kind of late.
I think I should go soon.

321
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:26,555
What?

322
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,205
Haven't even gotten
our Combo Platos yet.

323
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,323
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

324
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,263
I... Just considering my options
for the rest of the evening.

325
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,931
And my PJ's and the Friday Night Lights
box set is winning hands down.

326
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,604
We're having a great date.
What's wrong?

327
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,023
Nutshell? I'm past you.

328
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,150
- Past me in what?
- In life.

329
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:52,320
Look, Andy.
I know there are plenty of girls

330
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,358
that would be dazzled
by $2 taco night at Borracho's

331
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:58,268
and the fact that you can balance
a salt shaker on the bridge of your nose

332
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:01,005
but honestly you lost me
about 15 minutes in.

333
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05,233
This is stunning. I'm stunned.

334
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,501
Stunned? Really?

335
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,987
You're unemployed,

336
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,019
you're closer to 40 than 30,

337
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:12,102
you drive a car from a TV show

338
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:14,157
and your greatest recent
accomplishment

339
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,803
was beating the upside-down
kill screen in Ms. Pac-Man.

340
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:20,881
I didn't beat it, I just got to it.
Died almost immediately.

341
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,934
The thing's upside down.

342
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,811
You're a frozen margarita, Andy.

343
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,896
I happen to like slushy beverages.

344
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,455
And I'm a doctor.

345
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,113
Fine, you're a doctor.

346
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,823
I play doctor.

347
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,747
Why did you even agree
to go out with me?

348
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,859
'Cause my mother always said
that "if they feed you, go."

349
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:50,199
I'm starting to realize
my mother gave me lots of bad advice.

350
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,589
Thank you for the drink.

351
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,010
- I'll drive you home.
- No, it's all right.

352
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,546
I'll find my own way.

353
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,369
Preferably in a car
with the doors open.

354
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,108
Good night, Andy.

355
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,371
This baby sleep too much.

356
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:16,178
It probably just wants

357
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:18,193
to wake up when it's all over.

358
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,741
Shit, now I'm calling it an it.

359
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:22,051
Him an it.

360
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,428
Him a him.

361
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,747
I need to name this baby.

362
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,604
I go surf now.

363
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:31,085
I like Bernardo,
like in <i>West Side Story</i>.

364
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:35,131
Bernardo Botwin.
I'll think about it.

365
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,237
Bernardo?
He gets killed by Tony.

366
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,429
On the birth certificate,
he'd be Andy Jr.

367
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,058
That's what I call my penis.
Wait, no, God!

368
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,143
I need to stop playing doctor
and be a doctor.

369
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,730
- What?
- I wanna be the father.

370
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:52,915
- Really?
- Really.

371
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,526
But I mean really, really.

372
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,617
If my name is
on this child's birth certificate,

373
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,447
then I will be its father.
And we will raise it together.

374
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,573
- Him.
- Him.

375
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,885
50% ownership.
Half the voting shares.

376
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,911
And I'm on the bimah
at the bar mitzvah.

377
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:06,579
He's Jewish now?

378
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,875
Reform, but yeah.

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,124
And just so you know,
I'm not doing this for you.

380
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,043
This is for me.

381
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,562
I want something that matters.
I want to be a substantial human being.

382
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,967
You know what I mean?
Substantial.

383
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,980
Substantial.

384
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,504
He's substantially wet.

385
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,519
I think you should change him, papa.

386
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:33,948
All right.

387
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:36,151
What's up?

388
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,785
All right, come on, little buddy.

389
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,239
Let's see what you're packing
downstairs.

390
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:46,202
Let's see what's going on down here.

391
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,179
I know it.

392
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:51,173
Bun's still on the hot dog.

393
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,164
Right, that.
I got to take care of that.

394
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,352
- Next checkup.
- Checkup?

395
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:58,997
A briss with a mohel and a Rabbi.

396
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:02,305
Yeah, bagels and whitefish.
Those are my demands.

397
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,330
- Demands?
- That's right. 'cause I'm the papa.

398
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:07,433
I'm the papa.

399
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,768
- Tradition.
- Oy.

400
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:24,342
Who are all these people?

401
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,054
The Rabbi brought them.

402
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,871
You need 10 Jews to watch him
lose his dick head or it's not official.

403
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,006
That's it.
Mazel tov.

404
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,257
Let's name this baby and eat.

405
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,068
Nice work, Rabbi.

406
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,104
Well, thank you.
I've been at it a while.

407
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:57,815
- What do you practice on?
- Goyim.

408
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:00,818
I think it's a barbaric ritual.

409
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,155
Well, it represents a covenant
between our people and God.

410
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,158
- It decreases pleasure.
- Paid for my summer house.

411
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,060
Oh, excuse me.

412
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,915
Will you look at this.

413
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,240
A professional woman,
a doctor no less,

414
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,671
playing a juvenile video game.

415
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,340
It's just so immature...
For a doctor.

416
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,717
I had no idea
this game was so awesome.

417
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,191
So, clearly,

418
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,721
you're open to looking
beyond first impressions.

419
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,289
I didn't say that.

420
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,808
Damn, I just died.

421
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,310
You are here

422
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,939
'cause you like me, aren't you?

423
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,357
I'm here because Nancy invited me.

424
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,443
And I am fascinated by how

425
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,644
this is gonna play out
with the gangster baby-daddy.

426
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,669
I'm obsessed with the drama.

427
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:50,760
- You were mean.
- I was honest. That's not mean.

428
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,111
It was harsh.
It was a snap judgment.

429
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,668
I'm almost inclined
to not ask you out again

430
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,750
just to show you how wrong
you are about me.

431
00:22:58,282 --> 00:22:59,544
- Almost?
- Almost.

432
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,713
Almost.

433
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:07,844
All right. Whitefish?

434
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:11,264
Dimes go in the lipsticks.

435
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,808
Eighths go in the compacts.

436
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:17,061
Half ounces in the eye-shadow kit.

437
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,203
This is exciting.

438
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,841
When are you gonna break
the news to Doug and Silas?

439
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:24,449
I'm working up to that.

440
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:27,280
Well, you better do it soon
before that swelling goes down.

441
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,324
You fractured my cheekbone.

442
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,617
There's some old gym equipment
in the garage.

443
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,119
I've been lifting.

444
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,746
You look good.

445
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Thank you.

446
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,839
- From a drawer?
- That's right.

447
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:51,054
- Can you fix it or not?
- Go see a doctor.

448
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:52,981
I don't have any insurance.

449
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:55,683
I've been taping it to a popsicle stick,
and it's turning blue.

450
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:57,473
Try cherry.

451
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,799
What are you looking at?

452
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,533
I did not approve this.

453
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,869
Now he looks like his daddy.

454
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:18,414
And you, too, from what I hear.
But slightly smaller.

455
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:21,209
My son is not Jewish.

456
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,477
Oh, yeah, he is now.

457
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:25,380
It's an ancient
and scholarly religion.

458
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,840
Disproportionate numbers
of nobel prize winners.

459
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:31,761
- Meet my son... Avi Melech.
- That's his Hebrew name.

460
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:35,260
"Avi" means "my father."
"Melech", the king.

461
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:36,307
That's my boy.

462
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,942
In english, it's Steven Ray Botwin.

463
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,245
Stevie Ray.

464
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:44,144
Would you like a bagel
with whitefish?

465
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,986
I'm gonna have to speak
with you privately.

466
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:03,751
This is unacceptable.

467
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,701
My son, our son,

468
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:09,674
will be baptized
by a priest in a church.

469
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,448
Sorry, he's Jewish.

470
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,809
Snip, snip.

471
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,305
Eat fish.
Start saving for law school.

472
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,558
I am his father.
I choose his life.

473
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,533
You had your chance to choose.

474
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:21,908
You walked out.

475
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,888
I have to think about the baby now.

476
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:26,482
You think about yourself.
Don't pretend that's a mother's love.

477
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,986
From the man who refused to put his name
on his own son's birth certificate!

478
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,280
My son's not gonna be raised
by that <I>pendejo</I>!

479
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,365
That <I>pendejo</I> sticks around.

480
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:38,494
He fights for what he loves.
And he's not a coward.

481
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,210
Get out.

482
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,296
My son won't grow up to be like you.

483
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,091
He won't see you.
He won't know you.

484
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,180
He is mine.

485
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,472
No, you lost him.
