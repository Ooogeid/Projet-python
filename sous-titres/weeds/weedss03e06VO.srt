1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,487
- ... supervised.
- You sold $2.000 in a day.

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:05,159
- Impressive huh?
- Your brother is mad at me.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,576
- I put him in majestic summer school.
- Maybe you and I can solve a murder.

4
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:11,993
Blood samples point
to Kyle and Jill.

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,145
Jill had an abortion!

6
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:18,648
I'm setting in front of you documents
which will honorably discharge you

7
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:20,665
from the US army reserves.

8
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,699
- Can you grow here?
- Hell yeah it's perfect.

9
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,606
Allright, teach me some
more grow business.

10
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:27,691
Guillermo's crew is all moody
'cause I jacked his horse.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,517
I left you a package
in the garage.

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,712
I need you to hold on to it
for a spell.

16
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,893
Good morning.
you want huevos rancheros?

17
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,163
Why are you cooking
without clothes?

18
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:38,561
No I have underwear on.

19
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,540
There's a cotton barrier between
my eggs and yours.

20
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,398
Would you please take a walk
into the laundry room with me?

21
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,395
Oh, please tell me there's
not a body in there.

22
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:04,998
- Yowza.
- Heroin.

23
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,321
- Heroin-o-licious.
- Oh put it back.

24
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,499
Are you a smack dealer
now Nancy?

25
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:20,112
Oh, bringing the hammer, down!

26
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,441
turnin' out the bitch!

27
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:25,103
- Hardcore!
- How much is it worth?

28
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:27,762
I'm no expert.

29
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:32,631
I've heard tar is worth between
$40,000 and $80,000 a key,

30
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,974
and we've got 20 keys
in there, and that's wholesale.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,923
Once you break down into
chunks and balloons,

32
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,681
you're talking about
10 times that.

33
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:40,667
It's awesome.

34
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,895
Calm down, you
don't understand.

35
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,156
Oh, wait, is your...
oh, jesus, Andy!

36
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:50,532
What? That's a lot of money,
I'm excited for us.

37
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,503
Are you insane?
This isn't ours.

38
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:55,492
We're not heroin dealers.

39
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:58,386
That stuff scares the
shit out of me.

40
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,711
- Hello?
- Good, you're up.

41
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,167
- <i>We're throwing a party.</i>
- Are we?

42
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,110
I had a vision in the
middle of the night.

43
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:14,826
Think big and festive.

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,897
Mixed drinks, strong,
<i>and real food</i>

45
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,977
<i>None of that California
healthy crap.</i>

46
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,694
Fried things,
wrapped in bacon.

47
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,641
- Crowd pleasers.
- When are we throwing this party?

48
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:30,012
<i>Tomorrow, for the Agrestic city council.</i>
And whoever else matters

49
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:31,676
in wherever the
fuck it is you live.

50
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,904
Nice, tomorrow,
as in 24 hours?

51
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:37,507
Well, I was thinking late
afternoon, so it's more like 31.

52
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,444
Your budget's 5 grand.
make it look like $10,000.

53
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:43,744
<i>I've emailed you a guest list:
mayor asshole, council man asshole,</i>

54
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:46,725
<i>any other important assholes
you can think of, add them on.</i>

55
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,676
- <i>Is this gonna be a problem?</i>
- No, no, all good.

56
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:52,978
<i>Great, wear something that
shows off those sexy legs.</i>

57
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:55,207
<i>I look forward to seeing
where they end sometime.</i>

58
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:57,621
That's your one for the day.

59
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:04,130
- Did I, uh, hear "party"?
- Yes, for the city council, go on.

60
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:08,319
- Get out of here.
- Aw politicians, shit, this is perfect.

61
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,897
We can unload at least a key.

62
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:13,538
These are U-turn's drugs, and he's
going to take them back.

63
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:20,425
You... are going to shave...
and find a clean shirt.

64
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,370
because you are going to
cater this soiree,

65
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:25,177
because we are going to have
the party here tomorrow night.

66
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,790
Here? Not a restaurant or a hall?

67
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,019
Not if we want to make
4 grands.

68
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,002
Take $1,000.
make it look like $5,000.

69
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,417
I don't remember volunteering my
services, maybe I have plans tomorrow.

70
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,211
Maybe I have a playdate

71
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,387
- You live here for free.
- Yes.

72
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,770
You eat my food, you wipe your
ass with my toilet paper.

73
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,757
I don't have to ask you shit.

74
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,326
Get in there and finish
frying your eggs,

75
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:55,776
think of a menu that includes
pork-wrapped items.

76
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,103
And wash your hands.

77
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,460
I need now is for the boys to
eat heroin eggs for breakfast.

78
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,643
Right, cuz then they'd
want it everyday.

79
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,791
Welcome, to your
new home miss Hodes.

80
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:11,978
We've got it promised out next week,
some folk shooting a movie,

81
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:15,057
But after that,
she's all yours.

82
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,549
Thank you Sullivan Groff.

83
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,963
Of course, we'll have to keep it in
the corporation's name

84
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,174
for the first six months...

85
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,227
A house is a fat piece of swag to hide.

86
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:26,635
Oh it works for me.

87
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,150
Keeps it out of my husband's
stubby, little sausage fingers.

88
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,405
- Husband?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,513
- You're not wearing a ring.
- I'm separated.

90
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,028
Dancing my way to divorce.

91
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:43,427
This is an amazing living room.

92
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,793
They call this "the great room".

93
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,717
This... is the room that
sells the house.

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,373
Oh, flat screen goes right here.

95
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,835
- What the fuck?
- Here, get behind me.

96
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,041
God!

97
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,555
"Whore"...

98
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:11,852
- "Cunt"!
- Cunt.

99
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,771
And another "whore".

100
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:16,690
"Whore"... fucking Doug.

101
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,698
But you got to admit, he's quite
accurate with a 5 iron.

102
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,913
I'm not dressed for this.

103
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,541
You said you wanted to talk.
this is my fitness time.

104
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:35,205
Ow, quit it!

105
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,265
Bob and weave, Bob and weave.

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,588
Oh, no, too slow.

107
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:40,993
- Come on!
- Ok.

108
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,356
When are you coming to take
your trunk out of my house?

109
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:46,432
- Oh you looked didn't you?
- It's in my house.

110
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:48,239
And there it shall remain,
grasshopper.

111
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,512
Listen...

112
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:56,512
I'm throwing a party tomorrow, it can't
be storage space for your... heroin.

113
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,542
Get the trunk, out of
my house, now.

114
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:02,695
No more complaining.
Now, move your feet!

115
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:03,937
Come on!

116
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,581
What am I doing here?

117
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,455
You are working off your debt
and your ass.

118
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,420
Keep moving.

119
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,573
- What do you want from me?
- I'm thinking about grooming you.

120
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,966
I'm thinking about the future.

121
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,965
Yeah, that's 'cause Marvin
is a fat fool!

122
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:23,132
Maybe one day
you'll be my lieutenant.

123
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:26,051
- No, thank you.
- Oh!

124
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:27,872
Okay...

125
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,390
Yeah, I wasn't asking,
and you ain't there yet.

126
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,766
Just keep on watching
and learning,

127
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,211
and we'll see what happens.

128
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,020
Never turn down
an opportunity to learn.

129
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,581
- You're right.
- No, I'm left.

130
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,403
See? See what I'm saying?

131
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,114
Listen... when we done here,

132
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:45,194
I'm gonna give you an address
downtown, 7:30 sharp.

133
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:47,197
- It's a surprise.
- I don't like surprises.

134
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:48,536
You're gonna like this one.

135
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:51,201
Now, come on!
keep dancing, girl! Aah!

136
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,498
Bingo!

137
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,624
Oh, so close.

138
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,757
All right, new game.

139
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,016
Picture frame.

140
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:01,022
So that means we fill out the
whole outer edge of the card...

141
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,329
Top row, bottom row, side,
and side, all filled in.

142
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:08,639
Now, this is a long one, everyone,
so settle in...

143
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:10,704
and let's bingo!

144
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:14,456
It's an indica blend, so it's
not too harsh, not too heady.

145
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,615
It has a real calming effect.

146
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:20,357
Son, I don't need a sales pitch.

147
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,756
Just tell me this...
Will it fuck me up?

148
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,152
Yes, sir,
it will fuck you up good.

149
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,696
Benine.

150
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:33,922
Good news. Your tumor is B-9.

151
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,273
B-9

152
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,935
Hurry up and give it to me.

153
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,640
This girl is giving me a headache.

154
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,314
Before

155
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:46,910
- And after.
- Very good!

156
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:48,577
Before.

157
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,310
N-37.

158
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:57,193
It is a known fact that in africa,

159
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,841
the lions rule the Serengeti plain.

160
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,908
All right,
I need you to try one of each.

161
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,898
I have stuffed mushrooms,

162
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,288
little smokies wrapped in bacon,

163
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,143
chicken satay, and rumaki.

164
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,865
Feast and praise.

165
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:14,972
Is this dinner?

166
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,695
Yeah, sure, I guess. try.

167
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,194
This sucks.

168
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,302
How can it suck?
it's wrapped in bacon.

169
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:26,453
Not the food.

170
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:30,392
This... Me and you.
I want family dinner

171
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,740
I need to talk to mom.

172
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,882
I'm your uncle. talk to me.

173
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,212
Can you convince mom

174
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,560
that I'm better off
sitting home all summer

175
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,293
than stuck in a classroom
full of religious zealots

176
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,757
proselytizing
a form of fundamentalism

177
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,522
that's two klicks away from jihad?

178
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:49,579
Maybe you better talk to your mom.
Try another smoky.

179
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,177
When's mom coming home?

180
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:54,338
Uh, not sure. She has
a "ladies in business" thing.

181
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,304
She's at a drug thing, isn't she?

182
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,463
No.

183
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,356
Yeah, she's at a drug thing.
your mother's a drug dealer.

184
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:02,437
Why do you make me say it? Why?

185
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,333
- Bud, where you going?
- I'm not hungry.

186
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,232
Okay, no more hors d'oeuvres.
I'll make some pasta.

187
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:11,047
We'll watch bikini
chicks eat crickets.

188
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,682
No, thanks.

189
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:14,627
I'm gonna go read.

190
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,839
Reading?
You kids today and your reading.

191
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,128
<i>The male's barbed penis</i>

192
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,569
<i>will make sex so painful
for the female</i>

193
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:32,058
<i>that she snarls and snaps at
him when he retreats.</i>

194
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,448
<i>So he bites the scruff of her
neck to hold her down.</i>

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,333
<i>Now, the bite may appear to be
dangerous and aggressive...</i>

196
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,007
Someone get the door!

197
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:51,202
- Who is it?
- I don't know who it is,

198
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,871
because someone hasn't
put up my security cameras

199
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,358
like I asked 17 times.

200
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:57,105
Hey, I'm working the crops here.

201
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,238
You ain't doing nothing
but smoking mores

202
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,595
and running water
through dollhouses.

203
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:03,159
Why don't you get your ass up
a ladder and do it?

204
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,832
- Should I get it?
- yeah, see who it is.

205
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:10,205
What I do with my time
is none of your damn business.

206
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,672
And when I ask you to do
something, you fucking do it,

207
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,515
'cause I'm your aunt, I'm your
elder, and I will beat you down.

208
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,863
It ain't like you don't know we
supposed to have a security s...

209
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,985
What the fuck you doing here?

210
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,780
Don't just stand there...
invite a nigga in.

211
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:32,206
Next time I ring your bell, you
better hurry up and let me in.

212
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,315
Next time you in my face, gargle.

213
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:37,242
Oh, you a wild girl, Vaneeta.

214
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,740
Why'd you bring him here?

215
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,568
He brought me. it was a surprise.

216
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,450
I didn't even know
about this place.

217
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,920
I know everything.

218
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:46,719
Now, come over here.

219
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,828
I don't want my soldiers
fraternizing with the help.

220
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,352
This is not me.

221
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,264
How could you think I'd like this?

222
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,094
The fun's just getting started.

223
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,222
Now, where's our crop?

224
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,586
It ain't ready.

225
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,006
What you mean, "it ain't ready"?!

226
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,727
Y'all had a minute to get
this place up and running.

227
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:06,704
Y'all got more excuses
than a nigger in court.

228
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,949
Pull it up, dry it out!
let's hit the streets!

229
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,409
Come on, let's move, now!

230
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:11,754
Look, I told you...

231
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,704
It ain't ready.

232
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,070
Can't force nature.

233
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,711
Oh, no? Hmm.

234
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,091
Seedless watermelon...

235
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:24,618
Broccoflower, aprium...
half apricot, half plum.

236
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,412
Bullshit, you can't force nature.

237
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:29,598
They even got a hypoallergenic
cat you can buy for 4 grand.

238
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,306
Knock over a plant.

239
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:36,846
What?

240
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,966
You need to learn to wreck shit.

241
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,945
Let them know you mean business.

242
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,642
Look, I'm all for wrecking shit
to make a point.

243
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,001
I do it with my kids all the time.
But we're wrecking our own shit.

244
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,229
Don't argue with me.

245
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,769
Just go over there
and bust some shit up

246
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,631
before I have to bust one of
them up, and wait for my cue.

247
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,366
So, y'all motherfuckers
think we playin', huh?

248
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,421
I want my fuckin'crop in a month!

249
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:09,636
Now, do it right!

250
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:10,783
Fine.

251
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,181
All right, louis...

252
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:18,605
Show's over.

253
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,421
You'll get your fuckin'crops,

254
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,338
and then we're done with your ass.

255
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,016
Your grandmother always said
you were a bad seed.

256
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:31,793
Now look at you...
full-grown shit bush.

257
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,578
You old fool.

258
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,054
It's over when I say it's over.

259
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,435
Aah!

260
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:47,228
All right, Nancy, let's go.

261
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,909
Did you fuckin'apologize?

262
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:54,925
What's the matter with you?

263
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,413
Listen, "thug" means never
having to say you're sorry.

264
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,502
An underground canal
will carry the sewage

265
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:05,638
right through agrestic

266
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,789
to our water-treatment plant
in van nuys.

267
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,737
- Are you coming to the party later?

268
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,382
- Yes
- Well, how about being my date?

269
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:14,936
We're ready to break ground, sir.

270
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,224
What do you want now?

271
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,497
You ever watch a man
play with a big machine?

272
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,885
Not for a long time, but you
still didn't answer my question.

273
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,544
Get over your issues, celia.

274
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,064
I want you.

275
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,914
Let's just start with a date,
and we'll take it from there.

276
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,480
- okay, stop right there.
- can I help you?

277
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,195
- Mr. Groff?
- Dumb name.

278
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,361
- And you are?
- Warden Shlapobersky,

279
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,657
from the wildlife commission.

280
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,875
A mammal on our
endangered-species list

281
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,218
may lose its habitat
with this new construction.

282
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:46,008
We have to insist
that you halt all work

283
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,865
until we've further
investigated the matter.

284
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,679
Let me guess... the dirt shrew.

285
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,869
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,672
Looks like a jackrabbit
and a big rat fucked.

287
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,967
You're not getting
anything else from me, wilson.

288
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,080
This store is closed.

289
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,577
Well, this project is on hold

290
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,511
until there's a full report
on the dirt shrew,

291
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,163
and I'm referring to
the endangered animal,

292
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:05,027
not the one
in the hard hat and heels

293
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,543
who's been sucking your dick.

294
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,189
I said, "don't let me move"!

295
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,151
You're big. you're a large man.

296
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,735
It's hard to keep you in one place.

297
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:18,880
I don't let you move.

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,732
Shut the fuck up!
I ain't talking to you!

299
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:23,823
Tell him to shut his fuckin'mouth.

300
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,615
Shut your fucking mouth, Marvin!

301
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,259
That's good.

302
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,442
Oh, that was really good.

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,251
Hey, listen,
if you don't really need me,

304
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:37,944
I need to go to the flower mart

305
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,044
to pick up some Casablanca
Lilies for my boss's party, and...

306
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,368
and I hear that all the wedding planners
get there early and buy them all.

307
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:47,460
He'll kill me if this party tanks.

308
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,455
You're being hyperbolic.

309
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,512
I don't think
he'll actually kill you.

310
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:55,566
But me...

311
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,605
I'm a different matter.

312
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:03,252
- Put your hand on my shoulder.
- Why?

313
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:05,665
It helps me pay attention
to my form! Do it!

314
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,789
Review time.

315
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,517
What did we learn last night?

316
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,728
Lesson... make an impact.

317
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:22,122
I'm a drug dealer...

318
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,027
... And I'm great at what I do.

319
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,104
Don't you want to be great
at what you do?

320
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:30,401
Yeah.

321
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:34,379
You been learning good, novice.

322
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,203
But you got to do better.

323
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,077
More money...

324
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:40,119
Results...

325
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:41,660
Faster.

326
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,704
Now go get those lilies.

327
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,030
Hi, we haven't
officially met. I'm Tara.

328
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:02,678
Silas.

329
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,540
Hmm, community-service boy.

330
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,126
I saw you sell mr. Mertes
an eighth.

331
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:10,965
Nice cross.

332
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,702
Yes, well, I'm tight with the lord.

333
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,304
So, he's aware you can spot
an eighth from across the room?

334
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:21,223
He is. In fact, he, uh,
he likes it when I get stoned.

335
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,716
We have some great talks.

336
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:26,750
Are you gonna tell on me?

337
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,030
Not if you smoke me out.

338
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,574
Right now?

339
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:36,103
Tomorrow. Same time.

340
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,885
Gladwell park.

341
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,183
Uh, smoke me out, and
I'll tell you about my friend.

342
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,462
Jesus.

343
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,458
That's the one.

344
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,422
Hey, hey,
go easy on the jumbo shrimp.

345
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,732
Those are expensive.

346
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,299
Dumb name can afford it.

347
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:02,140
(Hey, hey, shh!)

348
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:03,938
You got to let it go, man.

349
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,895
Love the food, pal.

350
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:07,851
Want you to give
a friend of mine a call.

351
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,606
We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses.

352
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:13,115
Needs a caterer.
you'll thank me later.

353
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,073
Hey, you did a good job.

354
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,634
How much of the budget
did you stuff in your bra?

355
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:22,818
Uh, half.

356
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,270
- Can I feel?
- No

357
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,422
In that case, next time,
spring for a hall.

358
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:31,002
Now, you see that fella...

359
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,699
Baldy, the white-haired clown?

360
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,380
Let me know
when he's good and shitfaced.

361
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,993
I need his signature on something.

362
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,097
And that woman there
in the chanel knockoff...

363
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,173
She needs the recipe
for the stuffed mushrooms.

364
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,123
She's a big fan.
she's also someone's wife.

365
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,274
I need to borrow her
for a minute.

366
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,772
You are going to talk to me.

367
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,282
In, in. Okay, listen.

368
00:18:56,863 --> 00:19:00,059
I know we're in the middle
of the party and everything,

369
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:03,373
but, Nancy,
you have got to stop hating me.

370
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,055
- I don't hate you.
- But you do.

371
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:07,609
Celia, I don't.

372
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,335
Listen, you got me a job.

373
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,066
What's done is done. I don't want to
fight anymore. Let's just leave it.

374
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,090
Good, then.

375
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,535
- Okay ?
- I'm glad.

376
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,568
- Great.
- Goddamn it!

377
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,767
These fucking
ankle-strap shoes.

378
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:30,150
Has Sullivan
ever talked about me?

379
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:33,064
- What?
- Has he ever mentioned me?

380
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,949
Yes. He calls you
the hot redhead.

381
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:39,968
Are you sure
he was talking about me?

382
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,167
Because I've always thought
I was more...

383
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,483
...Auburn with, like,
strawberry blond highlights.

384
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:49,461
He was definitely talking
about you. He likes you.

385
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:50,998
You should go be with him.

386
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:54,559
Nancy, there you are. Matt Keefe
doesn't have  a drink in his hand.

387
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:55,716
Hey, man, what's up?

388
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,844
Did you tell some woman
in a Chanel knockoff

389
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,740
she could go through
my recipe box?

390
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,853
Out, out,
all of you, all of you!

391
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,044
This room is off limits!

392
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:04,576
Okay? Out. Get out.

393
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,063
- I'm really glad...
- Get out!

394
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:11,379
What are you doing down here?

395
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,255
These little smokies
are like crack.

396
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:14,465
Don't eat too many of them.

397
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,051
They're filled with nitrates.

398
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,887
I really have to talk to you.

399
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,228
Well, bad time.

400
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:20,667
We'll talk later. I promise.

401
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:30,911
You look beautiful tonight.

402
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:32,711
Thank you.

403
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,589
I want to thank you
for being my date.

404
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,212
You're welcome.

405
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,106
You know
I'm gonna keep trying.

406
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:52,531
Good.

407
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,553
Who are you?

408
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,044
A sheep in god's flock.

409
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:27,759
Let me hear you say "baa."

410
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:33,193
You want a drink?

411
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:36,246
Mr. Johnson gave it to me
after he confused me with his war buddy.

412
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,494
I don't drink.

413
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:40,917
Wine's okay
because jesus drank that,

414
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,992
but, other than wine,
I don't drink.

415
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:46,536
But you smoke.

416
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,307
Only weed, not cigarettes.

417
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,598
Never cigarettes.

418
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:55,709
You don't drink,
you don't smoke cigarettes.

419
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:58,327
Let me guess...
you don't have sex either?

420
00:21:58,487 --> 00:21:59,949
Not until I'm married.

421
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:08,108
How can you be all into jesus
and still smoke weed?

422
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,748
Because pot is natural.

423
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,269
It's not processed.

424
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:17,152
It's made by god himself,

425
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:18,831
so it's spiritual,

426
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:21,652
elevates you, opens your mind,

427
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,597
and that's what god's love
is all about.

428
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:28,953
I can see your boner.

429
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:30,911
Fuck.

430
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:32,639
Don't be embarrassed.

431
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:35,877
I mean, that's
part of god's love, too.

432
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:37,952
Once you're married.

433
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,086
You're right.
My virginity is for my husband...

434
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:45,057
But that doesn't mean
we can't have some fun.

435
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:10,869
You okay?

436
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:12,706
Of course.

437
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,125
I was just at this party
last night

438
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,241
and fell up on two
big-booty freaks, that's all.

439
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:21,259
- They kept a brother up all night.
- I'm coming!

440
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:24,210
Keeping up with my heart rate,
swinging my arms.

441
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,547
You gonna let him beat you?

442
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:28,197
Come on! First one
to the next tree wins!

443
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,196
U-Turn? Oh, my god.

444
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:37,422
Oh, my god. Marvin!

445
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,652
What is it?
What's wrong with him?

446
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,237
He got high blood pressure.

447
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,462
I saw some people
at the bottom of the hill.

448
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:49,014
Run and ask them if they have
a banana. He needs potassium!

449
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:50,421
I'll stay here.
you'll be okay.

450
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,297
You bitch-ass bitch...

451
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,278
I got you now.

452
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:19,140
This is for saying I was too
stupid to be your second in command.

453
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:23,818
And this is for laughing at me
for going to "Dreamgirls"

454
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,357
and for never
letting me count the money.

455
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:28,656
You gonna die, motherfucker.

456
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:46,799
Don't die on me, coz!

457
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,523
No one has any bananas.

458
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,348
We need to get him
out of here.

459
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,496
Let's pick him up.

460
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,389
U-Turn's dead!

461
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,564
He's dead!

462
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:58,566
What am I supposed to
do now, man?!

463
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,217
What the fuck
am I supposed to do, man?!
