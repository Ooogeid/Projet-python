1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,360
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,750
what was it like?

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,610
Confusing, brisk, messy.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,330
How's your mom doing in rehab?

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,310
I can't visit till she's detoxed.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,320
- Chilea?
- Celia.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,280
Oh, ain't we fancy.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,700
You're gonna have to take that fucking
attitude out the door right now, you hear me?

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,000
Head cheese sandwich.

10
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:21,490
Six inch or foot long?

11
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,046
Foot long all the way, bro.

12
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,125
Enjoy.

13
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:25,497
It's her, man.

14
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,793
She didn't get fat, did she?

15
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,713
No. She's beautiful.

16
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,981
Se—or doug? W-what are you doing?

17
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,500
I want to make the sexo with you, baby.

18
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,300
But we do not know each other.

19
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,821
Okay, I hear you. Can
I just see one boob?

20
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,813
Go get miss hodes a glass of water.

21
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:44,932
Now, agent shlatter.

22
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:49,201
Deliver me guillermo garcia gomez.

23
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,551
I don't know of any gomez.

24
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:51,870
If I did once, I don't anymore.

25
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:53,932
Not what I hear.

26
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:55,631
What the fuck?

27
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,523
Exactly. What the fuck? This
is supposed to be a pot tunnel.

28
00:00:58,536 --> 00:00:59,492
It's a tunnel.

29
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,943
There's no magical "weed
only" sign at the entrance.

30
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:05,133
Cut the shit.

31
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,863
Guillermo.

32
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:11,782
Garcia...

33
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:14,173
gomez.

00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,010
I asked you toonome alE.

38
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:31,853
Agent shlatter's my partner.

39
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,363
And so your word is shit.

40
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:36,380
My word is shit?

41
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:39,112
You called. I'm here.

42
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:40,691
Gomez.

43
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,081
I need assurances.

44
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,630
What kind of assurances?

45
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:46,622
Everything I ask for, I get.

46
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,473
I'm not your daddy.

47
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:49,823
Hey, I'm not fucking around here.

48
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:53,323
This information I have,
very few people have it.

49
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,230
I'm listening.

50
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:01,350
It's gonna look like it came from me.

51
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:04,463
It cannot look like it came from me.

52
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:07,161
More important than anything
you do with this information,

53
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:10,533
it must not look like it came from me.

54
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:11,522
Okay.

55
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,693
You make a bust, I do
not go down with it.

56
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,602
My people do not go down with it.

57
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,822
- Still, it never comes back to me.
- Fine.

58
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,750
My name never appears
on any piece of paper.

59
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:22,752
No one ever speaks my name.

60
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,832
- This meeting never happened.
- Done.

61
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:25,921
I will not be fleeing.

62
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,191
My family will not be going
into witness protection

63
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:31,171
because there will be no reason for
us to go into witness protection.

64
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:34,212
You're getting repetitive.

65
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,300
There's a tunnel.

66
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:48,802
So, I go to see one of my kids in the foster
home, and I'm beggin' him to forgive me.

67
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:52,341
******

68
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:55,940
"Who are you, lady?I ain't your kid."

69
00:02:55,956 --> 00:03:00,773
I'm thinkin', "my own boy
doesn't even recognize me."

70
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:03,963
That's the saddest thing ever.

71
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,610
But it ain'T.

72
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:10,861
The saddest thing is, I was so
fucked up, I went in the wrong house.

73
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:15,321
It was so devastating,
I miscarried right there.

74
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:18,452
Thanks for sharing. Celia?

75
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,452
I thought i had hit bottom.

76
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:27,453
But after hearing your stories, I
realize it could be so much worse.

77
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,101
The truth is,

78
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:37,632
none of you have any chance in hell of
ever pulling your lives back together,

79
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,193
if you even had lives to begin with.

80
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:45,903
As I have listened to your tales of
burning wreckage and shattered existence,

81
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:52,360
I realize that i am the only one
here that has any chance at all --

82
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:58,242
a chance to make amends
and to start over...

83
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,460
fresh.

84
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,883
Stupid-ass bitch.

85
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,001
- Andy?
- Yeah?

86
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,540
Hi, maria.

87
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm so sorry.

88
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,982
No, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry.

89
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,963
okay, no towel. One sec.

90
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,762
What you doing here?

91
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:35,540
You have beein my eams.

92
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:39,513
Oh, yeah? H, yea well,dreams are weird.

93
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:44,351
Uh, I have this recurring one where
I'm playing pool with lou dobbs.

94
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,872
And suddenly, his big,
fat stomach opens up

95
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:51,572
and these nasty teeth grow out
of his torn, fat, marbled flesh.

96
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:53,430
Please make love to me.

97
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:56,721
Oh, n ino, can't do that.

98
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,162
Do you not t nktti am aractive?

99
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:03,971
Yeoh, Who locked the fuckin'
do-- you're very attractive, yeah.

100
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,220
I think you are attractive.

101
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:09,291
M, u but doug.

102
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,013
He is not the man for me. U are.

103
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,433
Okay.

104
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,450
You are excited.

105
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,521
Nono. It's jndt wiy out.

106
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:19,571
I do not think it is the wind.

107
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:26,291
Lou dobbs. Lou dobbs.
Lou dobbs. Ou dobbs.

108
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:31,241
Lou dobbs. Lou dobbs. Lou dobbs!

109
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:34,032
No. We're going to a wedding.

110
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,743
It's casual, but
evening casual, you know?

111
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,260
I was thinking something
with a drop waist.

112
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,451
Kind of tory burch?

113
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,590
Exactly.

114
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,010
- I'll help them, sanjay.
- Well, I got it.

115
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:49,352
No, I need you to
redress the mannequins.

116
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,301
Well, it's about time. Can I do a theme?

117
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,782
Yeah. Go for it.

118
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:57,070
Um, the dressing rooms
are back this way.

119
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:01,291
Just let me know if you
need help with anything.

120
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,893
I'm thinking shades
of blue for the window.

121
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:12,992
And I'm thinking that that man
you just helped is gay, gay, gay!

122
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:14,091
The guy in the couple?

123
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,203
Not a couple. There's weirdness.

124
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:20,193
I'd say maybe she's his surrogate,
but he called her "wife."

125
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:21,610
It's a puzzler.

126
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,503
They're a nice, married
couple having a baby.

127
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:25,902
They're not a couple.

128
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,490
You need to get your gaydar checked.

129
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,782
Uh, listen, breeder, my
gaydar is never wrong.

130
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:33,131
That man hearts cock.

131
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:36,201
Clearly, he hearted her
vagina at some point.

132
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:37,543
You ever hear of in vitro?

133
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:43,413
So what? Religious and societal pressures
have forced him to live the lie of domesticity?

134
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:48,011
Or maybe... he's a cop.

135
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,821
- What?
- Oh, that's it.

136
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:59,453
He's an undercover cop here
to scope us out and bust us...

137
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:04,172
and then ask me out.

138
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,700
All right.

139
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,712
Of course. That's got to be it.

140
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:10,962
Oh, I'm telling you.

141
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,631
Get back to your vision in blue.
Leave the nice couple alone.

142
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:17,763
I'm going, but know this -- no straight
man knows what a drop-waist dress is.

143
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:21,270
And if he does, he denies it.

144
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:28,746
I really do not feel
like going back to class.

145
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,795
Fuck class.

146
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,517
Shit! I think something just bit me.

147
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,351
Could you not blow smoke in my hair?

148
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,003
You should dye it black.

149
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,972
It would look totally cool black.

150
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:42,093
Let's break into the science
lab and get high on nitrous.

151
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,791
They keep it in a locked cabinet.

152
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,883
We could break the glass
with a fire extinguisher.

153
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:50,351
Yeah, 'cause no one would hear the sound of breaking
glass in the science lab in the middle of the afternoon.

154
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,740
- But I want to get high.
- Me too.

155
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:55,190
- I could get some pot.
- Shane!

156
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,581
Mind your own business.

157
00:07:56,595 --> 00:08:00,080
- Can you get it like now?
- Sure.

158
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:03,411
I'm going to class. Are you coming?

159
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,693
No. He's gonna hang with us.

160
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,891
I'm gonna hang with them.

161
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,581
You two are totally making
me reconsider fucking boys.

162
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,472
You do them once, and
they become your puppet.

163
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,372
She's a dyke.

164
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,033
In that case, she should go purple.

165
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:25,233
Her hair would look totally cool purple.

166
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,113
Head cheese sandwich, please.

167
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,353
What are you doing here?

168
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,361
You heard me. I want a sandwich.

169
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:38,623
Then go to subway.

170
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:41,332
They don't have the kind I want.

171
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,680
Neither do we.

172
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,042
Oh, I think you do.

173
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,153
Fuck off.

174
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,280
Come on. Just one?

175
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,450
I'm not giving weed
to my little brother!

176
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:49,760
You gave me a condom.

177
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:53,302
That was sex, shane. This is
drugs. Why aren't you in school?

178
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:56,073
I knew you smoked when
you were 13. I saw you.

179
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:58,950
Well, you're already stupid enough.

180
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,800
With that asshole danny melcher.

181
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:04,202
You were both giggling, and then he stood up
on our water slide and took a piss in our pool.

182
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,463
You saw that?

183
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,860
Why do you think I didn't
go in the pool for a year?

184
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:11,020
Look, I'm not gonna sit here
and say "don't do drugs."

185
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:13,061
'Cause that would make
you a total hypocrite.

186
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:18,063
But... I'm not gonna
be your fuckin' dealer.

187
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:21,412
Hey, does anybody work here?

188
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,791
Be right out.

189
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:28,010
I'll give you 300 bucks.

190
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:33,590
Go back to school, shane.

191
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,571
Sorry about that.

192
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,071
Do you know what a barcarole is?

193
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:46,351
I do not.

194
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,243
It's a boat song.

195
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:53,573
From the days when men
serenaded women in boats.

196
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:57,652
You got a thing for boats.

197
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:02,263
The finest barcarole ever written
-- and this is not my opinion.

198
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:06,153
It is generally agreed
upon by men of substance --

199
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,900
is the one you're hearing right now.

200
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,600
Who are the girls?

201
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:18,732
Melia, cybelle,
adelita -- my daughters.

202
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,211
No pictures of mommy?

203
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,813
She's remarried now.

204
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,582
Lives in france.

205
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,930
They're all there.

206
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,062
You don't get to see them much?

207
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:35,773
Over christmas, we're
going skiing in whistler.

208
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:38,100
This picture wasn't here before.

209
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,521
I hid it.

210
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:43,852
It was a strange thing for me to do.

211
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:48,561
You make me do things
I wouldn't usually do.

212
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,320
Where are you?

213
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,071
What?

214
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,150
Where are you?

215
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,762
You're in your head and not here.

216
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:09,091
No.

217
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm -- I'm here.
No, I'm here.I --

218
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,553
I want to tell you something.

219
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:28,902
There were more girls in
the tunnel. I know that.

220
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,951
You do?

221
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:37,141
It is the business of
dark-hearted people.

222
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,971
And you and i are not dark-hearted.

223
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:51,612
S girlwier nev hrcome
theough t tagnel ai oh.

224
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,862
Do you dance?

225
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:01,170
I do.

226
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,812
Would you care to dance
with me, nancy botwin?

227
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,862
You should say, "yes"

228
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,023
yes.

229
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,070
I threw up on my prom date.

230
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,781
charming.

231
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,383
Do you love me?

232
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,410
Are you in love with me?

233
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,393
"Are you in love with me"?

234
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:50,872
That's not an answer.

235
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:54,341
You don't ask the mayor
of tijuana if he's in love.

236
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,960
That is just not done.

237
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,053
You should have said "yes."

238
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,860
Would you like to take a trip with me?

239
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,513
Christmas in whistler with the kids?

240
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:25,092
No. Sooner. And only us.

241
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:27,083
I have a job.

242
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,092
I manage maternity world.

243
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,601
I'll have to ask.

244
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:34,433
May I have a week off?

245
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:38,480
You didn't say "please!"

246
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:42,752
Please, kind employer?

247
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,821
You may.

248
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:03,231
Patron.

249
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,403
What are...

250
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:06,581
Out!

251
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,381
It's ....

252
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,061
Tell....

253
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:12,191
He says....

254
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:13,841
red licorice.

255
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,362
S?

256
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,231
Call ....

257
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:45,382
What does that mean
-- regaliz rojo?

258
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,320
Very bad.

259
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,991
Place is really coming along, yeah.

260
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,063
Not bad, huh?

261
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,692
But as soon as we figure out our next
venture, I want to get a bigger place.

262
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm thinking generic
mexican pharmaceuticals.

263
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,170
Sell them to old people with
no insurance. What do you think?

264
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,343
Yeah. That's a great idea.

265
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,750
So, where are we eating?

266
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,432
Maria, any ideas?

267
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:27,012
Just, please, no more mexican food.

268
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,310
- cuban?
- Nothing with beans.

269
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:31,490
Andy, any ideas?

270
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,932
Maria and I had sex!

271
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:38,122
What?

272
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,572
We had sex. I'm sorry. We did.

273
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:44,003
Just once. Okay, twice.
But not two separate times.

274
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,613
One time.

275
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:48,041
And then again after.

276
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,173
You guys had sex?

277
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,381
It wasn't planned or
anything. It just happened.

278
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,811
I seduced him.

279
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,900
I feel like shit.

280
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,312
You're my friend.

281
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,702
I love you, man, and I'm --
it's tearing me up inside.

282
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,651
I had to come clean.

283
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,482
It's never gonna happen again, I swear.

284
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:12,341
It was a one-slash-two-time
thing -- meant nothing.

285
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:13,311
I love him.

286
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:17,911
No, no. You don't
love me. You love doug.

287
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,642
No. I love you, andy.

288
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:23,653
You are the best lover I have ever had.

289
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,133
Yeah, but doug's gonna
be even better, right?

290
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:29,151
I mean, he's so tall, and
he's so good with numbers.

291
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,503
She got scared, doug.

292
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:34,933
I was a fear fuck, 'cause she's so
totally into you it freaked her out.

293
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,413
Tell him, maria.

294
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,081
I'm so sorry, doug.

295
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:43,003
But sometimes, we
cannot help who we love.

296
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:48,172
Well... okay.

297
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,263
All right. I hear you.

298
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:53,133
I guess I'm glad you
were honest with me.

299
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,881
It'll never happen again.

300
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:57,172
It will. It will happen many times.

301
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,763
Stop saying that!

302
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,933
It's fine.

303
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,330
you're my best friend, and I love you.

304
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:07,653
And maria's right -- we
can't choose who we love.

305
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,800
But, maria, as much as
I've enjoyed having you,

306
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:13,180
it's a little awkward
for you to stay here now.

307
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:14,821
I understand.

308
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:17,440
You guys mind if I have a few minutes?

309
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,050
Of course, man. Take
all the time you need.

310
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,522
San diego county.

311
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:39,360
Department of immigration
and naturalization.

312
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,320
You did very good work, captain.

313
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,293
Clini--
clinique.

314
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,990
Tell your men I said that myself.

315
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,451
He'll be taken care of.

316
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,832
You'll be taken care of.

317
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,322
There's a press conference. I
should be there within the hour.

318
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,593
Jimmy jam, too.

319
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,380
- Now -- -
stay calm.

320
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,511
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

321
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,863
You?

322
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,612
Many arrests.

323
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,332
And one of guillermo's men was killed.

324
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,981
- Someone talked.
- Really?

325
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:15,832
The one with the drug
problem -- your lesbian lover.

326
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:19,663
Celia? Oh, no. No way.

327
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:22,121
She's terrified of me.

328
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:24,423
You know we're not lesbians, right?

329
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,153
I take your word.

330
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,763
What about the asian homosexual?

331
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,793
Why are we focusing on my crew?

332
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,301
My people don't talk.

333
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,643
Oh, really?

334
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:37,400
Well, someone ratted out guillermo
when he said he wanted to kill me.

335
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:38,613
What about that guy?

336
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,241
We'll be looking at everyone.

337
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,060
Will you be looking into me?

338
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,672
Should I be looking into you?

339
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:45,363
Only if you don't trust me.

340
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:50,182
Reckless, impulsive, but not suicidal.

341
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:53,552
You're gonna have your own
problems because of this.

342
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,501
Adelante.

343
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,892
Patron, the car is downstairs.

344
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:04,790
It's gonna be hard for me to see you
in the short term. You understand?

345
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,940
Of course.

346
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,691
It's an inconvenience, but we'll get by.

347
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,922
Dig another tunnel, right, cesar?

348
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:15,532
Already digging.

349
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,330
Call cesar if you run into problems.

350
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,683
I will.

351
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:32,833
Oh, I almost forgot.

352
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,853
- Yes.
- "Yes"?

353
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:39,900
The answer to last night's question.

354
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:59,012
And I'm sorry for the massive
body issues I have given you.

355
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,642
And I'm sorry for judging
your lifestyle choice.

356
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,471
If you want to love the
ladies, love those ladies.

357
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:05,562
Vagina power!

358
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,901
I'll buy you a big
strap-on for hanukkah.

359
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,773
Jesus, celia.

360
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:12,873
Okay, fine. I'm sorry about that, too.

361
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:17,283
Do you forgive me?

362
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,711
That's it? That's all you're sorry for?

363
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,210
What else is there?

364
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,040
Apology accepted.

365
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,492
Okay. Dean, you're next.

366
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:32,353
Isabel, would you mind
leaving us alone for this one?

367
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:35,351
Fine. I'll be at the pool.

368
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:46,010
Okay. Here goes.

369
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm sorry for being married
to you without ever once,

370
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:58,980
I mean, not even for a moment,
being sexually attracted to you.

371
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:03,900
I'm sorry every time we had sex
I fantasized about other men.

372
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm sorry the sight of your naked body repulsed
me to the point that I was forced to stray.

373
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:11,652
I'm so glad this is
making you feel better.

374
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,213
I'm sorry I had children with you.

375
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:16,283
I'm sorry I made a life with you.

376
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,302
That my hatred
of you --

377
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,452
- all right, enough.
- No, no, no. I'm just getting started.

378
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,161
No, you are finished!

379
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,443
I could care less about
your fucking apologies.

380
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:28,592
But we happen to have a daughter out there
who hasn't seen you in over two years,

381
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:33,092
who bore the brunt of your insensitivity
and anger and who could use an apology --

382
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:37,000
a real apology, celia, a hell
of a lot more than I could.

383
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,691
I don't know where quinn is.

384
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,030
She's living in oaxaca
with a guy named rudolfo.

385
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,461
Rudolfo?

386
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:45,820
Go. Find quinn. Make things right.

387
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:51,043
Vaya con dios.

388
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:55,511
The....

389
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,210
would....

390
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,871
without....

391
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,772
of....

392
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,350
the ....

393
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:03,783
and....

394
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,810
Let....

395
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,520
as....

396
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:11,862
We....

397
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:14,120
We....

398
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,431
We....

399
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:19,760
To....

400
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:36,420
From....

401
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:40,620
who ....

402
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,771
You...

403
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:49,213
...very carefully.

404
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:51,280
Then...

405
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,952
...do...

406
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:55,793
Let's...

407
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:09,033
- You totally rock.
- Totally.

408
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,781
I see you're still alive.

409
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,113
You're late.

410
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,190
Got stuck doing interviews. Big story.

411
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:21,990
Big spotlight shining
on that maternity store.

412
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:24,402
What am I supposed to
do now? Can I go home?

413
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:25,441
Sure.

414
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:28,400
We'll arrest you tomorrow
and make it look right.

415
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,441
Store manager. Got to question your ass.

416
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:35,801
We'll pretend to ask, and
you'll pretend to know nothing.

417
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:39,553
And we'll pretend to
fuck up on a technicality.

418
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,011
Sounds like a plan.

419
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,152
What about sanjay?

420
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,531
We took him to long beach
and put him on a plane.

421
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:46,451
And guillermo?

422
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:50,262
Guillermo's going away for a
long time, and so is his crew.

423
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:54,563
There was some international confusion.

424
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,301
Who is guillermo's boss?

425
00:23:58,156 --> 00:23:59,241
I have no idea.

426
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:02,520
Well, I hope that's the truth 'cause
we got you covered on this side.

427
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:05,020
But they play a harder game down south.

428
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:06,041
You should know that.

429
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:09,321
You make it look right, I'll be fine.

430
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:36,882
Agent shlatter, I think
it is your partner.

431
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:44,450
Maybe we let it go to voicemail.

432
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:54,042
"Informant details
location of said tunnel.

433
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:58,300
Informant confirms hour of delivery."

434
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:01,882
I'm going to ask you
again the same question.

435
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:05,373
Who is "informant"?

436
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:08,340
I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know.

437
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,620
He's...

438
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:13,362
Get...

439
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:15,223
Then...

440
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:39,303
I did not hear you.

441
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:42,590
One more time, amigo.

442
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:51,891
Nancy botwin.
