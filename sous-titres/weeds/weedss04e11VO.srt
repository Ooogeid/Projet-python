00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:06,926
Previously on <i>Weeds</i>...

2
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:08,688
- What are these?
- Snacks.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,598
- Heavy snacks.
- This is my cousin Amparo.

4
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,646
- What's wrong?
- Migraine.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,440
You got too much stress now.
This will unwind it.

6
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,732
Ayahuasca's like 30 years
of psychotherapy in one night.

7
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,204
The plant teaches you
what you need to learn.

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,227
<i>You know.</i>

9
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:28,823
<i>No more hiding.</i>

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:32,619
She's losing her shit.
The clock strikes 18, and I'm done.

11
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:37,082
- Do you party?
- They really want to have sex.

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,416
Then go do it.

13
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,984
This is the woman
your depressed amigo searches for?

14
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:43,103
- That's the one.
- We will help the sad, tall,

15
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:44,547
angry, baby man find her.

16
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,134
You're as beautiful as I remember.

17
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:51,083
- You take too many drugs.
- Mostly Xanax and coke.

18
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,088
<i>You need to keep
better care of yourself.</i>

19
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,171
Cocaine?

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,391
Coca.

21
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:59,270
If you don't deal with this,
I will call your mother.

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,316
I lie to myself all the time.

23
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:07,419
<i>I make compromises. I tell myself
I'm not doing harm when I am.</i>

24
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:09,364
I so am.

25
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:12,200
- Do you see her?
- There's no one there.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,035
Of course not.

27
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,235

29
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,846
These pop-tarts are good.

30
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:40,069
Are these pop-tarts sugar-free?

31
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,962
The regular pop-tarts aren't.

32
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,102
I don't think they make
sugar-free pop-tarts.

33
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:47,410
I'm not allowed to have these, then.
My mom doesn't let me have these.

34
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,958
Then this is a really big day for you.

35
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:54,835
Neither of your parents has a problem
with your sleeping at some...

36
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,946
boy's house they've never met?

37
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,300
They're totally cool with it.

38
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:03,519
- How bohemian.
- No, they're American.

39
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,925
I'd like to hear more
about this science project.

40
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,928
It's sort of like an experiment.

41
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:17,766
Biology.

42
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,725
You could say that.

43
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:23,041
Fascinating. Reproduction...

44
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,137
Disease.

45
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:30,358
I assume the presentation
you three are working on

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,184
will deal with those things,
in addition to volcanoes

47
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:35,562
and wind.

48
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,549
Where were you last night?

49
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,164
I'm an adult, Shane.

50
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,540
You're a child.

51
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,043
What happened here last night?

52
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,473
- Got to go.
- Bye, Shane.

53
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,931
What was that?

54
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,468
Did you have sex?

55
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm 13 years old.

56
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,681
Exactly. You're 13 years old.
They're 13 years old.

57
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:01,652
- They're in my grade.
- That's too early, Shane.

58
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:02,731
You're too...

59
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,440
- Fuck you, Judah!
- I can handle it.

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,755
Well, I can't.

61
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,798
I don't want you seeing
either of those scary,

62
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,081
little sluts again.

63
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,031
Quit pretending to be a mom.

64
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,324
Good morning.

65
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,955
- You okay?
- No! I'm not okay! Do I look okay?!

66
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,636
How did this happen?

67
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,343
You had boys.

68
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,041
Morning, señorita.

69
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,189
Señor Doug?

70
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,735
Dónde?

71
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,580
- Is this your house?
- This is my place, babe.

72
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:07,083
You passed out in the van,
and I carried you up, like a bride.

73
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,171
I tried waking you for a little nooky,
but you sleep like a corpse.

74
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,757
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just...

75
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,651
I can't believe you're really here.
You are so totally beautiful.

76
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,062
You are very kind.

77
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,783
I'm kind, and you're pretty.

78
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,855
Together, we're kind and pretty

79
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,362
and nice and beautiful.

80
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:37,899
Señor Doug?

81
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,783
- What are you doing?
- I want to make the sexo with you.

82
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,619
- But we do not know each other.
- Let's get down to it.

83
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,705
I am not some <i>piruja</i>.

84
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:47,415
We must take time.

85
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,375
You must win my affection.

86
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,212
Okay, I hear you.

87
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:54,756
Get to know each other, win your heart.

88
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>Sí.</i> Thank you.

89
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,195
Can I just see one boob?

90
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,280
The next two weeks of your life
are going to be

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,819
some of the most difficult
you have ever faced.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,537
All the pain that you've been numbing
for years with your substance addiction

93
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,151
will hit you at once,

94
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,027
and it will be excruciating.

95
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,597
But know this... you're not alone.

96
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:23,117
The people next to you
will become your best friends.

97
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,094
So get ready everyone...

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,418
because you are all about
to go through hell together.

99
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:31,706
Give it up!

100
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,574
Let's go to hell!

101
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,603
- Why is this locked?
- We're closed.

102
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,968
Who told you we were closed?

103
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:57,668
The sexy, scary, beardy one.

104
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,494
Don't you think it's conspicuous

105
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:02,177
if the whole mall is having a sale
but we're closed?

106
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,452
I do what I'm told by men
with semiautomatic weapons.

107
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,447
I'm a total bottom that way.

108
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:10,518
You look tired.

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Love tired?

110
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,628
- Sex tired?
- Tired tired. I'm just tired.

111
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,119
So, what's the haps in here?

112
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,976
Look. The crates again.

113
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:31,003
Yes.

114
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:34,549
The crates from America
going into Mexico.

115
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:35,857
You look tired.

116
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,942
What's in the crates?

117
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:39,736
Maybe you should go and lay down.

118
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,281
I'm just gonna take a little peek.

119
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,157
No.

120
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,179
- 'Cause if I peek...
- I'll shoot you.

121
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:49,537
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- It's my job.

122
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:52,544
It's your job to threaten to shoot me,
not to actually shoot me.

123
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,303
That's not pot.

124
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:14,562
Everything's fine, Sanjay.
Go back to your book.

125
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,464
- What the fuck?
- Exactly. What the fuck?

126
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,066
It's supposed to be a pot tunnel.

127
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,570
I know you ain't as slow you're acting.
It's a tunnel.

128
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,853
There's no magical "weed only" sign
at the entrance.

129
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,075
Cut the shit.

130
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:37,522
- When did the floodgates open?
- When the water got here.

131
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,353
- Head cheese sandwich.
- 6 inch or foot long?

132
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:56,930
Foot long all the way.

133
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,315
- Enjoy.
- You know it.

134
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:03,444
- Head cheese sandwich, please.
- Six inch or foot long?

135
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:04,444
Six inch.

136
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,990
There's no meat
anywhere in there, right?

137
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,150
'Cause if meat even touches the weed,
I can't smoke it.

138
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,260
- I'm vegan.
- No worries.

139
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,557
- That's $240.
- Bargain.

140
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,214
- $240.
- I gave you $5.

141
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,009
You ordered the head cheese sandwich?

142
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,554
I did. Everybody seems to like them.

143
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,474
You may actually have gotten
the wrong sandwich.

144
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:36,971
- Let me check.
- Yeah. I gave you the wrong sandwich.

145
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:38,980
- My bad.
- And we just ran out of bread.

146
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,232
You got a stack of sandwiches there.

147
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:42,984
Those were preordered.

148
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:46,632
What's going on here?

149
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:49,907
Sir, you're too fat.

150
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:52,424
You fattist.

151
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,657
I'm gonna write you up on Chowhound.

152
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,045
Your mom's a rude bitch.

153
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,503
Nice save, Mom.

154
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,689
Celia, we're waiting
for your promise partner, Barry.

155
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,200
Any idea where he is?

156
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,973
I saw him at breakfast.

157
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,225
What?

158
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,699
Oh, right.

159
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:22,666
"I'm responsible for him,
and he's responsible for me

160
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,497
"'cause I can't do this...

161
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,695
"alone.
I do this as a we."

162
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,531
So that means...

163
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,797
I'll be right back.

164
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,472
Promise partner.

165
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,552
What are you... doing?

166
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,853
Where did you get that?

167
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,561
17 years as a commercial pilot.

168
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,306
I think I know
how to sneak shit past security.

169
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:58,063
And I can't take these places sober,
you know?

170
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:02,447
Therapy, bonding,
all the fucking yapping.

171
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,752
Hey, this ain't my first time
at the fair, okay?

172
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,912
I've been to Betty Ford,
Cottonwood, New Days,

173
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,425
Fresh Start in Albuquerque.

174
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:11,447
That place is like a whorehouse.

175
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,560
18-hour layovers in Bangkok

176
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,910
are nothing compared
to the saunas at Fresh Start.

177
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,455
You're a pilot?
Do you... fly like this?

178
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,768
Coked to the gills. You don't want
to fly with me when I'm sober.

179
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,775
I crash, we all crash.

180
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,330
Remember the Trump shuttle?

181
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,132
That was my first gig, right?
I couldn't afford blow.

182
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:33,413
Fucking Nodoz and Dexatrim.
That is no way to live.

183
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,235
I love the moment right before,
you know,

184
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,338
when you're still looking at it.

185
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:45,022
I love when it goes up your nose
and you feel fucking awesome.

186
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,066
Here.

187
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,784
I'm gonna help you.

188
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,100
Barry, I am your partner.

189
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,664
We can do this.

190
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,917
Clean and sober.

191
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:06,709
Come on.

192
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,547
Fuck off!
I was gonna share this with you.

193
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,935
- Now you're bumming me out.
- Give me the straw.

194
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,830
- Give it to me!
- That's my...

195
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,013
I snuck this in up my ass, okay?

196
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:18,889
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

197
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:19,986
You can't!

198
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,969
She was fucking forcing me
to snort coke!

199
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,353
You got to help me.

200
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:29,834
It's bullshit.

201
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,697
I spent 25 years with a woman
who didn't put out.

202
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,147
I deserve some.

203
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,954
- It's been one day.
- And a half.

204
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,437
- Right.
- I don't know what to do.

205
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,044
I mean, it's been forever
since I had to court a chick.

206
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:43,863
And let's face it...
getting laid in the'70s was easy.

207
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,325
I drove a Camaro.

208
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,127
Oh, man, I wish I grew up then.

209
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,810
I got totally shafted...

210
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,295
Fucking AIDS.

211
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,178
Ruined everyone's fun.

212
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:56,784
- I thought you got laid all the time.
- Yeah, but I had to use condoms.

213
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,170
Andy, I smuggled her here.

214
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,390
I think that merits some cockamole
on her faceadilla.

215
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,136
Possibly.

216
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,270
But...

217
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:09,586
- What do you really know about her?
- Not much.

218
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,038
Maybe I should buy her
some scented body wash.

219
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,671
Look, she's probably scared.

220
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:15,740
I mean,

221
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,428
she's totally out of her element.
Make her feel comfortable.

222
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:20,258
- How do I do that?
- Talk to her.

223
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:23,280
- OK. Talk to her. About what?
- About anything.

224
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,465
On the way over here,
we had great talks.

225
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,958
She grew up in an orphanage.
Start there.

226
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:29,688
- She's an orphan?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,387
Sweet. Daddy issues.

228
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,561
Age difference should work in my favor.

229
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,681
- <i>Hasta luego.</i>
- Thanks.

230
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,804
Finding God?

231
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,633
God finds me.

232
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,160
- You don't look well.
- No.

233
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,465
No. I'm not well.

234
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:12,174
That ayahuasca really fucked me up.

235
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:16,356
You, however, look fantastic.

236
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,645
I have a charity function.
But my love says we need to talk...

237
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,319
So...

238
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,291
charity waits.

239
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,069
What's coming through the tunnel?

240
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,136
What comes through the tunnel?

241
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,037
I am told by the people I work with,

242
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,473
the people you work with,

243
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:53,069
that boxes come through that tunnel.

244
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:55,481
Right.

245
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,726
Weed, heroin,

246
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,138
cocaine,

247
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,699
guns. Stop me if I make a mistake.

248
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:04,555
- Boxes.
- Girls.

249
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,202
- No. No girls.
- There was a girl.

250
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,018
Guillermo brought her in.
He said she was his cousin.

251
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,980
I don't get into details.
I really don't.

252
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:16,372
There are guns coming
through the tunnel into your city.

253
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,729
Where are they going?

254
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,650
They go to the people who want them.

255
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,620
And you're okay with that?

256
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,914
It's how I build schools,

257
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,292
hospitals.

258
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,846
It's how you provide for your family.

259
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,116
Yeah.

260
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,605
She wasn't Guillermo's cousin.

261
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,983
Charity calls.

262
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:50,615
It's not enough...

263
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,186
your charity.

264
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:53,854
Go home.

265
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:56,549
Get some sleep.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,997
Eat with your children,

267
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,159
take a walk by the water.

268
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,359
Nothing is ever enough.

269
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,270
But we live...

270
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:09,453
and we try.

271
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,605
- Got a proposition for you.
- Can it wait till after my bath?

272
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:38,854
Guess not.

273
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:41,016
The cheese shop is really taking off.

274
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,119
Well, people love cheese.

275
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,030
People love my weed.

276
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,882
- The proposition?
- I'm getting to it.

277
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,703
Okay, get to it faster.

278
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:51,686
Okay.

279
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,249
The problem is space.
I need more space.

280
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,918
- You and me both.
- Secure space,

281
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,836
where people can't wander in.

282
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:01,036
Larger,

283
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:03,882
safer, away from where I sell, right?

284
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,598
- Right.
- Okay.

285
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,469
So, here it is.

286
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,866
We're partners.

287
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,098
You stake me.
I find a place to grow.

288
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,299
Been there.

289
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:13,393
Done that.

290
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,311
Fucked it up. Twice.

291
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:17,634
We don't have to make
the same mistakes this time.

292
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:18,917
We've learned.

293
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,817
We've learned to not do it anymore.

294
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,154
Lisa told me you would say no.

295
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,828
Let me think about it.

296
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,967
- That's all I'm asking.
- Good.

297
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,571
That's all I'm doing.

298
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,521
What was it like?

299
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,565
Confusing. Brisk.

300
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:54,347
Messy.

301
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:55,915
I don't know.

302
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,416
- My mom hit me.
- You told your mom?

303
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:00,638
Have I taught you nothing?

304
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:03,484
Tell her what she wants to hear,
and then you do what you want.

305
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,944
How's your mom doing in rehab?

306
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,379
Fine, I guess.

307
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:10,386
I can't visit till she's detoxed.

308
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,713
Where did she get the coke?

309
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,579
Probably the maternity front.

310
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:16,592
What?

311
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,083
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

312
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,605
My mom was in jail,
and then suddenly she's free

313
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,200
and working for your mom.

314
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,589
- Retail?
- You think my mom's dealing cocaine?

315
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:28,755
I think they're both dealing.
But your mom's a control freak,

316
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,761
and mine's weak and addiction-prone.

317
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,681
Good times, huh?

318
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,621
How great would it be
if we were both 18?

319
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,652
- So, you gonna dump them?
- Why?

320
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,712
'Cause the slap-happy drug dealer
told me to?

321
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:50,698
Screw that.

322
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:58,080
Simone, Harmony, this is Izzy.

323
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,457
Does she party?

324
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,168
Depends on the party.

325
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:09,081
Are you sure
there is no border patrol here?

326
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,586
As long as you don't walk outta the surf
with 10 other wet Mexicans,

327
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:14,042
you'll be fine.

328
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:17,433
So, Andy tells me
you grew up in an orphanage.

329
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,683
I prefer not to talk about it.

330
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:24,080
Then what should we talk about?

331
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,983
We should talk about you.

332
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,339
I grew up in the Valley,

333
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,820
married my high-school sweetheart,
it didn't work out.

334
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,197
- Divorced?
- No. Not yet.

335
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:35,159
- You're married?
- Technically. Gotta sign the papers.

336
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:37,536
Well, why do you not sign them?

337
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:38,973
I'm on the run.

338
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:41,165
But it's nothing.
Just a little embezzlement.

339
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:43,860
- You steal?!
- Borrow.

340
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,044
I was gonna pay it back.

341
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,338
- When?
- Someday.

342
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,426
Hey, what the heck?
You wrecked our castle.

343
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,996
It wasn't a castle.

344
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:56,805
It was a... lump of sand.

345
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,647
You're a bad man.

346
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,853
You're a... bad castle builder.

347
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:07,621
Little shit.

348
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:10,819
You do not like children?

349
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:13,819
I like my four.
Well, three of them.

350
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:17,785
You have four children?
When do you see them?

351
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:21,090
When I can trust they won't tell
my cunt ex-wife where I am.

352
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,589
- What's the matter?
- I am...

353
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,210
I am not feeling so well.

354
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,045
Perhaps we should stop talking.

355
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:30,761
Okay. I'm cool with that.

356
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:33,509
Let the silence bring us closer.
Yeah, I can dig it.

357
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:41,006
I was weak. I was dishonest.

358
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,888
I let the plane fly me.

359
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,468
If it wasn't for Celia Hodes,
I'd be back in the air in 30 days

360
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:49,650
snorting lines off the dashboard

361
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,528
and jamming blow up my urethra
so I could fuck Paula,

362
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:54,363
the 57-year-old flight attendant.

363
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,880
I wanna apologize to you, Celia.

364
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,084
Thank you, Barry, for your share.

365
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,622
We're all like one big...

366
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:15,008
wonderful, dysfunctional family,
and I love you guys.

367
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:19,598
We're all working through it together.

368
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,769
I mean, I never really had a family.

369
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,924
I mean, I have a family,
but they're not like you guys.

370
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,816
Celia, can we borrow you
for just a minute?

371
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,146
Yeah. Sure.

372
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,190
Hurry back, okay? 'Cause I need you.

373
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,521
And everybody needs you.

374
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:47,098
We ran your insurance info a few times,
and it's not exactly accurate.

375
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,794
- What seems to be the problem?
- You don't have any.

376
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,589
The policy number you gave us

377
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:56,050
belongs to an individual
who is deceased...

378
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,509
and Korean.

379
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:01,896
Listen,

380
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,020
this is going really well.

381
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,381
And I'm only on my second step.

382
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,064
I am so proud of me.

383
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,728
We're proud, too.

384
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,860
We have no intention of abandoning you.

385
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:19,031
Our sister facility across town
has a bed available,

386
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,309
and they're holding it just for you.

387
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:22,849
No, I belong here.

388
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,497
Barry needs me.

389
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,039
Don't you have a work program?
I could do...

390
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:28,916
dishes, landscaping.

391
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,414
I'm sorry, Celia.

392
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:32,878
What we pay our help in a year
won't cover a week here.

393
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:37,347
Discharge paperwork is in the folder.
I'll need your signature on all pages,

394
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,843
and you can drop it
at the front desk on your way out.

395
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:44,514
Best of luck with your recovery.

396
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:48,446
We're going to need your room vacant
within the hour.

397
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,607
Doug around?

398
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:04,201
He go to buy some mouthwash,
some toilet paper, and some tweezers.

399
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,408
Oh, cool.

400
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:06,703
Right.

401
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:10,624
So, how's it going... things with Doug?

402
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:15,309
Just okay?

403
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:19,694
He is a terrible man.

404
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:20,747
What?

405
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:22,709
Come on.

406
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:26,043
- He's a great guy.
- He is a criminal.

407
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:27,724
- He's an accountant.
- A thief

408
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:31,690
who has abandoned his wife and family
and wants to make me his whore.

409
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:36,265
A CPA with legal problems
who's going through a divorce

410
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:38,443
and is wildly in love with you.

411
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:40,626
He has warts on his genitals.

412
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,365
Yeah, I got nothing for that.

413
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,669
Please, Andy,

414
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,654
help me.

415
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:53,000
These are for you, my love.

416
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,600
Look how thoughtful he is.
This is a good man.

417
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,215
Yeah, over there.

418
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:03,452
Bust it open.
I could use the hand lotion.

419
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,305
Here you go.
Something to put in the <i>piñata</i>.

420
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,927
You say $20 each.

421
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,000
I say $20 total.

422
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,752
Don't pull that Mexican shit with me.

423
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,280
Look, honey.

424
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:21,820
I got us a bed.

425
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:31,861
That's when I took that crack pipe,
broke it off, stuck it in his neck.

426
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:34,958
Said, "I'm not using this
except to kill you, motherfucker."

427
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,024
Like half a rock is worth getting fucked

428
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:41,118
with a mannequin leg, shoe still on it?
Fuck that.

429
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:44,468
Anyway, that's all I got for now.
Thanks for listening.

430
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,478
Ain't we fancy.

431
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:58,272
You're gonna have to take
that fucking attitude out the door.

432
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,624
We don't play that shit in here.

433
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,109
I'm gonna have
that fucking combination changed.

434
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,932
- I'm just putting money in the safe.
- Yeah, then do it.

435
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,768
More cousins?

436
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,662
Yeah, that's right.

437
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:41,399
Are you girls okay?

438
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,834
- I'm not seeing this.
- You're catching on.

439
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,062
About fucking time.

440
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:02,754
Day's over.

441
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:04,395
Go home.

442
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,678
Thank you for coming.

443
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,309
I know you're busy.
