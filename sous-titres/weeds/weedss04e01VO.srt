00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,580
(Previously on "weeds"...) 
There is now a
mandatory call for evacuation in lower majestic.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,190
All evacuees are welcome here to
the summer canyon recreation center.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,880
* Where there's fire,
people like to smoke *

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,080
okay, we need to be
leaving. I smell smoke.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm opening up a club...

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,950
heylia's compassionate care.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,360
Nancy, if it all burns
down, what are you gonna do?

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,800
I guess I'd have to go.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,340
Agrestic -- shit!
Majestic police!

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,490
You really got to clear out now.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,280
The fire's up the block,
and it's moving fast.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,740
Holy shit.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,040
That house belongs to celia, and
she was my lover, and it was good.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,610
So, you buy her a house...

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,590
and I assume you're fucking her in said house
-- she of the magical house-earning pussy.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,690
- Celia hodes?
- Yeah?

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,410
Nancy botwin.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,250
I just got a call from guillermo.
And I need to go meet him.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,670
No. You need to stop
hanging out with bad people.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,660
The man set a town on fire!

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,620
I could use you.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm not selling for you.
I'm nobody's bitch anymore.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,620
We take you off the sales floor.
That's for the little people.

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,820
Navigator.

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,960
I get stuck in traffic a lot.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,150
Traffic?

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,290
Andy: Do you have some sort of a plan?

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm working on it.

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,720
am I under arrest?

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,290
All right, how long is this gonna take?

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,110
Why don't i ask my questions,
and then we can get to yours?

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, could you turn
down the air-conditioning?

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,770
I am in a sundress.

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,360
Can I have a diet coke?

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,360
Again with the questions.

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm starting to see
what did it for groff.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,730
He never had to get on top.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,180
I beg your pardon.

42
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,900
How tall are you
-- like, 5'8"?

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,400
Shouldn't you be asking
questions about drug things?

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,400
Okay. Was sex like a drug to you?

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,640
Look, I don't know what he told you,

46
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,350
but sullivan groff is
a lying piece of shit.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
So, you never had a sexual
relationship with him?

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,890
A sexual relationship that resulted
in his giving you a house --

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,410
a house which was later used for the
growing and cultivation of marijuana?

50
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,260
That house was never in my name.

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,220
I was just living there.

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,890
Then my idiot ex-husband
had an accident,

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,870
and I saw an opportunity
to make some money

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,950
by renting it out to someone
I thought was a friend.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,670
What she did with it has
nothing to do with me.

56
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,830
You should be questioning nancy botwin.

57
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,880
- Did a bird just crap on my head?
- No.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,620
What is with all the birds?

59
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,650
Shane, you should use the bathroom
before we get back in the car.

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,300
Can I ride with uncle andy?

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,530
Didn't you like listening
to the radio loud?

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,500
Best bathroom graffiti ever
-- at least in the top 10.

63
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,730
"Here I sit, uh, cheeks a-flexin'...

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,720
giving birth to a baby texan."

65
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,610
I think that's offensive to texans.

66
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,040
Only the baby ones.

67
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,310
Shane wants to ride with you.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,500
Oh, sorry, buddy. The
plasma's riding shotgun.

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,040
Please tell me you washed your hands.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
Mom's car smells like gas.

71
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,870
It's giving me a headache.

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,800
The car smells like gas?

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,310
I don't think it's the car.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,980
No, it's your mother.
She smells like gas.

75
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,770
- I don't smell anything.
- You smell like gas.

76
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,470
I don't know. I must have
spilled it when I was pumping.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,440
We haven't stopped at a gas station.

78
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,710
Do we actually know where we're going
or are we just driving around randomly?

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,050
We're on the run, aren't we?

80
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,590
These are solid questions.

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,160
We're going to ren mar.

82
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,590
What -- ho, what?
Ren mar? Back up.

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,670
No, moving forward.
We're going to see bubbie.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
- Bubbie?
- Doesn't bubbie hate you?

85
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,730
She just hates that I'm not
jewish. It's not personal.

86
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,080
No, I think she hates you, too.

87
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,040
Well, she loves her
great-grandchildren.

88
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,580
I've only met her twice,
and once was at dad's F.

89
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,970
she kept calling me
"gooshey purim" -- something.

90
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,090
"Goyishe punim" -- "you
got face like a goy."

91
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,470
Look, she's family.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,970
She lives by the beach. That's the
plan. Let's get back on the road.

93
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,150
Shane, you sure you don't need to
pee or birth a texan before we go?

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,690
No.

95
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,130
Hey, can I go with you?
Mom's car smells like gas.

96
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,560
How am I not smelling it? Never mind.

97
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,800
I'll drive the van. The three of
you can take the prius, all right?

98
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,390
Will that make everyone happy?

99
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,080
Flying flu bag!

100
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,090
I hate birds.

101
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,200
Dad once told me bubbie
killed the neighbor's dog.

102
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,280
No one could ever prove that.

103
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,350
What's she like?

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,370
Oh, she's great, actually, and a
bitch, but in a great, tough-cookie way.

105
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,060
- Old people creep me out.
- Okay, fine!

106
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,670
I spilled gas on myself when i
was pouring it on the furniture.

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,880
What? Yes.

108
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,940
I set the house on fire.

109
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,560
Okay? It's done. It's gone.

110
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,090
I'm sure the real fire would
have gotten to it, anyway.

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,810
I just wanted to make sure.

112
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,360
It's time to move on,
so... let's move on.

113
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,030
Questions answered. Mystery solved.

114
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,820
And there were growers
-- heylia and conrad.

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,820
I don't know their last
names, but they were black.

116
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,820
And the gay indian kid
and the christian girl.

117
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,830
You seem to know a whole lot about
the operation for just a landlady.

118
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm telling you, you
want nancy botwin. Not me.

119
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,810
How do you know what I want?

120
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm full of surprises. I...

121
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,350
have a parasitic twin
growing out of my stomach.

122
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,550
Seriously?

123
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,450
You'll have to get me
naked to know for sure.

124
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,640
Are you trying to flirt with me?

125
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,730
Is that what this is?

126
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,150
- That's pathetic.
- That is?

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,820
You're the "drugs are wrong" lady,
and you were running a grow house.

128
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,470
I got a picture here
of you with sasquatch.

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,340
You like costume play?

130
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,660
- I want to go
home. - Which home --

131
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,180
the one with the pot plants or the
one with the injured idiot ex-husband?

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,460
Whichever one hasn't burned down.

133
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,550
Very good point. You could
be homeless for all we know.

134
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Thank goodness you have a
place to sleep for the night.

135
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,420
What do you mean?

136
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,970
I mean I'm gonna keep you for
a while, check out your story.

137
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll have someone bring you
a diet pop and a sweater.

138
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,800
- Diet coke.
- No, princess.

139
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,820
Diet shasta... in a can...

140
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,000
room temperature... no straw.

141
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,140
Say thank you.

142
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,630
Fuck you. I haven't done anything.

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,480
We'll see.

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
I want a lawyer!

145
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,640
Are you looking? I'm about
to do the spinny-spin.

146
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,510
Yeah, I'm looking. One second.

147
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,770
Wait, that wasn't it. Hold
on. It's gonna be really good.

148
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,960
What the hell happened to you?

149
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,580
I've been, like, sitting
here. I've been calling.

150
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,870
Andy: Sorry about that. My phone
battery conked out around oceanside.

151
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,550
Mine was on mute.

152
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,120
My phone was fine, but I've
been ignoring your calls

153
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,420
because I'm mad at you for burning
our house down without thinking that

154
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,030
maybe some of us would have liked to
go back and get a few more things out.

155
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Stuff, shane --
all replaceable.

156
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,770
We've got the computer.
We've got the photo album.

157
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,830
You got the photo album?

158
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,650
Yes, of course I did. Think I forgot?

159
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,590
Well, did you get that box of
loose pictures from the garage?

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,710
I did. It's in the back of the van.

161
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,990
Well, then... good.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,630
I'll answer your call next time.

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,350
This house looks c L.

164
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,940
Well... good.

165
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,060
There's this amazing
german deli in carlsbad.

166
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,050
I brought you
zwiebelbraten with spaetzle.

167
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,180
You might want to heat it up.

168
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,570
- You're an asshole.
- Fine. I'll eat it.

169
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,370
So, no one's home?

170
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,320
I wouldn't say that. Some
giant killer dog is home.

171
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,260
I rang the bell, and it barked like it was gonna
lunge through the window and bite my head off.

172
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,350
Bubbie hates dogs.

173
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, I think she's gotten over it.

174
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,330
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?

175
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,920
Maybe she's taking a walk.
Bubbie was always a big walker.

176
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,450
Why would you go
walking without your dog?

177
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,150
'Cause I'm telling you, she hates dogs.

178
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,390
Rad: She doesn't really have a dog.

179
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,580
That's rad. That's
his name -- rad.

180
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,210
He's 10, and he's read
the whole "narnia" series,

181
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,660
and now he's moved on to "his dark
materials," and he likes it so far.

182
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,100
His parents are divorced,

183
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,600
and he wants to be an inventor and
a robot builder when he grows up,

184
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,690
and his favorite color is green, and
his favorite animal is the komodo dragon,

185
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,120
which can eat up to 80% of its
own weight in a single sitting,

186
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,330
and he thinks dodgeball is gay.

187
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,510
That's how long I've been
sitting here waiting for you guys.

188
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,980
And bubbie definitely has a dog.

189
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,370
No, it's the doorbell.

190
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,810
- Her doorbell barks?
- Yeah.

191
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,870
Check it out.

192
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,060
See? I do it all the time.

193
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,420
I bet she loves that.

194
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,160
You couldn't have told me this earlier?

195
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,480
Rad: You didn't ask.

196
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,630
She's probably in there.
She never comes out.

197
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,380
My mom won't let me
trick-or-treat here on halloween.

198
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,330
I know how to get in.

199
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,830
Used to do it all the
time when we were kids.

200
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,610
- How?
- None of your business.

201
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,200
But if shane's too heavy to heave up
to the pergola, you might find out.

202
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,450
Shane, let's do it.

203
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,450
Wow, the ocean's like a block away.

204
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,910
It's nice, isn't it?

205
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,590
I think it could be good.

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,660
Whenever I swim in the ocean,
I get a really sick rash.

207
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,450
Good to know.

208
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I'll buy you a wet suit.

209
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,970
All right, he's in.

210
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,250
We can't stay here.

211
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,540
Attention, evacuees...

212
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,210
Check it out.

213
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,310
It's snowing in so-cal.

214
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,920
Except they're warm snowflakes.

215
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,460
Taste like... loss.

216
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
And muffins.

217
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,160
Mine tastes like a vinyl sofa.

218
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,270
Hey, when fema gives us hotel vouchers, do you want
to combine them and get, like, a ginormous suite?

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,950
A sweet suite? A dude suite?

220
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,290
A dude suite with isabel.

221
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,550
Okay, well, she's almost a dude.

222
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,540
I'm not ready to make that
judgment until she's past puberty.

223
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,720
Well, either way, she's
cool. She could hang with us.

224
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,900
Hey, do you -- do you
still poop yourself?

225
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,240
You don't have to worry about it.

226
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,730
So, you -- you
do poop yourself?

227
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,200
I can get myself onto a toilet
and evacuate my own bowels.

228
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,080
- You used to poop yourself, but now you don'T.
- That's right.

229
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,890
Okay, then.

230
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,720
Here.

231
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,280
Doug wilson? I'm agent
shlatter with the D.E.A.

232
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,450
He's a cripple with a doctor's
note. I'm just keeping him company.

233
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,680
Maybe she's just taking a nap.

234
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,080
Hey, bubbie. It's me
-- andy. You sleeping?

235
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,660
If you're sleeping, I'm gonna
go through your purse, bubbie.

236
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm gonna look at your driver's
license, find out your real age.

237
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,090
I'm also gonna take all your $5 bills.

238
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,500
She's not sleeping. She's
somewhere far, far away.

239
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,100
This is totally creepy.

240
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,860
Jesus, time is cruel.

241
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,270
- I should start taking fish oil.
- And green tea.

242
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,530
Yeah, 'cause that'll totally reverse
the effects of 90-plus years of life.

243
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,790
Get real. It's all downhill from 30 on.

244
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,950
- Shut up.
- Be quiet.

245
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,580
What did they say?

246
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,510
That the nurse was fired a month ago.

247
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,720
Said a family member called and
said he was taking over her care.

248
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,900
Oh, shit --
family member?

249
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,850
No, no, no. Forget this. I'm leaving.

250
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,510
Oh, no, wait. We don't know for sure.

251
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,390
D-don't you have cousins?

252
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,580
Isn't he on a riverboat somewhere?

253
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,490
He probably sunk it.
It's him. I know it's him.

254
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,830
Look. Look around.

255
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,380
Paintings missing from the wall.

256
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,320
All right, here we
go. Tchotchkes missing.

257
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,330
Bubbie's watching the world poker tour?

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,550
Look. He's here.

259
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,930
Who's here?

260
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,680
Who the fuck is here?

261
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,540
I've got a vicious dog. He'll
bite your thieving balls off.

262
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,810
You better start running.

263
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,550
Oh, christ.

264
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,890
Hey, dad, you can call off the doorbell.

265
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,790
It's your family.

266
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,950
Hello, len.

267
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,840
Why do I smell gasoline?

268
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,290
How stoned are you two?

269
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,490
- I'm, uh...
- we're baked out of our skulls.

270
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,620
But you -- you
shouldn't do drugs.

271
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,610
You've convinced me.

272
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,950
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

273
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,050
- Oh, shit. What do you think she told them?
- Everything.

274
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,510
Oh, god. I'm gonna go to jail, and I'm gonna
get raped, and it's gonna make me hate being gay.

275
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,630
Hey, hey, careful. They
could be "istening-lay."

276
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,230
- They could be
what? - "Othing-nay."

277
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,910
No one's going to jail.

278
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,120
You just need to get
your stories straight.

279
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,900
They're gonna want to
know who's running things.

280
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,500
We could turn in conrad and heylia.

281
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,710
Oh, they're long gone.

282
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,990
Of course they are. The
black guys never get arrested.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,880
But here we sit, two milks and
a cappuccino, rousted by the man.

284
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,160
Man: Mr. Wilson?

285
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,070
You know the name. Use it.

286
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,910
Celia -- celia
hodes -- h-o-d-e-S.

287
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,530
She ran the whole thing.

288
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,770
Sanjay: She won't know
I said anything, right?

289
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,390
'Cause she is super fierce.

290
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,810
Oh, celia scares me. She's the boss.

291
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,750
Nancy? Never.

292
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,230
She's got two children.

293
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,090
And wasn't she married
to one of your guys?

294
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,810
How crazy would that be -- the
drug dealer and the D.E.A.Agent?

295
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,220
Nah. Makes no sense.

296
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,540
Nancy?

297
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,630
She and celia were in pta together,

298
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,700
and they were friends for a while,
but I think they kind of drifted.

299
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,720
Probably because my ex
was becoming a drug dealer.

300
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,290
Nancy who?

301
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,900
Oh, oh, I do know one nancy,
but her name used to be vince.

302
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,060
Is that the same person
you're talking about?

303
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,310
Vince? No?

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
How could you just leave her like this?

305
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,970
I had errands.

306
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,300
You were at the track.

307
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,250
And the rite aid.

308
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,420
She was fine.

309
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,490
I changed all her bags, cleaned her
up, and turned on the television.

310
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,870
It's not like she has anywhere to go.

311
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
And I was back before
dinner, and, excuse me,

312
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,640
who the hell are you bursting in here like
this and telling me how to take care of grandma?

313
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,770
- With not-francie,
no less. - Who?

314
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,790
It's your mother. Never mind.

315
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,040
Her name is nancy.

316
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,370
He knows that. He just won't say it.

317
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,340
Who's francie?

318
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,810
That's the woman your
father should have married.

319
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,190
Francie's wonderful.

320
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,620
She's an eye doctor.

321
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,250
Beautiful, tiny hands that
bring sight to the blind.

322
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,270
She married a cantor, has four children,

323
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,730
and is still the number-one lasik
surgeon in the whole north county area.

324
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,510
Gave me a discount.
Now I can see perfect.

325
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,650
She's wonderful.

326
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,180
What is that?

327
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,530
Zwiebelbraten with
sp-- uh, spaetzle.

328
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,730
- What?
- I don't know. It's german.

329
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,790
You're sitting in my mother's living room
eating german food and smelling like gas.

330
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,390
She was at auschwitz, for christ's sake.

331
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,240
What kind of a monster are you?

332
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm a terrible shiksa monster
here to terrorize your clan.

333
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,560
What do you want from me, len?

334
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,520
It's been 20 years. Can
you... get over it already?

335
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,850
Hey, judah stopped talking to us.

336
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,000
Because you'd only call me not-francie,

337
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,120
because you refused
to come to our wedding,

338
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,220
because the one time we came
down here after silas was born,

339
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,220
you told us that the baby had eczema
because judah had watered down the gene pool.

340
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,050
Look who's keeping lists.

341
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,820
Your skin looks much improved.

342
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,670
Gee, thanks.

343
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,070
Len, your mother is dying.

344
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,560
You're not looking so hot yourself.

345
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,220
Isn't it time to make peace?

346
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,720
What do you mean I'm not
looking so hot myself?

347
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,310
I've got my hair and muscle tone,
and I have excellent posture.

348
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,700
Fine, len, you're a --
you're a god among men.

349
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
How could I have been so blind?

350
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,830
Must be a little distracted
'cause my house burned down.

351
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,130
What, did you leave a scarf over a lamp?

352
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,590
I know people do that sometimes
to help with the mood lighting.

353
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,900
But, you know, before you know
it, everything's in flames.

354
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,270
Do you not watch the news?

355
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,670
I watch "sportscenter."

356
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,780
Okay. See that? Great big fire?

357
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,980
Our house somewhere in the
middle of it. It's gone now.

358
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,320
Oh, all he cares about
is his sports book.

359
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,890
Like I'm gonna make money on a fire.

360
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,580
Let's just go, huh?
We can stay at a motel.

361
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,520
No, andy. We can't stay at a motel.

362
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,030
We've been driving all day.

363
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,420
- Apparently, I smell like gas.
- Apparently?

364
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,660
The kids are tired.

365
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,370
I'd rather not use a credit
card and leave a paper trail.

366
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
- What, are you on the run?
- Yes.

367
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,790
Well, that, at least I can
wrap my head around. All right.

368
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,030
Here's what we'll do.

369
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,310
You and your brother klaus
can stay in judah's old room.

370
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,250
It was my room, too.

371
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,420
You can sleep in judah
and not-judah's old room.

372
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,730
There are sheets in the hall closet.

373
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,170
Not-francie can sleep in bubbie's room.

374
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,310
- Thank you.
- All right. We'll see.

375
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,800
So, what did he do?

376
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,140
Why do you assume it's me?

377
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,710
Because it's always you.

378
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay, shower time.

379
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,820
Why are you always such a prick to me?

380
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,780
I'm just not sure you're mine,
so I keep an emotional distance.

381
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,170
If only that were true and I wasn't
looking at the ghost of hanukkah future,

382
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,580
fighting the urge to
throw myself off a cliff.

383
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,040
Oh, such drama.

384
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,010
Hey, I get laid all the time,
and I shit like a swiss train.

385
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,990
You should be so lucky.

386
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,680
You can sleep on the couch.

387
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,490
You want to play poker tomorrow?

388
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,410
- No.
- Okay.

389
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,560
Rinse off the nazi plate, will you?

390
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,210
And turn the tv back to my channel.

391
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm gonna change ma's diaper and clean her
feeding tubes and give her a new nightgown.

392
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,500
You should go away. It's not pretty.

393
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,750
- I can take it.
- Great.

394
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,490
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Good.

395
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,980
Hey, I'm hungry. Make me a sandwich.

396
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,870
Tomorrow we're gonna
have to have a discussion

397
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,390
about how long this heartwarming
family reunion's gonna last.

398
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,480
I like shane, despite
his stupid cowboy name.

399
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,760
He looks like my side of the family.

400
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,220
The rest of you... I don't know.

401
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,920
We shall see.

402
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,820
All right, get ready,
mom. Rolling you left.

403
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,650
Oh, ma.

404
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,080
They're lying! They're all lying!

405
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,900
Please help me.

406
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,120
I think you're very handsome.

407
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,990
Come in.

408
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,660
- The boys asleep?
- Yeah.

409
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,900
And it's totally freaking me out.

410
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,680
Shane's sleeping on my
old "star wars" sheets.

411
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,430
Silas found one of judah's playboys
from 1979 under the mattress --

412
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,750
candy loving on the cover,
dorothy stratten centerfold.

413
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,210
It's beautiful.

414
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,930
I'm having jerk-off flashbacks.

415
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,860
My old stains... are still on the wall.

416
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,870
My children are sleeping
next to their unborn cousins.

417
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,730
I'm thrilled.

418
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:32,290
Hey, this is where judah
and i grew from boys to men.

419
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,810
How often did you guys come here?

420
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,320
Oh, three, four times a night.

421
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,290
- You're an animal.
- Every year, every year.

422
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,960
Dad had custody in the summer, so he'd
park us with bubbie and go to the track.

423
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,870
It was great, you know? We loved it.

424
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Judah would bring it up
every once in a while,

425
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,570
but then he'd remind himself that
he was angry at everyone, and he'D...

426
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,980
shut down.

427
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,730
Yeah, well, that was the
past. You were his future.

428
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,130
I think he was, uh,
happy with his choice.

429
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,400
Well, thank you.

430
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,920
- He once showed me naked pictures of you, you know?
- Bullshit.

431
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,600
You hadn't been dating that long.

432
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,370
He wasn't taking you seriously yet.

433
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,250
You had this silver sequined bowler hat.

434
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,000
That asshole.

435
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,700
I c-- I can't believe --
he swore he'd destroy --

436
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,830
I can't -- I --
fucking asshole.

437
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,980
Sometimes.

438
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,590
Just 'cause he's dead
doesn't mean he was a saint.

439
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,140
It's weird seeing all
these old pictures around.

440
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,510
Wait. What pictures? They're here?

441
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,210
No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.

442
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm gonna look for them tomorrow.

443
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,120
No, I was just...

444
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,510
talking about all the
pictures around the house.

445
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,020
Oh, yeah. It is a little
overkill, isn't it?

446
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,500
Judah, judah, judah, judah.

447
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,880
And, of course, the fabulous francie.

448
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,270
God.

449
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,250
Look how young and smiling and gorgeous.

450
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,910
You really think I made him happy?

451
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,280
This was before he chipped his
tooth and he got that fake one.

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Nancy, what the hell are we doing here?

453
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,330
We're starting a new life.

454
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,610
Fresh. The beach.

455
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,120
Houses built before 1997.

456
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,770
Clean air.

457
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,750
I bet the schools are good.

458
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,500
I hadn't counted on the dying
woman in the living room, but...

459
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,840
you have a plan, don't you?

460
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,520
It's not about the clean air.

461
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,910
It's all part of a plan.

462
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,930
I might have a plan.

463
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,050
Or the start of one.

464
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,100
A plan in the planning
stages, if you will.

465
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,990
Should I be nervous about all this?

466
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,520
Of course you should.

467
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,500
It's the drug business. It's dangerous.

468
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,500
But we're just gonna try and put
all that out of our minds for now.

469
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,130
Think happy thoughts.

470
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,850
Wait. What is it? You're
not thinking happy thoughts.

471
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,070
I saw my grandmother's vagina.

472
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,830
You know they actually used old landing
strips from vietnam to build that fence.

473
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,680
From one fucking mistake to another.

474
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,860
You ever been?

475
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,030
Let me guess. Spring break, right?

476
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,220
Went down with some college
friends to drink some tequila,

477
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,020
get into something
crazy like a donkey show.

478
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,270
No. No tijuana. I always
stayed at a resort in cabo.

479
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,570
I got a sunburn, bought a tin mirror.

480
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,460
Again with the fucking birds.

481
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,070
- I swear they're following me.
- Nah.

482
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,470
They just squawking to let their mexican
buddies know there's more scraps on this side.

483
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,940
Cleaner water. Fly on over.

484
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,720
There's no water in the sky.

485
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,150
Maybe you should strap
the drugs to the birds.

486
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,990
We tried it with pigeons.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,830
They can't really carry too much weight.

488
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,000
What's with the numbers on the wall?

489
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,190
Over here is for border
patrol, so they can radio in

490
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,630
when one of the poor, huddled
masses yearns to be free.

491
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,700
Over there, it marks territory --
who controls what part of the wall.

492
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,250
Mexicate cartel --
they got 1 through 323.

493
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,770
Mzo got 667 through 1,500.

494
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,900
And us, we got what's in
front of you -- 324 to 666.

495
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,440
Tres seis.

496
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,700
What, you thought we worship the devil?

497
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,930
Shame on you.

498
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,110
Listen, I'm still unclear.
What's my job here?

499
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,730
Your job is to be a
pretty american lady.

500
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,900
Think you can handle it?

501
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,580
And there's big money in
it if you do it real good.

502
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,390
Big, big money?

503
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,700
Phew, man, I'm two years
from retirement myself.

504
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,540
I won't bring heroin.

505
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,090
You got some arbitrary
rules you live by.

506
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,490
- But you're standing here, aren't you?
- I won't bring heroin.

507
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,650
All right, then you bring
in lots and lots of mota.

508
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,420
You're still gonna make
lots and lots of cash.

509
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,700
And retire, right?

510
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,920
What are you gonna do with
all your cash and free time?

511
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,400
Where's Ivan?

512
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,190
They got him.

513
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,190
Idiot wore baggy pants.

514
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,900
Got caught on the fence.

515
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,370
But otherwise...

516
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,240
We're good.

517
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,050
We'll be in touch.

518
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,070
Welcome to the border.

519
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,150
Hasta luego.
