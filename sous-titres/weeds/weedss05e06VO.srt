00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,691
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

4
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,017
Ignacio will watch over you for now.

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,192
You helped Shane rob his teacher?

6
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:23,105
I am so sorry

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,813
that I exposed him
to the world of criminal activites

8
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:27,192
for the first time.

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:29,111
I wanna open a store.
Medical marijuana.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,362
I want my cut.

11
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,739
Can we have a second?
We're new to this extorsion thing.

12
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,324
I have nowhere to go.

13
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,017
Do you think that you could allow me
to stay in your garage

14
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,706
while I figure out
what the fuck I'm doing with my life?

15
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:44,084
- Two days.
- I own a house here in Santa Playa.

16
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,087
- Did you just ask me to live with you?
- There's plenty of room.

17
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,964
Even room for him.

18
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,950
- I'm good.
- Me too.

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,176
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

20
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,881
I got the money. There is a lot.

21
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,555
- What? How?
- It doesn't matter.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,701
We could be more,
I would like to try.

23
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,405
- Esteban...
- Write him a note.

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,185
- A note?
- Leave him a note.

25
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:04,141
Like the olden times.

26
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,845
Break his heart in ink.

27
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,288
He will understand

28
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:08,923
if he loves you.

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,585
These are terrible names.

30
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:29,922
Percy.

31
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,008
Clifford.

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,446
Who would name a son Humphrey?

33
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,168
Mr. and Mrs. Bogart.

34
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:39,347
Still a bad name.

35
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:43,100
It's true.
You always hear "Bogie and Bacall."

36
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,413
You never hear...
"Humphrey and Lauren."

37
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:53,289
I've decided that...

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,407
we will get married.

39
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,686
That is a prized family heirloom.

40
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,680
"Reyes" means "kings".

41
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,417
I don't know what "Botwin" means.

42
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,842
This just isn't
how I pictured this going down.

43
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,354
Well, I am sorry to disappoint you.

44
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:33,705
Purple.

45
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,107
Did you like the ring?

46
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,517
It's hideous.

47
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:50,877
That's the championship ring
of the soccer team I own.

48
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,255
I'm gonna want that back.

49
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,563
Are you really asking me?

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,707
Where was that?

51
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,291
We're not children anymore, Nancy.

52
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,751
We're not playing house.

53
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,478
I ask

54
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,712
that you give yourself to me

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,639
to be mine forever.

56
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,304
Mrs. Esteban Reyes.

57
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,577
Would that make you
Mr. Nancy Botwin?

58
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,668
I'll take a bowl of the best thing
you got on the menu, <i>s'il vous plaît</i>.

59
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:11,393
I'm trying to run a legitimate business.
You don't have a prescription.

60
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:14,628
Fine, I'll take it myself,
boy scout.

61
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,546
No, don't give me that look.

62
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,757
I do the same thing at Pretzel Time.

63
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,702
Come on, let's get faded.

64
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,178
Blitt and I need to close early.

65
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,305
For inventory, well...

66
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,122
What's left ot it, right?

67
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:28,723
Right.

68
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:29,935
Right, so...

69
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:32,395
Can you get faded somewhere else?

70
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:38,302
I'm hurt that you don't want
to smoke with me, Silas.

71
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,041
But I get it.

72
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,742
What really hurts though

73
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,369
is that you've been light

74
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,579
these last couple months.

75
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,498
Happens again,
we're gonna have a serious problem.

76
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,632
Bitch-ass bitch.

77
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,865
See ya.

78
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:08,473
My name is in this book.

79
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,661
"Shane: a feeling of guilt."

80
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:11,977
Was I an accident?

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,708
Who can remember?

82
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,252
Honestly, I was hammered.

83
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,681
- You should get to pick your own name.
- At what age?

84
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,195
If I'd given you that freedom at 3,

85
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,115
your name would be
Count Chocula Botwin.

86
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,608
Notice anything different?

87
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,519
About my hand?

88
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,127
He said he was gonna ask you.

89
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,628
He told you?

90
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,987
We had an <i>hombre </i>to <i>hombre </i>talk.

91
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,432
<i>Mucho </i>respect. I'm cool.

92
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,225
You're cool?
And you're guzzling coffee?

93
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:55,079
Ignacio says it puts hair
on your chest.

94
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:59,607
Spinach gives you instant muscles
and an anchor tattoo.

95
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:01,860
Time for summer school.

96
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,453
<i>Escuela de verano.
Vámonos, muchacho.</i>

97
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,740
<i>Señora </i>Reyes.

98
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,326
<i>Felicidades.</i>

99
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,621
Did Esteban tell everybody?

100
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,079
Everybody except for Andy.

101
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,914
You might want
to take care of that one yourself.

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,350
You wanna buy a Fresca
with a credit card?

103
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,515
<i>Qué estupidez!</i>

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,373
<i>Estupidez</i>, but <i>es </i>on the quiz.

105
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,336
School doesn't teach you
nothing useful.

106
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:43,693
You wanna learn <i>español útil</i>?
I teach you.

107
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,641
Lesson number one...

108
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,670
Common business transaction.
Repeat after me.

109
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:57,606
- What does that mean?
- That means,

110
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,251
pay up, motherfucker, or I crack
your head open with an ice pick.

111
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,669
Nice.

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,288
- All-purpose.
- <i>Sí.</i>

113
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,077
Can we ditch school?

114
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,776
- We don't need no stinking school.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,527
- What's up?
- My score.

116
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,231
That's what.

117
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,228
312,000

118
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,241
and counting.

119
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,412
Look out, Abdner Ashman.

120
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,168
Coming to get you.

121
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,539
- Who's Abdner Ashman?
- Guy from Queens.

122
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,248
Holds the record
Ms. Pac-Man high score.

123
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,506
I'm only behind him, like,
600,000 points, give or take.

124
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,467
- Look out.
- Silas.

125
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:50,427
I know I've got a ways to go.

126
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,243
I'm in this for the long haul.

127
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,599
It just...
It feels right, you know?

128
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,768
She gets me. We're in sync.

129
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:01,814
No words,
just a gentle touch of my hand.

130
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,048
I move left, she moves left.

131
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:06,372
I move right, she moves right.

132
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:08,152
Should I be worried here?

133
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,570
Yes! Power pellet.

134
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,281
Die, Inky. Die, Blinky!

135
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,286
Come here, Sue,
you filthy little ghost whore.

136
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:16,954
I'm worried here.

137
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,909
Don't worry about me.
Worry about you.

138
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,873
I'm worried about both of us.

139
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,241
You, because...

140
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,015
you're cracking up.

141
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:28,491
And me, because the cop
extorting money from me is cracking up.

142
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,831
- How much you got left?
- Of what?

143
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,348
Uncle Yitzhak's lost fortune
which fell miraculously into your hands.

144
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,142
Right, that's how it happened.

145
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,725
How much do you have left?

146
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:42,104
A couple thousand maybe, if that.

147
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:46,023
What? I thought...
You said there was like 180 grand.

148
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,943
Was. Look, look around you.

149
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:51,753
Geez...

150
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,199
You blew all that money
on this crap?

151
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,594
This crap

152
00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:59,039
and General Lee.

153
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,213
- Fuck's sake.
- <i>Please, step away from the car.</i>

154
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,212
<i>Please, step away from the car.</i>

155
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:14,845
Dammit.

156
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,019
Why do I have to do this?

157
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:25,927
Because you're the only one
I could trust not to get turned on.

158
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,112
Doug, thank God you're still here.

159
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,944
I need a ride to the mall.

160
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,114
No can do. Gotta dry.
If I smudge, people know it's fake.

161
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,116
Yeah, that's how they'll know.

162
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,284
Ask Andy.

163
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,480
I did.

164
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:41,121
Conflicting engagement
with Ms. Pac-Man.

165
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:43,248
Have a nice walk to the bus stop.

166
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:45,654
Christ, I need a car.

167
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,460
My fucking feet are killing me.

168
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,665
If you actually wore
your sneakers to work,

169
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,943
instead of changing
into them there...

170
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:53,925
Sneakers are the footwear

171
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,386
of my corporate oppressor, Isabel.

172
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,722
I just thought
you might as well be confortable.

173
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:02,475
Do you think it's comfortable for me
to work at Super Sneakers?

174
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,327
Well, it's not.

175
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,896
But I will suffer for my beliefs.

176
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,887
You want to know who else did that?

177
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:11,524
Jesus.

178
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,193
I thought Jesus wore Birkenstocks.

179
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:18,672
Is she gone?

180
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,910
Make sure you get it even.

181
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,340
Hi, Andy. It's me, Nancy.

182
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,575
I thought maybe you'd...

183
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,443
pick up this time,

184
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,478
but you're probably really busy.

185
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:00,646
I gotta say, I think it kind of sucks
that you've been avoiding me

186
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:03,470
because I miss you,
despite what you might think,

187
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:06,081
and I hoped that maybe by now
you'd understand that...

188
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,791
I'm doing the best I can
to deal with everything.

189
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,045
Maybe that's asking too much.

190
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:15,718
Oh, yeah, guess what?

191
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,663
Esteban asked me to marry him.

192
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:19,884
I know, right?

193
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,227
No more Nancy Botwin.

194
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:24,914
Mrs. Esteban Reyes.
Mrs. Somebody... else.

195
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:26,559
Isn't that weird?

196
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,234
This is the part
where I thought you'd laugh

197
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,379
and make a joke
about outlaws and in-laws

198
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:34,416
and a fajita bar at the wedding.

199
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,417
Anyway... call me.

200
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,415
Come and see me.

201
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,935
I hope you're good.

202
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,120
And please don't have
a scraggly moonshiner beard,

203
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,701
unless you plan on starting a cult,
in which case...

204
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,077
go, beard.

205
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:05,788
Bye.

206
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,519
Fuck.

207
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:29,873
- Do I look even to you?
- What?

208
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,294
I'm working on my tan.

209
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,324
I found this George Hamilton
autobiography in the shitter.

210
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,495
This guy's a fucking genius.
You know he doesn't live anywhere?

211
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,757
His rich friends put him up
wherever he goes.

212
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:43,219
And he's constantly banging, like,
Britt Ekland or Anita Ekberg.

213
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,805
And you know what, Silas?
I want to be like this.

214
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,804
And to be like the "G. Ham",
I need the tan, man.

215
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,686
I need the deep, dark, savage tan.

216
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:53,271
C.P. came by today.

217
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,959
He threatened us
because his take's been light.

218
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,783
Of course it's been light,
the fucking guy's always hanging around.

219
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,196
No one's gonna want to buy weed
in frond of the bacon.

220
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,811
Skeeves people out, like midgets.

221
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,561
He pulled a gun on me.

222
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,746
Just messing around, but still...

223
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,263
What a douche.

224
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,335
Power corrupts, Silas.
We need to fight the power.

225
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,081
Great. How do you propose
we do that?

226
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,308
We ask ourselves...

227
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,787
- "What would george hamilton do?"
- What? Why?

228
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,960
The man slept with his stepmother
when he was 12 years old.

229
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,309
Clearly, he can do anything.

230
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,431
Next lesson.
Greetings and salutations.

231
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,855
Repeat after me.

232
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:55,375
Means "go fuck yourself in the ass."

233
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,229
This is fun.

234
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,640
Hey, fuck you, man.

235
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,038
No, this is fun.

236
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,200
You with the fucking names.

237
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,844
Yeah, new name.

238
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,605
Comes with a prize.

239
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:53,725
You like it?

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,192
Turns out you were wrong.

241
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:59,163
It wasn't "miss dead puta whore"
after all.

242
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,132
It was Mrs. Esteban Reyes.

243
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,027
Though, I might hyphenate...
Botwin-Reyes...

244
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:09,908
Just to keep my old self alive,
being a modern woman and all.

245
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,550
I'm impressed, <i>blanca</i>.

246
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,753
You know,
you remind me of my cat, Rosita.

247
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,452
I used to throw her
off the porch, and...

248
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,730
Damn if that little bitch
didn't land on her feet every time.

249
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:29,018
Of course, then I threw her
off the roof,

250
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,850
and she went splat.

251
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,363
So, why you come here?

252
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,226
Invite me to the wedding?

253
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,659
I wanted to share something
with you.

254
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,029
The other day, my fiancé...

255
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:48,017
He said the funniest thing.
We were eating breakfast.

256
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,490
He has brioche made for me.
It's my favorite.

257
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,535
And he said, "Mi amor,

258
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,257
"do you know
that I would do anything for you?

259
00:15:57,382 --> 00:16:00,132
"Do you know
that I would even kill for you?"

260
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,439
He just kicked.

261
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,135
And you know what I said?

262
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:14,346
Maybe you asked him to kill
some loco DEA agent?

263
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,017
Did you do that?

264
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,892
'cause if that was you...

265
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,572
Gee, thanks.

266
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,030
You did me a solid.

267
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,192
Maybe soon we won't have
this glass between us no more.

268
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,656
You're not going anywhere.

269
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,717
We had some fun
at the driving range yesterday!

270
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,469
What do you wanna do today?

271
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,081
Tennis?

272
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,295
Wait! Wait!

273
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:09,156
Shit!

274
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,734
Fucking shoes!

275
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,481
Love your shoes.

276
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,245
Thank you.

277
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,457
I may work in casual,
but my heart is in couture.

278
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:06,876
Honey, I've been there.

279
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:08,475
Raylene Reynolds.

280
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,650
Regional sales director,
you're pretty! Cosmetics.

281
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,012
Nice to meet you.

282
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,014
Hop in, darlin'.

283
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,973
You look like you could use a ride.

284
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,339
How much weight can that thing hold?

285
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,645
If that fucking fat-ass
costs us our security deposit...

286
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,235
Growing up, young George
lived by one rule...

287
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,801
- Do the dumbest thing possible.
- What?

288
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:44,788
Time and again,
he'd get himself into trouble

289
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,332
just for the thrill
of weaseling his way out of it.

290
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:49,613
I want to be that weasel.

291
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:52,964
- Wait, no. Wait.
- Get out of my store.

292
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,382
Right now! Get out of my store!

293
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,094
I've had enough of you
driving my customers away,

294
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,511
and skimming my profit.

295
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,798
Don't care if you're the heat.
Don't take it in the back.

296
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,974
Not from you. No more.
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

297
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,487
You're making a big mistake, Wilson.
A big!

298
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,481
You know what else is big?
My Johnson. And you can suck it!

299
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:13,985
Shit!

300
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,945
What would George Hamilton do now,
you asshole?

301
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,073
You gonna put on a Zorro mask
and fuck him?

302
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,436
Oh, there you are.

303
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,807
I was gonna take a walk.

304
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,209
I made it from the bedroom
to the patio.

305
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,169
God! I'm huge!

306
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,043
Not for much longer.

307
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,347
Soon I'll be a new mommy...

308
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,472
Again.

309
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:42,203
And married... Again.

310
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:45,197
Again again, actually.

311
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,895
And you are ecstatic.

312
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,063
Ecstatic.

313
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:51,731
And huge.

314
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,694
And beautiful...

315
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,972
And radiant.

316
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,506
What does this...

317
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:03,747
Mrs. Esteban Reyes do?

318
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,497
Whatever she wants.

319
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,915
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

320
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,325
I just keep thinking
this Mrs. Esteban Reyes person

321
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,171
is going to kill Nancy Botwin.

322
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,717
Why must you always think
someone's trying to kill you?

323
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,698
It's just a name.

324
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,276
I'm not marrying the name.

325
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,975
I'm marrying you.

326
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,787
If you want to be Nancy Botwin...

327
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:32,897
Keep your name.

328
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,150
Really?

329
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,532
I'm still going to brand you,
of course, but...

330
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,285
... sure.

331
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,398
Time to go fence.

332
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,159
Have fun, d'Artagnan.

333
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,821
See you next time.

334
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,759
This is...

335
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,138
You got a pool and everything, huh?

336
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,808
No peacocks, but I suppose
they could be roosting.

337
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,394
You don't look so good, my friend.

338
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,068
Right on.

339
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:19,042
Well, Ignacio said he thought
Nancy might be down here, but...

340
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:20,503
she's not.

341
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,065
You fence, huh?

342
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,199
Tool.

343
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,729
I fence a bit.

344
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:27,702
You?

345
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:31,850
I have no formal training,

346
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,302
per se,

347
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,427
but...

348
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:39,839
I was Ren Mar JCC

349
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,342
lightsaber battle champ

350
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,734
'79 to '82.

351
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,992
That brings back some memories.

352
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,659
So, congratulations.

353
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:09,364
Thank you.

354
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,331
You're a lucky man, Esteban.
Just thought I'd come down,

355
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,291
give you and Nancy my blessing,

356
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,335
say there's no hard feelings.

357
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,964
Hard feelings? About what?

358
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,609
Nothing. Forget it.

359
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,645
Tell me, what is that strange sound
you're making?

360
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,357
That's not how it's done in Mexico?
You guys don't have sound effects there?

361
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,515
If you care for a friendly bout,

362
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:45,780
I will show you
how it's done in Mexico.

363
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>En garde.</i>

364
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,187
Okay.

365
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,942
God damn it!

366
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,270
What's going on?

367
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,779
Andy is giving us his blessings.

368
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,303
So...

369
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,813
You and Esteban tying the knot,

370
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:03,723
taking the plunge, buying the cow.

371
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:09,960
- Seems kind of sudden.
- Well, it's not,

372
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:13,034
which you would know if you ever
called me back. Did you get my messages?

373
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,137
I got your note.

374
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,412
Said everything I needed to hear.

375
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,517
A note, Nance, seriously?

376
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:22,438
A note?

377
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,354
So, is this what you want?

378
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,264
Should've known.
You always seem to get what you want.

379
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:38,705
No, I wanted Judah to outlive me.

380
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,564
So, my blessing. You want that, too?

381
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:49,194
- You don't have to. I mean...
- No. Great and careful work, Nance.

382
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:06,148
I know the "God" part.
What's the rest?

383
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:10,058
"Blessed are you
who has kept us alive,

384
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:14,187
"sustain us, and enabled us
to reach this season."

385
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,606
I'm sorry, Andy. I'm sorry that...

386
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,816
- everything...
- Don't, okay?

387
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:28,254
Don't.

388
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,751
God bless.

389
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:35,746
But when Esteban dies,

390
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,897
which in his line of work will probably
be sooner rather than later,

391
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:43,230
when he dies and you're once,
twice, three times a widow...

392
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,296
don't expect uncle Andy
to stop by and make pizza eggs,

393
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:52,133
'cause I won't do it.
You know what I'll do?

394
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,985
Send a note.

395
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,530
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to get this damn tan off.

396
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,066
Fuck George Hamilton.

397
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,995
He can "love at first bite" me.

398
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,587
You are a sad, sad man.

399
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:14,852
What the fuck was that?

400
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,304
We cannot get married.

401
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:23,140
Excuse me?

402
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,350
Things have changed.

403
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:28,353
I'm sorry.
