2
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,550
I've decided
that we will get married.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,081
Can we ditch school?

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,347
Fuck you!

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,368
I'm Huskaroo's girl.

6
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,357
The cop extorting money from me
is cracking up.

7
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,025
Bitch-ass bitch.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,152
Blitt and I need to close early
for inventory.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,154
Get out!
I don't want you in here anymore.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,199
Shit!

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,576
Uncle Yitzhak's lost fortune.
You said there was, like, $180,000.

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,928
Look around you.

13
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,080
You blew all that money
on this crap?

14
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,041
I haven't seen you since the ultrasound.
Everything looks fine.

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,294
Love your shoes. Raylene Reynolds.
You're Pretty! cosmetics.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,759
- What the fuck was that?
- We cannot get married.

17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,010
Things have changed.

Hairdryer.

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,782
- It's not what you think.
- Of course not.

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,835
She's just a friend,
cousin, coworker,

23
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,317
neighbor...

24
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:20,663
It's not like that.

25
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,087
What's it like?

26
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:24,265
'Cause all I know is

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,119
some stiletto-heeled Mexicunt

28
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:28,541
stalks in here,

29
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,193
screeches at you in Spanish,

30
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:32,883
suddenly the marriage is off.

31
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,000
Her name is Pilar Zuazo.

32
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,041
She is

33
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,515
a very important woman in my life.

34
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,686
In my position,

35
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,389
to marry a foreigner

36
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,494
is bad publicity.

37
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,152
She doesn't want me to jeopardize
my political career.

38
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,278
Consider your political career safe,
<i>señor</i> mayor.

39
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,572
Wait! This is only a delay.

40
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,241
You must trust me.

41
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,758
After the election,

42
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:01,412
we will be married and be a family.

43
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,047
What election?

44
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,876
I'm running for <i>governador</i>.

45
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,865
It's the next step
in a long journey.

46
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:11,902
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,883
I didn't think it through.

48
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,235
The timing...

49
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,556
I was too

50
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:21,917
impetuous.

51
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:24,268
Because I love you, Nancy.

52
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:26,450
You are what I want.

53
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:31,525
I still don't understand who she is,
why you're taking orders from her.

54
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,999
She is someone
who has a great deal of influence

55
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:37,287
with the people
who matter in my country.

56
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:40,242
She makes sure those people
support my ambitions.

57
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,037
So, she's your boss?

58
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,682
- No one is my boss.
- It sounds like she's your boss.

59
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,461
Come downstairs.

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,921
I'll tell Concha
to unpack your things.

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,890
- You've ever slept with her?
- No, it's not like that.

62
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,010
And I am told
she has teeth down there.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,890
I don't want to find out.

64
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,269
After the election,

65
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,020
we will be man and wife.

66
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:11,398
Z,

67
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:14,510
U, A, Z, O.

68
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:16,969
Is that her?

69
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:20,241
- She's hot.
- They're fake.

70
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,946
You want her Wikipedia page
or the Forbes article?

71
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,146
Try Wiki.

72
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,749
Daughter of late Mexican
industrialist Raúl Zuazo.

73
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,599
Silver-spooned oppressor.

74
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,325
Sole heir to vast
telecommunications holdings.

75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,547
Media manipulator.

76
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,675
On the board
of the Mexican Stock Exchange.

77
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,014
Inside trader.

78
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,054
- Philanthropist.
- Tax evader.

79
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,330
Doesn't say anything
about a drug kingpin.

80
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:46,901
She owns Mexico, mom.

81
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,644
She can have these pages edited.

82
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,724
We need to get the fuck out of here.

83
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,191
These people bludgeon
innocent golfers for sport.

84
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,377
- What are you talking about?
- They're gonna wait

85
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,863
until you have the baby
and then they're gonna kill us.

86
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,099
They don't even need a reason,
they'll just do it and laugh.

87
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,870
That's probably them
coming after us right now.

88
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:24,837
What is all this stuff?

89
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:26,823
We're setting up a birthing room.

90
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,060
Esteban feels that you should have
the baby here at home.

91
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:32,730
Birthing room.

92
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,357
Everything you need
will be right here.

93
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,157
How convenient.

94
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,363
They will be no need to ever leave.

95
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,951
What about a flat screen?

96
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:48,613
Premium cable,
one of those little fridges?

97
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,709
- You said everything I need.
- I cannot provide those things.

98
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:57,129
Who should I ask? Esteban? Pilar?

99
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,881
Best Buy.

100
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:02,474
I'll do that.

101
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,888
Hop over there right now,
review my options.

102
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,184
I'll take Shane.
Shane loves Best Buy.

103
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,727
Your car's in the shop.

104
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:14,919
What's wrong with it?

105
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,897
Broken tail light.

106
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:24,793
These

107
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,208
are my keys.

108
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,134
When I'm not tooling around town

109
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,671
in my cherry red
You're Pretty! convertible,

110
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:34,530
I am cruising in my Maserati.

111
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,170
Three thousand square foot
ski chalet in Tahoe.

112
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,008
Ski in, ski out.

113
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:44,051
My private instructor
looks just like Ashton Kutcher.

114
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,887
So, hands up!

115
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,682
Raise those hands!
Who wants to be me?

116
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,706
She's much blonder
than I would ever go again,

117
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,310
but I do love Tahoe.

118
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,812
Hands down. Forget it.

119
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:56,855
About 90% of you

120
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,816
simply don't have what it takes.

121
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,878
But for the other 10%,

122
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,558
let me just say,

123
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,615
being me is fantastic.

124
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,617
I think her nipples are hard.

125
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:10,786
As a matter of fact, they are.

126
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,581
My nipples are hard
and my lady is wet.

127
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,168
Because success

128
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,061
turns me on.

129
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:22,089
And if success doesn't turn you on,

130
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,718
then you can take
your initial $5,000 investment fees,

131
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,470
pop on out to your shit cars,
and drive out of here.

132
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,044
Okay then. So...

133
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,435
What turns you on?

134
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,811
Success!

135
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:37,151
Dick.

136
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,181
Am I wrong about you, Celia?

137
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,776
Dick ever buy you
a Cartier Panther watch

138
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,153
with double diamonds?

139
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,620
'Cause if it did,

140
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:47,489
then suck that dick, girl.

141
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:49,593
But if not,

142
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:51,744
I need to ask you a question.

143
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,830
Are you a closer or a loser?

144
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,625
Well, I've been a loser.

145
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,213
But I want to be a closer.

146
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:06,675
But I don't have $5,000, so...

147
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,219
You're going to let a little thing
like that stand in your way?

148
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:14,725
No way.

149
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,143
No way, cow girl.

150
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,023
You're Pretty!
will front you on credit

151
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,440
all the products that you need
to put yourself on the road

152
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,909
to financial freedom.

153
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:24,234
Are you ready to ride?

154
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:25,903
I said,

155
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,693
are you ready to ride?

156
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,826
- Are your nipples hard?
- Yes.

157
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:37,873
But I had reconstructive surgery
because of a double mastectomy,

158
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,541
so they're always kind of like that.

159
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,711
Let's get started.

160
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,342
Whatever you need.

161
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,928
It's your fourth THC cone today.
You're costing us money.

162
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,235
Double scoop
of Cripple Ripple Fudge.

163
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,691
Keep the change.

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,029
I think I might actually
be addicted to sugar.

165
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,480
I love it here.

166
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,373
This is everything I ever wanted.

167
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:26,797
Shelves filled with drugs,
cold creamy treats flavored with drugs.

168
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,340
Beautiful girls in bikinis

169
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,677
coming and asking me for drugs.

170
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,518
- Are you crying?
- Don't look.

171
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,898
Gentlemen,

172
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,684
waking up in my car
with a searing headache,

173
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:41,645
unable to move for some time
without blinding pain,

174
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,150
gave me some time to think.

175
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,461
You all were right.

176
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,363
Having the heat lurking
around a pot club, bad for business.

177
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,449
So from now on,

178
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,824
when I come in,

179
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,536
I come in my civies.
Makes sense.

180
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,522
Do you know this guy?

181
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:02,124
How high are you?

182
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,943
So, that was my apology.

183
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,005
Now it's time for yours.

184
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,257
We're sorry you got hurt.

185
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,719
So you do know this guy.

186
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,855
Well, sorry

187
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,047
means a lot.

188
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,603
You know what also means a lot,
partner?

189
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,438
- Ten grand.
- Ten grand?

190
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,606
Today.

191
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,317
Assault on a police officer
is a felony.

192
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,027
Minimum sentence: 8 years

193
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,820
of daily ass rape.

194
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,155
Assault? Really?

195
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,866
I'll be back this afternoon
for the money.

196
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,157
This is some potent shit.

197
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,208
I'm seeing Stormtroopers.

198
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:49,191
It's Comic Con, you idiot.

199
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,058
Leave it.

200
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:01,697
I told you, I told you
something would happen to Esteban.

201
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,653
What, did he get shot?

202
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,808
Beheaded? I heard they're doing that.
They're chopping heads off.

203
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,782
Are there photographs?

204
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,920
Can I see them?

205
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,100
- Where did you park?
- Out front.

206
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,374
We got to go.

207
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,263
- What, to identify the body?
- No.

208
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,885
To Dr. Lyman's.
I have to have this baby right now.

209
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,499
What about Esteban's body?

210
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,086
Esteban's fine.

211
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,844
The call was bullshit to get you here.
He's not dead. Nothing happened.

212
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,467
- No beheading?
- No beheading, no.

213
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,886
You lied to me. I was all excited.

214
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,216
They built a goddamn birthing room.

215
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,360
They want me to have this baby
totally off the grid.

216
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:44,960
No birth certificate.

217
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,429
If I disappear, if the baby disappears,
nobody knows.

218
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:48,897
It's fucking Rosemary's baby.

219
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,406
No, I'm through
bailing your ass out.

220
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,675
You're no longer my responsibility.

221
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,171
You're the responsability
of the unbeheaded,

222
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,616
corrupt, drug-dealing politician
that you've chosen to marry.

223
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,827
Andy, I'm not fucking around here.

224
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,522
I'm trying to get
over you and your drama.

225
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:08,499
This could send me back
weeks in the healing process.

226
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,085
You cannot suck me back

227
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,310
into your web.

228
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,922
You're right, I can't suck you in...
How about a handjob?

229
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,466
Jesus, get off!

230
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,345
I don't want
your pregnant pity handjob.

231
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:22,280
Christ, that's just sad.

232
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:26,560
Fine, I'll take you.

233
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:30,206
But this is it, the last time.
I really mean it.

234
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,339
Not like the last time
I said I meant it.

235
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:34,526
And raincheck on that
for when you're not with child.

236
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,388
Pull your car right at the gate
and wait for me there.

237
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,131
Were you really gonna jerk me off?

238
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,703
That or squeeze your balls
till you give me your car keys.

239
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:46,848
I miss Yael.

240
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,701
Before...

241
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,471
And after.

242
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,263
With the help
of You're Pretty! cosmetics,

243
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,308
I have just transformed

244
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,852
this plain-faced little girl

245
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,854
into a glamorous woman

246
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,106
ready to meet the man of her dreams.

247
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:14,816
I like girls.

248
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,360
Play along.

249
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,895
Don't forget,
I'm giving a 10% discount

250
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,574
to all of my colleagues
from Surfside Mall.

251
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,820
I got to hit it.

252
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:26,328
If I'm even 10 min late,
they put me on squeeze duty all day.

253
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,872
No problem.
Just tell me what you need.

254
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,457
Lady, I got 4 kids, no husband.

255
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,957
I make $8 an hour.

256
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,752
If you think I got some extra cash

257
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:36,963
for some overpriced eye-shadow,
you're crazy.

258
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:39,341
Then why are you here?

259
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,135
You promised free samples.

260
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:46,431
With purchase.
You didn't read the fine print.

261
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,017
- There's no fine print.
- This is bullshit.

262
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,269
- I want my free sample.
- Me too.

263
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,770
Well, doesn't anybody
want to buy anything?

264
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,577
Free sample!

265
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,748
Okay, fine.

266
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,125
You know what?
Just kill me now. Kill me.

267
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,830
Have a great fucking day.

268
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,464
Rob me blind, grubby.
Grubby grubber.

269
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,542
You know what?

270
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,458
Why don't you just stay blotchy
and non-attractive, bitch!

271
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:15,317
I hope you're happy!

272
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,629
<i>Huskaroo, Huskaroo</i>

273
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,147
<i>You're beautiful</i>

274
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,633
<i>In all the things you do</i>

275
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,052
You're not so bad yourself.

276
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm Isabelle.

277
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,056
Danielle.

278
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:29,871
And...

279
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,436
I think you'd look better
without all that crap on your face.

280
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,223
There goes the dyke market.

281
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,540
Are you joking?

282
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,251
It's General Lee.
From the <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i>.

283
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:59,171
I know. I was 12 years old once too.
Why are you driving it?

284
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,309
Bought it from some laid-off
mortgage broker in Torrance.

285
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,646
One of seventeen
used on the show in season four.

286
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:07,179
At least it damn well better be.
I paid a shitload for it.

287
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:08,513
Unlock, please.

288
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,266
It's welded shut.
You gotta come through the window.

289
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,352
In that case a little help, please.

290
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:19,562
Wait, wait, wait.

291
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,625
Jesus.

292
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:26,087
Christ!

293
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,192
Here you go.

294
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,331
- Get your hand off my boob!
- Deal with it.

295
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,133
It's nice to see you're putting
uncle Yitzhak's money to good use.

296
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,337
Just be glad
I didn't get Fonzie's motorcycle.

297
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:45,664
I was this close.

298
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:03,777
I'm Tenly.

299
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:05,737
You certainly are.

300
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,322
Is the manager around?

301
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:08,753
Doug Wilson.

302
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:11,618
Top dog, big cheese,
head honcho, grand puba.

303
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,329
- What do you need?
- A job.

304
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,372
Hang on.

305
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:18,875
You're fired.

306
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,293
- I'm what?
- Fired.

307
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,714
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

308
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,589
You see that chick over there?
She needs a job, I need to get laid.

309
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,383
You can't fire someone
for no reason.

310
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,926
I just gave you a reason.

311
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:30,764
Look, if you need pussy,
I can hook you up.

312
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,099
My cousin broke up with her boyfriend
and she's horny as shit.

313
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,810
- She kinda look anything like you?
- Kind of.

314
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,144
Get out of here.

315
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,315
He fired me.

316
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,011
- What are you talking about?
- It's bullshit!

317
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:47,744
Hang on.

318
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,767
- Can I talk to you a sec?
- What?

319
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:53,952
- You can't just fire people.
- Why not? He looks like a terrorist.

320
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,297
He can sue us
for wrongful termination.

321
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:59,107
Why are you being
such a cockblocker?

322
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:01,175
Fine, keep
your swarthy little Jihadi.

323
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,828
I want Tenly, it's my place too.

324
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,980
We can't afford them both.
We have a graft to pay.

325
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,281
It's exactly why I fired
the little Paki.

326
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,509
Fuck you, man!
I'm Tunisian.

327
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,886
I have had it.
I can't work with you anymore.

328
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:13,638
So leave, I don't care.

329
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,141
This partnership is over.

330
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,114
That's right, it is. <i>Finito</i>.

331
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,437
Don't go anywhere.
We might have an opening.

332
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:21,855
Asshole.

333
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,309
- Thanks for doing this.
- You're welcome.

334
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,991
- I'll pay for gas.
- Thank you.

335
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,202
- It's the least I can do.
- I'm not thanking you for the gas.

336
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,928
What are you thanking me for?

337
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:40,498
For showing me
what I want out of my life.

338
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,084
You have General Lee,
what more could you ask for?

339
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,487
Readiness.

340
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,046
Ready to find the right woman,

341
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,401
ready to settle down, sow my seed.

342
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,176
Carry on my part
of the Botwin legacy.

343
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,679
You do have a cute butt,
it would be a shame not to pass that on.

344
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,683
Go on ahead with your snidy snideness,
snide away.

345
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,901
You'll see.

346
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,104
I have just as much
to offer a woman as Judah.

347
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,399
And you're alive.

348
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,611
And Judah crashed on that front.

349
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,943
It might not be so obvious,
but I'm a real catch.

350
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,134
I'm kind,

351
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,283
funny, total rockstar in bed...

352
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,243
That does seem to be the consensus.

353
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,708
The whole key
is strong and focused work

354
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,415
where the sidewalk ends.

355
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,430
I know, Andy. I'm a girl.

356
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,863
How's Esteban, in the sack?

357
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:31,216
He seems like the selfish type.
Throw you down on a table and fuck you.

358
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,321
That works too.

359
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,501
I knew that you liked it rough.

360
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,794
You know,
I'm precise, I'm connected.

361
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,119
I'm an artist.

362
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,290
You and me,
we never would have worked.

363
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:44,342
- I'm not rapey enough for you.
- Consider yourself lucky.

364
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,606
I'm fucking poison,
you don't have to drink it anymore.

365
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,001
Cheers to that.

366
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,610
Still want my raincheck handjob.

367
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,814
- Oh, God.
- What? What's wrong?

368
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:00,893
I still love you.

369
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:03,532
No, I don't, I don't.

370
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,209
It's just an obsession.
I want what I can't have.

371
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:08,931
I'm so fucked up.

372
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,047
Jesus, you are poison.
Fuck you!

373
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,722
As I remember, this car went
a hell of a lot faster on the show.

374
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:35,517
What are you doing here?

375
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:37,610
My mom told me to come here
after school.

376
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,566
Someone's trying to kill us.

377
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,691
Again.

378
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,908
Which leads to the question:
why would she send me

379
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,956
to the most obvious place
I could be found?

380
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,808
Don't worry.

381
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,708
Your mother leads a charmed life.

382
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,933
She's lucky.

383
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:54,645
Everything always works out
for Nancy.

384
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,718
I, on the other hand,

385
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,855
I'm jinxed, cursed, blighted.

386
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,516
Nothing works out for me.

387
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,572
What's in that case?

388
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,219
A lot of false promises.

389
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,859
God, I could use a foot massage.

390
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,190
Here.

391
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,288
Thank you.

392
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,541
I fucking hate Mexicans.

393
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,918
Never go into sales.

394
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,128
- They're animals.
- It's humiliating.

395
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,590
- They have no regard for human life.
- I'm Willy Loman.

396
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,425
I think I'm gonna move back here.

397
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:39,594
Dean was suppose to be Willy Loman.

398
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,462
Can you tell my mom
you'll take care of me?

399
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:50,063
I've enough problems of my own
without taking on Nancy's.

400
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,774
Besides, why would you wanna be
stuck with me?

401
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm a bitch.

402
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:55,824
I drink.

403
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,531
And I peddle useless shit
that nobody wants.

404
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,756
I don't want to be stuck with you,
I can take care of myself.

405
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,911
I just need you to tell her
you'll watch out,

406
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,663
so she'll leave me alone.

407
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,915
You should peddle
something that people want.

408
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:12,585
- Like what?
- Like drugs.

409
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:14,685
That's fucking great.

410
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,619
Now you tell me when it's too late.

411
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:21,485
I just blew my whole wad
on eye-shadow and zit concealer.

412
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:22,789
Thank you.

413
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:26,307
Go get me a drink.
And then switch to the other foot.

414
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:39,987
Nancy Botwin.

415
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,446
It's been a while, hasn't it?

416
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,404
From crescent to a full moon.

417
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,453
Sorry,
I've been seeing another doctor.

418
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,178
I've been seeing other patients.
It's all good.

419
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:52,438
I'm Andy Botwin, not the father.

420
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,544
Ex-brother-in-law,
still close with the family.

421
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,974
Love kids.

422
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,248
Ready for my own.

423
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,448
Isn't that the whole point of life?
Children? Propagation?

424
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,063
The cycle of life?

425
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,511
I need to induce.

426
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,165
- What did your doctor say about that?
- I didn't ask him.

427
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,018
But I need you to get the baby out of me
as soon as possible.

428
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,320
You're two days away
from your due date.

429
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,513
It's best to let your body
call the shots here.

430
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:15,776
I can't wait.

431
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,943
Why don't we wait
till you're past your due date

432
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,781
- and I'll get your chart from the...
- I can't wait.

433
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,446
It's not because I'm uncomfortable.

434
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:26,490
The father is a drug kingpin,
slash mayor,

435
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,491
slash radical home birth advocate

436
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:30,705
who built a delivery room
in their guest house.

437
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,583
He spared no expense.
He did this for two apparent reasons.

438
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,619
One, to guarantee

439
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,556
that his first and only son
would arrive safely to the world.

440
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,674
Two, to ensure
they would be no witnesses

441
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,927
or official records of said event,

442
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,889
which could pose a problem
if he ever decided to, say...

443
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:51,581
kidnap the baby to Mexico
and/or kill its mother

444
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,387
the minute she gives birth.

445
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,189
Thank you, Andy,
for your discretion.

446
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:57,523
Don't worry.

447
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,859
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

448
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,819
She can't testify, right?

449
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,260
- Is that just lawyers? Shit.
- Please.

450
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,445
I need this baby to be born
right now.

451
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,272
I need witnesses.
I need a US birth certificate.

452
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:13,250
I need to do this
before he realizes that I'm gone.

453
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,623
I need help.

454
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,220
I don't have health insurance but...

455
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:23,294
I can pay cash.

456
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,052
And if all goes well,
there's a bonus in it for you.

457
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:33,476
We need to get you into the hospital
and get a Pitocin-drip going fast.

458
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,122
Unless you want a C-section,
it's faster but...

459
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:37,417
Get it out!

460
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,519
All right, I'll let the hospital know
we're on our way.

461
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,290
She's awesome.

462
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:48,445
Please, I beg you.

463
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,534
Wait until I've given birth.

464
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:08,802
Damn!
Now that's what I'm talking about.

465
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:12,872
These Comic Con freaks
like to party.

466
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:15,778
I guess you kind of have to be baked
to dress up like Skeletor

467
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:18,741
and try to snap an upskirt picture
of Lucy Lawless.

468
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,275
So where is your partner?

469
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:22,571
Who cares?

470
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,695
Blitt and I can run this place
all by ourselves. Right, Swarmer?

471
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,268
- Hey, buddy.
- Look at this place.

472
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,006
Very impressive.

473
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,039
Thanks for involving me, dickhead.

474
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,013
Like when I involved you
in my city council reelection campaign

475
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:42,462
- and you forgot to send my paperwork?
- One. One fuck-up.

476
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,470
You're fucking jinx.
Anything you touch turns to shit.

477
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:49,122
- Nothing personal.
- You're a douchebag. Nothing personal.

478
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,500
Here's the man I came to meet.

479
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,772
My client wishes
to dissolve the partnership.

480
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:03,816
We'll be filing articles of dissolution
with the state and county.

481
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:06,861
You are advised to give
statutory notification to all creditors,

482
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,821
settle all creditors' claims

483
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,980
and then we can begin the distribution
of all business assets.

484
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,702
I'll take the weed.

485
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,830
Fuck you. This club was my idea
and you ruined it.

486
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:20,458
- You're uptight.
- And you're irresponsible.

487
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,566
- You're really blowing all up?
- I don't have a choice.

488
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,456
I can't work with you.
This is a professional establishment.

489
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:28,841
Not some place for you
to chase ass and get high.

490
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,500
I can't have you blow this place up.

491
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,537
I love this place too much, man.

492
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,444
But you got to make
a compromise too.

493
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:39,435
I get a ball in the morning
to get me through the day.

494
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,188
And for the sake of our friendship
and the success of our business,

495
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:43,898
I'll bang Blitt's cousin.

496
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,304
- Deal.
- Deal.

497
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,667
That's what I like to see.

498
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,637
Bros before hos.

499
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:55,576
And weed over greed.

500
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,578
Or is it greed over weed?

501
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:00,813
Get down! Everybody down!

502
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,793
Come on, guys!
It's just more Comic Con freaks.

503
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:05,368
Don't fucking move.

504
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:07,427
I'm getting my badge, I'm a cop.

505
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:09,882
Get the fuck down on the floor now.
You too.

506
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,093
All right, I'll play along,
whatever.

507
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,724
How come he doesn't have
to get down?

508
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,352
Because I'm Frank Calderone.
Internal affairs.

509
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,937
Officer C.P. Jones.

510
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,152
You have the right to remain silent.

511
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:28,109
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's no joke, fat-ass.

512
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,447
Theft, extorsion, falsifying documents.
And that's just for openers.

513
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,004
You really are a cop.

514
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,370
- Can I still bang your cousin?
- You will never come near a Calderone.

515
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:41,914
Dean Hodes, attorney of law.

516
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,448
Fucking jinx.

517
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,507
Excuse me, visiting hours are over.

518
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,181
You have done a very bad
and foolish thing coming here.

519
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:01,642
You must leave right away.

520
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:05,336
Get dressed.

521
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,174
My God.

522
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,522
You have no idea what you've done.

523
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:43,844
He has your eyes.
