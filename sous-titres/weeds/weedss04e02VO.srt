1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,150
Previously on "Weeds"...

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,950
This was not what I had
in mind. Those are people's homes.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,150
Fema's gonna set them
up at the marriott.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,890
It's time to move on -- we
take you off the sales floor.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,470
Traffic?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,860
You'd bring in lots and lots of mota.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,750
Holy shit.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,460
That house belongs to celia.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,260
Celia hodes.

10
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:22,540
Celia hodes.

11
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:24,106
She ran the whole thing.

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,815
They're all lying! Please help me.

13
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:29,707
Nancy: We're going to ren
mar. We're going to see bubbie.

14
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,340
She's somewhere far, far away.

15
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:33,503
The nurse was fired.

16
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,372
A family member called and said
he was taking over her care.

17
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,052
Hey, dad, it's your family.

18
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,581
Who the hell are you
bursting in here like this?

19
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,152
Why are you always such a prick to me?

20
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm just not sure you're mine.

21
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,461
- What, are you on the run?
- Yes.

22
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,792
Well, that at least I
can wrap my head around.

Bingo.

27
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:48,101
Bubbie --
who knew?

28
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:53,273
Nice dress, mom.

29
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:55,332
We should have done this years ago.

30
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,202
Burn down the house
and move to the beach?

31
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,911
We can hear the ocean.

32
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,622
How great is that? Listen.

33
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:04,572
That's silas watering his
pot plants in the shower.

34
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:06,331
Silas!

35
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,872
Okay. The hair...

36
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,131
identity crisis, new
start -- I get it.

37
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,021
More importantly, the plants.

38
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:27,891
The plants need to grow somewhere
else, out of this house now.

39
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:30,041
What are you so paranoid about?

40
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,842
I'm paranoid about len.

41
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,941
He wants to be called lenny.

42
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:36,383
If len sees those, he might flip...

43
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:39,473
or steal them or smoke
them -- we just don't know.

44
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:44,023
The bottom line is -- we don't shit
where we eat or eat where we shit.

45
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,692
Either way, words of wisdom.

46
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:49,450
Well, then where am I
supposed to put them?

47
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:53,510
Figure it out, young
botanist. Just get them gone.

48
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,723
Where are you going?

49
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,162
I need to buy a bed skirt.

50
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:01,593
I want to go shopping for a bed skirt.

51
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,341
You don't even know what a bed skirt is.

52
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,592
Do too. It's like a dust ruffle.

53
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,160
How do you know what a dust ruffle is?

54
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,971
- All gay boys know what a dust ruffle is.
- Silas.

55
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,620
That's right, I'm a big
fag, so you can suck my dick.

56
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:13,391
Please, can I come with you, mom?

57
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,482
No, honey.

58
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:20,671
I need some alone time, and you just told
your brother to suck your dick. Gross.

59
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:21,723
Where are you really going?

60
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,232
I just told
you -- errands.

61
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:25,472
Dressed like that?

62
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,530
Good morning, andy.

63
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,993
- len.
- Lenny.

64
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,951
How long does it take portnoy
up there to finish his business?

65
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,600
Use the downstairs bathroom.

66
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:41,123
I don't like the toilet in there.

67
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,383
It's got a padded seat.

68
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,171
It's like taking a shit on a mushroom.

69
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,191
I've taken a shit on mushrooms...

70
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,431
and on a mushroom, actually.

71
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:50,940
Of course you have.

72
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,090
Listen, bonnie and clyde, I don't
know what you two are running from.

73
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,410
And you know what? I don't care.

74
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:01,671
Why don't you just give me $300 in
cash right now, and the subject is dead?

75
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:21,480
Okay.

76
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,673
Nice doing business with you.

77
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:32,903
Hey, so, I'm doing something
potentially illegal today.

78
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:38,350
What sort of potentially illegal activity
are you engaging in in that dress?

79
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,362
I got a page. He gave me an address.

80
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:41,801
Who? Your john?

81
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,052
Guillermo.

82
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:49,111
"Psychotic gangster, burned
down agrestic" guillermo?

83
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:51,703
Do you want to keep
living with your father?

84
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:54,722
It's work. It's fine.

85
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,123
Keep your cellphone on.

86
00:04:57,136 --> 00:05:00,041
In case of injury or imprisonment?

87
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,270
In case I need something
from the supermarket.

88
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,872
Like a rape kit? I don't think
they sell those at ralph'S.

89
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,082
It's work. It's fine.

90
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:11,441
Okay, have a good day at the office.

91
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,441
Maddy shaheen. I'm the public
defender assigned to your case.

92
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,540
Am I getting out now?

93
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,211
You just have to sit tight
a little while longer.

94
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:24,361
The charges won't stick.

95
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,970
Oh, good. Thank god.

96
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:30,701
No one actually saw you drive the escalade into
the convenience store, so we're totally cool.

97
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:31,500
Escalade?

98
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,043
It's says "escalade." That's
what came through the window,

99
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:36,400
unless it was a highlander or
one of those big lincoln things.

100
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,932
What is it? A navigator?

101
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,112
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,803
- Felicia harken?
- Celia hodes.

103
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:45,223
Hodes. Okay. Right. Hodes.

104
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,760
Hey, any relation to dean hodes?

105
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,371
He was this loser who was constantly
hitting on me in law school.

106
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,440
No. No relation.

107
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,092
Okay. Here we go.

108
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,183
No, that is not it.

109
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,710
Are you retarded?

110
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:00,112
I'm just disorganized. You don't
have to be a bitch about it.

111
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,530
Ooh, here it is.

112
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:06,312
Uh, yeah, you're not getting
out of here anytime soon.

113
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:12,730
I pose a bigger threat to the public than
someone who drove a car through a store window?

114
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:16,001
Antidrug crusader
caught with grow house?

115
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,950
You're fucked like a
stray dog in chinatown.

116
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,891
I-I-I shouldn't
be in here.

117
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:24,512
The toilets are metal.

118
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:27,130
Anyway, your hearing
date's in three weeks.

119
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:31,842
You were on city council, so if you slept with any
cops or judges, it's time to call in the favors.

120
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,713
I'll be in touch, sally.

121
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,362
- Celia.
- Yeah. See ya.

122
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,680
Felicia? Not felicia.

123
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,543
Mamacita!

124
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:53,391
Hey, blanca.

125
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:55,840
You said you had a job for me?

126
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,422
Yeah, I do.

127
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,671
And good morning to you.

128
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,411
You need to get that fixed.

129
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,360
Obviously.

130
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,511
You're gonna take a little
drive for me today, blanca.

131
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,610
Go down to tj and get
that brake light repaired.

132
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,733
In mexico?

133
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,303
Cheaper labor there.
I know a good garage.

134
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:21,532
Once you get over the border, take any
left off revoluciÛn and follow the river,

135
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:26,831
paseo de los heroes, and look for the
beer-can/horsehead thing hanging outside.

136
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,003
Beer-can/horsehead?

137
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,411
Yeah, it's on the wall.

138
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,232
- And that's it?
- No.

139
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,690
I also want you to go to a
farmacia, get me some inhalers --

140
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,111
ventolin and aerobid. 10 each.

141
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:41,462
No, 15. Don't get me
flovent. It gives me a rash.

142
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,462
Uh, ventolin and aerobid.

143
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:47,440
Can you give me the address of this
place, and I'll put it in my gps?

144
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,716
Just, you know, follow paseo de
los heroes and look for the horse.

145
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:57,825
Use your eyes, spoon-fed americana.

146
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:01,547
Hey, there's $10,000 in it for
you if you don't fuck it up.

147
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,742
Ooh, $10,000.

148
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,800
No, no. Cash on delivery.

149
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,700
That's for the inhalers.

150
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,092
I almost forgot.

151
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,630
We got you a present.

152
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,703
Wait. What is that?

153
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,681
Yo, be gracious when
somebody gives you a gift.

154
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,523
No, I don't really
do this kind of thing.

155
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:27,093
That's good luck, man.
Don't fuck with good luck.

156
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,103
Just say, "thank you."

157
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:32,753
Well... how thoughtful.

158
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:37,492
And really... stuck on there. Thank you.

159
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:41,742
Eh, you'll be fine. Just
smile and just act like you do.

160
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:47,432
And, you know, you're gonna come back,
this money's gonna jump into your purse.

161
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:50,422
- Be a good day for blanca.
- Yeah.

162
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:51,892
What am I really doing?

163
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,683
Oh, no, no, no, no.

164
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,422
The money doesn't like
it when you ask questions.

165
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,443
It gets very sad and
wants to crawl away.

166
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:02,423
All right, all right. Off to mexico.

167
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,580
Iviva zapata!

168
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:09,801
Lenny: I'm gonna be at the track until
4:00, so you boys are basically on your own.

169
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:15,670
Just check the monitors, keep an eye on her
feeding tube, and check her diaper for deposits.

170
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,380
And roll her in the afternoon.

171
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,093
That's so she doesn't get bedsores.

172
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,351
Few minutes on each side.

173
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:25,480
It's a shame you boys never
got a chance to know her.

174
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,323
But you can blame your mother for that.

175
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,092
- Now, you, alan ladd.
- Shane.

176
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,442
- And klaus.
- Silas.

177
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:38,671
If either of you boys have any big ideas
about going through my things while I'm gone,

178
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,440
you can forget it.

179
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,533
It's all rigged to
blow your fingers off.

180
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:48,321
So stay out of my stuff if you ever want
to handle your little shmeckies again. Okay?

181
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:51,562
Now, I don't believe in wireless phones.

182
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:55,381
So if something goes wrong,
you can page me at the track.

183
00:09:55,395 --> 00:10:00,490
And, uh, if she dies on your
watch, it's your fault, got it?

184
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:06,870
She does that sometimes.
It's not necessarily bad.

185
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,081
Okay.

186
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:10,723
- It sounds bad, grandpa lenny.
- It's not.

187
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:17,142
And when your uncle andrew crawls
out of that rattletrap van out there,

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,941
tell him I expect to be reimbursed
for everything he eats...

189
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:26,243
and tell him he's a thief and
that he still owes me $20,000.

190
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:28,731
I got to go. Bye.

191
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:34,090
You're on first watch.

192
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,350
Doug: Guess who finished the monster
po' boy at the gumbo junction.

193
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,103
5 feet of fried-fish goodness!

194
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,843
And it was free 'cause he ate
the whole thing in under an hour!

195
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,223
People sang and threw
beads. It was awesome.

196
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,983
Why are you here? Where is dean?

197
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:54,631
He's down in the lobby hitting on some
frumpy chick who dug him in law school,

198
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:58,540
and he wanted me to let you know
he's sorry there's no money for bail.

199
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,971
You fuckers ratted me out.

200
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:03,153
That might be another reason
why he's staying in the lobby.

201
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,921
Where's nancy?

202
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:06,020
Who? That nice widow?

203
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:09,621
She should be in
here, not me -- nancy!

204
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:15,530
My cellmate, chita, says that she's
gonna make me her special girl.

205
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,620
I have to get out of here now.

206
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,440
It's good to make friends,
ceil. Breach the divide.

207
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,290
"Why can't we all just get along?"

208
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,623
I like your hair.

209
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,783
I couldn't decide, but I just did.

210
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,482
I mean, it's nice off
her face, isn't it?

211
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:28,513
It's youthful.

212
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,463
My life is in danger.

213
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:34,470
Oh, come on. You know, you're probably
safer in here than you are in town.

214
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,012
People are outraged, ceil.

215
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,121
You know, your house
burned to the ground,

216
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:40,072
but people still spray-painted
"hypocrite" in the charred remains.

217
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:42,090
You have to get me out of here.

218
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,560
This is a nightmare.

219
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:47,241
And it should be nancy's
nightmare, not mine.

220
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:49,670
She does look scared, doug.

221
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:53,823
I am, baby. Mommy is terrified.

222
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:56,341
Then maybe this is a
good time for us to go.

223
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,633
I don't want you getting all upset.

224
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,022
I mean, this must be
really hard for you.

225
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,800
- No, no, no.
- Please, please, please.

226
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,411
I don't -- I don't want to
be anybody's special girl.

227
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:05,731
Visitation is over. Come on.

228
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,560
Help me. Help mommy.

229
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,803
Hola.

230
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:35,502
Yo quiero una brake light para...

231
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,413
this car.

232
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,073
Guillermo.

233
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:46,090
Una brake-light
especial. øHabla inglÈs?

234
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,213
S?

235
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,253
I need to get my brake light fixed.

236
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,711
Guillermo sent me.

237
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,321
Hybrid, eh?

238
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,393
Yeah, hybrid car.

239
00:12:55,415 --> 00:13:00,530
Got to save those fossil
fuels -- dead iraqi children.

240
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,612
What's wrong with that car?

241
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,863
Broken taillight.

242
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,303
You know, I-I'm still under warranty.

243
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:12,652
I really don't want to blow that.

244
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:17,172
So when you're fixing my light, if you can just
make sure everything's back where you found it.

245
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,250
Oh, and while you're in there,

246
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:21,491
can you override the thing that stops
me from doing gps while I'm driving?

247
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:24,702
- I heard you can do that.
- That's illegal.

248
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,113
What was Guillermo thinking?

249
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:30,621
He thinks with his dick.

250
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,222
She is hot though,isn't she?

251
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,611
Una hora, you come back, eh?

252
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,411
An hour. Great.

253
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:39,330
Oh, I need a bag.

254
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,032
Small planet. I'm doing my part.

255
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:47,711
øDÛnde est* la farmacia, por favor?

256
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,882
Tell her to go to my
cousin's farmacia on Third.

257
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:54,753
No,no.Doming's brother's place
is cheaper and they have more.

258
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,413
Dominga's brother is unethical.

259
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,933
Are you calling my
brother-in-law unethical?

260
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,171
That's what I'm telling
you,he's unethical.

261
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,262
Why?

262
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:03,401
Fuck you.

263
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,381
Farmacia m*xima.

264
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,910
End of street, red sign, eh?

265
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,262
End of street, red sign. Gracias.

266
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,180
Mucho bueno. Gracias.

267
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,531
<i>NO APARCAR</i>

268
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,783
Andy: 10 minutes. That's my limit.

269
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,092
After 10 minutes in the same room
with him, I want to kill or be killed.

270
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:22,753
Shane's in there...

271
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:27,030
Just staring at bubbie's machines,
scared to death she'll kick on his watch.

272
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:31,120
Lenny's a master at giving
kids age-inappropriate tasks.

273
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,670
I'm surprised he didn't have
shane drive him to the track.

274
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:36,942
He says you're a thief.

275
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:38,880
Who did?

276
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:42,713
Lenny. He said you
stole 20 grand from him.

277
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:45,240
- And he wants it back.
- Unbelievable.

278
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,841
Unbelievable. You know what?

279
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:50,213
You're better off without
a dad. It fucks you up.

280
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:53,761
You're better off. At least
you can be your own person now.

281
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,752
I didn't mean that. I don't mean that.

282
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:01,633
I like your hair. I did that, too.

283
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:06,780
Tried to give myself a mohawk
using my mom's lady shaver.

284
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,123
You're damaged.

285
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,433
I was born into it.

286
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,730
Hola.

287
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:18,521
Oh, terrific. So, it's done? Finito?

288
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:22,782
30 what?

289
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,582
Dollars --
for the light.

290
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,511
You're charging me. Guillermo?

291
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,563
So, uh, what do I do now?

292
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:54,202
You go home. Have a nice day.

293
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,261
Pinwheels! Pinwheels!

294
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:40,943
Miss.øGuitarra?

295
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:44,601
- No. Um, diet coke?
- Yeah.

296
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:45,673
Jarritos.

297
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:49,700
- diet jarritos?
- No.

298
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,832
- Iced latte?
- Okay. I get for you, miss.

299
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:58,201
- It's $3.
- 3

300
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,901
Do you have change for a $50? øCambio?

301
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,603
No. Nobody have.

302
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,283
How much?

303
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:10,233
- It's two for $30, but for you, $25.
- S?

304
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,582
Uh, the,
um --

305
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,041
øguitarra?Yeah, guitarra.

306
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,840
Do you have a red one?

307
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,800
Mellow out, jesus.

308
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:43,141
Hey, miss. Una m*s latte, se—ora?

309
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:44,811
Oh, god, no. No, no m*S.

310
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:49,540
Um, ba—O. Is there a
ba—o around? Toilet?

311
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:51,350
Oh, no, no. No ba—O.

312
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:56,082
But there is a jack in the box
on the other side in san ysidro.

313
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:59,123
Gracias. Perfecto.

314
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,043
Turn around.

315
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,650
Fine. Enjoy the show.

316
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,612
Oh, god.

317
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:49,131
Not you.

318
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,881
Hi, sweetie.

319
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:07,442
Where are you? I've
tried you like 50 times.

320
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,040
Uh, I was in a parking
garage. What is it, honey?

321
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:12,301
Isabel texted me.

322
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:15,353
- Did you know mrs. Hodes is in jail?
- What?

323
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,260
She got busted for a pot house.

324
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:20,803
Your pot house, mom.
She's ratting you out.

325
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,740
Fuck!

326
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,513
Yes, mom. Fuck.

327
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:26,740
Okay, honey. I'm kind of busy
right now. Don't say fuck.

328
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:29,131
- Are we safe?
- Of course we're safe.

329
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:31,223
- I think we should change our identities.
- Got to go.

330
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,570
Have your passport ready.

331
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:39,680
Fuck, fufu ck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

332
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,631
Man: No passport?

333
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:43,530
I didn't know.

334
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:45,103
So, what were you doing in mexico?

335
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:48,883
There's this skin cream
-- fade cream, actually.

336
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:52,592
Probably poison, but
definitely effective.

337
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,052
You came all the way
here for skin cream?

338
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,621
Oh, yes. My skin is
very important to me.

339
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,883
It's the first thing people see.

340
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,603
Is that alcohol, ma'am?

341
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:05,643
Uh, no, sir. That's my urine.

342
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,442
I see.

343
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,721
You mind unlocking your trunk?

344
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:22,931
Okay. Thank you very much.

345
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,370
I'm gonna need you to pull over
to the second inspection area.

346
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,431
Doug says everyone fingered celia.

347
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:43,723
Then he started giggling 'cause he said
"fingered," which leads me to believe he's high.

348
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:49,032
But he's almost always high, so I
believe the information is reliable.

349
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,370
There's mom.

350
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,993
How'd it go at the track today, dad?

351
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,012
Catch a few winner

352
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,552
no?Not one? Shocking.

353
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,750
How many races were
there? Nine? Anything?

354
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:05,693
Did you blow the whole $300?

355
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:09,591
I bet your grandpa doesn't
have $5 left in his wallet.

356
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,282
Can't pick a winner to save his life.

357
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:15,453
- August 14th, 1983.
- And away we go.

358
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,840
Kentucky mistress...

359
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:20,571
lady's a charm, please
pass the salt -- winners.

360
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,163
Not one
-- three.

361
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:26,630
That trifecta was the
overlay of the century.

362
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:29,290
I clocked their
workouts for four months.

363
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:32,273
You clocked your shits for four months.

364
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:35,240
I asked that prick over there
to pedal his little bicycle,

365
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:40,421
which I bought him, up to del mar
and throw down $100 on a sure thing.

366
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:41,472
Father of the year.

367
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:45,102
What the fuck does he do? He pockets it.

368
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,823
Goes out and buys himself
some "star trek" piece of shit.

369
00:22:48,848 --> 00:22:49,952
It was boba fett.

370
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:52,431
I don't even know what that means.

371
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:54,402
Ganef!

372
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,210
I trusted you, and you lied to me.

373
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,852
"Oh, dad, the horse lost."

374
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:03,341
They did lose every other time.

375
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:05,630
You never won.

376
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,921
That trifecta was a fluke.

377
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,790
That's the beauty of gambling.

378
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:14,023
You lose, you lose, and then
you win big to make up for it.

379
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:15,991
You stole my win-big.

380
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,430
You destroyed the beauty.

381
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:21,573
What the hell were you doing, sending two
kids to the track to place your bets, anyway?

382
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,973
- Judah would have never - -
the whole thing was judah's idea!

383
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:27,772
Lower your voice. You'll
agitate your bubbie.

384
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,431
Bubbie was in on it, too!

385
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:32,902
She told us we should take your money, we should
go down to the boardwalk and have some fun.

386
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,421
"He'll never win," she
said. "He's a schlimazel."

387
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,952
- She never said such a thing.
- She did! She did.

388
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:41,401
- Tell him, bubbie.
- Leave her alone. She's a bag of broccoli.

389
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,600
If judah were alive today -

390
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:44,923
- She's trying to talk.
- If judah were alive today, what?

391
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,341
She's trying to talk!

392
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,532
Geharget mach.

393
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,381
What did she say?

394
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,670
Something about target.

395
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,640
Idiot. It's yiddish.

396
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:05,983
She speaks yiddish.

397
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,611
What does it mean?

398
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,923
It means "kill me."

399
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:13,622
You see what you've done?

400
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:17,371
- Oh, could I just - -
stay back behind the line.

401
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:33,693
Oh, you think there's a tiny, little
immigrant stuffed in my lipstick?

402
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,062
Joke.

403
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:41,232
You didn't laugh 'cause I was
redundant, right? "Tiny, little."

404
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:53,010
Bingo! This one is mine, boys.

405
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:02,470
Would you like to explain to me why
you have drugs hidden in your vehicle?

406
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:10,843
Welcome back, blanca. Took you a while.

407
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,500
I see you got some souvenirs.

408
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:17,963
They tore the car apart, couldn't
find anything. Your guys are good.

409
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,702
Good at what?

410
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:22,720
They're in the engine. Am I right?

411
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:24,783
What's in the engine?

412
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,502
The drugs.

413
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:29,662
Who said anything about drugs,
man? Where are my inhalers?

414
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,482
Uh, oh, right. The inhalers.

415
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:35,422
They were confiscated. Apparently,
I needed a prescription.

416
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:39,792
You buy a prescription for 10
bucks from the guy in the farmacia.

417
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:41,721
I ask you for one thing.

418
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:44,020
You know how much a ventolin costs here?

419
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:45,611
Shit!

420
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:46,803
Mira.

421
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:51,711
What?

422
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:56,320
It's a camera, like
"taxicab confession."

423
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:59,211
This was to see how you
did with the border cops.

424
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,153
We're gonna do postgame later.

425
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,683
You were recording me?

426
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,702
Edit down a highlight reel.

427
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,281
No, wait, wait. You were
recording me, and there's no drugs?

428
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:10,543
The car was clean?

429
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:12,431
It kind of smells like pee.

430
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:16,682
So, what, you're
just... fucking with me?

431
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,113
This is bullshit.

432
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:25,690
You think those guys who flew into the towers
-- that was their first time on an airplane, huh?

433
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:30,292
It's practice.

434
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:35,182
Go home and think about
what you did wrong.

435
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:38,033
Tomorrow, we review the tape.

436
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,623
Do I get paid for that, too?

437
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:45,312
You lucky you getting half.

438
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,882
You lost my inhalers.

439
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,870
I think I'm starting to believe you.
