1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,638
Few people could have anticipated.

2
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:03,928
- Thank you, Mr. Groff.
- Sullivan.

3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:05,148
Dumb name.

4
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:06,234
My name is Guillermo.

5
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:09,617
Tell your friend U-turn...
You tell him he's a lawn jockey now

6
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,145
- What the fuck is this?
- Your pot.

7
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:14,743
You were supposed to pick up
a key of jack.

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:15,969
Heroin?

9
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:18,478
I'm gonna kill
that bean-farting motherfucker.

10
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,751
Heroin?

11
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:21,206
Chop that shit up.

12
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:22,795
Bring me back $12,500.

13
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:24,782
How am I supposed to
put food on my table

14
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:26,405
if you keep upping my debt?!

15
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,149
Get a fucking job.

16
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:29,699
You're a very beautiful woman.

17
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,211
I bet you look good rolling
right out of bed in the morning.

18
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,793
If I hire you, I'll be paying for the
right to make comments like that.

19
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,394
As long as you're okay
with being shot down every time.

20
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:39,639
Can you grow here?

21
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:41,063
Hell, yeah. It's perfect.

22
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,092
Fuckin' shame
it's all gonna be for U-turn.

23
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:44,957
You let me worry about U-turn.

24
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:49,614
You know, this community-service
thing is totally unsupervised.

25
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,073
I will never let you deal.

26
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,488
You don't have a choice.
I know you don't.

27
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,298
That is your battle buddy!

28
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,287
I can't wait to kill me some terrorists.

29
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,440
Are you kidding me?

30
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,529
This is gonna be great!

31
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:08,686

Synchro et relecture :
Macanto/Michvanilly/[dx]Samael/San-A/

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,444
Now point the camera
at my ass. Hurry.

35
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,928
I don't want to
see your balls, man!

36
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,142
Tuck 'em away!

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,341
All right. There. There. Fine.

38
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,022
Ready? Okay.

39
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:14,902
It's coming.
oh, and it's a good one.

40
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:16,819
Hey, what is that?

41
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,631
It's showtime!

42
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,817
Wow! That was Rodriguez?

43
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:26,127
Yeah. And they
fucking killed him.

44
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:27,846
For trying to light farts?

45
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,508
They don't
need a reason, Doug.

46
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,429
It's Pat Tillman
all over again.

47
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,617
I got to forward this
to my fraternity brothers.

48
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,433
Forward it to Lowell Bergman, all right?
Forward it to Harry Reid.

49
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:37,959
Are they beta phi omegas?

50
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,891
Ok. I love you.

51
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,466
And I thank you for the pants
and the chinese food

52
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,895
and, what, 70, 80 bucks
that you got here.

53
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:48,951
But uninformed Doug, Doug
of the disengaged electorate,

54
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,172
that Doug needs to remove
himself from the room

55
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,282
'cause I'm
riding the edge here.

56
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:57,356
D'you want me to answer it?

57
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,485
That's how they track you.
That's how they got Rodriguez.

58
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,734
If you answer it,
I could be a dead man.

59
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,079
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Botwin.</i>

60
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,890
He's not available right now.
Who, may I ask, is calling?

61
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:15,324
<i>You know who this is.</i>

62
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,009
What? What?

63
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,291
Scary. Deep voice.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,808
Very deep.

65
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:23,657
Very scary.

66
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:26,201
You can't stay here.

67
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:29,960
They are going to kill you, Andy.

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,227
I sold Jesus a quarter ounce
at the fast mart.

69
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:39,945
He's a mexican guy
who's on roadkill with me,

70
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,324
working off a D.U.I.

71
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,430
He loves the lord,

72
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,130
and he loves weed.

73
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,862
And so does his cousin Javier,

74
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,751
who works in the kitchen
at Amechi's.

75
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,357
I only sold him a dime,

76
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,676
but two of the delivery guys
bought a half ounce each.

77
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:55,304
Got a free meatball sub,
does that happen to you a lot?

78
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,248
- Free food?
- Not really.

79
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,844
Happened to me twice today.

80
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,262
Want some jerky?

81
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,644
Thank you, no.

82
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,110
After the sub, I drove back,

83
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,828
and checked in with my supervisor,

84
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,544
- and he sent me to bingo.
- Bingo.

85
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:09,849
At the retirement home,

86
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,638
run by church volunteers
and misdemeanor felons.

87
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:14,651
Three customers there.

88
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,125
Mr. Mertes.

89
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,323
You sell to Mertes?

90
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,759
Any cars following you?

91
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:20,912
No.

92
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,038
You sold $2,000 in a day.

93
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,432
- Impressive, huh?
- Temporary.

94
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,463
This is not a career path.

95
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,441
This is a family in crisis.

96
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,314
And I'm being the good son.

97
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,034
I'm assuming you burned
through your client base.

98
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:41,639
Kinda.

99
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,221
Okay.

100
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,283
I'll make some calls.

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,559
But if you sell to these people,
you're not the good son.

102
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:51,366
You're some random punk
who sells for me.

103
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,422
Pick an alias, work your deliveries
around your community service.

104
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,062
Will do.

105
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,907
Give some jerky to your brother.
He's mad at me.

106
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:03,034
- Why this time?
- I put him in Majestic Summer School,

107
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:06,460
to keep him off the streets,
away from drugs.

108
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:15,704
I love that sound.

109
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,840
Hammer the nails,
pour the cement down.

110
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,853
Good men are gonna raise
their families here.

111
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,783
Of course, it's that kind
of missionary zeal

112
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,439
that's got us into
this mess, isn't it ?

113
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:32,990
We need these sewer lines.

114
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:35,790
We need these votes.

115
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,379
And the word around town says,
"You get Doug Wilson's vote...

116
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,635
The rest will follow."

117
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:45,142
Well, that's beautiful.

118
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,211
I'm thinking a golf membership.

119
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:50,455
Ok.

120
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,587
Now, I know a lot of you
are looking up at this board

121
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:55,154
and you're thinking in
yourselves, "Critical Thinking?

122
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,518
That sounds kind of square,
sounds kind of whack."

123
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,586
Ok.

124
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,748
Who here can tell Bob
what "Critical Thinking" means?

125
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,354
Anybody?

126
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,304
Hit me.

127
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,986
Critical thinking is the
process of conceptualizing

128
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,817
and analyzing information,

129
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,552
gathered from observation
or communication

130
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,474
as a guide
to belief in action."

131
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:21,976
You got a name, friend?

132
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,516
Shane Botwin.

133
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:24,934
Dap?

134
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,049
Blow it up.

135
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,405
Shane Botwin,
let me ask you a question.

136
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,886
Do you want to spend the next couple
of weeks reading out of a textbook,

137
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,306
or would you rather
keep it real?

138
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,986
I guess --keep it real.

139
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,427
'Cause I can assign you pages

140
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,162
from the textbook. You can copy
them into your notebooks,

141
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,169
regurgitate them later for a test.

142
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:51,385
I can do that
if that's what you want.

143
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,319
Or...

144
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:58,528
Maybe you and I
can solve a murder.

145
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,417
Cool.

146
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:04,454
Two Gs.

147
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,276
That's right.

148
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,183
The agreement was $12,500.

149
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,300
You breaking the social contract.

150
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:16,500
Well, I'm working
with some new people.

151
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,154
It takes time.

152
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,375
10 grand light.

153
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,046
Usually get a nigga shot.

154
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,046
Oh, good thing I'm white.

155
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,752
I've been shot!
I've been shot!

156
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,379
What the fuck happened?

157
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,551
I was getting the mail,
a truck comes by.

158
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:33,767
Blam! Blam! Blam!
Shot in the ass!

159
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,295
- Hi, Marvin.
- Hi, Nancy.

160
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:40,295
You two, go outside and start rousting
niggas. Find out who saw what.

161
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,483
Man, you think it was the mexicans?

162
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,813
Cucaracha motherfuckers
need to get stomped!

163
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:47,308
Fuck you man!

164
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,371
You bleeding all over, man!
Put your hand over your ass!

165
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,315
Blot that shit, man! Blot it!

166
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,922
I need a doctor!

167
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,386
You ain't getting in
my leather seats with that ass.

168
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,662
Oh, no.

169
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,706
No, no. No way.

170
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,795
- This one of these hybrids, huh?
- Yes.

171
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,455
How are you doing
back there, Marvin?

172
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,708
Got a fuckin' bullet
in my ass!

173
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,272
Are we sure this is
the way to the hospital?

174
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,887
We ain't going to
no motherfuckin' hospital.

175
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:20,538
Charge you 50 bucks for an aspirin,
treat you like shit...

176
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,447
...if you don't have insurance.
Make a right.

177
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,321
We got our own guy...
Dr. Tupelo.

178
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:26,876
He don't ask no questions.

179
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,225
And he real good at
takin' bullets out of people.

180
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,392
Lovely.
Can't wait to meet him.

181
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,484
Marvin, what's the gang sign
for those tres seis bitches?

182
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,653
Yeah, that's what I thought.

183
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,598
- Make a right.
- Who's tres seis?

184
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,460
The three sixes.

185
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:42,765
Guillermo's crew.

186
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,827
Little bitch is all moody 'cause
he thinks I jacked his horse.

187
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,078
You did.

188
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,385
That don't give him permission
to shoot you in your ass!

189
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:50,991
That motherfucker gonna get his.

190
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,817
You don't mean "horse"
like, like, horse like "neigh"?

191
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:58,148
Don't play that Doe-eye
cute shit with me.

192
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,312
I know you know better.

193
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:02,936
Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay.

194
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:06,212
- You buy or lease this car?
- Uh, I bought.

195
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,227
Hmm. How much.

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,314
I don't really recall right now!
There's a man bleeding in my backseat!

197
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,146
I have to pick up my son
from summer school!

198
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,436
Make another right.

199
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,913
I have to get this.

200
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,065
Hello?

201
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:21,742
I just want to make sure
those packets went out this morning.

202
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,080
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- Liar!

203
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,612
- Who's that?
- Who the fuck is you, nigga?!

204
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,784
Oh, sorry, I'm losing you. Bye!

205
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:33,152
- Make another right and slow down.
- Okay, now we're driving in a circle.

206
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,702
Yeah, but we're about
to go straight in a second.

207
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,760
Yeah, motherfucker!

208
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:48,680
Drive, bitch, drive!

209
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,743
We need these sewer lines.
We need these votes.

210
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:04,794
And the word around town says,

211
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:08,447
"you get Celia Hodes' vote,
the rest will follow."

212
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:13,387
I hear Doug Wilson
is getting a golf membership.

213
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,957
I love a woman
who does her homework.

214
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,192
Would you like
a golf membership, too?

215
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:23,125
- I don't play golf.
- Oh. Well.

216
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,165
What is it you do play, Celia?

217
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,981
I play house.

218
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:38,519
Hey, sweetie.

219
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,173
- How was your first day?
- Mostly sucky.

220
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:44,500
Only mostly?

221
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,698
Hello.
You must be Shane's mother.

222
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,293
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

223
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,631
Eve Meriweather,
Education Coordinator.

224
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,618
Well, Shane had a fabulous first day.

225
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,219
Bob really took a shine to him.

226
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,095
Bob. That's great.

227
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,835
- What happened to the backseat?
- Mom spilled some coffee.

228
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,533
And this is for you.

229
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,061
It's just some forms
and permission slips.

230
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,888
It covers everything
you'll need to know

231
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,222
about the absolute truth
ministries campus.

232
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,252
We got some super-great programs,
"Prayer Power" meetings.

233
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:16,084
And not just for Shane
but for the whole family.

234
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,408
You're a jewish, right?

235
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:24,411
Um, no. I'm not.
Shane's father was a jewish.

236
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:25,958
Did he pass?

237
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,168
Most people thought
he was italian.

238
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,547
Yes!
Yes, he's no longer with us!

239
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:34,676
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

240
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,038
Losing your husband...
I just can't imagine.

241
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,249
- Well, God bless you.
- Are these shell casings?

242
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,670
Oh, Eve, in a rush!
Got to go. Got to make dinner.

243
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,780
Buckle up, honey.

244
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,394
All right. We'll see you. Bye!

245
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:48,856
So, when you cast your vote tonight,

246
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,849
rubber-stamping
another environmental holocaust

247
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,193
the name of "Urban Renewal,"

248
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,280
I want you to remember
the san acitos dirt shrew.

249
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,239
How could we forget him?

250
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:04,071
Their beauty was here
long before we were.

251
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,337
This sewer is soaked in their blood.

252
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,734
Thank you, Jane Chaffin,

253
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:15,718
founder, president, and sole member
of the Agrestic Eco-Warriors.

254
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,405
Your passion humbles us.

255
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:23,342
And that concludes
the public debate on motion 412,

256
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,869
proposal to expand the sewer
and water reclamation systems

257
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,061
of greater Agrestic.

258
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:29,776
Let's do this.

259
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,106
- All of those...
- All in favor of more pipe, say "aye".

260
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,362
Aye.

261
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:37,446
- Aye.
- The "Ayes" have it.

262
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,453
A moment of silence
for the dirt shrew.

263
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,078
The motion is passed.

264
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,077
What the fuck did you get ?

265
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,519
House still for sale?

266
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,654
Andy ?

267
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:37,313
Andy's dead.

268
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,433
I'm Bill. Bill Sussman.

269
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,791
Here is your mail.

270
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,134
How's the army?

271
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,710
They killed Rodriguez.

272
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,175
I think I killed a Hernandez.

273
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,413
That's a wig !

274
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,278
Yeah that's all they had at rite aid...

275
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,762
Mostly wigs for black women.

276
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,268
Are these bullet
holes back here?

277
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:58,450
What? Oh those?

278
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,913
I was in a drive-by shooting yesterday.

279
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,810
I was ...

280
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,117
driving the car, this car!

281
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,677
I may be a murderer!

282
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,718
Murderess.

283
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:10,492
Actually I think we only clipped him,
you know, hit him in the leg.

284
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,540
- Hit who in the leg?
- One of the Mexicans, Tres Seis.

285
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:14,716
They shot Marvin.

286
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:15,717
Who's Marvin ?

287
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,055
I'm scrubbing his blood
out of the backseat.

288
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,247
It won't come out!

289
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,261
Are you ok?

290
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:27,174
- Actually Andy..
- Bill Sussman.

291
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,037
I think I am ok.

292
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:33,681
I mean, stuff keeps
piling on, piling on...

293
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,959
And while,
tomorrow is another day.

294
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,933
I'm pretty sure it's only giving more
heinous is gonna happen to me

295
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,227
because that just seems
to be the way it rolls.

296
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,194
I really think i'm finding myself!

297
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,186
Look at my hand!

298
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,666
Nerves of steel.

299
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,645
- Pretty steady.
- That's what I'm talking about.

300
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,783
Well, this is all good.

301
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:01,125
Meanwhile, a reconnaissance
drone killed my battle buddy.

302
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,673
And, I'm going to die.

303
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,780
I know too much.

304
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,745
I was hoping for a shower.

305
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,603
Maybe a little nap.

306
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,780
But...

307
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,788
You obviously are having a

308
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,349
slow psychotic breakdown

309
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,181
so I'll just ask...
Do you have any money?

310
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:21,776
No I don't...

311
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,969
I have a backseat full of blood...

312
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,822
I have two licence plates.

313
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,031
I may have to remove.

314
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,972
I have an assistance's job that
a monkey could do.

315
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,859
I have a death wish.

316
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:38,694
You're welcome to any
of those sparkly gems.

317
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,297
But as far as money goes...

318
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:41,788
Bill.

319
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,647
Everything that comes in,
goes out!

320
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:46,138
I'm gonna go now

321
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,315
I like this new you.

322
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,224
She's a winner.

323
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:58,028
Tell the kids I miss them.

324
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,310
You betcha.

325
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,531
Where d'you hear that?

326
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,148
You're sure about that?

327
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,633
That's good news!

328
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:12,306
Cool.

329
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,148
And?

330
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,508
Gunfire in the streets.

331
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,086
Brown fighting black.

332
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:21,573
Black fighting brown all on account of
somebody shot Marvin in the ass.

333
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,930
Something about a Mexican,
and a tinted truck...

334
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,018
Driving up and... pop pop pop :
right in Marvin's ass.

335
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:29,732
That's one big ass.

336
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,478
Maybe if that Mexican had a better aim,
he wouldn't have needed three shots.

337
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,522
Maybe if he had'n't used his auntie's
snubnose piece of shit you'll be right.

338
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,387
Still...

339
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,034
War is on.

340
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:42,842
War is on...?

341
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:47,269
- More males..?
- I think that's the last of them.

342
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,394
And why are you doing that?

343
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,205
Got to separate the males
from the females,

344
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,556
or they'll fuck up the whole crop.

345
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:57,815
How d'you know they male?

346
00:16:57,873 --> 00:16:59,596
They got a little plant dick?

347
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:01,933
No dicks, just sacs.

348
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,546
Plants looking good in there.

349
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:08,186
That's because it's a room
full of women!

350
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:12,944
Steppin' up.

351
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:19,225
And we're sitting out there like lambs.

352
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,134
And Rodriguez, he's got the cellphone
up in his hands, just like that.

353
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,054
When it struck.

354
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,201
Right in the chest,
into his heart.

355
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,384
Tell them.

356
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,951
- What did he say?
- He says "Wow"!

357
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,485
- Shocking ...
- Shocking !

358
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:44,694
Shocking !

359
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,602
A naive kid, a great kid.

360
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,552
Who only wanted to serve his country.

361
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,494
eating our vindaloo,

362
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,687
Watching "dancing with the stars",

363
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,734
And we don't wanna know about it!

364
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,343
You tell that to Rodrigez
tell it to his fucking corpse

365
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:24,874
Hey Mom.

366
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:25,977
Hey you.

367
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,128
Got a lots of calls from clients today.

368
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,797
- Oh yeah?
- People seems to like the new guy.

369
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,142
Judah.

370
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:38,126
Tip of the hat to the old man.

371
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,337
We're gonna need
more product soon.

372
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:44,975
I'm having homework issues.

373
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,070
Come here, let me see.

374
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:50,937
The day after prom,

375
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:54,046
A murder has taken place,
and blood has been found.

376
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,568
Principal Paul calls up
detective Dan to investigate.

377
00:18:58,162 --> 00:18:59,799
It's like an episode of CSI.

378
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,129
I have to use my power
of critical thinking...

379
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,913
- ...to solve a murder.
- Who's that?

380
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:06,280
That's Kyle. He disappeared
right after the murder.

381
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,858
This is Jill.

382
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,645
Her blood matches the blood
found at the crime scene and...

383
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,298
...this is Mia, the cheerleader.

384
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,523
Kyle promised to
take her to the prom...

385
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,720
...then dumped her hard.

386
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,642
Jealous Mia murdered Jill.

387
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,929
- That's what I thought too.
- So what's the problem?

388
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,887
Every day we get new clues,
and today we got this one.

389
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,789
Two days later,

390
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,360
Jill, arrived at school.

391
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,431
I though Jill was
murdered, that's bogus.

392
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:31,692
No body, no murder.

393
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,075
It doesn't add up.

394
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,457
-W- w-v-m-d
-W-w-v...

395
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:39,682
What would Vic Mackey do?

396
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,189
He'd plant evidence
and coerce a confession.

397
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,840
Okay but, what's
detective Dan gonna do?

398
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,844
Drink myself
into a stupor and,

399
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,713
sleep with my prostitute/informer.

400
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,066
No more cable for you.

401
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,477
Mr Botwin.

402
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,472
This is my lawyer, Dean Hodes.

403
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,250
Gentlemen, we called this meeting
because my client is tired of ...

404
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,063
- We don't care.
- Go fuck yourself.

405
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,123
You're in possession of US
military hardware Mr Botwin.

406
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,415
Where's the phone?

407
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:10,427
My client neither
confirms nor denies...

408
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,926
- Shut up.
- Suck yourself!

409
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,924
I'm setting in front
of  you documents...

410
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,778
which when signed,
will honorably discharge you

411
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,343
from United States army reserves.

412
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,018
You're the drone guy, right?

413
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,303
Lawyer, for the contractor?

414
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,531
Your machine killed Rodriguez.

415
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,541
You forced him
out in the field.

416
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,721
We were gonna strap that
phone to a fucking mule..

417
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,359
till we found
your two sorry asses

418
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,360
And then we figured
why waste a good mule?

419
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:35,308
Private Rodriguez died a hero.

420
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,799
Sign the documents, Mr Botwin.

421
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,147
I'll need to look these over.

422
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:39,734
There's no time to look
over anything Mr Hodes.

423
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:40,955
Suck yourself!

424
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:43,298
You see that windows
washer outside,

425
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:44,685
cleaning the windows
Mr Botwin?

426
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:46,498
Notice, anything unusual?

427
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,067
I don't know, should I?

428
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:49,476
He's a white guy?

429
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:50,950
Actually, he's a lithuanian.

430
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:53,574
And that squeegee he's
holding is a remote,

431
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,087
currently erasing your
hard drive, Mr Wilson.

432
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,808
Would you confirm that for me?

433
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:04,632
That's because ...

434
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,304
... that window washer,
is not a window washer.

435
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,635
He works for us.

436
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:12,611
And that janitor in the
hallway, he works for us too.

437
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,065
Turn on your vacuum Ivan.

438
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:16,625
Turn it off.

439
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,688
Turn it on.

440
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,414
Turn it off.

441
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:24,076
Two vans in the
parking lot, helicopters...

442
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:26,083
You're fucking
surrounded,dipshit!

443
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,692
And we can
make you disappear faster

444
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:29,183
than a mule can shit itself.

445
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:30,849
What's with him and the mules?

446
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,605
Do you think we're
fucking around here?!

447
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,895
You return our
property pronto, dickhead!

448
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,257
Give him the phone.

449
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,316
Give him the phone Doug!

450
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,420
What am I signing here?

451
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:48,021
You're not signing anything.
You're not here right now.

452
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,497
You were never at Fort Irwin

453
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,404
and the only man named
Rodriguez you know is

454
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:55,081
some asshole in the Yankees
thinks he's better than Graig Nettles.

455
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,079
Suck yourself!

456
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,784
Okay, you've walked
the crime scene.

457
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,277
You've interrogated
your suspects.

458
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:07,392
You've gathered your evidence.

459
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:09,427
Which one of you,

460
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,651
is ready to put
your critical mind,

461
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,059
to the ultimate, test.

462
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:16,215
Who here has solved,

463
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:19,268
the strange case, of Cordull high.

464
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:27,340
Crimes, are solved
by hard evidence.

465
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,519
Blood samples point to Kyle and Jill,

466
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:33,154
but, since both of them
showed up at school later,

467
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,139
there can be
only one solution.

468
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:38,831
There was no murder.

469
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,260
Ah, but there was...

470
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,212
A murder of the worst kind.

471
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:48,472
For you see,
Jill had an abortion.

472
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,840
It's horrible,
it's disgusting,

473
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,505
but I have no place else
to put you.

474
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,710
You're just going to have
to fake it for a bit.

475
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:22,718
Hey Mom.

476
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:24,547
What's up Nance?

477
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:26,288
What are you doing here?

478
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,935
Oh, just dropping off
some business,

479
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:31,295
getting a rundown
on the operation,

480
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,243
meeting the family.

481
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,606
Uncle andy's back.

482
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,413
He has a bag of ice
on his balls.

483
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,670
What's up little man ?

484
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,488
Shane, go in the house
with your brother

485
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:44,259
Listen to your mother, Shane.

486
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,089
She's a gangster
she'll keep you staight.

487
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,563
U-Turn, why don't you and I
have a little walk and talk?

488
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:51,084
You can't come to my house,
you're not welcome here.

489
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:53,993
Aw, come on girl,
we tied you and me.

490
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,691
I'm not fucking kidding.

491
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:57,160
Save it.

492
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,378
I was just dropping off
some bricks for your boy.

493
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:02,113
Oh, and I left you
a package in the garage.

494
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:04,642
I need you to hold onto
it for a spell, that's all.

495
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,239
Things are starting to
heat up over the hill.

496
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,387
You bought a Prius?

497
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,294
I bought seven of them.

498
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,276
I got my whole crew
driving them.

499
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,679
They're real quiet.

500
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,742
Good for sneaking up
on motherfuckers.

501
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:23,623
Ah, check this out.

502
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:24,876
Hands free.

503
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:28,504
What up Doe?

504
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,221
<i>Where you at U-Turn? You late.</i>

505
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:31,914
You bitch ass
gonna have to wait,

506
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:33,678
I got business going on,
fuck you.

507
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,642
See the shit
I'm surrounded by?

508
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:39,917
That's why I need more
bitches like you Nancy.

509
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:41,015
Oh!

510
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,423
And you could use this.

511
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:46,967
Watch it tonight.

512
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,105
Heroin...
