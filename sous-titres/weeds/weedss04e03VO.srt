1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,100
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,080
Yes, I set the house on fire.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,160
We're going to ren mar.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,110
- Ho, what?
- We're going to see bubbie.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,990
What's she like?

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,860
She's somewhere far, far away.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,750
It's a shame you boys never
got a chance to know her.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,830
But you can blame your mother for that.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Yeah, you're not getting
out of here anytime soon.

10
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,400
You fuckers ratted me out.

11
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,403
She got busted for a pot house.

12
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:29,842
Your pot house, mom.

13
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,782
Fuck!

14
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,680
Should I be nervous about all this?

15
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,213
Of course you should.

16
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:36,340
It's the drug business. It's dangerous.

17
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,883
You're gonna take a little
drive for me today, blanca.

18
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:41,243
And there's big money in
it if you do it real good.

19
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:44,462
Wait, you were recording me, and
there's no drugs? The car was clean?

20
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,152
Tomorrow we review the tape.

21
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,782
Nancy, what the hell are we doing here?

22
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,041
We're starting a new life.

23
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,450
She's trying to talk!

24
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,373
It's yiddish.

25
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,233
- What did she say?
- It means "kill me."

29
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:14,940
Her eyes don't move, but they follow
you like when you look at a painting.

30
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:17,123
She's like a painting.

31
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:20,131
"She's alone and palely loitering."

32
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,832
How is she?

33
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:29,072
Alone and palely loitering.

34
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,323
Nice coat.

35
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:33,511
Kept me toasty on the porch last night.

36
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,302
Bubbie loves her pelts.

37
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,820
What was wrong with the couch in here?

38
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:40,070
I got a little creeped out after
the whole "I want to die" thing.

39
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:42,850
Plus, it's like bunking
with darth vader.

40
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,693
The what thing?

41
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,733
Yesterday, bubbie told
us she wants to die.

42
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,623
Actually, she said, "kill me."

43
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:51,713
In yiddish.

44
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,561
Bubbie, this bubbie, the
bubbie that doesn't blink?

45
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:58,192
She seized a moment.
It was very intense.

46
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:01,003
- So she's actually in there.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:02,580
And she wants out.

48
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,830
I've got many long,
dark hairs in my tub!

49
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,503
I've actually got one
wrapped around my toe!

50
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,510
I'm thinking, "disgusting!"

51
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,933
I'm also thinking you're
going bald! Do women go bald?

52
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,061
Where did you come from?

53
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:19,270
Outdoor shower. No line. No lenny.

54
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:22,691
Where the hell is my bathrobe?

55
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:34,531
I believe this belongs to you.

56
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,820
And that belongs to me.

57
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,862
Another thief.

58
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,312
Good morning, shane.

59
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:45,413
You, I'm not talking to.

60
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,303
Is this still about me being a thief?

61
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:52,390
Or have we moved on to bubbie's
recent trip to clarityville?

62
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,362
"Kill me." "Kill me," huh.

63
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:57,560
What do you think she meant by that?

64
00:02:57,607 --> 00:03:00,623
Maybe it was her sled.

65
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,990
I said I didn't want to talk to you.

66
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,603
But you don't listen.

67
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:08,330
You just keep on talking, don't you?

68
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,050
It's a lot of hair.

69
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,580
You're under a lot of stress.

70
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:25,582
What do you think brings two people
together, miss hodes, chance or fate?

71
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,271
Chance?

72
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,043
No, fate. It's
f-- it's fate.

73
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:34,631
- It's definitely... fate.
- Wrong.

74
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,343
Please don't put me back in jail.

75
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:41,263
It's chance! And I'm gonna give you one.

76
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,913
A once-in-a-lifetime,
never-to-be-repeated,

77
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:48,501
small-window-of-opportunity
chance to clear your name.

78
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,780
Does that interest you, miss hodes?

79
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,653
Yes, it does. Yes.

80
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,981
I want to know where nancy botwin is.

81
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,192
I can do that.

82
00:03:57,206 --> 00:04:02,490
I want to know how she knows this
man, what she's doing with him,

83
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:05,583
when they met, and who introduced them.

84
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:10,110
If you can give me the
"why," I'll shit sunflowers.

85
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:13,203
And then you'll drop all the charges.

86
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,383
- Did I say that?
- No.

87
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,651
I did not say that.

88
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:22,601
I also did not not say that.

89
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:26,030
What you deliver to
me, I give back to you.

90
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:31,091
Quality of information
equals degree of leniency.

91
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:34,743
So I-I just, uh... what?

92
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:39,952
Knock on her door? Say, "hey,
nance, got any new mexican friends?"

93
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,452
Actually, he's puerto rican.

94
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,372
How he ended up running los angeles for a
mexican cartel is something of a mystery to us.

95
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:50,540
Guillermo garcia-gomez.

96
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,780
That's who you want.

97
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:55,410
Oh, I'd love her, too. Love it!

98
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,890
But her time's coming,
'cause that's fate.

99
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,183
But this guy, he's a whale.

100
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:03,390
And I fucking love whales!

101
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,721
I'm ahab, miss hodes.

102
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:11,543
Guillermo garcia-gomez.

103
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,920
You report to me weekly.

104
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,723
And, celia?

105
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:18,601
Yes?

106
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:24,461
I liked you blonde on
your driver's license.

107
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:27,753
Think about going there again.

108
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:35,071
Do you have anything to say about this?

109
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:37,543
Happiness is an empty bladder?

110
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,692
What's with all the skirt flapping?

111
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,100
I was drying my... self.

112
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:47,001
Silk chiffon. Expensive to dry-clean.

113
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,950
Chewie took a shit in
a bread bag one time.

114
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,042
So, that's why I got
stopped? Because I peed?

115
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,241
Yeah, 'cause you peed, 'cause you
went through right after shift change

116
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,192
when border guards are fresh and
eager, 'cause you wore that ridiculous,

117
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:07,723
check-my-shit-out, technicolor slut suit
in the middle of the afternoon on a tuesday.

118
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:09,971
Why you calling attention to yourself?

119
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,943
You're supposed to be
the all-american mom.

120
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,050
Get yourself some J.Crew. Blend, se—ora.

121
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,662
- Blend?
- Yeah.

122
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:21,141
Look. Look at your hands.
They don't stop moving.

123
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,951
Banging on the steering wheel, tapping
on the dash, fanning your coochie.

124
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,883
I had a lot of coffee.

125
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,511
So, next time, you have less.

126
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,381
Take some beta blockers, okay?

127
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,130
Just calm your shit down.

128
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,200
What do you need with all that?

129
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,863
The guy didn't have any change.

130
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,093
Oh, and he was the only one out there?

131
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,923
Look what message you sent.

132
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:46,833
A lady goes to T.J.Dressed
like a guera peacock,

133
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:51,352
and she comes back with nothing but the
mierda she buys in line at the crossing.

134
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,282
I told them I was
looking for fade cream.

135
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:57,021
All right, well, why didn't you have and empty
container to show the guys in the store, huh?

136
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,510
What's the brand name?

137
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,712
Ah, you're right. I was vague.

138
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:05,312
You must always be thinking ahead,
okay? Know what's around you.

139
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,653
Stay relaxed.

140
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,113
You've been thinking
east-west your whole life.

141
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,331
You need to start thinking north-south.

142
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,733
I want to make another run.

143
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,410
- Right now.
- Nah.

144
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:16,243
A real one.

145
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:18,242
You ain't ready for that.

146
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,422
You gave me a test. I failed. Fine.

147
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,930
But I get it now.

148
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:26,973
North-south. J.Crew.
Small bills. Beta blockers.

149
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:30,330
So school's out, hmm?
You learned all you need?

150
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,573
I learned all I'm gonna
learn sitting in a warehouse.

151
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,231
Ah, eager beaver.

152
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:40,313
Okay, you want to make
a real run? All right.

153
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,973
This time you're gonna take my ride.

154
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,552
Andy: Uh, there -- there's really --
there's really no easy way to say this.

155
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,841
You want to kill bubbie.

156
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,000
No.

157
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,483
Well, yes, but no.

158
00:07:56,495 --> 00:08:01,841
I mean... yes. And also no. Mostly yes.

159
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,260
Like an incredibly humane,
merciful, dignified "yes,"

160
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:13,060
up here in the foreground with
this deeply felt, sorrowful,

161
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:19,731
tinged-with-regret-and-guilt-
about-the-big-fat-"yes" "no" back there a ways.

162
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,280
I think it's the right thing to do.

163
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,981
Of course you do. You
talk to dead people.

164
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:28,020
It's what bubbie wants.
What's your problem?

165
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,961
We don't have a whole lot of family.

166
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:33,493
Do we really want to kill one off?

167
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:36,731
That in there, that's as
good as it gets for bubbie.

168
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,222
There's no recovery.

169
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:43,433
There's just pain and more pain
and wanting that pain to end.

170
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:46,011
So let's just kill her?

171
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,612
Let's help her find peace.

172
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,550
By killing her.

173
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:56,010
I wish you wouldn't make "killing
her" sound so much like "killing her."

174
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,622
Show some balls.

175
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,911
That's the spirit!

176
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,103
Yeah. Sure.

177
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:06,161
Death is no big deal because
life is just... blah blah blah.

178
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:10,823
Look, silas, life is just blah
blah blah. You hope for blah.

179
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:12,423
And sometimes you find it.

180
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:16,181
But, mostly, it's blah
and waiting for blah.

181
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,460
And hoping you were right
about the blahs you made.

182
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:24,310
And then, just when you think you've
got the whole blah damn thing figured out

183
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:30,190
and you're surrounded by the
ones you blah, death shows up.

184
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,841
And blah blah blah.

185
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,361
All right, let's do this.

186
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,930
That was good.

187
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,721
I have my moments.

188
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:49,463
So, the plan -- unified
front, three-man approach.

189
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,401
We send shane in to
convince the old man.

190
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:56,150
- Silas and I hide out here.
- What?

191
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,050
He likes you.

192
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,613
Fine. Pussies.

193
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:11,062
Fucking hotel key. Shit. Fucker.

194
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,672
Maybe they gave you the wrong key...

195
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:19,790
for your room that you have with your
husband, Dean Hodes, the lovable gimp.

196
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:21,673
Yes.

197
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,123
<i>Look at this thing.
Do you want to hold it?</i>

198
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,213
<i>No, I don't want to hold it.</i>

199
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,663
<i>But what are we looking
at, exactly? What is this?</i>

200
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,840
<i>Well, when the fires hit Agrestic...</i>

201
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,053
Oh, God, look.

202
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,393
<i>You said a "sneak"?</i>

203
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,181
<i>Yep, that's the term, kind of like...</i>

204
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, I love Huell Howser.
Don't you just love him, Celia?

205
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,481
He's so enthusiastic.
And his hair is so neat.

206
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:48,442
Pam, get your head out of huell's
ass and go out into the hall.

207
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,662
I need a lookout.

208
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:59,012
<i>I wasn't looking at it
from the right angle.</i>

209
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,991
<i>Now, she kind of had a premonition.</i>

210
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,632

00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:08,443

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

"Ren Mar is full of beach nazis."

215
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,201
Ren Mar.

216
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,533
Ren Mar.

217
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:30,312
Bebe? Regrese como
una hora o dos horas.

218
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:34,811
No, um... Sorry, no comprende.

219
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,430
- Farmacia.
- Oh, no.

220
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,570
No, I'm gonna stay here
and watch and listen. See?

What the fuck is that?

235
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:41,670
This is Lento. He's
going to see his mother.

236
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:44,593
She's getting a gastric
bypass in LimÛn grove.

237
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:49,180
I'm not smuggling any
illegals. I just do mota.

238
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:52,073
Mota, see? No illegals.

239
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,661
Oh, do not worry, miss.

240
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:56,141
I am not illegal. I got a green card.

241
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,900
- You got a green card.
- I got a green card.

242
00:12:57,918 --> 00:12:59,763
So, why don't you just
walk across the border?

243
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,520
I also got a prison record.

244
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:06,351
For what? For what?
Why did he go to jail?

245
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,913
Jaywalking.

246
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,211
Vaya con dios.

247
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,822
I need to talk to you about Bubbie.

248
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:23,171
Well, unfortunately for you,
I do not share that need.

249
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,553
But would you like a parting gift?

250
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,571
She's in a lot of pain.

251
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,973
Well, that's an amazing diagnosis...

252
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:35,271
considering you and
your family just got here

253
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:39,111
like little rays of
sunshine and euthanasia

254
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:43,983
and you really aren't as familiar with her
medical condition as, say, someone like...

255
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,062
I don't know. Who am I
thinking of? You know.

256
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:48,341
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue.

257
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,710
Me. But you nailed it.

258
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:52,511
What tipped you off?

259
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,171
Was it the morphine drip?

260
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,772
She said she wanted to die.

261
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:02,653
You know what? I've
changed my mind. Let's rap.

262
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:07,020
Here, have a seat right by my mother.

263
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:13,330
Now, what do you want to talk about?

264
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:17,123
I think that Bubbie has...

265
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:26,113
that you have the right
to choose your death.

266
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:32,771
Well, you got to respect a man
who speaks his mind, huh, ma?

267
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:35,800
I do it myself all the
time to varying effect.

268
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,081
But, still, respect must be paid.

269
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:39,772
Pulling the plug on her?

270
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,402
Is that what you have in mind?

271
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,483
Pretty much.

272
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:50,862
So, tell me, would you
want to kill your mom?

273
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:55,261
I mean, let's just say that
was her laying in that bed,

274
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,433
shedding hair all over the pillow.

275
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:01,101
If she said "kill me," I would.

276
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:04,613
Well, as luck would have
it, it's not your mom.

277
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:10,462
That happens to be the woman that
spent the wonder years kicking my ass.

278
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:16,261
Calling me a loser, a
liar, bad investment,

279
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:19,450
force-feeding me liver and applesauce,

280
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:23,623
hanging my dog twice
accidentally, or so she said.

281
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:26,571
But how do they get
up there in that tree?

282
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:30,193
I think you're having
problems letting go.

283
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:35,360
Of course. I am. I'm
having problems letting go.

284
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,502
You know why?

285
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,750
'Cause it's my fucking mother.

286
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:48,820
All eyeballs and elbows
and ready to play god.

287
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:54,130
Okay, big guy. Here we go.

288
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:57,360
See the ventilator?

289
00:15:57,398 --> 00:16:01,951
It starts here, and it ends there.

290
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:07,602
So, all you got to do is
reach down and yank it out.

291
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:12,143
Just give it a tug -- pop!

292
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,920
And she's gone.

293
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,483
Easy, right?

294
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,092
I can't.

295
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:49,643
How do you say "I fucking
did it" in spanish?

296
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:53,471
- "Lo hice, chingado."
- Lo hice, chingado!

297
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,312
- Ichinga tu madre!
- What? What does that mean?

298
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,631
That means you hit a fucking pothole.

299
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,870
I'm sorry. We're almost there.

300
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,362
Are you lost, miss?

301
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,021
We keep turning right.

302
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,532
Well, these streets all look the same.

303
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:12,883
Have you been to Guillermo's
drug warehouse before?

304
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,492
Do you know if it's by an ez storage?

305
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:17,380
Maybe if you stop and ask.

306
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:21,250
Yeah, not the kind of thing
you can ask someone... else.

307
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,853
It's -- it's this way.

308
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,052
You drive for shit.

309
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,240
Sorry. Wait, this looks familiar.

310
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:33,093
Oh, this is it. This is it.

311
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:52,471
Ilo hice, chingado!

312
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,031
Lo hice, chingado.

313
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,442
Hola?

314
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,643
Guillermo?

315
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:04,202
Chewie?

316
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,710
Shit.

317
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:12,610
Is here?

318
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,951
No. Is not here.

319
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:20,192
Well, is here, but here isn't
here anymore, apparently.

320
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:22,950
Uh, you will please let me out now?

321
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,162
No.

322
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:28,351
I want to. But you're a criminal
of some sort, and we're alone.

323
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,900
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:35,001
'Cause I'm sure you're quite possibly a
very nice mexican man who loves his mother,

325
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:38,611
but you might also want to
make a hat out of my kidneys.

326
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,371
So we'll get you out soon.

327
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,730
Soonish.

328
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:55,330
What the fuck do you want?

329
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,330
I'll give you a beer. Will you go away?

330
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,082
Can I drink my beer first?

331
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,751
Only if you swear, by whatever
god you consider significant,

332
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,700
that you absolutely will not speak.

333
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,850
Yeah, okay.

334
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,662
You're -- you're gonna talk. Give me
the pabst back. Get the fuck out of here.

335
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:16,182
I'm not talking. I'm drinking.

336
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,412
Just start talking.

337
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,870
We both know you're gonna
talk, so go ahead and talk.

338
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:33,331
You're trying to put
me on tilt aren't you?

339
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:49,743
Fuck! Say it! You want
me to kill my mother!

340
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,223
- That really hurt!
- Say it!

341
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:59,292
Goddamn it, yes! Yes, I
want you to pull the plug!

342
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:00,953
I want you to cash in her chips.

343
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,203
I want you to enter
her in the dirt derby.

344
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:06,582
You're the one who told
us what she said... You.

345
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:10,191
It was yiddish. You could have
said anything, any lie you wanted.

346
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,590
But you told us.

347
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:15,683
You can't listen to that. She doesn't
know what's coming out. It's just talk.

348
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:18,360
- How often does she talk?
- I don't know.

349
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,231
How many times does she
say, "I want to die"?

350
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,463
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

351
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:26,193
Once, twice, several times,
a bunch, often, never.

352
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,611
What do you want me to say,
that I want to kill my mother?

353
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,061
That I want her dead? I
wish this would all go away?

354
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,093
- Yeah.
- Fine.

355
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:38,273
I wish she were dead and
this would all go away.

356
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,371
So, do you want to be the one who...

357
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,522
like this is some fucking honor?

358
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:06,051
- You do it.
- No way. She likes me.

359
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,270
Nancy.

360
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:15,342
Bubbie did say bringing not-Francie
into the family would kill her.

361
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:18,372
Psychic, my mother.

362
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:27,882
Is here LimÛn grove?

363
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:30,441
No. No limÛn grove.

364
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,692
Will you please shut up about LimÛn
grove every time I hit the... brake?

365
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:36,572
I've got to pick up my mama.

366
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,430
She gets discharged at 5:00, and they're
just gonna leave her in the hallway.

367
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:43,922
Listen, listen. Lento, I'm sorry.

368
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:49,781
It's just I'm dealing with some seriously
thwarted expectations of my own right now.

369
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:56,461
I'm gonna go inside.

370
00:21:56,485 --> 00:22:00,710
If Guillermo doesn't call me back in 20
minutes, I'll bring some tools and get you out.

371
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:01,623
I have to pee.

372
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:03,943
You go right ahead, sweetie.

373
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:08,120
Hi, guys.

374
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:13,763
We're just, uh, saying our good-byes.

375
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:16,381
- Oh, my god. Did Bubbie...
- No.

376
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:23,032
We decided it would be best to pull the
plug, though, and let her rest in peace.

377
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:25,493
Tonight.

378
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:32,673
Actually, we decided, uh, you should...

379
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:36,493
do the honors.

380
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,020
I'm...

381
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:44,952
One sec.

382
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,772
Um, hola.

383
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:50,111
Hey, you got my pot,
my truck, and my cousin Lento?

384
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,840
Where the hell are you?

385
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,000
Outside.

386
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,540
I'll be back in a sec.

387
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,270
It's okay, Nance. Go outside.

388
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,712
Uh, gather your thoughts.

389
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:09,423
When you're ready, we'll be here.

390
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:15,533
Where were you guys?

391
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,173
Security breach.

392
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,630
Change of venue.

393
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,112
And how do you know where I live?

394
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,500
It's in your GPS. Under "home."

395
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:24,470
That's nice.

396
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:29,980
I-I need to go kill my dead
husband's grandmother now.

397
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:32,382
Been there.

398
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:36,091
Dinero.

399
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:42,460
Oh, shit!

400
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,680
- Mucho dinero.
- Si.

401
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,563
Balls!

402
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:00,352
Fuck!

403
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:08,081
Think Andy gets residuals for this?

404
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:11,252
That foot is kind of hot.

405
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:13,413
Does that make me gay?

406
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:17,051
Crap. This is my favorite part.

407
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:20,320
Need like 10 more minutes, Izzy.

408
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:23,372
- Carilli.
- Wilson. I want answers.

409
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:26,411
We researched the insurance
policies on the municipal buildings.

410
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:31,261
There are several discrepancies that...
oh, Jesus cock, you got a Christ-on.

411
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:33,002
Sorry about that.

412
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,751
Must be upsetting.

413
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:36,702
Unless you own a horse.

414
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,281
I'll grab some pants, be right back.

415
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:45,680
Doug, say goodbye to Izzy for me.

416
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,471
And tell her I'm sorry that we
never got to watch porn together.

417
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:49,822
Wait, no, don't tell her that.

418
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:52,381
Tell her, "Herbie the love bug."

419
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,442
- What's going on, man?
- Nothing.

420
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,011
Where's my Armageddon bag?

421
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,171
Oh, no. Come on, stay, Doug.
We'll fight them together.

422
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:00,671
AdiÛs, buddy.

423
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:04,772
Oh, and that foot thing...
makes you totally gay.

424
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,852
I love you, man.

425
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:08,713
Gay!

426
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:13,051
Gay!

427
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:17,860
Bubbie, to be honest,

428
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:22,023
I don't really know
a whole lot about you.

429
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:26,572
I don't even know your real name.

430
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:30,543
I mean, I do. If I
thought about it. Probably.

431
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:32,703
Helen?

432
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:36,700
I'm -- I'm sure
I'll -- I'll...

433
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:39,581
read it in the paper
-- or on your grave.

434
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:45,853
Anyway... I know Judah loved you.

435
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:50,060
And I know you loved Judah,

436
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:54,130
and that's good to know.

437
00:25:55,045 --> 00:26:00,622
I know you aren't hanging on
for things you haven't done

438
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:04,570
because you did what you
needed to do. You were here.

439
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:07,711
And you touched all these lives.

440
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:12,452
And you were loved.

441
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:17,510
And you collected many
excellent treasures

442
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:21,881
which we will now have to
figure out what to do with.

443
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:26,522
Um, I pray that...

444
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:31,051
you will rest easy,

445
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:35,832
that you will not fear,
that you will have peace,

446
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:42,052
and you will thank god
it has come at last.

447
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:49,623
And... please don't be mad at me.

448
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,562
- Was that it?
- No.

449
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:05,731
- That one?
- That's the kitchen.

450
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,830
I can't...

451
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:12,410
- How about now?
- Getting warmer.

452
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:21,842
That's it.

453
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,452
She's still breathing.

454
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:45,700
Shane, get mommy a pillow.

455
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:50,100
- Is your mother a prostitute?
- No!

456
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:51,502
What happened ???

457
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:52,803
Is that her pimp?

458
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,500
<i>On the next all-new Weeds</i>

459
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:56,301
I found Nancy.

460
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,703
There is a gun in here?
It just makes me nervous.

461
00:27:58,806 --> 00:27:59,801
It's just a pick-up. ???

462
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,900
- Are we gonna die tonight?
 - ???

463
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:03,400
Holy shit!

464
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,411
???
