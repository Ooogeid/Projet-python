00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:05,743
There are many safe and ethnically
diverse neighborhoods in Pitt*, Penn*.

3
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:08,359
- Shane, who are you talking to?
- Dad.

4
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,137
I need to rent your empty house.

5
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,347
We need a grow house.
Can you deal with that?

6
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:18,414
Hello... Eve Meriweather,
education coordinator,

7
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:20,640
absolute truth ministries campus.

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,489
The wrath of Doug.

9
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:23,681
It's comin'.

10
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:27,021
What kind of man tears a
cross off the roof of a church?

11
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:30,400
An impressive one, I'm guessing.
That's a big fucking cross.

12
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:33,960
I read an article in the paper about
this cross of theirs that got stolen.

13
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,613
I think I just found it.

14
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,148
- You got a call.
- From who?

15
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,313
Roy Till. He's with the D.E.A.

16
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,204
I have questions.

17
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:44,312
You do?

18
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,815
I don't think our business
arrangement's gonna work out.

19
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:47,667
And why's that?

20
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:50,288
My customers don't
seem to like your product.

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,607
That's a shame.

22
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:54,340
Three guys on motorcycles
pulled me out of the car.

23
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:57,305
They said they're coming after you.
They're coming after all of us.

24
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,903
So, what do you want from me?

25
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,514
What kind of protection would
I get for half of everything?

26
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:04,100
Anyone fucks with you,
they fuck with me.

27
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,228
When they go down,
they go down hard.

28
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:08,304
Fine.

29
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:12,066
The fire started in their grow field.
Someone torched it.

30
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,027
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

Relecture: michvanilly, San-A.

34
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,257
Good morning.

35
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:17,416
After a long night battling darkness,
treacherous conditions,

36
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:18,911
and high walls of flame,

37
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:22,595
firefighters still do not have this
searing blaze under control.

38
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:25,264
The west end of the
charter school is gone.

39
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:28,344
We're trying to save the worship
hall now, but we're just not equipped.

40
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:29,998
Oy vey.

41
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:33,822
Almost 300 acres and
several homes have burned,

42
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:37,956
and with santa ana winds blowing
strong and tinder-dry conditions,

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,071
this fire shows no signs of weakness.

44
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:45,919
They say Arson is a sexual crime.
Couldn't you have just rubbed one out?

45
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,811
- You did this?
- Of course not.

46
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:50,669
You took care of the bikers, didn't you?

47
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,689
There are tinder-dry
conditions out there,

48
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,212
warm temperatures, low rainfall,

49
00:02:56,521 --> 00:03:00,033
high-density housing in a natural
habitat, Santa Ana winds.

50
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,765
- Not my fault.
- You're a gangster.

51
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,595
Shut up.

52
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,389
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Don't be.

53
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,701
Well, what's our next move?

54
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,144
- Pitts...
- Don't even fucking say Pittsburgh, ok?

55
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,782
We've had enough of that shit.
Just deal like the rest of us.

56
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:17,984
- Pittsburgh.
- Dipshit.

57
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:20,932
- Dad!
- Okay, enough, everybody.

58
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,114
Time to pack up.
We're leaving.

59
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:26,095
Take only what's really important, okay?

60
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:27,961
Everybody go.

61
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:31,569
Firefighters continue to lose
ground in Majestic

62
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,319
despite the efforts of several
local agencies.

63
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,976
We take you there live for an update.

64
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:39,136
Everything we couldn't get into
the van we wrapped in trash bags,

65
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,044
which we sunk to the bottom of the pool,

66
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:45,720
because we figure the pool can't
burn, right? Now we're just praying,

67
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:48,448
that water doesn't get into the bags
and destroy the bowflex.

68
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,568
I am sorry to interrupt.

69
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,306
We have just received word that the
evacuation of lower Majestic

70
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,291
is now mandatory. I repeat...

71
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:59,350
There is now a mandatory
call for evacuation in lower Majestic.

72
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:03,114
Firefighters are going door to door,
telling people to get out immediately

73
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,891
as this insatiable conflagration
continues to rage.

74
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:08,575
Hello?

75
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,322
Hello?

76
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:12,538
Hello?

77
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,557
Firemen hello?

78
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:19,886
You're blocking my driveway.
I can't pull my car out.

79
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,577
We can't move the truck, ma'am.

80
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,364
We asked for a voluntary
evacuation of this area.

81
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,530
The evacuation order is now mandatory.

82
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:28,995
Ah, well, how am I supposed to evacuate

83
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,348
with your truck parked in front of
my fucking driveway?

84
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:35,289
There are shuttle buses running to the
evacuation center every two blocks.

85
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,481
I just finished loading up the car.

86
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:42,935
Come on, it'll take you two
seconds, and I'll be on my merry way.

87
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:46,167
- Please?
- Got it?

88
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:53,579
You spiteful, fucking piece of shit.

89
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:57,330
What if this was your house?
And all of your things?

90
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,924
I live in a shitty apartment, and
my ex-wife has all the good stuff,

91
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:01,796
so I probably wouldn't
give a shit, ma'am.

92
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,743
But you're welcome that I'm risking my
life and lungs trying to save your home,

93
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,924
your hybrid, and all your crap.

94
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:17,955
You know what?
Fair enough.

95
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:21,623
You know, I don't need any of this.

96
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:25,097
- I'm going to the shuttle!
- Good for you.

97
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:33,456
Here's my phone number.

98
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,640
Call me... a few drinks.

99
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,057
Some angry sex.

100
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,260
Here I go.

101
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,443
Okay, we need to be leaving.
I smell smoke.

102
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,439
Damn, Heylia, you get
nervous around the barbecue.

103
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,334
Just let me pack a few more plants.

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,090
Look, we've done most of what we can do.
House burns down, we start again.

105
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,572
House still standing, we
go back to work in a few days.

106
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:02,273
Oh, no.

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,603
I'm getting too old for this shit...
growing here and running there.

108
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:08,659
Fuck it. I'm going legit.

109
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,618
Now, what the fuck are
you talking about?

110
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm opening up a club.

111
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:17,329
Heylia's compassionate care.

112
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,222
What? I still got my connections.

113
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,016
You gonna buy from me?

114
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,400
So long as I don't have to
know where you growing it...

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,652
And I don't have to
see your fucking girlfriend.

116
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:31,177
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Fine... your cock-charming fuck buddy.

117
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,966
You know, I'm done fighting, 'cause
I know you gonna do what you gonna do.

118
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,489
I'm simply asking that
you keep it out my face,

119
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,521
and I hope for your sake, she
make a decent turkey,

120
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,804
'cause she ain't coming to
my house for thanksgiving.

121
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,048
Now, look at that timing.

122
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,594
There you go.

123
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,875
Residents in northern Majestic
have been ordered to evacuate,

124
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,981
and voluntary evacuations are
in effect for lower Majestic

125
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,376
and the area formerly
known as Agrestic township.

126
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:03,083
All evacuees are welcome here to
the Summer Canyon Recreation Center.

127
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,562
Dan, back to you in the studio.

128
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,974
All right, that's it, guys.

129
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,475
Let's get back as soon as we can.

130
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:12,826
Careful.

131
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,346
Careful! This is my dad,
not a washing machine.

132
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:16,419
I'm fine, honey.

133
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:19,375
No, you're not. You were banging around
in there like a pinball.

134
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:23,419
And were you trying to hit every pot
hole, or do you just suck at your job?

135
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,932
It's been a long night.
She's tired, cranky.

136
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,078
Dad, you need to stop
being such a pussy.

137
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,924
I'm not always gonna be around.

138
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,403
Here we go.

139
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,811
I'm ready.

140
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,182
- What's that?
- My turtles.

141
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,832
- You have turtles?
- Franco and Warhol.

142
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,027
How long have you had turtles?

143
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,184
I won them last year at a carnival.

144
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:48,496
Turtles. How did I not know
you had turtles... for a year?

145
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,300
No, honey. No waffle maker.
We don't need it.

146
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:58,100
Homeowner's insurance policy, deed
to the house, birth certificates.

147
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,767
- Daddy's earth quake box.
- He reminded me about it this morning.

148
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,645
Well, tell him thanks.

149
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,778
He doesn't want to leave the house, mom.

150
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:10,495
Good thing he can't catch fire.
But we can, so we got to go.

151
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:13,404
- Does he understand that?
- I'm not leaving if he's not leaving.

152
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:18,725
Shane...

153
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:22,668
- this has gone far enough, really.
- I'm not leaving.

154
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,355
Judah? Listen...

155
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:35,935
Judah, listen to me.
No, it's my turn to talk.

156
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,158
Can I talk, please? Thank you.

157
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:42,726
Kindly tell our son that
he needs to leave.

158
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,501
because his safety is more important

159
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:50,093
than hanging out with you in this
prefab shit box you loved so well.

160
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:52,120
You both need to let it go.

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
No, my hair's the same.

162
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:59,074
Okay, I stopped straightening it.
All right, are you gonna tell him? Fine.

163
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:01,335
Shane,

164
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:03,800
your father wants you to go.

165
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,549
I'll start loading the car.

166
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,095
The evacuation center...

167
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,650
Captive audience, high anxiety level.

168
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,894
Where there's smoke, there's smoke.

169
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,992
We need to stop off and get
my seedlings at the grow house.

170
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:21,577
No.

171
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,485
I'm not leaving without my work.

172
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,512
Fine, I'll go and get it.

173
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,909
You guys, take the van and
go to the rec center.

174
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,610
I'll meet you there.
Start loading.

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,114
- Did you know Shane had turtles?
- Franco and Warhol.

176
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,110
Right. Go.

177
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,102
Live at the scene here.

178
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:47,061
<i>Mandatory evacuations
of areas of majestic...</i>

179
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,740
Look at that! It's
right behind the golf course.

180
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,108
Okay, team, we're in a giant room full
of unhappy people with lots of cash.

181
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:58,051
So let's take their cash and
make them happy, okay?

182
00:09:58,357 --> 00:09:59,766
On my count. One, two, three.

183
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,040
Break!

184
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,660
* Where there's fire,
people like to smoke *

185
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,871
* where there's
fire, people like to toke *

186
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,943
* oh, where there's
fire, we can all get paid *

187
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,600
* and if we're lucky, maybe
we'll get laid *

188
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,626
- Your phone broken?
- Sorry about that.

189
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:28,199
I was trying to get as much
out as I could before I lock up.

190
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:32,055
It's nuts out there.
Couldn't even drive over here.

191
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,137
I had to park and sneak
under the barricade.

192
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,893
Should you even be here?

193
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,026
I was sent.

194
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,903
Got to rescue the magical Silas strain.

195
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,100
Plus, I hear there's a fire
barreling towards this house.

196
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,228
I was wondering if there's anything
I could take with me.

197
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,729
Heylia took a bunch of
it, but grab what you can.

198
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,607
And dole it out as slow as you can,

199
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,671
because I think that's
gonna be it for a while.

200
00:10:58,364 --> 00:10:59,421
Wildfire.

201
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:00,877
Guillermo fire.

202
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:02,831
No shit?

203
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:06,823
I don't think he meant for it to spread.
He was burning out the bikers.

204
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,495
That's what happens when
you make a deal with the devil --

205
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:11,686
Fire.

206
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,880
Fire.
"Fire on the mountain."

207
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:20,426
The Grateful Dead.

208
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,352
Can you make a turkey?
Can I make a turkey?

209
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,053
Where did that come from?
Just answer the question.

210
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,861
I can... buy a turkey.

211
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:38,724
Heylia makes, uh, these
deep-fried turkeys.

212
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:44,052
Unbelievable.
Yeah.

213
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,117
Can't really see myself deep-frying.

214
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,661
I'm more of a
bake-and-broil kind of girl.

215
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,851
Microwave, think I could fit
a turkey in the microwave?

216
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,188
You'd have to have a
pretty big microwave.

217
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,071
Or a pretty small turkey.

218
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,648
Nancy...

219
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,264
What are you gonna do?

220
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:11,642
If it all burns down?

221
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,096
Your house.

222
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:15,904
Your suburb.

223
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,899
Well...

224
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,245
Well...

225
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,950
I guess...

226
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,711
I guess I'd have to go.

227
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,060
Cookies! Would you
like to buy some cookies?

228
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,009
Drink up.

229
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,318
So, what's our next move, Nance?

230
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,479
I thought I'd get some cheese.

231
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,721
They're making fondue at cot 14.

232
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,048
No, not that.

233
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:04,111
The business, our friend Mary Jane.

234
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:07,841
Why don't we see how the fire goes,
and then we can regroup?

235
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,985
Well, don't forget that I am
in the group when we regroup.

236
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,755
Fine. If we regroup the
group, you'll be in the group.

237
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,901
She's got a great ass, your mom.

238
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,510
Don't be gross.

239
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,213
I was just kidding.

240
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,164
Isabel...

241
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,070
are you really a lesbian?

242
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,808
Do you really talk to your dead father?

243
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,551
I gotta go to the bathroom.

244
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:39,364
Go.

245
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,670
Agrestic-- shit, Majestic police!

246
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,678
Hello! Anyone here?

247
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,519
Holy shit. Hello?

248
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,445
Anyone here?

249
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,599
Sorry, guys. You really got to clear
out now. The fire's up the block,

250
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,320
- and it's moving fast.
- Holy shit.

251
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:57,252
I think they shot
"Peckers of the Caribbean" here.

252
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,860
Okay, the fire just took out the olive
garden. Come on, guys,

253
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,481
we really got to go. Let's go!

254
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:05,961
Franco, like the spanish dictator?

255
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Franco, like Franco Harris, the
Steelers hall-of-fame football player.

256
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:13,052
Honey, I know where you're
going with this.

257
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:15,232
We are never going
to move to Pittsburgh.

258
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,013
Mommy hates the cold.

259
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,100
If you still feel this strongly
about it in five years,

260
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,860
you can apply to Carnegie Mellon.

261
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:28,249
"And he doth great wonders, so that
he maketh fire come from heaven..."

262
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,940
Creepy.

263
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:32,867
What about Tampa?

264
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,010
Oh, I gotta go.

265
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,403
"And men were scorched
with great heat, "

266
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:43,626
"and blasphemed the name of god,
which hath power over these plagues."

267
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,253
Amen!

268
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,040
Stand up.

269
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,550
Raise your hands high and pray for him!

270
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,857
* the Jesus freaks are singing *

271
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,100
* the Jesus freaks are singing *

272
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,690
* the Jesus freaks are singing *

273
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,712
* they're annoying, self-righteous,
and lame *

274
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,949
Everybody, come on. All together now.

275
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,206
So, it's not your house?

276
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,051
No. No.

277
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,446
That house belongs to Celia.

278
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,149
Celia Hodes.

279
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:29,251
H-o-d-e-S.

280
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,987
Then why is it in the name of
a company that you own?

281
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,970
Well, because my company bought
it, and then I gave it to Celia.

282
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:40,492
Now, why would you give this Celia
person a house, Mr. Groff?

283
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,026
Because she was my lover.

284
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,198
And it was good.

285
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:50,296
And she was getting a
divorce, and she wanted a house.

286
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,626
But I couldn't put it in her name

287
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,540
because the divorce hadn't
gone through yet.

288
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:58,282
The power of passion makes
you do crazy things,

289
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,722
- captain Till, is it?
- Okay, so, you buy her a house,

290
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,567
and I assume you're
fucking her in said house,

291
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,068
she of the magical house-earning pussy.

292
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:09,837
Did you not notice

293
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:12,830
the many marijuana plants
that were growing in her living room?

294
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,606
Well, we broke up a few weeks ago,

295
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:16,895
so she must have started growing
it right after that.

296
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,493
You know, it's funny. I would have never
pegged her as the drug-dealing type.

297
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,262
She's a very complicated woman.

298
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:27,651
Jesus, Groff, if I let you stick your
finger up my ass,

299
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:29,747
can I get a Porsche?

300
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,933
May I go now, captain Till?
My work here's finished.

301
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:36,070
I'm due in Colorado Springs
in three days,

302
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:38,199
and it's time for me to hit the road.

303
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,664
Leave a number where I can reach you.

304
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,494
- Will do.
- Go.

305
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,927
Hey, I just got a call from Guillermo,
and I need to go meet him.

306
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,148
No. Nancy, no. Just stay here.

307
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:09,501
Stay here with me and the kids.
Get your toes done, sell some weed.

308
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,676
I hear there's fondue at cot 14.

309
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,402
It was just a cheese plate.

310
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,707
You need to stop hanging
out with bad people.

311
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,865
The man set a town on fire.

312
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,189
All the more reason
not to piss him off.

313
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,864
We just need to talk,
Guillermo and me.

314
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:27,439
- I'll be back soon.
- Do you have some sort of a plan?

315
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:32,693
I'm working on it.
Work in progress.

316
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,685
I got to get going.

317
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,966
They found the cross!
It's in a house in Majestic.

318
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,371
We have to save it!

319
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,694
- Majestic's on fire.
- Jesus will protect us.

320
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,628
Jesus will protect us!

321
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,292
Jesus does not make
you flame-retardant.

322
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:48,570
I have to go.

323
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,125
This was not
what I had in mind.

324
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,719
Act of God, baby.

325
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,037
Fire's part of nature.

326
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,053
Act of stupidity.

327
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,135
Those are people's homes.

328
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,871
FEMA's gonna set
them up at the Marriott.

329
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:10,702
They're gonna get room service for
two months, premium cable.

330
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,644
And they'll come back, see it
all built up bigger... brighter...

331
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:20,301
And then God's gonna burn
it down again...

332
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,711
'cause they don't belong
here in the first place.

333
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,438
And the whole thing starts over.

334
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:30,866
- It's the circle of life.
- Hakuna matata.

335
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,897
My house is about to
burn to the ground.

336
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,072
You got insurance?

337
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,026
My weed is about to burn to the ground.

338
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:40,134
My customer base is about
to burn to the ground.

339
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:42,313
For that, I don't have insurance.

340
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:46,854
Couldn't get them to offer me a
drug-dealer, loss-of-product policy.

341
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:49,875
- Then it's a sign.
- A sign?

342
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:54,556
That it's time to move on,
that you don't belong here.

343
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,609
This is not your home.

344
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,023
- What happened to the bikers?
- They moving on, too.

345
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,972
But I don't think your
paths are gonna cross.

346
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,810
What am I gonna do?

347
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,200
You're white.
You're smart, pretty.

348
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,349
Yeah, I'll think of
something, huh? Fuck you.

349
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,601
That's my entire life. All that.

350
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,177
Your entire life. Come on.

351
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:26,795
This is one tiny valley.

352
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,629
Over the hill, there's another
one just like it.

353
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:32,581
Then another hill
and another valley.

354
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,273
And it goes like
that, just over and over,

355
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,257
all the way south to Mexico.

356
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,385
You're facing west.

357
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:48,427
See, I could use you.
You tell me which way is south.

358
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,765
- You be my navigator.
- Hand off the ass.

359
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:56,124
And thank you
for the muscle.

360
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:59,964
Sorry, I can't pay you.

361
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,027
It's not my fault, is it?

362
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,062
I bring a lot of mota
across the border.

363
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:09,952
I'm not selling for you.
I'm nobody's bitch anymore.

364
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:14,333
Nah, we'd take you off the sales floor.
That's for the little people.

365
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:18,138
Navigator.

366
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,083
I get stuckin traffic a lot.

367
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:25,010
- Traffic?
- Which one is your house?

368
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:29,756
That one.

369
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,299
No, that one?

370
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:35,967
I don't know. It's over there somewhere.

371
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,671
Maybe the fire
won't get there.

372
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,269
And you can stay here forever.

373
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,246
Gotta go.

374
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,373
* Well, this is just like the superdome
except no rapeor piles of human waste *

375
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:00,590
* it's still not quite like
home even though *

376
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,815
* we got wi-fi, some cookies,
and toothpaste *

377
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:06,684
* yeah, it's just like the superdome *

378
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,474
* 'cept everyone's
white and middle-class *

379
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,202
* we got some yoga people chanting *

380
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:15,128
* there's lots of Gatorade and
toilet paper to wipe our ass *

381
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:20,168
* this is just like the
superdo-o-ome *

382
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,105
Apparently, a religious
group chanting

383
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,860
- "jesus will protect us"
- Check it out

384
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,767
forced their way
into the burning house

385
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:31,326
in an attempt to rescue
the majestic cross.

386
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:33,244
Now those members are being
treated at a nearby

387
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,883
hospital for minor burns
and smoke inhalation.

388
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:38,989
Can you tell us why you
ran into a burning house?

389
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:41,113
The Lord told us to go.

390
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,951
- Okay, I'm over her.
- <i>Hodes? Celia Hodes?</i>

391
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,906
<i>If Celia Hodes is in the room,
could you please raise your hand?</i>

392
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:55,708
<i>- Hodes? Celia Hodes?</i>
- I think they're calling you.

393
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,651
Is there some kind of
raffle that I didn't get in on?

394
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:00,152
- I hate it when I miss out!
- I don't think so.

395
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,266
Well, raise your hand.
See what they want.

396
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,621
Here! She's right here!

397
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:07,116
- Celia hodes?
- Yeah?

398
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:20,005
Nancy Botwin.

399
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,748
Sorry, ma'am.
This whole area has been evacuated.

400
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,793
I know.
I live here.

401
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:37,330
I evacuated. It's just my
house is right there. Please?

402
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:40,365
Ma'am, the fire's ripping through
the canyon right behind your house

403
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,067
- It's not safe.
- Look...

404
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,028
My husband's ashes are in there.

405
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,739
Please, I forgot
my husband's ashes.

406
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,766
Let me go in there. My house is
right there. I'm begging you. Please.

407
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:57,313
- You live right there?
- Yeah, that's my house right there.

408
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,667
Two minutes. I'm counting. Go.

409
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,789
Andy, get the kids ready
to go. I'm coming back.

410
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:18,012
It's time to hit the road.

411
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,259
No, now, Andy! Do it!

412
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:24,997
Well, then don't make me yell.

413
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,418
Okay. See you soon.

414
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,196
Judah...

415
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:41,068
if you're still here...

416
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:43,739
I tried.

417
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:17,810
Hey... where are the ashes?

418
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,298
I forgot that, uh,

419
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:24,337
we buried him.

420
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,337
Thanks, though. Gotta go.

421
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,903
<i>Special thanks to Liana,
Soofredin, Ledje, Ouazo...</i>
