Previously on weeds...

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,260
Is it true that once a whitewoman's
been wh a carpenter, She never goes back?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,310
Life-insurance checkmade

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,740
Shouldn't be any troubleto cash.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,000
Look at that.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,380
You owe mesome money.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,870
How much?

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,440
I need $100,000. Majestic
ischecking their books tomorrow.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,340
I might have accessto some money.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,860
I had a little emergency.
You'regonna have it back in a month.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,100
This is a scam,right?

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,340
It's just my way of
saying,thank you for your help.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,260
I look so happy.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,880
We're looking downa
long road here,mrs.hodes.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,830
Not me. We are getting a divorce.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,550
There's no one elsebut you.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh,god.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,450
- I quit.
- Bullshit.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,510

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,830
How could you leave all this?

24
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,840
A better,more lucrative
opportunity has presented itself.

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,060
Besides,we both know you'll soon be off
to build another just-add-water insta-town.

26
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,340
Utopian village,nancy.

27
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,350
Where are you going?

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,910
A company called aguatecture.

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,310
It's all good.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,270
Well,would you give me a
few days to find someone new

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,780
And maybe fuck you a few more times?

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,550
Yes,and maybe.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,890
Just let yourself in.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,270
Is your mom around?

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm starting to think you
just like me for my mother.

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,510
Excuse me?

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,770
Who's the one that's been
living in a grow house?

38
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,710
It makes a girl feel like she can't get
any attention unless she's a pot plant.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,910
How about we take a trip upstairs...

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,670
And i check your bud...

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,820
And your stems...

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,210
Oh,sorry. I have to go.

43
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,320
Hey,well,hold on a sec.

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,050
Who's the honker?

45
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,030
Kenneth.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,980
We're gonna go see
laser bach at the greek.

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,810
You're going on a date?

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,350
Yes,and now i'm late.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,890
- Hey...
- What's up?

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,520
I thought you were dating me.

51
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,340
I am.

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,150
You can't date both of us.

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,990
It's not like that with kenneth,okay?

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,290
He meets my cultural needs,

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,450
and you engage my sensual/sexual side.

56
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm just something for
you to rub up against?

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,390
Silas,don't do this.

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,560
I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow.

59
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,600
We'll dialogue.

60
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,420
Oh,shit. You.

61
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,980
Me --
carrying cash.

62
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,130
See? Have a little faith.

63
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,060
That looks awfully thin for 100 grand.

64
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,270
I'm doing the best i can.

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,950
Little faith -- that's
exactly what i've got for you.

66
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,060
This is how fucking broke i am.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,960
He was dirty. So was his partner.

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,790
They took money whenever they could.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,990
I know. I lived with
the creep for a decade.

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,180
He hid it somewhere.

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,970
Believe me,it's out there.

72
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,890
And the legit stuff -- the
life insurance,the pension?

73
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,320
Wife two's got it.

74
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,950
And she put in,what,six
months with the bastard?

75
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,010
I'm raising his child,and
i'm begging her for money?

76
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,310
I don't think so.

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,110
That's my goddamn fucking money.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,440
And i'm telling you,she played him.

79
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,910
I know it. What?

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,620
Suddenly he gets married
and then winds up dead?

81
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,060
Does that make sense to you?

82
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,060
That bitch knows something.

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,610
I'll need a retainer.

84
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm on it.

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,900
Doug:this is bullshit.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,170
You can't just toss us
asidelike we're regular people.

87
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,450
We're elected officials!

88
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm an elected official.

89
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,510
You were elected by a
citythat no longer exists.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,280
And coarse languagewill
not be tolerated here.

91
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,820
Fuck you,carilli.

92
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,460
We have jobs we expect to keep.

93
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,060
We have contracts with the
citywe expect to be honored.

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,990
I expect mineto be honored.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Wilson,if you cannot
controlthat vile mouth of yours,

96
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,400
I will have you thrown
outof this meeting.

97
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,220
Oh,don't you getall pious on me.

98
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,420
You promised we'd get absorbedinto
the machine here,that i'd get absorbed.

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,580
And as citizens of majestic,

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,930
You all have the rightto run for office
in the next electionone year from now.

101
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,910
Oh,horseshit!

102
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,450
Any city councilwith a half
a brain has got the system

103
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,470
So juiced up no one new has
a prayerof getting elected.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,180
Yeah,i want mylandscaping contract back!

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,000
I am sorry,but all the
landscapingis handled

106
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,710
By the majestic
ministriesdevelopment corporation.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,750
If we can'tget satisfaction here,

108
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,390
We willget it in the streets.

109
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,740
Yeah!

110
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
People! People!

111
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,310
There are other ways you canserve
the fine city of majestic.

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,100
You can volunteerfor
a municipal program.

113
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,180
Volunteeringis for saps.

114
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,720
We expect to feed off the tit
oflocal government just like you.

115
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,830
I'm afraid that all yourcontracts and positions
are now null and voidper the referendum.

116
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
There is very little moreto be said!

117
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,230
Mr.wilson,this councilis not finished looking
into your questionableinvestment in aguatecture.

118
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,570
Don't you bang that gavel at
me,you sanctimonious jesus freak!

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,470
You know,your long
skirtisn't long enough,lady.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,330
I saw your fat ankles
--calf,right into ankle.

121
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,050
Cankles!

122
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,890
That's it!

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,850
Cankles!

124
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,250
That is it! That is it!

125
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,580
This meeting is adjourned!

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,900
Cankle bitch!

127
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,910
Cankle bitch!

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,970
Cankle bitch!

129
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,180
How dare you?

130
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,140
Rude and vulgar!

131
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,310
You too! Man cankles!

132
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,420
Mankles!

133
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,000
Douglas,we need to have a word.

134
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,970
Okay. How about die?

135
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,260
How aboutaguatecture?

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,380
How aboutnone of your business?

137
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,550
Hey,how muchdo you know about it?

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,310
Not enough.

139
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,440
Mom,we got toget rid of tara.

140
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,310
Really?

141
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,410
She's untrustworthy.

142
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,900
Last i counted,she was right on.

143
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,660
And she wraps her money inthose
cute little jesus ribbons.

144
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,270
I'm thinkingshe's a keeper.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,840
Look,i know you saidnot to involve tara.

146
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,330
That's right,i did.

147
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,270
And i knowthat you were worried
that i would maybebreak up with her.

148
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,250
- Let me guess --i was
psychic? - You were right.

149
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay,you were right,and i was wrong.

150
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,490
I get it. I got it.

151
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,520
But we need toget rid of her.

152
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,110
No,my dear.

153
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,440
You need to suck it up and make nice.

154
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,140
So,that's it?

155
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,010
You're picking herover me?

156
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,570
Why can't youback me up for once?

157
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,260
This is notyour mommy talking.

158
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,910
This is your boss.

159
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,650
So i suggestyou listen to now.

160
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,340
What?

161
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,950
Tara's my top earner.

162
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,210
And when you bring inwhat she brings in without
getting emotionalor fucking up, You can make demands.

163
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,630
But until then,keep
your head down and learn.

164
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,920
She stays...

165
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,860
And you get over it.

166
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
Now...

167
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,010
As your mother...

168
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,520
I am sorry it's not working
outbetween the two of you.

169
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,230
I'm sorryif she hurt you. Little bitch.

170
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,460
You'retoo good for her.

171
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,080
And i love youvery much.

172
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,510
And you could usea haircut.

173
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,030
What's withthe banging in the morning?

174
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,340
Mom says we need tobeef up security.

175
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,670
That little thing's a camera?

176
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,780
Cool,huh?

177
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,410
And i can broadcast the imageto
any computer in the house.

178
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,460
Hey,could we pointone
of those next door?

179
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,400
Jordan klien's home from
collegefor summer break.

180
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,540
I can't spend all my timewaiting
for her to get naked one window up

181
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,600
And three acrossfrom
my side of the house.

182
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,390
I got things to do.

183
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,150
Your fatherwas good with tools --
always building things,fixing things.

184
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,000
I had to gothe other way.

185
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,040
Which way is that?

186
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,090
Destroying things,blowing stuff up.

187
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
Pretty good at it,too.

188
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,580
Unfortunately,not much of a market for
that particular skillwhen you grow up,

189
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,240
Unlessyou're a terrorist.

190
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,150
You could dospecial effects for movies,

191
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,230
Blow tunnels through
mountains,building demolition,mining.

192
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,030
Blowing shit upis not
just for terrorists.

193
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,460
Don't let themtake that away from you.

194
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,610
- hey,guys.
- hey,sanjay.

195
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,310

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,770
Way to own it,sister.

197
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,270
My friend isabelis a lesbian.

198
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,720
If i bump into her atnorth valley
gay pasta night,i'll say hey.

199
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,410

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,300
How much you need? I'll hook you up.

201
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,130
I could useabout half a pound.

202
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,910
Back in two shakes.

203
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,470
- Is that little thinga camera?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,430
Oh,it's adorable.

205

So,you didn't knowyou liked guys?

206
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,650
Is there something you'dlike
to talk about,shane?

207
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,740
Are youfeeling confused?

208
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,020
No,i always thoughtyou were gay.

209
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,380
Okay... Good to go.

Shaped like houses.

225
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,790

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,230
Who on earth would

233
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,280
Look,if you don't wantnone

Okay,who the fuck was that?

255
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,380

we should ask conrad.

256
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,100
Mom,i need toshow you something.

257
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,100
Oh,no. Shane,no more tutorials.

258
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,180
It's not a tutorial.
It's feed from earlier.

259
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,720
- So?
- It's the pool guy...

260
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,310
Checking us outtwice in one day.

261
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,340
- Is he a cop?
- I don't know.

262
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,790
That would suck.

263
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,530
Yes.

264
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,860
- Yes,it sure would.
- Look at this.

265
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,180
Whenwas this one taken?

266
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,640
It's the live feed.

267
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,630
It's the same guy.

268
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,090
He's out there right now.

269
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,780
Who are you?

270
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,820
Just surveyingthe water lines,ma'am.

271
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,410
You haven't hadany problems,have you?

272
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,340
You're not surveyingthe water lines.

273
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,700
And you're not a
fuckingpool cleaner,either.

274
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,580
Who the hell are you?

275
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,660
Private investigator.

276
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,600
You mind if i have that
back? I'm running kind of low.

277
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,490
- What do you wantfrom me?
- Let's walk.

278
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,960
My clientis interested in
finding outa whole lot about you.

279
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
What client?

280
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,610
Not at libertyto divulge that.

281
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,400
But you can tell me thatyou're
a private investigator.

282
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,310
Yes,i'm comfortablewith that.

283
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,540
I'm comfortablebecause i feel...

284
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,110
- You and ican do business together.
- Really?

285
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,800
I have a strong feeling,in fact,that
in exchangefor my discretion --

286
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,640
With the police,with
my client --

287
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,900
Dealingwith your illegal
activities Vismarijuana trafficking,

288
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,200
you might want togive me some money.

289
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,920
I have no ideawhat you're talking about.

290
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,900
Ah,that doesn't matter.

291
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,780
I have pictures --dealers
coming and going.

292
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,360
I even followed one -- the
gayindian kid -- on his rounds.

293
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,980
I have cellphone wiretaps.

294
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,190
Some of it's static-ridden.

295
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,840
I guess it's time to investin
that newer technology.

296
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,010
But yougetting the idea?

297
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,640
Isn't that what pellicano'sgoing
to jail for -- illegal wiretaps?

298
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,650
Inadmissible in court,absolutely.

299
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,270
Illegal? Yeah.

300
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,870
But if theywere to show up anonymously

301
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,250
at the d.e.a.office,

302
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,510
I bet an extensiveinvestigation
would ensue.

303
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,910
How much do you want?

304
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,300
Hey,i'm not greedy.

305
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,110

306
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,800

You can buy plenty of blondeswith

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,930
Okay,sinceyou asked so nice...

314
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,900

315
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,460

316
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,970
You and my wifewould
totally bond on that.

317
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,720
So,anyhoo,here'swhat you're gonna do.

318
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,920
Meet me heretomorrow morning
at 10:00with the moola.

319
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,350
Look,it's gonna take mea little more time
than 24 hours to come upwith that much money.

320
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,570
You're a drug dealer.

321
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,340
With expenses.

322
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,020
Consider thisone of them.

323
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,940
Hasta la tomorra!

324
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,280
Celia:son of a bitch.

325
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,060
Oh,look who's here. My family.

326
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,450
Hey,family.

327
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,420
Did you knowthat we're poor?

328
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,380
We're really poor.

329
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,620
Maybe we should cut downon
our liquor purchases.

330
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh,no.

331
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,970
All the poor drink.

332
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,890
Yeah,i sawthe poor this morning.

333
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,950
They all had bottlesin paper bags.

334
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,940
That's what i
need --a paper bag.

335
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,520
Wonderful idea.

336
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,800
You couldput your bottle in it and
then vomit in itwhen you're done.

337
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,380
I don't vomitfrom drinking.

338
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,470
I vomit wheni think about my life.

339
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,910
Isabel,why don't yougo for another walk?

340
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,830
See? I'm not the only one
whothinks she needs more exercise.

341
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,610
I don't thinkyou should
be alone with her.

342
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,660
It's okay,honey.

343
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,860
Why don't you go to
shane'shouse or something?

344
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,230
Fine. I'll call in later.

346
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,290
I will rock the house
of shanebefore i'm done.

347

Make some coffee,celia.

348

Aguatecture.

350
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,740
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

351
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,540

Up until this point,i

362
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,540
Because god knows what is

363
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,580
But so help me,if you don't come clean,

I will make sure a catheter is

377
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,030
Lovely morning.

378
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,650
It dependswhere you're sitting.

379
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,550
Aw,it's notso terrible.

380
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,380
You'll make more money.

381
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,960
There's always more money
in your line of work.

382
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,340
And there'salways more blackmail.

383
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,920
What's to stop youfrom coming back?

384
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,880
I give you my word.

385
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,570
You're blackmailing me.

386
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,790
You've threatened to destroymy
life unless i give you money.

387
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,990
Yes. I promise i'll neverdo it again.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,070
Cross my heart.

389
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,850
- I have kids.
- I know.

390
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,720
Took their pictures.

391
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,580
Handsome boys.

392
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,770
Can i have my money now?

393
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,000
They're not just handsome.

394
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,640
They're also smart,especially
shane. Off the charts.

395
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,320
There's a $100 buy-inat commerce in an
hour, and i'd reallylike to be there.

396
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,010
You're mugging me -- you'll take a
minuteto listen to what i have to say.

397
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,770
My smart son,shane,took
me to a store yesterday --

398
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,440
- Panorama city --off
the 405. - ********

399
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,270
Spyware store. You ever been there?

400
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,330
It was my first time.

401
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,640
I bought myselfa teeny little microphone
that you hideinside your blouse.

402
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,190
Recordseverything you say...

403
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,560
Transmits it backto shane's
computer -- actually,any computer.

404
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,930
Only $49.95

405
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,420
Technology'scome a long way.

406
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,980
And sinceblackmailing's a felony,even
when you do itto alleged drug dealers,

407
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,070
you probably want me to
keepthis conversation to myself.

408
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,020
So,i guess whatwe
have here is a dÈtente.

409
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,590
You tell the police what i
dofor a living,not good for me.

410
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,190
I tell the policeyou
blackmailed me,not good for you.

411
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,540
Understood.

412
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,100
Now...

413
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,990
I don't knowho your client
is,but i have a pretty good idea.

414
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,260
Whether you tell her whati
do for a living is up to you,

415
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,900
But i stronglyadvise against it.

416
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,310
This is for me?

417
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,470
It's a lovely morningafter all!

418
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,370
Oh,go fuck yourself.

419
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,570
If i could,i'd save a
fortunein strippers and alimony.

420
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,730
I'm off to commerce. You wish me luck?

421
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,100
So,how much do youhave for me this time?

422
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,290
$500? $200?

423
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,130
Some loose change?

424
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,070
- I don't have anything.
- Shocking.

425
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,910
- And it's your fault.
- How's that?

426
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,930
The private investigatoryou
hired shook me down,

427
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,670
Took all the moneyi was gonna give you.

428
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,060
Shook you down
--for what?

429
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,200
None of yourgoddamn business.

430
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,350
But nowi have nothing.

431
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,710
And frankly... I'm pissed.

432
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,620
- You're pissed?
- Yeah.

433
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,040
You didn't trust me,and
you really should have.

434
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,410
I was gonnaget you your money.

435
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,830
- Sure you were.
- I was.

436
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,230
And by the way,it
wasn't even your money.

437
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,400
I was legallyentitled to it.

438
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,260
Mrs.Scottsonnumber two. Me.

439
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,590
Not you.

440
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,870
But now it's his,and
that isn't my fault.

441
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,470
So i guess the whole
pointis moot,actually.

442
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,020
Thenwhy are you here?

443
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,750
I thought... I needed a friend.

444
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,580
I don't need a friend.
I don't need anybody.

445
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,990
Don't call me.

446
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,200
Bye.

447
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,120
Please tell me you werejust
in the neighborhood.

448
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,930
Your friend celiacame to aguatecture.

449
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,130
How the hell?

450
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,330
Did she see anything?
What does she know?

451
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,130
I was wonderingthe same thing,so i gave
her a call, 'Cause i still had her number.

452
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,910
She told me to tell you

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,200
And she knowsyou're dealing again...
