1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,890
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,030
guillermo garcia gomez.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,380
There's a tunnel.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,730
You make a bust, you get guillermo,
and it never comes back to me.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,400
Why are we focusing on my crew?

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,950
My people don't talk.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,860
When did we decide you
were gonna move your plants?

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,630
Something kind of fell into my lap.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,630
Where exactly is this grow room?

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,020
Back of a cheese shop.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,100
I could get some pot.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,460
You totally rock.

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,270
- Maria and I had sex.
- What?

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,050
I love him.

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,670
Department of immigration
and naturalization.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,470
We happen to have a daughter out there
who hasn't seen you in over two years.

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,230
I don't know where quinn is.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,800
She's living in oaxaca
with a guy named rodolfo.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,470
Who are the girls?

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,400
My daughters.

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,100
What am i supposed to do now?

22
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,440
We'll arrest you tomorrow,
make it look right.

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,260
We'll pretend to ask, and
you'll pretend to know nothing.

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,950
If you don't have any plans...

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,310
I'm seeing someone.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,550
Agent shlatter.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,390
Who is the informant?

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,760
Nancy botwin.

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,770
If you..........

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,320
I did.......

34
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,180
He said......

35
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,400
It is......

36
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,090
If I........

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,660
I will.......

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,640
If.......

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,640
you.........

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,240
Yes.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,230
Well,I.........

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,850
based on.........

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,580
Keep looking.

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,010
se—or.

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,290
My client reserves
the right --

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,110
shut the fuck up.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,940
So, you had no idea that there
was a tunnel in the back room

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,930
that was being used to transport
narcotics from mexico to the united states?

49
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,320
They kept the room locked.

50
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,500
And it didn't strike you as odd that strange men
were shuttling packages out of there all day long?

51
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,480
Of course it struck me as odd, but I didn't ask
any questions because a paycheck is a paycheck.

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,590
There is no law against being the
unwitting participant in a crime

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,360
if there is no prior
knowledge of said crime.

54
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,160
Thank you for that fascinating tidbit.

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,010
You know, I don't actually
turn 18 until 10:47,

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,610
so we got another 15
minutes to break the law.

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,640
We really shouldn't be
wasting it by talking.

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,960
Who's that?

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,780
Damn it! He said noon!

60
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,540
- Who said noon?
- Just get dressed.

61
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,040
Hey, guys.

62
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,940
Oh, this is nice. Very nice.

63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,350
What the hell are you doing here?

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,990
Rad told me it was a special occasion.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,260
Your boyfriend's 18th birthday?

66
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,270
Rad, I want you to leave the room
and shut the door behind you, okay?

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,540
Hey, twinkie. Smile.

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,070
Family-court judge is gonna love this.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,810
Sole custody is the only
thing that makes sense, henry.

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,470
Rad shouldn't have to
shuttle back and forth to napa

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,700
just because you fell in love with
some tasting-room tramp from trefethen.

72
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,910
Yeah, I still love my kid.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,980
Then live near him.

74
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,570
You took the cheese store. You took
this house. You're not taking my son.

75
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,280
- You left us.
- I left you.

76
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,210
I want to make sure someone's looking after my
son while you're getting high and banging 'nsync.

77
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,580
Funny, because you were never really that
concerned about rad while you were cheating.

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,060
Well, maybe I wouldn't have cheated
if you weren't such a fucking bitch.

79
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,420
That's great. Blame me.

80
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,950
- Sorry, dude.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,370
- You leaving?
- I want you out of here right now.

82
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,680
Yeah.

83
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,940
Yeah.

84
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,860
- get out. - Well,
I'm her legal repre--

85
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,920
get out, or I'll fucking
throw you through the window.

86
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,220
Oh, I-it's okay, dean. Go.

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,220
No, it is definitely
not okay.I'm her --

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,680
Oka-- this is a flagrant
miscarriage of justice!

89
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,730
My partner is dead.

90
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,930
Oh, my god.

91
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,340
His body was found hanging
on the border fence.

92
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,410
He didn't have a fucking face.

93
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,140
No face?

94
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,840
Who owns the tunnel?

95
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,370
Who owns the fucking tunnel?

96
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,920
You tell me now!

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,320
I-I don't know.

98
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,190
Bullshit!

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,330
Who's guillermo's boss?

100
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,030
Who's the fucking animal on
the other side of the fence?

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,160
I-I wasn't on the
other side of the fence.

102
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,100
I was on this side.

103
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm gonna get this guy,
with or without you.

104
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,050
And I'm gonna kill him...

105
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,730
after I kill everyone he loves.

106
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,090
And I'm gonna do it alone.

107
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,100
And if I find out...

108
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,180
you made me go the long way,

109
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,140
I'm gonna kill you, too.

110
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,880
He was my partner.

111
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,860
No buso directo.

112
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,090
How muchas tickets do I need?

113
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,490
First to san nicol*S.

114
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,640
Then to san cristobal.

115
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,540
That chicken just sneezed on me.

116
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,990
Then to mixtepec.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,770
All right, what about sitio de perdido?

118
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,390
That's where I need to go.
That's where my daughter is.

119
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,890
Give them to your daughter.

120
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,020
Beautiful movie star?

121
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,870
Kathleen turner. "Body heat." Is it you?

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,510
Of course it's me.

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,920
But don't tell anyone.

124
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm researching a film.

125
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,810
You know, donkey here
was an actor in live show.

126
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,950
Oh, you don't say.

127
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,350
No, I say.

128
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,610
Then he got replaced by a younger
donkey because his cojones --

129
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,980
they grow muy droopy.

130
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,130
Time is cruel.

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,350
Hey, mom.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,590
You didn't have to have her deported.

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,650
Oh, but you had to screw her, right?

134
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,680
Yeah, she's hot.

135
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,760
But the I.N.S.?

136
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,290
She wouldn't fuck me.

137
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,690
But she fucked you.

138
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,060
Huh, well, fuck
her -- and fuck you!

139
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,110
That was really awful,
doug... even for you.

140
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,970
There are rules among men, andy. Codes.

141
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,870
You don't have sex with
your friend's girl... ever!

142
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,750
Code breaker!

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,000
You had sex with celia,
your friend dean's wife!

144
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,500
Sowho's the original
code breaker, bdereaker

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,370
me.I'm a code breaker.

146
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,880
Me, too. Me, too.

147
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,630
Sorry, man.

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah, I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry.

149
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,930
I really liked her.

150
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,730
No, you didn't really
"like her" like her.

151
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,120
She was a fantasy.

152
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,720
You're still too in love with
dana to "like" like anyone.

153
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,620
Well, you're in love with nancy.

154
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,350
I'm not in love with nancy.

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,790
You so are. Why else would
you put up with all her crap?

156
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
I --
the kids.

157
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,980
My brother.

158
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,750
Nancy.

159
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,430
I don't love nancy, okay? Shut up.

160
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,890
- You shut up.
- So, you shut up.

161
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,670
Hold that thought.

162
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,380
Oh, hi, silas, son of my dead brother.

163
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,040
Where? Okay. Okay.
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

164
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,230
- I got to go.
- You want to smoke out first?

165
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,050
I can'T. Shit's blowing up.

166
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,500
How come you always
have shit blowing up?

167
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,910
Where's my shit?

168
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,380
I used to have shit. It
used to blow up all the time.

169
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,030
Now nothing. Shit just sits there.

170
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,480
That's some tough shit.

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,170
Shit.

172
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,940
Sure it won't get towed?

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,570
It's a secure lot. It'll
be fine for a night.

174
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,900
Put the sandwiches in the freezer.

175
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,930
And then as soon as I reach doug,
we'll move it all to his house.

176
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,390
Happy birthday, silas.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,960
Holy shit.

178
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,150
That's right. Happy birthday.

179
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm such a phasehead. Why didn't
you say anything? 18, right?

180
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,880
It's not a big deal.

181
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,490
Sure, it's a big deal.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,470
Could you stop playing
that fucking piano?

183
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,310
Look who's not in jail.

184
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
Told you I'd be back.

185
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,140
- What happened?
- Nothing.

186
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,770
Asked me a few questions. Sent
me home. I'm just a salesgirl.

187
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,310
Sure you are.

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,640
Happy birthday, silas.

189
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,560
Have a good time with lisa tonight.

190
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,250
Dinner's off. We're off.

191
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,730
- Happy birthday to me.
- What?

192
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,820
well, why don't we all go out, then?

193
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,540
How about that italian place
on ocean, say 7:00? Okay?

194
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm gonna go take a bath.

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,710
Mom... remember that
small-business loan we discussed?

196
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,990
It would be a great birthday gift.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Silas...

198
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,860
are you gonna back me or not?

199
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,880
- Uh, this is a bad time.
- And?

200
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,580
And it's a bad time.

201
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,070
Yeah. Well... thanks for
giving it some thought.

202
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,550
Hi, it's me.

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,830
How was your day?

204
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,030
Okay.

205
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,250
I got taken into custody,
questioned, released.

206
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,420
And?

207
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,090
Uh, had pancakes for breakfast.

208
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,040
Really? What kind?

209
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,290
Blueberry.

210
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,320
What did you have for breakfast?

211
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,720
Yogurt... and coffee and toast.

212
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,330
Sounds like a nice breakfast.

213
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,400
I'd like to see you.

214
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,080
- I'd like to see you, too.
- Tonight.

215
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,110
Tonight?

216
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,380
I will send a car.

217
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,870
Has to be tonight?

218
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
Yes.

219
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,630
I can drive myself.

220
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,870
You will come.

221
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,740
I said I would.

222
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,540
Te amo.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,820
Yo tambiÈN.

224
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,080
Perhaps...

225
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,220
they .........

226
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,990
Nancy?

227
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,600
Go away, andy.

228
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,880
Nancy, can I come in?

229
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,190
No.

230
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,990
I'm coming in.

231
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,560
Could you close the door behind you?

232
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,030
I can see your boobies.

233
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,430
Good for you.

234
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,300
Close the door and sit down.

235
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,500
They're nice.

236
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,830
Bigger than I thought.

237
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,400
Thanks.

238
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,720
You want a towel or
something? Two washcloths?

239
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,560
- Andy.
- Fine. Fine.

240
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,370
Are you going to jail?

241
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,030
No. I'm not going to jail.

242
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,000
Why not? Why aren't you going to jail?

243
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,730
I can't tell you.

244
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,730
You have to tell me.

245
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,680
I can'T. I can't tell anyone.

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,650
Could you turn on the water for me...

247
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,840
- add some bubbles?
- Yeah, sure.

248
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,580
I used to be able to rationalize
the things I did, andy.

249
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,770
Yeah. You were good at that.

250
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,550
Noanymore.

251
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,570
At some point recently,
everything became right or wrong.

252
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,820
Right or wrong.

253
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,880
What did you do?

254
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,500
There was this girl...

255
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,460
in a blue dress.

256
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,310
She was so young.

257
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,370
She had this bag with a butterfly on it.

258
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,390
She kept looking at me.

259
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,780
"Dear dana...

260
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,210
"I can't believe how different
ren mar is than agrestic,

261
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,950
"how fast things move down by the ocean.

262
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,110
"I saw a surfer once when I was
a kid,but now they're everywhere.

263
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,530
"Beach went and got
itself in a big damn hurry.

264
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,680
"Found myself a crappy studio
apartment off the boardwalk.

265
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,160
"It's nothing fancy,
but it does the job.

266
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,250
"I have trouble sleeping.

267
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,780
"The bed's too short.

268
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,400
"I have bad dreams like I'm falling
or I live in africa with the monkeys.

269
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,410
"I wake up scared.

270
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,540
"sotimes it akes me while
to remember where I am.

271
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,130
"Since losing you, I've lost
all sense of joy and pleasure."

272
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,440
"Only one thing left to do."

273
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,070
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, god.

274
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,240
Legendary!

275
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,450
"So fuck you and your lawyers.
Come get me if you want.

276
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,450
"I don't give a shit, because I'm broke.

277
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,510
And when you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose."

278
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,120
"Take care. Doug."

279
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,660
Thank you, rodrigo.

280
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,850
Rodolfo.

281
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,130
He seems very nice.

282
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,510
How did you two meet?

283
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,260
He taught at casa reforma.

284
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,730
Political science.

285
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,530
Now he's working on his dissertation.

286
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,670
This is good. What is it?

287
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,510
It's a secret recipe from my mother.

288
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,930
How long have you been sober, mom?

289
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,150
17 days.

290
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,850
Good for you.

291
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,880
That's why I'm here.

292
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,120
I am working my steps, making amends.

293
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,520
I came here to say I'm sorry.

294
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,650
Very, very, very sorry.

295
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,560
Really and truly sorry.

296
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,970
So sorry.

297
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,350
Should I get more specific?

298
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,380
I think we're way past that, mom.

299
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,550
You know, casa reforma was
actually really good for me.

300
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,000
I met this man I love,
and we just... live.

301
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,990
Humbly, simply.

302
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,390
My life has purpose.

303
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
It's very hot. Are you hot?

304
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,320
And I'm just so glad that you came here
to see me so that I could tell you that

305
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,390
and tie you up and lock you
in a room and keep you there

306
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,220
until I sell your ass back
into suburban slavery...

307
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,600
- you fucking bitch.
- Fucking...

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,860
- shall I call your father now?
- Yes.

309
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,350
Tell daddy dean I want $200,000, and
tell him to be quick with the cash.

310
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,540
Or we're gonna start
sending him body parts.

311
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,500
Revolution is a very sad affair.

312
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,040
But these tears are shed
in the name of greater good.

313
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,990
Yeah? Well, fuck you and
your faggy revolution.

314
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,380
I'm taking my money,
and I'm moving to belize.

315
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,520
Uh, san diego, california.

316
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:17,730
I need the number of, um, a gift
store... place. Gift something.

317
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,650
I have nothing listing for
"gift store" in san diego.

318
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,950
Do you have an address?

319
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,180
I don't have an address.

320
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,350
I just need to get a gift.

321
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,650
If you type in "gift," what comes up?

322
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,650
I need the name of a listing.

323
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,160
Uh, please, anything gift.

324
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
Terrifically gift baskets?

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,880
Oh, do they deliver?

326
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,770
I have no idea, ma'am.

327
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,430
Connecting your call.

328
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,250
Terrifically gift

329
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,480
Hi, carol.

330
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,330
I need to t a birthday gift

331
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,420
we sure can.

332
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,470
What kind of basket
were you thinking of?

333
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,640
can you deliver to ren mar tonight?

334
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,520
For an extra charge, we sure can.

335
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,630
Great.

336
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,000
what have you got?

337
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,720
How about one of our theme baskets?

338
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,340
Casino night, chocolate
universe, gay paree?

339
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,740
Doe ou havanything for a son who thinks
his mother's completely failed him?

340
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,930
We can still go to the
restaurant, you guys.

341
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,180
It's fine.

342
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,740
Did she even say where she was going?

343
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,550
Why do you even bother asking anymore?

344
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,450
We never get a straight answer.

345
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,550
We have no idea. We probably never will.

346
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,450
Sometimes I wish she'd
get arrested already.

347
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,320
What the hell are you talking about?

348
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,100
At least we'd know where she is.

349
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,310
And, seriously, isn't
it only a matter of time?

350
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
What happens when mom gets arrested?

351
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,640
We need to make a plan.

352
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,920
Well, I'm 18 now.

353
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,190
I can be your argal gudian.

354
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,300
What about me?

355
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,350
- You can still hang out.
- Hang out?

356
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,540
I am the adult male figurehead here.

357
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,530
Come on, andy. You
don't act like an adult.

358
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,870
None of us do -- we're all a bunch of
babies, waiting for mom to make the money...

359
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
always looking for mommy's approval...

360
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,520
asking mommy's permission.

361
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,160
Shane's right.

362
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,750
She's unreliable. She's unavailable.

363
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,930
It's time for us to take
on some responsibility,

364
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
because, for all we know,
she's going to prison.

365
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,500
Or worse.

366
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,100
What do you mean?

367
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,040
Nothing. She's fine.

368
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm thinking of buying
some land in mexico.

369
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,510
Really? With what?

370
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,210
I made a few bucks from the cheese shop.

371
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,640
I'm gonna price it out. Nothing crazy.

372
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,390
Just a nice little farm
where I can grow pot,

373
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,510
maybe sell to the
clubs, a few customers.

374
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,400
But that's it. No stupid
expansion. No stupid mistakes.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,220
Small... mellow...

376
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,940
so I don't drop dead of a heart attack

377
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,470
because I'm so stressed from trying
to maintain this bullshit lifestyle.

378
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,050
I got a little cash from the coyote gig.

379
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,460
You want a partner?

380
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,980
- I'll take your money.
- What about me?

381
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,510
You go to school and be a kid.

382
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,590
I want to help.

383
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,750
You can help by not telling mom.

384
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,240
That's not a problem. I
have nothing to say to mom.

385
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,920
Hey, hey, hey. Let's stop
bagging on your mom, okay?

386
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,890
She has done some less-than-prudent
or thoughtful things, but she's nancy.

387
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,700
And we love her, all of us.

388
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,360
Love...

389
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,680
her... in a mom-loving way.

390
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,930
Not in any other way.

391
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,190
Of course we love her.

392
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,600
She loves us, too. But
whatever, man. It's useless.

393
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,790
I'm getting a popsicle. Anyone want?

394
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,620
No, thanks.

395
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,170
Yes. I would like a popsicle.

396
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,090
Security code
4-8-7, right?

397
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,370
That's right.

398
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,430
Well, great. We're all set with that.

399
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,140
Now, what would you
like the card to say?

400
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,540
"dear silas."

401
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,900
Silas?

402
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,630
S-I-l-a-S. That's
my son. "Dear silas."

403
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,770
- "Dear silas."
- "dear silas.

404
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,070
Happy birthday. Happy 18th birthday."

405
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,830
uh, don't write "um."

406
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,690
"I think you're an amazing son.

407
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,760
I'M... so proud to... be your mom."

408
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,620
"Be your mom." That sounds
like bullshit, doesn't it?

409
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,760
"dear silas, if you never see me
again, "I've probably been murdered.

410
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,340
Enjoy the dried apricots
and butter cookies."

411
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,840
Uh, the sterling celebration
doesn't come with butter cookies.

412
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,350
- But if you'd like to add them, I certainly can do that.
- Yeah, uh...

413
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,810
could you stop talking for a second?

414
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,710
Could you just, uh,
please be quiet and listen?

415
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,190
- Just listen.
- I'm listening.

416
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,120
Starting over.

417
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,000
"dear silas..."

418
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,380
"thanks for raising yourself

419
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,290
"these past 18 years. "You've...

420
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,800
done a great job."

421
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,070
Ms.Botwin?

422
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,390
Are you okay, ms.Botwin?

423
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,910
"Silas...

424
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,720
"you are loved. Me."

425
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,210
Sign it "me."

426
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,590
Just "me"?

427
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,770
Yeah, "me." No, "mom." "Me, mom."

428
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,080
Please -- please get
that to him tonight.

429
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,070
And -- and add
the butter cookies.

430
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,840
You can charge me extra for it, okay?

431
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,270
Thanks, carol.

432
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,020
You take care, ms. Botwin.

433
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,110
I don't want to believe it.

434
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,030
So don'T.

435
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,040
I thought you loved me.

436
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,240
I do love you.

437
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,670
You have made me so sad.

438
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,820
Well, I think I can make you happy.

439
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,130
It's too late.
