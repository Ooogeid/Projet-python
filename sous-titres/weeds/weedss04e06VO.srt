1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,600
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,460
I see no money.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,970
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,190
- She's with me.
- You make this go away.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,380
She's going to be
staying with us.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,300
You and your
drug-dealing mommy?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,050
You can stay here and float me
till the market comes back.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,660
Tell her I expect 10 grand
on the first of every month.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,650
When are you coming back?

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,870
The minute not-francie
misses a payment.

11
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:26,476
Hola.

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,835
Uh, you guys, uh,
heading towards ren mar?

13
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,117
Davenport, iowa.

14
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,271
Close enough.

15
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:35,890
Andy's friends,
I'd like to welcome you to our country.

16
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:37,321
I hope you get to stay.

17
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:39,602
Why are you here in our house,
mr. Wilson?

18
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:41,061
Where's your family?

19
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:43,681
My family left me, buddy.
My life's a toilet.

20
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:46,392
I hate myself. You happy now?

21
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:49,311
This is your new job.
We're making you manager.

22
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:53,300
You're gonna give me all that money to
manage the san ysidro maternity world?

23
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:56,960
I got a normal, boring job.

24
00:00:56,977 --> 00:01:02,111
It looks like I'm gonna be
doing it for a long, long time.

25
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:06,993
And you.........

26
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:09,683
Not for you.

27
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,421
What the "f"?

36
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,972
Cesar --
cesar, tell him that you know me.

37
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:56,001
Lev*ntate! Lev*ntate!

38
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,801
You know,
all I want to do is go back.

39
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,630
Would you let go of my arm?

40
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,101
It's not like I haven't
been to the garage before.

41
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,801
I just came in the
back way this time.

42
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:22,630
Okay, I-I think we're in america now.
I have rights.

43
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,092
It was the man in the suit,
wasn't it?

44
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:27,781
The boss, big boss, el jefe?

45
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:35,491
I think it would be wise for you to
reimagine the events of this evening.

46
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:40,741
Now, you close up your shop, go on home
to your family, and you saw nothing.

47
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:42,992
You mean no one.

48
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,363
That's right.

49
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,120
Don't break it!
I'm asking a buck apiece for those.

50
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:12,302
These are all 50 states.
You can't break up the set, man.

51
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,530
You can't keep taking stuff.

52
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,981
There's gonna be
nothing left to sell.

53
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,302
Are you kidding me?
Look around.

54
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,590
Hey, we're not selling
pictures of judah.

55
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:23,370
Photos are not included,
just the frames.

56
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,272
Fine.

57
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:27,030
But not the metal one, though.

58
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:30,981
Or that wood one there.
Or this other one here.

59
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,711
Ooh, pipes. Can I have one?

60
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:36,351
I think I could
pull off a pipe.

61
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,191
Four bucks.

62
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,951
Four bucks? What a rip.

63
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,082
I am keeping these.

64
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,733
You're all scavengers.

65
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:45,920
Yeah, scavenger.

66
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,191
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

67
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,772
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

68
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:52,963
There's gonna be nothing left for the
estate sale if everybody
keeps everything.

69
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,273
- Anything you want to keep?
- Nothing.

70
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,480
Except maybe this cool cigar box
so I can save it for my ashes.

71
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,123
You are a dark little fellow,
aren't you?

72
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:03,881
- Jews can't get cremated.
- Technically, I'm not jewish.

73
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:08,082
You are in the reform movement,
and those are all the cool jews.

74
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,642
"Scraps"?

75
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,740
"Rufus"? "Lucy"?

76
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:16,163
Vintage murdered-dog collars.

77
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,780
Five bucks each.

78
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,793
Oh, jesus, bubbie.

79
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:25,960
did you get lucky with the rocky
mountain chocolate guy last night?

80
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,020
Fung? Please,
I'm so not into asians.

81
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:34,203
Little rice dick, all that soy,
pai gow -- not for me.

82
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,902
I would take the
free fudge, however.

83
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,410
- How was your night?
- I...

84
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:43,853
saw no one attractive
in a place I wasn'T.

85
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,160
You're babbling.

86
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:48,610
- You need coffee.
- Yes, I do.

87
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:55,342
Um, hola.

88
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,472
Oh, a mexican man
with a machine gun.

89
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,553
That looks like...

90
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,570
a nice pastry.

91
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:08,141
Are you gonna be here long?

92
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:11,131
- Todo el tiempo.
- All the time, okay.

93
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:14,971
Well, then, um, soy nancy...

94
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,682
celia.

95
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:17,713
Ignacio.

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,750
Ignacio, nice to meet you.
Mucho gusto.

97
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:25,312
Um, well,
we're just gonna go and open up.

98
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:28,893
Do you want any coffee or anything?
I'm getting coffee today.

99
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,840
Oh, got your coffee.
Okay, then.

100
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,713
Um, bye now. Get out.

101
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:40,011
- Nancy...
- celia.

102
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,853
- There's a giant hole in the floor.
- I'm aware.

103
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:46,640
- What's in the hole?
- Mexico.

104
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,170
You must never go there
-- through the hole.

105
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,071
You can drive to mexico
whenever you want.

106
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,612
Just be aware there's a
very long wait to get back.

107
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:55,930
Don't drink the water.

108
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,871
Stay away from the hole.

109
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:03,673
And the man? Is that the attractive
man from the place that you weren't?

110
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:06,662
I went straight home.
I saw no one.

111
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,520
But he was so much
better-looking than that guy.

112
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,601
Hey, davenport!

113
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:20,822
Pescados.

114
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,942
Yeah, you go, man.

115
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:29,271
Look at yoga ass, with the ass like
an apricot that she got in yoga.

116
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,472
Check out bitch badge.
Or is it tramp stamp?

117
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,780
Either way, she's hot.

118
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:36,051
Wow, her friend's got madonna arms.
You think that's sexy?

119
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,553
Not on a white woman.

120
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,440
You need to find a place to live, doug,
you know, a place to take home
the ladies.

121
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,110
- I got to make some money.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,533
We should be coyotes.

123
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:50,901
That guy who brought over davenport
and marzipan was such an asshole,

124
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,541
and he charged them a fortune.

125
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,831
I think we got a real
opportunity here, doug.

126
00:08:55,845 --> 00:09:00,520
We could be good coyotes, nice coyotes,
like the jetblue of coyotes --

127
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:06,192
sun chips and bottled water, competitive
pricing without the rape trees
and extortion.

128
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,163
That could be our slogan.

129
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,330
I'm serious, man.

130
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,042
Oh, oh, look --
asian with big, fake tits.

131
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,121
Oh, what is that?
Is there ice cream up the street?

132
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:18,923
I love her. I love you!

133
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:23,742
I think illegal immigration for
profit -- that's our next venture.

134
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,332
Oh, let me think about it.
I don't really like mexicans.

135
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,850
Yeah, well, think about it.
It's good money.

136
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,132
I'll think about it.

137
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:39,250
These pants are great,
very elastic.

138
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:42,511
Um, here's a belly pillow.

139
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,390
Oh, what month is this belly?

140
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,740
That's about A...
six-month belly.

141
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,333
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,982
Wait till you see
the six-month ass.

143
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:06,020
- Hi.
- "Hi"?

144
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,866
You don't "hi" me.

145
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,885
You made trouble for me,
going where you don't belong.

146
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:13,437
I didn't know.

147
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,333
When you gave me a tour of the store --
"here's the cash register, here's the
back room" --

148
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,602
you might have said, "by the way,
here's a tunnel to mexico."

149
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,541
But you didn'T.
You said nothing.

150
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:28,781
Go do your job and go -- go out to the
front and smile at the pregnant ladies.

151
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,672
That's a lot of pot.

152
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,941
That's what it's all about.

153
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:43,332
Did you really get in trouble with
the man, the man in the suit?

154
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,983
Who is the man in the suit?

155
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,341
You didn't see a man in a suit.

156
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:53,191
Okay, fine, the invisible man --
what would he do if he existed?

157
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,141
Don't know yet.

158
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:59,552
But anything happens to me,
worse gonna happen to you.

159
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:03,852
We're just hoping for sunshine,
preparing for rain.

160
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,963
Get the fuck back out there.

161
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:09,330
I'll go look for an umbrella.

162
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,920
I just don't understand
why you're here.

163
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,361
Isabel.

164
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,810
Hi, mrs. Botwin.

165
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,481
You don't even like me.

166
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,421
That's true. I don'T.

167
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,942
So the fact that I am here,
begging to live with you,

168
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:31,513
should clearly demonstrate
how awful my life has been.

169
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,070
I can't do it anymore.

170
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:36,233
I took a greyhound and sat
next to a man with one leg.

171
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,273
I have no place to put you.

172
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:42,091
I've been sleeping on a chair, listening
to daddy weep in the next room.

173
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,661
This it the first time I've
left the hotel in weeks.

174
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,710
He clings, he over-shares.

175
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,331
I'm gonna be the only person
he knows in michigan.

176
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,880
You're moving to michigan?

177
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,852
Dad's going to defend
criminals in detroit.

178
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:58,123
Everyone's out of work, no middle class,
felonies at an all-time high.

179
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,583
It's his golden opportunity.

180
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,170
Oh, you're exaggerating.

181
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,303
It's motown. It's cold.
You can layer.

182
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:08,320
I hear there's a great lake.

183
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:11,222
Canada is... up there.

184
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:14,170
Look, go back to your father.

185
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:17,011
I will give you money
to take the train.

186
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:21,430
It goes right along the coast.
It's lovely.

187
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:27,681
For the first time in your life, please,
please don't act like a selfish
fucking bitch!

188
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:31,331
Save me.

189
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,363
I have a customer.

190
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:42,590
- I'll take the pants.
- Good. Great.

191
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,632
Take the pants.
Go, have children.

192
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:51,133
See how they grow up to denigrate the
fine city of detroit and call you a
fucking bitch.

193
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:55,331
Here, have a coupon.

194
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,330
Well, look at you.

195
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:07,131
- Court appearance?
- Laundry.

196
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,771
Hey, you got your tooth fixed.
Want to do it?

197
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,740
Fucking you ruined my life.

198
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,360
The sex was good,
though, wasn't it?

199
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,740
- Not bad.
- My best.

200
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,432
- Really?
- Legendary.

201
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,883
That's sad.

202
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,773
- I'm lonely.
- Me, too.

203
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,440
I think I'm getting
used to it, though.

204
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:30,431
I burned through my happiness...
the american dream.

205
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,332
I don't think that comes
around twice for many people.

206
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,751
Be nice if it came around once.

207
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:35,863
Isabelle's a great kid.

208
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,352
- Oh, you don't have to be her mother.
- Neither do you.

209
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,061
You just hang out with her.

210
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,092
I wish I'd tried
that with my son.

211
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,861
Gays are huge chick magnets.

212
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,962
He could have introduced me
to some young hot thing.

213
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:51,162
Your "young hot thing"
days are long over.

214
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,653
Yeah, probably...
unless I get rich.

215
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,391
Well, you could
embezzle from Ren Mar.

216
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:59,291
I like it down here.

217
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,151
The ocean is therapeutic.

218
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:12,153
- So, you want to...
- No. Absolutely not.

219
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:16,952
We'll see how strong your resolve is
after a few more nights of
couch squatting.

220
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:22,370
I'm picking up my FEMA vouchers
tomorrow, getting myself a
cordial suite.

221
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:25,742
It should last a few weeks and
then a few more to evict me and...

222
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,051
God, Doug, I said no.

223
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,220
I heard you.

224
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,751
Warm.

225
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,690
Well, you have a good night.

226
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:42,403
Leave the wine and the mag.

227
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,172
Shane, how much do we want
for the coffee table?

228
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:48,102
- 125
- 80

229
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,681
- 125
- 120

230
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,082
130. Keep it up !

231
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh, my god. Andy, look.
Check it out.

232
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:01,480
- It's yoga ass.
- Yeah? Where? You sure it's her?

233
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,883
There, on the stairs.
She's looking at the grapes.

234
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:05,543
That's her.

235
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:08,452
I could never forget
an ass like that.

236
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,971
Oh, she's mine. She is so mine.

237
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,240
No, I saw her first.

238
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,863
On the beach maybe,
but I saw her first in the house.

239
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:29,282
All right, all right, so we both
go for it, and then best man wins.

240
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,292
I am so gonna win.

241
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,760
So not. Watch it.

242
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,873
Oh, fuck.

243
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,272
That is not cool.

244
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,010
So not cool.

245
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,772
- He looks good, though.
- Yeah.

246
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,660
- Look at him work.
- Yeah.

247
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,980
He must be stopped.

248
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,612
What was that?

249
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:55,092
Oh, gosh,
I am so sorry about that!

250
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:57,903
I am such a clumsy clown.

251
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,773
Doug. Doug wilson.

252
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,393
Andy Botwin. We live here.

253
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,630
Nice platter.
That's such a nice platter.

254
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,101
I can get you a
discount on that.

255
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,302
Well, thanks.

256
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,362
Hey, guys.

257
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,811
Look at this.
Everyone wants a piece.

258
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,580
I got to show you
something downstairs.

259
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,500
They have a metal detector!

260
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,413
Who are you talking to?

261
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,420
My mom.

262
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,352
This is Lisa...

263
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,762
also known as Brad's mom.

264
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,472
Brad's mom.

265
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:32,950
You own the cheese shop?

266
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,081
Cheese gotta have it...
Yep, that's me.

267
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:37,801
- That is so clever.
- Thanks.

268
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,882
I love your cheese.

269
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:43,472
- Come on, come on.
- It was nice meeting you.

270
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:46,571
Yeah. You, too, Silas.

271
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:49,440
Excuse me.

272
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,851
Your kid is scary.

273
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,392
My kid's awesome.
You're just cheap.

274
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,381
Enjoy your table!

275
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:07,631
Put me down! Put me down! Help!

276
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,383
Okay, I got it.

277
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,892
What's the grand total?

278
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:19,512
We sold $8,327 worth
of Lenny's stuff.

279
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,871
And fuck him...
we're keeping it.

280
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,383
Where did Nancy go?
She ditch us?

281
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,783
She probably went out
to buy a "bed skirt."

282
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:29,363
Or she's out selling drugs.

283
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,632
- Hey, can I hold the money?
- No.

284
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,990
I'm gonna go hide this.

285
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,340
- We'll find it.
- Yeah, we will.

286
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,370
Whoa, check out sexy.

287
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,873
She swam in her clothes.

288
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:46,003
She's a wild hippie.

289
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:49,052
Think she shaves her pits?

290
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:53,901
That must be the boyfriend.

291
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:58,551
This is weird.

292
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:05,991
Is this really happening?

293
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,561
This is like a movie.

294
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:09,880
I wish we had milk duds.

295
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,503
They're illegals.

296
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,051
Help me!

297
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,633
You are so beautiful.

298
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:34,432
You are like a mermaid,
a mexican mermaid... a mermex.

299
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,192
I thought you didn't
like mexicans.

300
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,802
Just the fat ones.

301
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,092
- I'm Doug.
- I'm...

302
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:41,461
What's going on here?

303
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,742
This is my girlfriend.
She was just swimming with her clothes.

304
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,631
- I'm just doing my job.
- Your job is bullshit.

305
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,273
She just wants to be here.

306
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,070
Yeah, she wants to
clean our toilets.

307
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,150
Or, uh,
sewing or telecomunicacione.

308
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,223
- Let's go.
- SeÒor Doug!

309
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,042
Mermex!

310
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:59,232
I keep your, uh, flippy-flop!
You find me!

311
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,253
I'll find you. I will.

312
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,723
Oh, wait.

313
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:09,833
Let's go.

314
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,773
Wait, wait,
I don't even know your name.

315
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,912
- Maria.
- Maria mermex.

316
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:18,503
Si. SeÒor flippy-flop.

317
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:23,083
You hear that? She called me
"flippy-flop." How cute is that?

318
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:28,443
We could bring her back
here if we were coyotes.

319
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,912
I'm in.

320
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:41,272
The sale's over.

321
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:43,711
Silas.

322
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:51,020
Lisa, hi.

323
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:58,033
Listen... Did you sell
that wacky pack poster?

324
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,933
Brad's been bugging
me about it all day.

325
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,890
No, uh, I kept it.

326
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,270
I like that poster.

327
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:07,560
But if he wants it,
he can have it.

328
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:11,060
- Really?
- Yeah. Sure.

329
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,292
He's a kid. He should have it.

330
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:18,572
- Brad doesn't, uh, give a shit, actually.
- No?

331
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:26,411
You want to go for a walk
on the beach or something?

332
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,990
Yes. Yeah.

333
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,533
Uh, Brad is fencing.

334
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,960
I have to pick him up at 6:00.

335
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:35,861
Well, let's go.

336
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,981
Uh, just, uh,
let me grab a shirt.-

337
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,610
Let's -- let's get walking.

338
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:53,063
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

339
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:59,163
Fine. Pack a bag.

340
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:02,433
Well, hurry up before
I change my mind.

341
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,163
Thank you.

342
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:06,993
I thought you didn't want her.

343
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:09,410
I'm her mother, Dean.

344
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:11,290
And I could use the company.

345
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:12,942
I could use the company.

346
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:15,273
You could use a bath.

347
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,582
What if we move to Newark or...
or... or east St. Louis?

348
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,331
I got job offers there, too.

349
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,582
I live by the beach, Dean.

350
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,043
It's better for her.

351
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,230
But there's not enough
crime by the beach.

352
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:28,243
I need a job. What did I do?

353
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:30,192
I-I-I-I'm getting better.

354
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:35,142
I just -- I want to be a carefree
latchkey kid who lives by the beach.

355
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:37,203
You're throwing me
over for the beach?

356
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:39,281
Location, location, location.

357
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:42,192
I just --
I really need a mom right now.

358
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:44,211
And celia said she'd
try to find me one.

359
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:48,080
You understand that your
mother is Satan, right?

360
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,270
It's the devil I know.

361
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:53,720
I-I... I don't
want to be alone.

362
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:56,220
I'm not your wife.

363
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:06,141
You call me... every day.

364
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:11,223
And when you start to hate her again,
which you will, you come back to daddy.

365
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:13,880
I love you.

366
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,931
I know. I know.
I love you, too.

367
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,741
Try not to get shot.

368
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:31,880
Nancy Botwin.

369
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:35,402
A widow living in Ren Mar.

370
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:38,683
Two sons... Shane and Silas.

371
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:42,811
You never finished your
last semester at Berkeley.

372
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:46,843
You have four outstanding parking
tickets and a strange tattoo

373
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:51,810
on the upper left
cheek of your backside.

374
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:59,753
You should not have gone
through the tunnel.

375
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:03,053
- That was a mistake.
- I know.

376
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:08,520
You should not be
asking questions...

377
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,682
questions about me.

378
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:12,681
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:17,740
Yeah. You are sorry.

380
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,331
Yeah.

381
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,833
And your eyes are brown.

382
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:31,762
You must be punished...

383
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:34,162
learn a lesson.

384
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,593
It will be painful.

385
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:42,722
How about A... spanking?

386
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:49,190
A good, hard spanking.

387
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,941
Don't move.

388
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,080
Que paso?

389
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,990
Alguien, uh,
mas importante espera pa' verte.

390
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,963
Pues apenas se esta
poniendo divertido.

391
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:06,093
O al menos que nos digas que
la matemos ahorita mismo.

392
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:10,670
Habra mas tiempo pa' diversiones
cuando no tengas negocios que atender.

393
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,340
It's time for you to go.

394
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:18,700
Yeah, I-I heard the
verb for "to kill."

395
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:23,123
Yes. Well, uh,
work on your spanish.

396
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:28,430
Um, am I - am --
am I going back in the trunk?

397
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,342
No, you're going home.

398
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:35,270
Just this once,
you may use the tunnel.

399
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:39,012
- I'll call ahead and tell Ignacio not to shoot you...
- okay.

400
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:41,972
For now.

401
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:45,422
Good night, Nancy Botwin.

402
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,951
- He's the mayor?
- Si.

403
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:35,233
<i>On the next
all-new Weeds</i>

404
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:38,331
Esteban. Bring me to him or
I can track him down myself.

405
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:41,150
Please give me a reason ???

406
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,853
We're trying to launch
a coyote business.

407
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,553
We wanna know about your
immigration experience.

408
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:48,053
ImmigraciÛn!

409
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:51,053
That went well.
