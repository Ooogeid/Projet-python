1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,530
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,340
am I under arrest?

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,920
You'll have to get me
naked to know for sure.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,690
Are you trying to flirt with me?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,280
That's pathetic.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,660
I want to try living with mom.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,610
You're throwing me over for the beach?

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,550
Location, location, location.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,860
Judah showed me naked
pictures of you, you know?

10
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,780
You had this silver sequined bowler hat.

11
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:29,101
He swore he'd destroy those.

12
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:30,982
- This is lisa.
- My mom.

13
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:33,516
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Yes. Yeah.

14
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:36,240
- Well, let's go.
- Nice.

15
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:38,452
Whoa, check out sexy.

16
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,331
She entered this country illegally.

17
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:43,690
We could bring her back
here if we were coyotes.

18
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,271
I'm in.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,221
Nancy botwin.

20
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,681
You have four outstanding
parking tickets

21
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:57,301
and a strange tattoo on the
upper-left cheek of your backside.

22
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:00,463
You should not be asking questions...

23
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,531
questions about me.

24
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,882
You must be punished...

Fuck, andy.

29
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,062
You snooze, you lose!

30
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:43,272
You need to move out of my house.

31
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,500
Hey, nance. What time is it?

32
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:48,341
Time for you to get the
fuck out of my house!

33
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,812
You sound really angry.

34
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,360
Do you need sex? Help you relax.

35
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:02,911
'Cause I am willing to whip out my jeremy
piven right now and give you what you need.

36
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,302
That's how much I care.

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,162
The red bra you got hanging
in the shower is totally hot.

38
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:15,033
Jesus. This is a frat house.

39
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,641
I'm living in a frat house.

40
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:19,831
Who buys old dishes?

41
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:25,172
Well, people collect -- dishes,
corks, old gynecological instruments.

42
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:28,163
Mom, why are you googling
the mayor of tijuana?

43
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,820
- What?
- The history menu.

44
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:36,840
It's sandwiched between caffeine side effects
and the ren mar unified school district.

45
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,372
It doesn't feel like silas.

46
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:40,580
It's important to know
our neighbors to the south.

47
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:42,712
Speaking of which, where's davenport?

48
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,362
I want to ask him if he can drywall.

49
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,742
We're gonna be doing some
remodeling around here.

50
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:50,132
Thank god! I need my own room.

51
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:52,420
I can't handle the nightly
earthquakes anymore.

52
00:02:52,446 --> 00:02:53,361
Earthquakes?

53
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,301
I was scratching. I think there's fleas.

54
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:56,642
I swear to god.

55
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,980
Perv, we're in a bunk bed.

56
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:00,220
What the hell is wrong with you?

57
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,563
Hey, it's a family tradition.

58
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:07,220
Okay, delta pledges, stop
embarrassing your fellow brethren.

59
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:11,223
And, freshman, find somewhere
else to scratch your fleas.

60
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:13,233
I say we tear the whole place
down and start from scratch.

61
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,711
Yeah. You would.

62
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:18,130
Like all those tasteless
assholes up and down the block

63
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:22,521
who replace charming beach
cottages with monstrous boxes --

64
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,663
"oh, we need more room!"

65
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:26,262
Then work with what you
have or fucking move!

66
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:28,871
I'm just asking for a second bathroom.

67
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,093
That's okay, then.

68
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,480
You feeling flush? Bathrooms are
expensive. And I need a long tub.

69
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,000
We could save money if we
didn't use a contractor.

70
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,371
I could do it.

71
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:38,820
It's a big job, sweetie.

72
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,133
But I'm cheap, and I
don't ask questions.

73
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,471
You're hired.

74
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,310
You realize it's not our house
to remodel -- it's lenny'S.

75
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,570
I want my own fucking bathroom!

76
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,271
Sheesh, what are you complaining about?

77
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,412
We got celia out of here.

78
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:54,590
You! Boys! Boys are disgusting.

79
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:56,792
Okay, okay, let's settle down.

80
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,430
You got that kind of cash around?

81
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:05,391
Gonna explore some opportunities.

82
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,701
Oh, my god. He's huge.

83
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:10,733
Two weeks old?

84
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,690
Gigantism runs in clinique's family.

85
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,063
Of course it does. God. C-section?

86
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,513
Nope. Shot out like a pez.

87
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:23,242
Got a great pelvis.
That's what everybody say.

88
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,443
so... business.

89
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:29,353
How much of the valley do
you think you could cover?

90
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,292
I might be coming
into some bulk product.

91
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:35,353
- 100 pounds would be gone in a week.
- Seriously?

92
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:40,400
You left a vacuum, nancy. People are sad.
Things are burned. They need their weed.

93
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:44,413
Okay. Good. Very good to know.

94
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:47,923
- God, he's -- he's -- he's
huge. - Yeah, tell me about it.

95
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,412
Goodbye, miata. Hello, minivan.

96
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:54,733
Fuck your miata with a strap-on,
little bitch. We getting a escalade.

97
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:57,143
Let's do this shit.

98
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,792
I have health insurance
now and a guesthouse.

99
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:04,043
But the man, mr. Caplan,
he don't wipe so good.

100
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:06,973
Always leaving shit
slicks everywhere --

101
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:10,840
in the underwear, on the
toilet seat, the sheets.

102
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,943
I don't know how she live with him.

103
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,530
You want to sell drugs?

104
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,583
I have to leave my guesthouse?

105
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,601
I like living in beverly
hills. He's an agent.

106
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,162
Sell to his agent friends.

107
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:25,002
They like to party with all the money they've
made off of other people's work, right?

108
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:31,150
Yes, they love to party. You
have cocaine? They like that, too.

109
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,153
No. No cocaine. Just pot.

110
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,223
- You should really think about the cocaine, nancy.
- No.

111
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,742
- And the ecstasy.
- No.

112
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,963
Okay. I get that from geffen's maid.

113
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,003
What? Why are you looking at me funny?

114
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,592
'Cause you ain't said nothin'.

115
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,922
Haven't you noticed
something different about me?

116
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:04,621
I lost 10 pounds!

117
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:09,450
Right! Of course you did! Good for you!

118
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,201
- You -- you look terrific.
- Thanks. Feels good.

119
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:16,372
You know, finally back
to my high school weight.

120
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:22,031
Well, you should be so proud, and I bet
the women are beating down your door.

121
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:26,011
Now, that's what I'm hoping
for -- new town, new pussy.

122
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,450
New customer base.

123
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,542
My cousin vernon -- he'll take care
of that. He just needs the product.

124
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,291
You sure guillermo ain't got no
connections up there to fuck things up?

125
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,942
You know, that guy, he made me cry.

126
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,751
Oakland's a long way
from los angeles, marvin.

127
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:43,803
You don't have to worry about guillermo.

128
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:47,803
- Sweet.
- Yes. Sweet.

129
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:58,012
Keep the fanny pack tucked inside your
hoodie until we're back on american soil.

130
00:06:58,645 --> 00:06:59,810
They have quick hands.

131
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:02,993
Why can't you buy your drugs in
the U. S. Like a normal person?

132
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:08,480
Because I have no health insurance,
no money, and an arrest record.

133
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:13,860
Let's look at this as a cultural
expedition to a primitive land.

134
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,833
Hola, se—oritas. Xanax? Valium? Ativan?

135
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,183
Restylane.

136
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,603
- No xanax?
- No xanax. Restylane.

137
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:35,823
- Dos cc.
- Est* bien.

138
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:39,302
Where are we gonna live when
dad's fema vouchers run out?

139
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,640
- Oh, I'll find a place.
- With what money?

140
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:46,011
With the money I am making from my job.

141
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,400
- As a salesclerk?
- Yes.

142
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:51,322
- And where am i gonna go to school?
- I don't know!

143
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:54,990
Wherever shane goes. I'll talk to nancy.

144
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:59,971
- Xanax?
- No xanax. Restylane.

145
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:01,042
Generic cheaper.

146
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:03,726
Mexican generic hyaluronic acid.

147
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:09,253
Do I want to look like
the joker? No. No generic.

148
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:14,790
It's a front, isn't it?

149
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,522
What's a front?

150
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,790
The maternity store. It's a drug front.

151
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,080
You know, we passed a taco cart
back there. Why don't you go get one?

152
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,170
- I don't want one.
- Well, i do.

153
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,512
- Get me one.
- Get it yourself.

154
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,060
I just spent months
getting everything for dad.

155
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:33,103
Get me... a fucking... taco.

156
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:38,861
Look. You wanted this, not me.

157
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,282
Well, you got it. Welcome to my life.

158
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:47,112
Broke, homeless, not a man in sight,
although I know that's not your issue.

159
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,681
No prospects, no direction,

160
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:54,431
no hope for relief
from the crushing defeat

161
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,682
and futility and just...

162
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:00,792
pure bad luck that is my fate!

163
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:03,122
Walk with me here, okay?

164
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,893
Arm in arm, mother
and child -- doomed.

165
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,983
- Xanax?
- Yes!

166
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:16,981
I want some.

167
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,213
I didn't know you were a smoker.

168
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,320
Not for personal use.

169
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:24,541
I can unload 300 pounds.

170
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:27,211
You trying to get back in
the dealing game, blanca?

171
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:29,840
'Cause I told you those days
are behind you. You're here now.

172
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,352
And I intend to stay here. There's
just no reason why I can't do both.

173
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,252
I'll give you a reason
-- we got it covered.

174
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,440
Not my customer base.

175
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:42,731
How about you give me their
names and their phone numbers?

176
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,641
I'd be happy to service their needs.

177
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,062
What? We partners, right?

178
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,751
Are you gonna give me half?

179
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:53,272
I was thinking a 10%
finder's fee is generous.

180
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:54,630
They're my customers.

181
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,743
You ain't your own business no more.

182
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:00,731
All right, you're the mom-and-pop shop
that got swallowed by the megacorp.

183
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:09,320
Well... how about I buy some
off you for 5% over wholesale?

184
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:13,031
How about I sell you 300
pounds at 25 bucks a gram?

185
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:16,211
Fuck you, 25 bucks a gram!
That's more than street value.

186
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:20,130
That's my offer, right? You
don't like it, do something else.

187
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,742
You sure about this?

188
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:28,031
Trust me. It's their home
base. They're always here.

189
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:33,472
See? Look at this. They're like
jews and wedding hors d'oeuvres.

190
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,501
That's not cool.

191
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,672
Oh, sorry, man. Forgot you were a jew.

192
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,370
I should never have said
that in front of you.

193
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,170
øCu*nto?

194
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:48,621
We're doing some market research, and we
wanted to ask you fellas some questions.

195
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:49,192
øQu?

196
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:54,632
We're trying to launch a coyote business, and we
want to know about your immigration experience.

197
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,323
- Im--
immigration? - Yes.

198
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,313
Im-mi-gra-tion.

199
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,881
IinmigraciÛn! Ila migra! Ila migra!

200
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,143
That went well.

201
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:10,142
Well, look who it is
-- my walking buddy.

202
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:11,572
I'm glad you stopped by.

203
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,042
Sometimes a man just needs some cheese.

204
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:20,193
Well, that's what I depend on
-- men and their need for cheese.

205
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:23,723
- You're sweaty.
- It's hot out. I walked.

206
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:25,933
No car?

207
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,232
You only interested in guys with cars?

208
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:31,441
No. No, no, no. I have my own... car.

209
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:35,943
- Sweet.
- Yeah. It's awesome.

210
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:39,992
- Are you making fun of me?
- A little.

211
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,541
Where are you going?

212
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:50,663
I turn 18 in a few weeks.

213
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,630
I'll be able to vote...

214
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:59,041
buy lottery tickets,
drink -- in canada.

215
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,763
Yeah. I have a
10-year-old son.

216
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:05,961
I know. I've met him.

217
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:16,052
Oh, god. You are so fucking young.

218
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,643
Young and impatient. I'm not waiting.

219
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:29,302
- I have a sink in the back.
- Sink?

220
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,673
Something to hold on to.

221
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,102
Hold on to me.

222
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,030
Hola.

223
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,670
Hi, cesar.

224
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:52,010
Another unexpected surprise, I know.

225
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:54,681
Took my car this time, though.

226
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,590
Una "favor," por favor.

227
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,153
Gps?

228
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,951
Oh, no. No gps.

229
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:07,750
Um, esteban -- I need
to habla with esteban.

230
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:21,392
No one here knows an esteban.

231
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,511
Oh, come on.

232
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:27,150
It's a common mexican
name -- steven, right?

233
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,012
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:35,510
Um, does he have
a -- a code name?

235
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,453
Se—or grande?

236
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:41,523
Please back the fuck off.

237
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:47,953
What do you need?

238
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:50,553
To have a conversation. It's business.

239
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,860
You don't do business with him.

240
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,133
Right.

241
00:13:55,145 --> 00:14:01,000
'Cause he's the mayor -- face on all the
trash cans, making things better for you.

242
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:04,830
Well,
look --

243
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:09,712
you can either bring me to him
or I can track him down myself.

244
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,871
Make an appearance at city hall.

245
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:16,323
I'll make a big scene
till I get his attention.

246
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:22,022
Thank you, cesar.

247
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,640
Oh, smile. You get to drive a hybrid!

248
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:31,850
Maria? No?

249
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:35,311
- No s?
- Okay. All right. Gave it a shot.

250
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:38,030
Who wants another muffaletta?

251
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:40,231
- Yes.
- Thank you.

252
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,560
- Take it.
- Enjoy.

253
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:45,740
So, claudio, you think your
friends and assorted relatives

254
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:48,462
might be interested in our services?

255
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:51,792
A kinder, gentler coyote
is a rare thing, el andy.

256
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:55,213
But how can I be sure you're not deceiving
me, looking to recruit, transport,

257
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,702
and harbor my people for the purposes
of exploitation or organ theft?

258
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,260
Oh, come on, amigo. Would an
organ thief make you lunch?

259
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,071
That is why miguel has only one kidney.

260
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,953
Really? You can't tell.

261
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,161
You speak amazing english.

262
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:14,730
Well, in colombia, I was deputy
transportation administrator.

263
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,840
Let's talk numbers. What's
the going rate per smuggle?

264
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,630
Depends on how far they come.

265
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:23,683
But if it's just for a straight
border crossing, usually about $3,000.

266
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,702
Per body?

267
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:27,502
Not bad. Not bad.

268
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:30,160
And what are the easiest
ways to get through?

269
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:35,233
Truthfully, wait until the border
patrol changes shifts and scale a fence.

270
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,590
Or find a place where there's no fence.

271
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,132
Won't the agents shoot us?

272
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:43,271
No. It's too much hassle for
them -- blood, bodies, paperwork.

273
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:46,623
They don't get you in the first
two minutes, you're golden.

274
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,473
You know what your real problem is?

275
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:53,550
The minutemen -- "vigilante"
-- pains in the ass.

276
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:55,870
What the hell?

277
00:15:55,895 --> 00:16:01,042
If you're trying to snag this remodeling
contract out from under me, I'll ruin you.

278
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,660
No. No, no, no.

279
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:06,590
Doug and I are just doing,
uh, some market research,

280
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:10,601
but now that you mention it, maybe
these fellas can help you out, too.

281
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,762
- You guys know how to build a bathroom?
- With a giant tub?

282
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:17,493
They want a bathroom with a giant tub.

283
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:19,703
Well,the sandwiches...

284
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,313
are super yummy.

285
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,150
- Bueno.
- Yes.

286
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:29,890
Gracias. Muchas
gracias, amigas y amigos.

287
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,103
Estamos aqu? hoy para
inaugurar esta unidad mÈdica...

288
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:38,193
"we are here to inaugurate
this mobile medical unit."

289
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:41,961
Ayudar* para llevar servicios
mÈdicos de calidad a todos...

290
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:46,482
it will provide quality medical
care to all citizens of tijuana.

291
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:49,433
Con la terrible escalada de
violencia que hemos vivido...

292
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:54,793
with the violence that we
have now, it is very important.

293
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,842
Quiero aprovechar este momento para
agradecer a nuestro generoso benefactor...

294
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:03,970
he wants to thank a very
generous private benefactor.

295
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,550
He is the generous private benefactor.

296
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:14,710
Y ahora me dispongo a donar las primeras
gotas de sangre, y espero que hagan lo mismo.

297
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,642
Muchas gracias. Gracias.

298
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:45,671
I love this part -- the part where you sit
there wondering just how fucked you are.

299
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,370
- Well, how fucked am I?
- Don't talk.

300
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:50,130
Talking ruins it.

301
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:59,961
Go get miss hodes a glass of water.

302
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:04,710
Now, agent... shlatter.

303
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,851
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:12,342
This will serve as official notification
that all charges pending against celia hodes

305
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,683
have been dropped,
per my recommendation.

306
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:17,473
Dropped.

307
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,921
Initial the form where it says and
be sure to sign on the last page,

308
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,573
then leave it at reception.

309
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:30,640
Captain till
-- roy --

310
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:33,823
now that this is all over,
you know, I was wondering,

311
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:38,902
since I'm all the way up here, you
know, if you don't have plans...

312
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,072
I'm seeing someone.

313
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,300
Thank you.

314
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,782
Goodbye, miss hodes.

315
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:05,892
Esteban carlos reyes.

316
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:09,090
You come from money in mexico city,

317
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:13,281
attended columbia
university -- go, lions.

318
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:16,980
In 1990, you bought the
largest zoo in mexico.

319
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:21,160
Tragic story with the
mauled panda. Very upsetting.

320
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,880
You moved to tijuana in 1995
to build and manage a casino.

321
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:27,493
You now own three
malls and five hotels --

322
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:31,490
all very highly rated on
hotels.Com, you'll be glad to know.

323
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:36,760
In 2004, you were elected mayor, and then
you set up the esteban reyes foundation,

324
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:41,393
which offers scholarships to underprivileged
children, and you once dated liz hurley.

325
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,331
Now we're just friends.

326
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:45,873
I can only imagine what didn't
make it onto the interweb.

327
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:48,093
But enough about you.
Let's talk about me.

328
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,253
Yeah. All right. Let's do that.

329
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,093
I now know that I'm "o" positive.

330
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:53,743
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

331
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,610
Carlos -- may I
call you carlos?

332
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,992
- No.
- Why not?

333
00:19:58,215 --> 00:19:59,251
What do you want, nancy?

334
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,712
I want a piece of the
next weed shipment.

335
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,582
I can turn it around quickly.

336
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:10,021
And you come to me with this?

337
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:10,991
I do work for you.

338
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:13,323
No, you work for guillermo.
There's a chain of command.

339
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,060
- But he said no.
- So why would you think I'd say yes?

340
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,531
'Cause he's just punishing me
for getting in trouble with you.

341
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:22,792
- And you don't think you deserve to be punished?
- Not like that. Not by him.

342
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:26,281
- By me?
- Sure. By you. The boss.

343
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:29,233
Please, give me a piece
of the next weed shipment.

344
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,071
The lady is leaving.

345
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:58,462
Thank you for your time, mr. Mayor.

346
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:02,981
The cheapest way is to tap
intothe plumbing through here...

347
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,801
remove the closest wall,
and make this the bathroom.

348
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,410
And then we'll knock
down this wall first.

349
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,361
Just give me a number.

350
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,260
- That's your mom.
- What?

351
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,213
- No!
- Well, then, can I have them?

352
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:21,530
No!

353
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:22,930
Come on. I want to see them.

354
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,071
No!

355
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:25,922
So what do you think?

356
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:28,520
I'll... let you know.

357
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,650
Hello?

358
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:36,263
- Well, what's going on?
- Nothing.

359
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,430
- Hi, mrs. Botwin.
- Hi, isabel.

360
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:44,911
What? Why are you looking at me funny?

361
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,211
- Are these the bathroom guys?
- Yeah.

362
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,680
This is, uh, claudio.

363
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:54,540
He was once the deputy transportation
administrator of colombia.

364
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,631
- Hola.
- Hola.

365
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:58,861
He -- they're working
up an estimate.

366
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:02,003
Well, unfortunately,
we might have to w--

367
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:06,593
wait on...that.

368
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,950
Uh, where's silas?

369
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,173
He went to the cheese shop.

370
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,881
Calcium. That's nice.

371
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:19,703
Honey, why are you hiding sammy
davis' autobiography behind your back?

372
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:25,680
he had a baby with a white woman, mom.

373
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,400
I found it shocking.
He was protecting me.

374
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,683
Okay.

375
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,581
We don't get many bean
counters volunteering.

376
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:42,400
We're mostly servicemen or
cops... or used to be, at least.

377
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,340
Yeah. Well, you know, this has
always been a secret dream of mine.

378
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:49,520
And now, with the wife gone -- phew
-- I got nothing holding me back.

379
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,843
I'm ready to kick some ass.

380
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:55,200
You looking to stimulate the adrenals,
or do you just not like hispanics?

381
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:57,630
It's not so much that
I don't like them, sir,

382
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:00,370
it's just that there's another
group of people that I like more --

383
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:03,021
- my fellow countrymen.
- Good answer.

384
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,541
We don't tolerate
bigotry -- officially.

385
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:09,853
Wish there were more
like you, mr. Wilson.

386
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:11,831
We're vastly undermanned.

387
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,953
So, do we get to pack heat?

388
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:17,140
Our mission is to secure united
states borders and coastal boundaries

389
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:20,073
against unlawful and
unauthorized entry --

390
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:23,071
individuals, contraband,
and foreign military.

391
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:28,450
Now, if you choose to arm yourself, you
do so for the purpose of self-defense only.

392
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,712
But you'll never have to take action

393
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:34,723
because you'll abide by the rules
of no contact and no engagement.

394
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,080
- Can I throw rocks?
- No, sir.

395
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,150
So how do we nab these fuckers?

396
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:43,361
We report. We observe. We report.

397
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:47,943
"Report." Gotcha.

398
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,322
Like to start tonight? Sun's going down.

399
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:55,141
It all starts to happen
when the sun goes down.

400
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,481
Crazy shit out there.

401
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,480
Crazy shit.

* My love is like a powder keg *

404
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:19,960
* My love is like a powder keg in
the corner of an empty warehouse *

405
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:23,610
* Somewhere just outside of town *

406

* About to burn down *

407
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:41,993
* Our love is like the border

* Our love is like the border
between Greece and Albania *

409

* Trucks loaded down with weapons *

410
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:00,342
* Crossing over every night *

411
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:04,880
* Moon yellow and bright *

412
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:10,230
* There is a shortage
in the blood supply *

413
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:14,433
* But there is no shortage of blood *

414
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:18,543
* The way I feel about
you baby can't explain it *

415
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:22,662
* You got the best of my love *

416
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:59,311
I came to you first.

417
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:05,481
You said no.

418
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,271
It's just business, guillermo.

419
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,812
Thanks...
