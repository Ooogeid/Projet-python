2
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:09,091
If I was shot in my jerk-off arm,
I'd be mad, too.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,011
I can make the pain go away
anytime with a pill,

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,471
but I don't want to.

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,181
Fuck you.

6
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,102
They smoked heroin.

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,939
- Her friends suck.
- She kind of sucks.

8
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:25,691
I'm gonna out-Nancy Nancy.

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,069
You two idiots want to
get back at mom, right?

10
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,071
All right, then.
Let's do this right.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,865
You know what?
I could use more snake bite for my lips.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,868
Nancy, it's me
the cops are after me.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,246
I have this bag full of plants.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,925
I need your help.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,041
Bingo!

16
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:43,918
It was a bad idea
having you pick me up.

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,046
Gayle has a thing for me.
They're dangerous, Andy.

18
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,463
Fornicators!

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,171
I'm gonna ask Audra to marry me.

20
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:53,487
I wanna give her mom's engagement ring,
the ring that Judah gave you.

21
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:54,720
So, can I have it?

22
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:55,971
Pilar Zuazo.

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,390
I want her dead.

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,643
Depends if you can help me out.
Help get my case transferred to Mexico.

25
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,317
- He's not here.
- What?

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,277
He was released four hours ago.

27
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,196
He's back on the ticket.

28
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,356
She pulled him back in.

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,957
Señora?

32
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,181
Good morning.

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,810
I'll step outside
so you can get undressed.

34
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:44,520
What is this?

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,313
A gift for you.

36
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,315
Thank you. I don't want it.

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,860
I can't leave this room
until I've done my job.

38
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:51,944
Please leave.

39
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,196
I can see you need me.

40
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,446
Let me help you.

41
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,285
Don't make me sit on you.

42
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,661
Relax.

43
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,126
- Relax.
- Sorry.

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't be sorry. Just be limp.

45
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,130
You know my husband's running
for governor?

46
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,889
Yes, I heard.
Congratulations.

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,676
Now relax

48
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,003
and breathe.

49
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,475
He's a puppet.

50
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,768
You be my puppet.

51
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,931
Let me pull the strings.

52
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:30,983
- Men are weak.
- Some men are weak.

53
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,237
Women are strong...

54
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,948
Until they fall apart.

55
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,166
You're not going to fall apart.

56
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:41,702
What makes you so sure?

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,320
You're a warrior...

58
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,789
Like the boss.

59
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,173
Very similar,
locked up in all the same places.

60
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:51,796
Armored and ready for battle.

61
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,470
At least we still have that
in common.

62
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:58,469
You'd be surprised how much
you have in common with Pilar.

63
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,518
She sent me to you.

64
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,723
She wanted you feeling relaxed
and well.

65
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,639
Did we do the job?

66
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,391
There you are, you feral bitch.

67
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,274
Stop right there.

68
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,694
I'm diggin' the hair.

69
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,399
You got this crazy gypsy thing going on.
Want to lick my crystal balls?

70
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:55,401
I have a proposition for you.

71
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:58,166
Does it involve
licking my crystal balls?

72
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,364
I have some product
I'm trying to unload,

73
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:02,658
and I'll let it go cheap.

74
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,676
Fire sale.

75
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,079
I'm out of here.
I'm getting out of this business.

76
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,497
Since when are you in the business?

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,750
- Anyway, I'm broke.
- How broke?

78
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,960
I got $37.

79
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:14,795
Crap.

80
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,114
How about this?

81
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,636
You take my stuff on credit,
you reopen that little shop,

82
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,389
and then pay me back
in a timely fashion.

83
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,241
And if you screw me on the deal,

84
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,435
I'll have your legs broken
by a Mexican goon.

85
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,606
What do you say?

86
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:32,813
Deal?

87
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,595
Let me see what you got.

88
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,617
That's not mine.
Where'd you get this?

89
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,327
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:48,785
Nothing.

91
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,415
Oh, my God!

92
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,708
You know!

93
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,251
Know what?

94
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,113
Oh, christ. Of course.

95
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,504
Fucking Dean.

96
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,008
You're the worst actor ever!

97
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,094
Where's my pot, you stinky gash?
My pot-store pot!

98
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,471
I sold it.

99
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,515
- Then where's my fucking money?
- I rented a condo and bought this pot.

100
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,184
Then this is mine, and you owe me.

101
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,395
No, I am not letting you have that.
I've worked too hard for it.

102
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,522
A minute ago, you were begging
me to take this.

103
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,734
That's 'cause the heat is on.
But that doesn't mean you can take it!

104
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,904
I'm gonna call that black cop
and have you arrested.

105
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,072
Wait...

106
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,027
How did you know he was black?

107
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,759
- What?
- You son of a bitch.

108
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,805
I thought you were breasfefeeding.

109
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:51,558
I had a little too much to drink
last night.

110
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,264
I know.

111
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,691
Here I go,
failing yet another one of my children.

112
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:00,871
I didn't say that.

113
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,309
No.

114
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,363
You don't say much of anything
to me anymore.

115
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:06,031
What am I supposed to say?

116
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,492
I don't know.

117
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,619
So...

118
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,374
There we are.

119
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,376
You should go feed the baby.

120
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:19,795
Hey, guys.

121
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,759
I've got to go feed the baby.

122
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,459
Then you should do that.

123
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,431
I fed both of you.

124
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,311
Breast-fed both of you.

125
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,058
I did.

126
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,237
Thanks.

127
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,715
You're welcome.

128
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,156
Weirdness.

129
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,303
She's mom.

130
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
She's mom.

131
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,985
- Who is it?
- Adelita.

132
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,254
She probably snuck out
to see those idiots and can't get in.

133
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,426
Where are you?

134
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,146
I'll be there in a sec.

135
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,598
Where is she?

136
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,870
She's here... In her room.

137
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:18,520
- She wants me to come up there.
- Wear a condom.

138
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,564
- You learned that lesson, huh?
- Or don't.

139
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,187
See what'll happen.

140
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:25,611
Maybe she slept with someone
who slept with someone famous.

141
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:30,115
You could get Gwyneth Paltrow's herpes
or Lady Gaga's genital warts.

142
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,993
I hear everyone is dying
for John Mayer's syphilis.

143
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:34,995
Where do you get your intel?

144
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,373
I make it up.

145
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,843
Do you see my laptop
over there on my desk?

146
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,182
Could you look up...

147
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,018
Could you just bring it to me?

148
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,974
Just put it on the bed by this hand

149
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,834
and open it for me and go.

150
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,198
You called me up here
to get your laptop,

151
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,619
which is 4 feet away from your bed?

152
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,405
Go fuck yourself, princess.

153
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,081
Wait.

154
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,001
Half my body's gone numb.

155
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,422
I just want to go online
and try to find out why.

156
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,551
You want to Google
why half your body is numb?

157
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,883
- You could be having a stroke.
- I'm not having a stroke.

158
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,890
This has happened before.

159
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,244
It was just my hand, okay?

160
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:44,774
'cause I hit a nerve one time
I slammed into my wrist.

161
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,066
It was dumb.

162
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:47,359
Slammed?

163
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,434
Injected.

164
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,404
Heroin.

165
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,242
Holy shit!
You're a junkie.

166
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,437
I am a recreational user, okay?
Fuck you!

167
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,706
Is this from the stuff
you were smoking?

168
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:06,253
I think it was
from the stuff I took later.

169
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,280
Perfect.
I'm calling your dad.

170
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,381
Don't you fucking dare!

171
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,302
I thought you were cool.

172
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:15,554
You never thought I was cool.

173
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,389
That's true.

174
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,310
Just get out of here.
I don't know why I called you anyway.

175
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:23,103
I'll be fine.

176
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,925
Sure.

177
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:28,150
- Good luck to you.
- Wait! Silas.

178
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,469
Could you maybe shoot me up
just once before you go?

179
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,285
You've got to be kidding me.

180
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,492
- I'm not sure.
- Okay, get ready then.

181
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,838
This is sexy.

182
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,840
- Sexy?
- Yeah, sexy.

183
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:54,105
Sexy?

184
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,385
Sexy.

185
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,614
You're turned on, huh?

186
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,089
It's a flex fuel.

187
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,347
I registered it under a pseudonym

188
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,042
so the whackos can't trace it.

189
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,486
- I unlisted our phone number.
- You sold General Lee.

190
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:09,296
And the slot machine, the air hockey
and a few other things.

191
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,832
Not Ms. Pac-man.

192
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,354
No, what are you, crazy?

193
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,502
I love you,
but I've known Ms. Pac-man a lot longer.

194
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,989
She'll always have a place in my heart,
so if you're threatened,

195
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:18,898
then we need to talk it out.

196
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,885
- I want to see inside.
- All right. Watch this.

197
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,417
That's nice.

198
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,880
See, it's all about the glide.

199
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,722
I'm thinking "Greased Lightning"
or "Melvin. "

200
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,635
haven't settled on a name
for him yet.

201
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,821
This is like a living room.

202
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,755
Come sit in the front.

203
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,272
Come on.

204
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,315
There's two TV screens.
That's bonkers!

205
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,944
Don't make me come back there.
Come on.

206
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,654
Fine. Here I come.

207
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,033
This feels good.

208
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,787
A little lumbar support. Great.

209
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:08,041
If we got a pine-tree air fresheners,
where would we put it?

210
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:10,085
I hate those things.
They make me sneeze.

211
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,254
And we'd lose our new-car smell.

212
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,672
GPS.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,591
- Look at the rearview mirror.
- Is there something behind us?

214
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,387
No, there's nothing behind us.
Everything's in front of us.

215
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,849
Everything is in front of us, so just...
Oh, look.

216
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,061
You shouldn't leave that there.

217
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,228
If the light hits that
and it gets refracted into your eyes,

218
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:34,359
it could momentarily blind you,
and you could crash.

219
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:37,362
So maybe I should take it down.

220
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,116
Just to be safe.

221
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,160
Want to marry me just to be safe?

222
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,261
Fuck!

223
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,156
<i>Audra? Thank God.</i>

224
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,465
She can't talk right now, buddy,
and neither can I.

225
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,190
Got to go, bad timing.

226
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,497
<i>Please, I have to talk to Audra.
It's an emergency.</i>

227
00:11:58,622 --> 00:11:59,968
You're killing me!

228
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,970
Did someone else get shot?

229
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,602
Did you enjoy your massage?

230
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,501
Candela is magical.

231
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,316
Magical.

232
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:16,485
Not as magical as Esteban.

233
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:18,945
He disappears,

234
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,422
he reappears.

235
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,350
Esteban and I can never stay
mad at each other for too long.

236
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:27,995
We've always been a great team.

237
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,404
So I'm guessing...

238
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,632
death and/or blackmail

239
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:38,490
and/or imprisonment is the...

240
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,384
glue that holds you together.

241
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,969
We have come to an understanding.

242
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,890
I'm so happy for you both.

243
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,517
I thought you were bad for him.

244
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,114
The pollsters
have told me otherwise.

245
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:55,190
I can admit
when I've made a mistake.

246
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,068
He will win, even married to you.

247
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,531
But it would still be best
if you stayed in the background.

248
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:05,826
Don't mind me.
Can you leave my house now?

249
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:08,697
That's okay.

250
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,421
I should go to prepare
for the party tonight.

251
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,209
Big party at my house, Nancy.

252
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,628
Fundraiser for the campaign.

253
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,806
You should come... For 30 minutes.

254
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,425
Then you will get a headache
and leave.

255
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:25,395
I promise to deliver him back
before dawn.

256
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,555
<i>Adios.</i>

257
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,133
So...

258
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:39,495
You had some day yesterday.

259
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,591
I went looking for you.

260
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,088
I know.

261
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:49,792
I found you on TV.

262
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,307
You look good on TV.

263
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,750
You know...

264
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:57,833
She has everything...

265
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:01,731
Every indiscretion...

266
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:03,958
Documented...

267
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,330
Photographed.

268
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,394
I could cooperate.

269
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,809
I could go to prison for life.

270
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:13,656
Those were my options.

271
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,022
What would you have me do?

272
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,293
Is that...

273
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:41,213
Are you wearing my deodorant?

274
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,671
It's for men.

275
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,384
I like it.

276
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,971
I don't want to have my nose
in your armpit and smell myself.

277
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,182
So don't put your nose in my armpit.

278
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,143
Do you hear me?

279
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,313
I don't like you wearing it.

280
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:02,567
- I like the way it smells.
- You smell like a man.

281
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,237
You will not wear it again.

282
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:07,280
Is that clear?

283
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:11,205
I got it.

284
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,911
You're the man.

285
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:22,003
I was just thinking about you.

286
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>I saw a dogfight last night.</i>

287
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,244
Two pit-bull bitches
ripped the shit out of each other.

288
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,929
One of them had a really nice ass.

289
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,806
- Where are you?
- <i>Mexico.</i>

290
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,384
Thanks, blanca.

291
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,949
You know, it's nice to be free.

292
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,398
<i>That was fast.</i>

293
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,690
You did good by me.

294
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,985
I want it done today, Guillermo...
Today.

295
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,113
I held up my end. Just do it.

296
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,046
Sure. It's no problem.

297
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,075
I'm your boy, right?

298
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:08,466
So, you're benefiting
from my experience.

299
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,927
When Quinn tied me up,

300
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,219
I chafed.

301
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,958
You should be pretty comfortable.

302
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:16,931
So, what happens now?

303
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,315
I go back to my
fabulously successful career

304
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,264
as a drug dealer
because there are no black cops

305
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,525
looking for me.

306
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,236
What happens to me?

307
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,214
I haven't thought that through yet.

308
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:32,908
- I could sell your organs.
- You've had the best one.

309
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,659
I don't do dick anymore.

310
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,829
- Do tell.
- I met a lady.

311
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,789
- Nice.
- She is nice.

312
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,007
Nice to me.

313
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:44,836
She understands how a woman works.

314
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,161
When we kiss, it's soft,

315
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,643
and our breasts
press against each other and...

316
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,262
Who am I kidding?
I need dick.

317
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:55,639
Who is she?

318
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,057
She sells cosmetics.

319
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:00,477
- You fucked Raylene?
- You know her?

320
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,270
I tried, but she likes girl parts.

321
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:03,666
And success.

322
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,524
You pretty much stole
any chance I had at that.

323
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,902
Survival of the fittest.
You were stupid.

324
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,947
- And you were greedy.
- Like you wouldn't have done the same.

325
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,115
- That's not the point.
- Then what is?

326
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,520
We were both greedy and stupid,
and look where it got us...

327
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,053
Sitting in some storage locker.

328
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:19,909
You with the stench of pussy
on your lips

329
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,581
and me with a drawer-dented dick.

330
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:25,126
Speak for yourself,
'cause I am just fine.

331
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,812
Till the next time
you think a cop's watching you.

332
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,925
You folded so quick.
Maybe you're not cut out for this.

333
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,469
No! I want to be a drug dealer.

334
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:37,248
If Nancy can do it, so can I.

335
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:39,683
How did she do it?

336
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,892
She had a team.

337
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,722
I need a team.

338
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,159
People I can trust.

339
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,650
I don't trust anybody.

340
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,527
Hard to put together a team, then.

341
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,904
Nancy had a team. I want a team.

342
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,449
- Do you want to team up with me?
- Fuck you.

343
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:59,012
So, who are you gonna
team up with then?

344
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,998
Fine.
But you team up with me.

345
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,001
What difference does it make?

346
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,794
It makes all the difference.

347
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,379
You're tied up.

348
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:12,590
Bottom... Top.

349
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,141
Nice to see you.

350
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,143
Tell me someone else
hasn't gotten shot.

351
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,228
I'm here to see my nephew
and say hi.

352
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,482
Thank God. She's in he...
You said you wouldn't say anything.

353
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,735
She's roaming the halls.
I don't know.

354
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,747
What the fuck is going on?

355
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:36,327
I think Adelita O.D.'d or something.

356
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,117
O.D.'d on what?

357
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:41,964
Heroin.

358
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,903
She's a junkie.

359
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,813
Come in with me.

360
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,630
I'll find you
when I know a little bit more.

361
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,200
We don't want to overwhelm her.

362
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:56,869
Okay, sweetie,
healer of the sick, saver of lives.

363
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,028
I love you.

364
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,183
So, you did it, huh?

365
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,304
I did.

366
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:05,679
She's a doctor.

367
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,312
I'm marrying a doctor.

368
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,190
And she actually said yes?

369
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,008
She will. She's hooked.

370
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,480
- Ding dong?
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,480
Adelita's a junkie.

372
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,535
I think with the accent,
it's "yunkie."

373
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,132
Jesus.

374
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,968
Fancy boarding schools,
three languages,

375
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,713
but a neglected child
is a neglected child.

376
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,381
You're gloating.

377
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:37,342
What?

378
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:40,970
You're a little glad Esteban's
daughter's a drug addict.

379
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,293
- More than a little glad.
- I am not.

380
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,850
It's horrible.
Esteban's gonna be heartbroken.

381
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,602
Gloating.

382
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:49,687
A little. No, I'm not.

383
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,108
He did put down my children,

384
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,910
told me I should have
sent them away.

385
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,905
Bloom is off the rose, huh?

386
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,826
Little sorry that you pledged
eternal love and devotion?

387
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,202
I can't rely on men.

388
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:06,679
Doesn't mean I don't love them.
It doesn't mean I walk out.

389
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,569
It just means
I adjusted my expectations.

390
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,098
Men are weak.

391
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,131
I'm not. I'm fucking steel.

392
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,150
Yes, you are.

393
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,941
And you're getting married.

394
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,172
We're like an O. Henry story.

395
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,576
We're our own
fucked-up little story.

396
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,486
Why is he always here?

397
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,612
Afternoon.

398
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,910
I like him.

399
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:44,159
Congrats on your new run.

400
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,050
Thank you.

401
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:47,842
Sit down, join us.

402
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,684
Andy just proposed to Audra
this morning.

403
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,927
Congratulations.

404
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,420
Marriage is a complicated
and delicate dance.

405
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,132
- Yeah. It is.
- Sell it.

406
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,387
So, why are you here
and not with your fiancée?

407
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,805
She's here, too.

408
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:09,225
- Who else got shot?
- Nobody got shot.

409
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,293
Adelita wasn't feeling well.

410
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:13,498
Why didn't you tell me that?

411
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,023
What's the matter?

412
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,419
- I should go see her.
- No, Audra's up there with her.

413
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,712
You can go and see her
in a little while.

414
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:22,989
What is the matter with my daughter?

415
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:30,121
She is pregnant, isn't she?

416
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:32,813
Stupid, stupid girl.

417
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:35,660
Come on now.
I hear she speaks three languages.

418
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,474
She's not pregnant, Esteban.

419
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,874
She has...

420
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,133
A heroin problem.

421
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,348
What are you talking about?
Adelita?

422
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,724
That's impossible.

423
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,270
I know all the best rehabs.

424
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:57,649
I'm totally addicted
to that show "intervention. "

425
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:21,005
I can't.

426
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,716
He can't.

427
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,030
Then, I will.

428
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,202
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

429
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,149
But I figured we're all unemployed
and had nothing else to do, so...

430
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,019
I'm Celia Hodes, team leader.

431
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:50,917
Doug Wilson, finance,
co-team leader.

432
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:54,314
Dean Hodes, legal.

433
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,481
Sanjay Patel, sales.

434
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:01,049
Ignacio Morello Jr., supply.

435
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,381
Perro Insano, muscle.

436
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,093
Down, boy.

437
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:11,139
Introduce yourself.

438
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,640
We all know each other.

439
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,393
Do you want to play or not?

440
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,227
Fine.

441
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:20,365
Isabel Hodes, brains.

442
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,351
I have a team.

443
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:35,357
I'm gonna have to take it off
when I do surgery.

444
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,122
You're gonna have to take it off

445
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:39,282
if you don't say "yes" already.

446
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,340
So, what'd you and Nancy talk about?

447
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,298
I don't remember.
I was too busy thinking about you.

448
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:47,158
- Bullshit.
- It's true, I was.

449
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:49,876
I was thinking about
how you owe me an "I love you"

450
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:53,155
from when I said it in the hal
outside the junkie's room.

451
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,485
Well, in that case, I love you.

452
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:56,955
I love you more.

453
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,313
Have a seat, sinners.

454
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,816
Mom arranged it for her
to go someplace in Arizona.

455
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,636
She's on the plane now.

456
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:34,214
It was weird seeing Esteban cry.

457
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,459
Fucking idiots.

458
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,372
Slow down there, cowboy.

459
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:40,573
I enjoy the bubbles.

460
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:43,036
I'm not gonna become
an I.V. drug user.

461
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,640
You like pain too much.

462
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:49,146
Why didn't you go to Europe?

463
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:54,868
'cause it looked like you were
gonna go off the deep end,

464
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,393
and I wanted to be around
to jump in.

465
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,330
You should go. I'll be fine.

466
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:01,742
We'll see.

467
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:04,961
There's also mom to worry about.

468
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:06,879
The teflon warrior?

469
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,382
One day, her luck's gonna run out.

470
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:18,154
You having a good time?

471
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,685
The tuna poke is good.

472
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,856
- Get used to it.
- Get used to tuna poke?

473
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,996
Get used to the role you're playing.

474
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,171
Get used to Pilar and her ways.

475
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:32,613
I'm not prepared to get used
to Pilar and her ways.

476
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,907
Well, what a bad girl scout you are.

477
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,951
I've prepared in other ways.

478
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,486
Have you now?

479
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,322
Mini sliders.

480
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,286
You know, you should get one
before you have to go.

481
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:48,561
We'll talk about it later.

482
00:25:58,389 --> 00:25:59,739
I'm sorry, Nancy.

483
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm sorry about everything.

484
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:06,718
It's life.

485
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,097
That's what Shane told me.

486
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:13,946
Something happens today,
something else will happen tomorrow.

487
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,267
Wait.

488
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:21,621
It's cold outside.

489
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:23,471
Here.

490
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:26,751
I'm not going anywhere, you know?

491
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,970
Tell the boys I'll meet them
in the car?

492
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:33,003
You're trusting me with your kids?

493
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:35,537
We're all broken.

494
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,048
I know. My time is up.

495
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:41,941
Why don't we take a walk first?

496
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,701
You look nice.

497
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:46,257
Thank you.
You look nice, too.

498
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,011
So, Guillermo.

499
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:51,031
Interesting choice.

500
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:53,751
Guillermo?

501
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,484
I admire the <i>cojones</i>.

502
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,434
Next time,
you might want to hire someone

503
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,874
who doesn't work for me

504
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:04,747
and who isn't still mad at you
for ratting him out.

505
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:09,156
I'll keep that in mind...
Next time.

506
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,253
Now, if you'll excuse me,
some bitch told me

507
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,922
I had to leave early.

508
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,635
Your press-on nails
are digging into my arm.

509
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:19,611
You think this is a joke?

510
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:22,094
You took a fucking shot at me
and you hit my kid

511
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:23,748
and you cut my husband's balls off.

512
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:26,727
That's three you owe me...
Four if we count the balls separately.

513
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,896
Let's make it six.

514
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,514
We're counting yours, too?

515
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:34,190
Esteban needs you and the baby
for photos,

516
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:36,921
but Silas and Shane...

517
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,215
They are... What's the word?

518
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
Extraneous.

519
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:45,204
We don't need them to complete
our pretty pictures.

520
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:49,417
You come anywhere near my children,
I'll kill you myself.

521
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:51,576
You look stunning in black.

522
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,992
The people will be very sympathetic

523
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,175
toward the grieving mother
who has just lost

524
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,865
her beautiful children
in a tragic...

525
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,464
Car accident?

526
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,944
Or perhaps a plane crash.

527
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:06,527
Or perhaps...

528
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,980
A croquet mallet?

529
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,108
I couldn't find a golf club.
