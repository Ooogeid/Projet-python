1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,130
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,390
we're gonna be doing some
remodeling around here.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,780
We could save money if we
didn't use a contractor.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,540
- I could do it.
- You're hired.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,610
I turn 18 in a few weeks.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
I'm not waiting.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,610
We should be coyotes.

8
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,740
That guy who brought over davenport
and marzipan was such an asshole.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,030
Why can't you buy your drugs in
the U.S. Like a normal person?

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,010
I have no health insurance,
no money, and an arrest record.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,180
- Xanax?
- Yes!

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,320
I want some.

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,620
How about I sell you 300
pounds at 25 bucks a gram?

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,660
Fuck you. That's more than street value.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,440
You don't like it, do something else.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,020
I need to habla with esteban.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,530
"we are here to inaugurate
this mobile medical unit."

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,160
I want a piece of the
next weed shipment.

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,590
You work for guillermo.
There's a chain of command.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
But he said no.

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,600
I came to you first.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,980
Thanks...

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,710
Hola. Boss says time to start.

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,550
Boss?

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,850
Bubblicious or rhythm field?

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,800
I like bubblicious, but it's on back
order, and rhythm field fell off a truck,

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,970
so there may not be enough.

31
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,000
What happened to the solid subway
tile field with hex tiles on the floor?

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,370
I want to give you options.

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,020
You're the contractor, not the designer.

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,310
I can't express my opinion?

35
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,200
Why don't we discuss this after school?

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,050
Surf dicks and gym class. Can't wait.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,230
It's your first day. Give it a chance.

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,740
A chance for what?
More emotional scarring?

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,980
I don't see why I have to go
to school if silas doesn'T.

40
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,090
You're our one shot at legitimacy.

41
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,300
No, I'm not. I'm very
corrupt. I'm a contractor.

42
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,080
Shane... stop it. You're
gonna go to school,

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,620
and then you're gonna grow up and become a
doctor or a lawyer or a business executive.

44
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,230
That's my copper pipe.

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,070
You're late. I hope
you have a good excuse.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,860
Is your mother home?

47
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,220
I'm the guy you need to deal with.

48
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,480
Shane, you need to call
off your worker bees.

49
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,370
Cesar. Good morning.

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,730
How do you know my pipe guy?

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,660
You want to choose tile?
Fine. But i hire the subs, mom.

52
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,170
Shane. Not your pipe guy.

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,410
He would like to see you.

54
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,920
I have to take my kid to
school, and then I have work,

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,300
so maybe later on this afternoon?

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,300
No? All right.

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,840
Great. I'm being dropped off
in a limo with mexican plates.

58
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,920
So much for flying under the radar.

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,110
I'm so dead.

60
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,360
New school. First-day jitters.

61
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,790
Sometimes you eat the bear.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,690
Sometimes the bear eats you.

63
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Yeah, I'll remember that when they're
wrapping the tetherball cord around my neck.

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,230
Some people are victims because
they allow themselves to be.

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
That's right, shane. So don't allow it.

66
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,210
Eat the bear.

67
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,760
Here's $10 for lunch in case
you're still hungry after.

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,660
Can't I do drug things with you guys?

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,330
He's going to get his ass kicked.

70
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,520
He's used to it.

71
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,520
Mom. Mom!

72
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,660
Motherfucker!

73
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,840
Sorry, baby. Jail reflex.

74
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,630
You've got to take me to school.

75
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,590
Isn't there, like, a bus or something?

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,860
For some reason, the cordial suites
la jolla isn't on their route.

77
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,440
Just drop me on your way to work.

78
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,100
Okay.

79
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,100
Okay.

80
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,640
And you've got to change and shower,
and you need to give me $10 for lunch

81
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,840
and you have to fill
out the enrollment forms.

82
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,710
Hand mommy her pills.

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,500
How about a breakfast bar?

84
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,010
- Maybe I'll walk.
- Good girl.

85
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,080
Absolutely. Absolutely.

86
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,980
Garza, slow down, slow down.

87
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,220
Plenty of matzo to go around.

88
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,710
This is what my people ate as we
wandered the desert for 40 years --

89
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,170
at least in the beginning.

90
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,580
Then we switched to manna,
which fell from the sky.

91
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,940
Doesn't really happen anymore.

92
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,650
I'm thinking it's either
global warming or god is dead.

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,550
I haven't committed either way yet.

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,420
So, thoughts?

95
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,180
40 years?

96
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,090
Moses... wasn't half the coyote I am.

97
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,400
Okay, everybody check their supply bag.

98
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,430
You should all have breath
mints, a portable fan,

99
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,420
and a copy of "padre rico, padre pobre."

100
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,860
If anyone's illiterate, I
have a few copies on tape.

101
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,150
That's a nice tree, huh? Looks
like someone had a fiesta here.

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
Is violar mata. Rape tree.

103
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,540
These are from girls who have
been under this tree with evil men.

104
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,760
Yikes. Uh, okay.

105
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,590
Everyone, let's move over there where
the scenery's a little less... rapey.

106
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,770
Do you guys sell sandwiches?

107
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,660
No. Sorry.

108
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,330
People just don't get it. We're a
gourmet shop, not a sandwich shop.

109
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,100
What about gourmet sandwiches?

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,860
I mean, you got your bread, your
meat, every spread on the planet --

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,710
just slap them all together,
take out your big knife --

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,790
stab you with it?

113
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,370
Shouldn't you be in school?

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,000
Is money not the goal of this operation?

115
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,150
Big divorce settlement, huh? Trust fund?

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Money is very much the
goal of this operation.

117
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,110
I got screwed in the divorce
settlement, and, no...

118
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,730
There is no trust fund.

119
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,840
You might want to think
about making some sandwiches.

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,850
You are forbidden to say the
word "sandwich" in my presence.

121
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,960
Fine.

122
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,700
Or "sammich." Or "sammy."
It's all unacceptable.

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,500
If you're so into gourmet,
why are you smoking this?

124
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,420
- It's like the cheez whiz of pot.
- You're some big expert?

125
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,630
That's a bad blend.

126
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,600
It was harvested probably
a year ago and too soon.

127
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,100
It's dried out.

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,210
It's full of enough mold to cure strep.

129
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,690
I'm thinking you bought it
off one of rad's friends.

130
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,740
How do you know so much about weed?

131
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,200
Same way you know so much
about cheese. It's my business.

132
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,600
I am fucking a teenage drug dealer?

133
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,900
Grower. Small scale.

134
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,170
Soon-to-be dealer.
And we make love.

135
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,090
Oh, do we?

136
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,550
What's the greatest cheese ever?

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,160
But are we talking
sheep, goat --

138
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,200
yeah.That cheese.

139
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,110
This is better.

140
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, my god.

141
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,870
I've been smoking cheez whiz.

142
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,920
Entonces, guillermo.

143
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,050
Last week, nancy received
a portion of your shipment.

144
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,850
- øVerdad?
- S?

145
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,170
I instructed you to give her
that portion, and you did.

146
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,240
S?

147
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,720
You gave her that portion,
and then, from what I hear,

148
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,680
you announced that you would kill "the
marimacha bitch in front of her children."

149
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,450
But I didn't instruct
you to do that, did I?

150
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,670
No, I did not.

151
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,730
Now, guillermo, you know I
don't like to micromanage.

152
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,800
I work with people who do their
jobs well, and I leave them to do it.

153
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,700
However, slaughtering a
co-worker, in front of witnesses,

154
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,800
no less, has to be cleared
with upper management.

155
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,810
And your request is denied.

156
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,240
Julio's just doesn't travel well.

157
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,010
You know, in the restaurant,
this is delicious.

158
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,300
Entonces, guillermo, nothing bad
is gonna happen to nancy, right?

159
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,800
Course not.

160
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,120
I am glad to hear that.

161
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,770
I will increase your
commission for shipments.

162
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,630
You should live to enjoy your money.

163
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,080
- Gracias.
- Good.

164
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,000
Everyone's friends again. You may go.

165
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,920
Unh-unh, not you. You stay.

166
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,900
What's a marimacha?

167
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,530
Oh, that's an offensive
term for a lesbian woman.

168
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,150
You hungry?

169
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,790
Well, it smells great, but you
just said it didn't travel well.

170
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,450
No, we'll go to the source.

171
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
Someone make that noise stop!

172
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,160
Se—ora, that is three times today.

173
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,950
You're allowing criminals
into our business.

174
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,640
Where's nancy? I'm lonely.

175
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,370
You're back there with your
gun and your puzzles, movies --

176
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,520
I've just got the donkey that plays
"pop goes the weasel" 40 million time--

177
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,180
I don't feel good.

178
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,010
Se—ora! Despierte!

179
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,490
Se—ora. Oye. Breathe in.

180
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,390
Oh, ignacio. Okay.

181
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,280
Not here, though.

182
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,620
Que? No, no. Lev*ntate. Up. Come on.

183
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,680
What happened?

184
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,490
You take too many drugs.

185
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,580
You need to keep better care
of this store. Of yourself.

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,690
What did you just give me?

187
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,230
Stay awake.

188
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,380
Now your own store. S?

189
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,490
I'm on it. The store is me.

190
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,790
I'm tingly.

191
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,330
Fucking American.

192
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,370
Okay, mama. Let's get you dressed.

193
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,440
any action?

194
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,480
Nah. I think the word's out this
is a pretty tough point to cross.

195
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,130
We're doing good work here, wilson.

196
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,030
Fuck, yeah.

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,060
No immigrants storming through to steal fruit-picking
jobs from hardworking americans on my watch, my friend.

198
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,510
My retarded cousin, tom,
used to be a janitor. No more.

199
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,770
Mexican took his job.

200
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,360
After he got caught trying
to fuck a mop, but still.

201
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,980
Shocking. That's just shocking.

202
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,360
You know that woman I showed
you on my phone the other night?

203
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,040
Freaky steroid chick?

204
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,220
She left me.

205
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,690
- Is that good or bad?
- She was my masterpiece.

206
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,870
Six months of injections -- I took
her from 130 to 215 with a bmi of 18.6

207
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,390
She was two weeks away
from an adam's apple.

208
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,150
There'll be others.

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,850
Not like hope.

210
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,170
Sometimes, after making
love... she'd dead-lift me.

211
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,360
Now, that's one of a kind. Anyway.

212
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,890
This is desert eagle,
heading back to H.Q.

213
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,510
Here we go.

214
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,060
I will lead you now. You
shall be a free people!

215
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,540
Good idea. No time to waste. Yep.

216
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,560
Lady liberty beckons.

217
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,680
This is big and tall, checkpoint five.

218
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,600
Not a bean on the tortilla. I
repeat, not a bean on the tortilla.

219
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,960
All clear. No spic, just span. Over.

220
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,030
Davenport.

221
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,860
Aqu?

222
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,480
Ihola! Welcome to america. Happy days.

223
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,040
Have you seen this girl? Anybody?

224
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,490
Ah, nice to have you here.
Have you seen her? MarÌa?

225
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,800
øS? øNo? MarÌa? Nothing?

226
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,320
We did it, man.

227
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,960
- We sure did.
- We did.

228
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,840
OK,you're a ........

229
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,000
You've got......

230
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,640
Let's go!

231
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,280
What do we do with them now?

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,520
No idea.

233
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,390
So you are not a lesbian.

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,020
Um, around guillermo, I am.

235
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,680
Made it easier
to be friends --

236
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,450
when we were friends, before he wanted
to kill me in front of my children.

237
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,420
Oh, don't worry. It is fixed.

238
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,070
Don esteban! Don esteban!

239
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,670
See?I gave blood.

240
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,020
You are a good man,Julio.

241
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,910
Oh, you don't need a menu.

242
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,690
You order what you like.

243
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,390
Julio will make it, and
if he can't, he'll find it.

244
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,350
- Order anything.
- Elk.

245
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,820
S?

246
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,630
Wait, wait. I'm kidding.

247
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,590
Um, make the best thing that you make.

248
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,430
Look at you and your sway.

249
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,160
Yes. It's like you're
out with the mayor.

250
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,740
Much like that.

251
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,230
I have to pee.

252
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,660
Holy shit.

253
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,550
Run and call for help.

254
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,140
Take care of everybody.

255
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,340
Our food might take a little while.

256
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,460
You need to go.

257
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,010
It's ok.I'm ok.

258
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,900
The ambulance......

259
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,410
I know.I know.

260
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,030
Help Julio clean up.

261
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,410
Julio.I will.........

262
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,970
I strongly......

263
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,650
I'm going to stay.And......

264
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,850
Esteban.Please!

265
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,390
Take care of the........

266
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,880
Everyone...

267
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,180
...Don't .....

268
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,890
Everything will....

269
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,080
Do you have any neosporin?

270
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,190
Neosporin?

271
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,700
twizzlers. Some tampons.

272
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,870
I might have a tide stick.

273
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,290
Sit. Sit down.

274
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,110
I'm thinking we should
go out for chinese.

275
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,700
- Sit.
- Sit.

276
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,100
You never sipped from your beer
after you toasted the crowd.

277
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,250
That's very bad luck.

278
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,910
I don't like to drink from the bottle.

279
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,880
All right.

280
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,900
But clearly, that's not your issue.

281
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,980
Not my issue.

282
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,820
But then, I have trouble breathing after I've
been shot at, which, clearly, you don't, so...

283
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,850
I guess we all have our things.

284
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,470
Another school. Another first day.

285
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Another sweaty glass of social stigma.

286
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,910
We're interesting and
worthwhile people, isabel.

287
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,570
Yeah. Well, if only life were a judd
apatow movie where geeks ruled the world.

288
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,320
But it's not, so let's
just suck it up. Chip?

289
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,840
No, thanks.

290
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,830
Hey, who's the king of the school?

291
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,400
The most popular, most athletic,
most often-laid guy here?

292
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,850
I guess it's dan.

293
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,610
Everyone wants to be friends with dan.

294
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,870
- I'm shane.
- I'm dan.

295
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,740
Don't fuck with me.

296
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,470
Medium, large, large, small, petite...

297
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,700
petite maternity.

298
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,650
Excuse me. Sorry.

299
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,020
Do you have this in blue?

300
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
Nice choice!

301
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,960
I will ring you up over here $42.99...

302
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,530
Please. Do you want it in a box?

303
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,230
In a bag? In a box in a bag?

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,370
I actually just want it in blue.

305
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,020
Well, why didn't you say so?

306
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,740
Oh, I'm sorry. I've
already checked the racks.

307
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,710
Can you just check in
the back for me, please?

308
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,830
Good idea.

309
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,970
The drill...

310
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,390
Soccer shoe. Soccer shoe.

311
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,970
The preggies keep coming.

312
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,340
We call it f˙tbol.

313
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,670
Igol!

314
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,070
Kill....

315
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,370
- So?
- So, what?

316
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,360
- Do you have it in blue?
- Just get it in green.

317
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,290
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

318
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,270
Green is the color of
spring who's next? Let's go!

319
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,010
You think maybe they want to
close up? We've been here a while.

320
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,970
When I finish my coffee, we'll go.

321
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,720
Who was trying to kill you?

322
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,510
Maybe the mzo.

323
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,440
Maybe the mexicate.

324
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,350
And let me guess. You're the hot sauce.

325
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,750
I am the table.

326
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,500
How often do people shoot at you?

327
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,980
They mostly shoot at each other.

328
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,460
And the occasional bystander?

329
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,730
I cannot control the streets.

330
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,090
Streets that provide the
latest in mobile healthcare.

331
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,060
My success in business allows
me to give back to the community.

332
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,910
Take a little blood,
give a little blood.

333
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,620
You question my motives?

334
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,250
Soothing your conscience
at the expense of others.

335
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,520
You question my motives.

336
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,350
You're bleeding again. It's your...

337
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,190
no, no. I'm okay. I'm okay.

338
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,030
Maybe if you put it under your pillow you
can get a dollar from the shrapnel fairy.

339
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,250
Well, it's part of the job.

340
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,880
If people see you're afraid,
they do not vote for you.

341
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,130
- Nothing scares you?
- Nothing.

342
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,030
That's a lie. You're afraid
of dirty beer bottles.

343
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm not afraid. I just don't like them.

344
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,100
- Snakes?
- Fine with snakes.

345
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,340
- Failure?
- Not a problem.

346
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,580
Heights.

347
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,350
Are you afraid of heights?

348
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,820
Yeah.

349
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,010
What are you afraid of?

350
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,190
- calm.
- Before the storm?

351
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,180
The storm I can weather.

352
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,040
Come with me.

353
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,060
Okay. AdiÛs, adiÛS. AdiÛS.

354
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,430
You sure you're gonna be okay?

355
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,820
Lake davenport, florida.

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,930
Big fish. Lobster boy. Jeb bush.

357
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
We'll miss you.

358
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,540
Hasta luego.

359
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,910
You were right, andy.
This is a great business.

360
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,550
Helping the unfortunate.

361
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,110
Unlimited customer base.

362
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,860
- Reconnecting families.
- Low overhead.

363
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,290
We're doing god's work, and we're providing
the backbone of the american economy.

364
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,020
They paid you, right?

365
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,390
Two drills!......

366
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,390
Kill that....

367
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,390
Soccer shoe. Football shoe.

368
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,890
- W-whatever you call
it, I need more. - No m*S.

369
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
Please? Just a little bit? Helps me.

370
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,450
No m*s!

371
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,890
I'll pay you.

372
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,650
How much you got?

373
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,480
Hang on. I'll get my purse.

374
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,920
Suck......

375
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,060
Silas... I had a thought.

376
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,440
Oh, yeah?

377
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,060
About cheese.

378
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,640
Surprise, surprise.

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,430
About how it smells
-- very strong.

380
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,550
That is an understatement.

381
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,960
You can smell this
place from a block away.

382
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,080
It stinks.

383
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,460
Good thing you're sexy.

384
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,150
Okay. You're missing the point.

385
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,250
What's the point?

386
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,500
It's the kind of smell that
overpowers all other smells.

387
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,050
It is, isn't it?

388
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,070
Look at all of this room back here.

389
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,640
Maybe you know somebody
who wants to rent it?

390
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,520
You really don't want to
make sandwiches, do you?

391
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,530
Sandwiches are bullshit.

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,480
There are only 40 of
them left in the world.

393
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,260
And now I own three.

394
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,660
He will join the other
two at my zoo in coyoac*N.

395
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,540
My son has turtles.

396
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,530
Please tell me that's
also going to your zoo.

397
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,250
You might not want to watch this.

398
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,970
But you don't have a problem with it?

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,790
I enjoy it.

400
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,180
* Well, teach me, baby *

401
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,660
* oh, yes *

402
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,230
* a little
show-and-tell *

403
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,110
* teach me, baby *

404
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,090
* well one more time *

405
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:42,240
* how to see the sunrise
in the dead of night *

406
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,410
* teach me, baby *

407
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,590
* How to keep from loving you *

408
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,660
Ay, buenas noches, nancy.

409
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,060
I have found......

410
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,370
He helped......

411
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,720
He plied......

412
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,340
He wears.......

413
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,180
He calls......

414
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,920
El Andy.

415
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,720
* I'm not a weak girl *

416
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,660
* don't call me weak, no *

417
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,700
* I'm just a hungry girl *

418
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,210
* and you taste so sweet *

419
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,240
* and you taste so sweet *

420
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,800
