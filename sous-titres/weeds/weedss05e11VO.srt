<i>Previously on </i>Weeds...

2
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:09,342
Mom?

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,344
That bullet was meant for me,
wasn't it?

4
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:13,579
You owe me, and you hurt my kid.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,725
You're never getting hurt again.
I promise you.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,644
You should be worrying
about Stevie Ray.

7
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,228
He's just a baby.

8
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,481
- Baby murderer!
- 25 feet, Gayle.

9
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:26,609
Please help us, we can't get
our weed back without a court order.

10
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,487
I will help you.
But first, his dick.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,931
This drawer.

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,035
I can do this.

13
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,160
Raylene Reynolds.
You're Pretty! Cosmetics.

14
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:37,870
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,246
I can sell a lot more makeup

16
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,749
if I give a free gift.

17
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:43,713
I can't steal their weed.

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:45,887
Putz.

19
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,837
I've got a crooked dick,
and there's no pot?

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,715
This little milk ball was

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,968
a mistake that would end the career
of a very promising politician.

22
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,870
I am here to correct that mistake.

23
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,519
I have been replaced

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,813
as candidate for governor.

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,563
Pilar Zuazo.

26
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,986
I want her dead.

29
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,038
- In your face.
- She's fucking on fire.

30
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,257
Four points!

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,127
The newlyweds are annoying.

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,462
Weren't lawn darts banned?

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,964
When you boys are finished crying,
it's your turn.

34
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,770
He's taunting us.

35
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,719
He's trying to act like a father.
Fathers taunt.

36
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:37,909
When we went jogging,
dad told me I was so slow,

37
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,849
Stephen Hawking could beat me
in a footrace.

38
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:43,039
Then he collapsed,
puked twice, and died.

39
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,437
Who's the better jogger now?

40
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,959
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a proper wedding.

41
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,532
Well, it was perfect.

42
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,362
Thank you for marrying me.

43
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,036
No, thank you for marrying me,

44
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:57,700
and thank you for encouraging me
about the election.

45
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,659
Fuck Pilar. We're gonna win.

46
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:02,170
Throw already, you girls!

47
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,142
Hey, what's wrong with girls?

48
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:09,879
Who's that?

49
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:12,756
This is Adelita.

50
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,383
Our stepsister.

51
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,584
Adelita.

52
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,307
- Of course, you forgot I was coming.
- My brain. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:25,311
Adelita is in from Paris
to look at colleges.

54
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,273
- How are your sisters? Your mom?
- <i>Très bien.</i>

55
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,691
You're married.

56
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,780
Congratulations.

57
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:40,534
So, why is my room
decorated like a hospital?

58
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:48,250
- All right. There you are.
- This is wrong.

59
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,961
- I'm sorry?
- I ordered goat cheese.

60
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,463
This is ricotta.

61
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:55,758
You can tell because
it's disgusting and flavorless

62
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,085
and it's cow, not goat.

63
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,702
Cows go "moo."

64
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,437
Goats go "baa."

65
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:05,892
Sheep go "baa."

66
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,479
Shut the fuck up, sheep,
and bring me the right cheese.

67
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:12,316
I just attacked a waitress, Raylene.

68
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,400
- I'm back.
- You know,

69
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,113
in my whole time at You're Pretty!,
I have never seen anyone ascend

70
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,296
so fast

71
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,367
and with such thrust.

72
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,067
I'm just getting started.

73
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,412
I am doing a major push

74
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,290
as soon as I square away
some new product.

75
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,043
Hot damn! I am wetter
than a slaughterhouse floor.

76
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,796
- You're funny.
- Yeah, I'm not kidding.

77
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:50,645
I haven't pumped.

78
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,649
- Are you giving him formula?
- Sí.

79
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,441
Lupita, I'm breast-feeding.

80
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,680
Two people give you
different directions.

81
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,990
One, white woman from suburb,

82
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:05,032
the other, giant, scary,
Mexican drug kingpin.

83
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,452
Who you listen to?

84
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,074
There he is.

85
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,169
Did you tell Lupita
to give the baby formula?

86
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:19,174
I'm breast-feeding.
You know this.

87
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,802
Peasants breast-feed.

88
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,236
Peasants?

89
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,180
First of all,
it's better for the baby.

90
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,010
Actually, some studies suggest

91
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,096
that the toxins
you've ingested in your life

92
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,852
will come out in your breast milk.

93
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,708
I should unpack.

94
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,405
You are a politician's wife.

95
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,990
We have work to do.
Let the servants feed the baby.

96
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:48,120
No more formula.
Baby booby.

97
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,663
- I mean it.
- All right. As you wish, <i>mi amor</i>.

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,927
Don't you have to be
25 feet away, Gayle?

99
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,564
Not from you.

100
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:07,681
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:09,434
Pap smear.

102
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:13,239
Okay, before I climb in that car,
you should know that one phone call

103
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:16,564
and assurances that you've cut
all ties from Nancy doesn't mean that...

104
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,553
You un-welded the door.

105
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:26,915
Bye, Gayle.

106
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,499
Fornicators!

107
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,422
Read me what we got so far.

108
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,646
"Doug and Dean's big list of ways
to get revenge

109
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:46,886
"on that thieving,
deceitful whore, Celia."

110
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:51,390
- That's it.
- Okay.

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,241
You need to be typing
everything I say.

112
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,312
- My ideas are golden.
- Sorry.

113
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,647
Number one,

114
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,120
tell her she won some shit,

115
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,035
and then there's no shit.

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,110
Embarrassing!

117
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:06,572
Number two, we slip some
spider goats under her door.

118
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,979
- What the fuck are spider goats?
- Part goat, part spider.

119
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,663
Their milk has kevlar webs.
Look it up.

120
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,499
So, they're like
these tiny little goats?

121
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,335
No, they're big goats
with spider genes.

122
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,337
How the fuck do we get them
under the door?

123
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,007
Good point.
Number three.

124
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,761
We kick her in the twat.

125
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,386
We suck at this.

126
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,390
This is why we can't
strategize good, Dean.

127
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:32,843
Pot.

128
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,852
If we're going into battle,
we have to have a clear head.

129
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,187
But we love pot.

130
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,816
Do you think Ulysses S. Grant was stoned
when he won World War I?

131
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:43,734
Or Gore, when he beat
global warming?

132
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,903
We're going into battle
with a formidable opponent.

133
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,748
We have to be our very best.

134
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,910
Then we can fuck that bitch up good
so she stays fucked up.

135
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:54,453
So for now, we back off the weed.

136
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,136
How do you have a cellphone?

137
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,806
I always got the newest shit.

138
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,677
- What, you want me to hook you up?
- No. I'm in the middle of a contract.

139
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,935
AT&T.

140
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,954
Those fuckers tried
to give me a hard time, too,

141
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:25,651
so I had a friend visit the call center
up in Burnsville, Minnesota.

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,718
You should mention my name,
asked for Bill Sondergaard.

143
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:33,668
He'll be the one that sounds like
he's talking through a broken jaw.

144
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,705
Does this mean you're gonna help me
with my little problem?

145
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,530
See, now, about that.

146
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,823
Pilar Zuazo.

147
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:45,681
She's Manny Ramirez.

148
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,979
You a peewee-league pitcher.

149
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:52,053
Got to wonder, what the fuck
you doing on the mound?

150
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,016
I get it. You can't do shit.
You're locked up.

151
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,497
Don't get it twisted, <i>mami</i>.
I'm still working.

152
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:01,353
I'm just telecommuting for now.

153
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,872
Can you do it or not?

154
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:05,316
I don't know.
Depends if you can help me out.

155
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,053
Help get my case
transferred to Mexico.

156
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:11,156
- See, that tunnel that you shut down...
- Nasty rumor.

157
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,339
It spanned two countries.

158
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,855
Thanks to you,
the last of the American agents

159
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,005
who could testify
as to which side I was standing on...

160
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,667
He's dead now.

161
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,395
So?

162
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,248
So I need someone
with high-level Mexi-juice

163
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,840
to help get my case
transferred down there.

164
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:33,196
- And then what?
- Then I'm David Blaine in Mexico.

165
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,507
I slide under doors in Mexico.

166
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:45,607
How do I know
you're not gonna come after me?

167
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,638
<i>Blanca</i>, we're like...

168
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,004
one of those youtube videos.

169
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:54,412
You know, where a tiger
and a duck get all confused.

170
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,910
They become friends.

171
00:08:57,924 --> 00:08:59,955
And, you know, it seems okay,

172
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:02,909
but you never really know, do you?

173
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,949
God, I hated anatomy.

174
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,219
Memorizing all 206 bones
in the body is not easy.

175
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,930
Your hands feel good.

176
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,392
That's my fibula.

177
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,144
- See? I still got it.
- Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,232
- What was I saying?
- Wonderful, interesting things.

179
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,876
That's my tibia.

180
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,013
- Silence.
- I was gonna tell you

181
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,406
- about my year in Yemen.
- Yemen can wait.

182
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,407
Patella.

183
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,388
Okay, Audra.

184
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:41,329
- I mean Andy. I just called you Audra.
- I know.

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Femur.

186
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:47,651
Trochanter.

187
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,986
Femoral neck.

188
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,124
Femoral head.

189
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, God.

190
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,016
This is what I do.

191
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,924
So just you lay back.

192
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,726
This is embarrassing.

193
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,617
Never mind.

194
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:17,472
Look, I've been single for a while,

195
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,488
so my battery-powered helpers
have made it difficult...

196
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,711
That didn't shoot out of you, right?

197
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,838
It's Gayle.
He must have followed us. Fuck.

198
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,675
He brought some friends.
Holy shit!

199
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:37,761
- Let's call the police.
- No use.

200
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,314
I knew it was a bad idea
having you pick me up.

201
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:41,931
Gayle has a thing for me.

202
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,309
If you love something,
throw tomatoes at it.

203
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,166
Now I'm gonna have to move again.

204
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,979
- Seriously?
- I'm always moving.

205
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,391
They find out where I live,
and I move again.

206
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,775
They're dangerous.

207
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:55,028
Stay with me
while you figure out your next move.

208
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,113
What? No, I can't.

209
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,700
I got a big house.
You'd get your own room.

210
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:02,118
Me and the General
got you into this, so...

211
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,607
Why don't you think about it, okay?

212
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,723
- What are you doing?
- If you don't climax,

213
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:11,628
the terrorists win.

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,547
Can't let that happen.

215
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:20,863
A Baja federal judge
is holding that up.

216
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,389
Can you ask him to un-hold it?

217
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,893
You should not have been visiting
Guillermo Garcia Gomez in jail.

218
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,763
We have a history.

219
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,897
I'd come and visit you, too,

220
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,565
smuggle in

221
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,734
gold chains, shiny shirts.

222
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,154
Hi, honey. Can I make you something?

223
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:42,242
- Do you know how to make beer?
- You're not having any more beer.

224
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,078
That was a special occasion.
You got shot.

225
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,842
I know. I'm kidding.

226
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,476
Like it or not,
we all have to work together now.

227
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,884
It's for our own safety.

228
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,262
Why don't you stick
to breast-feeding?

229
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,847
Well, fuck you. Just do it.

230
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,309
Good.
And you can't kill him.

231
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,186
If anyone gets hurt,

232
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,356
I'll tell Esteban you tried to shoot me,
and his heart will break all over you.

233
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,525
I'm good at killing.

234
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,736
No killing.

235
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,319
Life's a drag.

236
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:22,673
Come on.

237
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,242
Big baby.

238
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,798
Seriously, tell me
why we're really here, or I'm leaving.

239
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,802
Well, now that I'm a giant success,
I want to pamper myself.

240
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,512
And I want to extend

241
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:47,117
the pampering experience
to my child,

242
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,475
whose company I enjoy.

243
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,613
She'll take a bottle
of the Sebastian shaper spray,

244
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:54,230
'cause she's my salon buddy.

245
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,358
Wait. Fine, fine. Fine.

246
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,655
I want to apologize.

247
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,907
When you told me you were gay...

248
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,427
I didn't react well.

249
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,287
You told me you would take
my rug-munching ass

250
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,898
to reparative therapy.

251
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,934
Well, that was old mommy.
I'm new mommy.

252
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:17,471
New mommy is a nice mommy.

253
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,612
Anyway, I thought
that maybe you could, you know,

254
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,218
tell me a little bit about it.

255
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,046
About being lesbionic.

256
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:28,949
What do you do?

257
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:31,434
I don't know.

258
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:35,156
I've only done the kissing part.

259
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,992
Was that weird... Kissing a girl?

260
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:39,593
Is it soft?

261
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,797
Is it good soft, like a puppy?

262
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,747
Or is it bad soft,
like rotten fruit?

263
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,271
Oh, god.
Am I gonna have to get a strap-on?

264
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,750
- I was just thinking about it.
- You cannot take this away from me!

265
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,420
- I'm not.
- It's all I have!

266
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:58,587
Don't be selfish!

267
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,315
Mommy's lonely.

268
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,517
There's this woman out there
right now

269
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,098
who thinks that I am <i>The Cat's Meow</i>.

270
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,689
Cat, pussy.

271
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,958
Already doing the lezzie humor.

272
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,793
You're not gay, mom.

273
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,305
Well, what if I am?

274
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,364
There was that Tracy Chapman song
that I liked.

275
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,334
New mommy is still a hateful bitch.

276
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,911
Come on. Maybe it would bring
us closer, you know?

277
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,733
Here you go.

278
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:32,413
What about you?

279
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:36,040
You ever...
Gone down to girly town?

280
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:53,520
I left clean sheets
and towels on your bed.

281
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,367
Thanks.

282
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,098
This looks amazing.

283
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,739
Holy crap!

284
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,886
I mean, what were you doing?

285
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,920
It felt like there were
eight of you.

286
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,609
- What was it?
- Trade secret. Can't tell you.

287
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:19,285
- Do it again.
- No. Okay.

288
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,516
Yes, please.

289
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,865
Oh, god, my head.
Throw me the aspirin.

290
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,434
You've had like 14 already.
You'll ruin your kidneys.

291
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,306
Fuck my kidneys.
What do those assholes ever do for me?

292
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,140
And I swear, if you tell me
they clean my poop

293
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,364
or whatever stupid shit they do,
I will kill you.

294
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,044
I will.
I will kill your face off.

295
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,436
Then have some food, at least.

296
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,783
Food is stupid.

297
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:46,387
- Read me what else we have up there.
- We have nothing.

298
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,779
Everything is lame.

299
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,074
Have my feet always been this huge?

300
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,601
Jesus Christ!

301
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,521
It's like I'm a clown in a circus!

302
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,786
My dad took me to the circus
once when I was 6 years old.

303
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,588
And backstage, the ringmaster
touched my tent pole.

304
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,505
What?

305
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:08,732
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

306
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,595
Why am I remembering that now?
I don't want to remember that.

307
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,951
No. Doug, what about our plan?

308
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,685
This is bullshit.
You stay sober.

309
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:20,120
Fuck that.

310
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,540
We get stoned in shifts.

311
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,399
One of us will stay sober,
the other will smoke. Then we'll switch.

312
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:27,793
But what if one of us
has a really great idea,

313
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:30,130
and the other one
is too stoned to get it?

314
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,435
Well, then...

315
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,700
We'll write each other notes,
like <i>Memento</i>.

316
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,402
God damn it,
show me what you were doing.

317
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,461
Here... you're doing something
to that, right?

318
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,184
I don't even know what that is.

319
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,632
That there?

320
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,715
I'm gonna address that later.

321
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,543
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna address that right now.

322
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:56,889
Hey, Adelita.

323
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,809
I was just heading for a night swim.
You want to join me? Big pool.

324
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,730
- Thanks, but I'm reading.
- What are you reading?

325
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:07,566
It's Milan Kundera,
"the book of laughter and forgetting."

326
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,487
So that's like a self-help thing?

327
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,491
Sort of.
Who are you reading now?

328
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,994
I'm between books right now.

329
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,247
Can you recommend something
you've really enjoyed?

330
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,874
I'll make you a list.

331
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,002
Cool. Thanks.

332
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,632
And welcome to the villa.

333
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,132
I grew up here.

334
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,665
- Welcome home, then.
- Thanks.

335
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,305
Enjoy your swim.

336
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Hello, Nancy.

337
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:46,667
I'm just gonna come out
and say this.

338
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,693
Silas can be very charming.

339
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,319
But he's still a guy,
and you're in high school.

340
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,071
My lover is 32 years old.

341
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,199
He's a journalist.

342
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:59,119
Your boy is not
a dangerous temptation for me.

343
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,453
So no need to worry.

344
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:03,957
How's my little brother tonight?

345
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:08,003
Being a stubborn gus.
He won't latch.

346
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:09,712
He likes the formula.

347
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,966
Formula doesn't come out of my boob,
so he's out of luck.

348
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,297
We don't really know each other.
Why don't we go to lunch or...

349
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,099
That's sweet of you, Nancy,

350
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,811
but I'm not terribly invested
in my father's love life.

351
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:26,470
Thanks anyway.

352
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,153
This is amazing.
What am I eating?

353
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,487
Grilled flank steak with red chard,

354
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,116
currants, and homemade harissa.

355
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:41,598
- I think I just came again.
- I love this peach fuzz.

356
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,580
I'm flawed.
I have a pelt.

357
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,457
You are perfect,

358
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,067
'cause you're flesh and blood
and organs and bones,

359
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,170
and you can name all of them.

360
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,588
You're so cool.

361
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,214
You cook like a motherfucker.

362
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,301
Oh, fuck.

363
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:04,059
He won't nurse.

364
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,101
Your fault.

365
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:08,730
You try putting tequila
on your <i>tetas</i>?

366
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:13,066
Frank, Vittachi will show you out.

367
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:14,990
There's breast milk in the freezer.

368
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:16,403
Give him a bottle.

369
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:18,865
And no tequila on the nipple!

370
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:21,910
It's Nancy!

371
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:27,831
I love this woman.
The people have spoken.

372
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:31,031
La Paz, Tecate, Ensenada, Loreto...

373
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:35,193
Everywhere, they support
Esteban Reyes for governor

374
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,550
of estado libre y soberano
de baja California.

375
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,356
Big, handsome governor.

376
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:46,971
Another drink.

377
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,355
The American political
strategists think

378
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,733
they can get some real money
running in clean money.

379
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,694
- Hear that sound?
- What sound?

380
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,081
Pilar Zuazo crying.

381
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,491
I am reborn.

382
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,993
Where is my daughter?

383
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:11,710
I hear Silas tried to hit on her.

384
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:16,214
Why...
Why is that so funny to you?

385
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:21,176
He's not, exactly in her division.

386
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:23,763
League, I think you mean.
League.

387
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,682
Why is he not in her league?

388
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:29,269
You want our children to be involved
with each other?

389
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:32,574
No, I'm just surprised
you'd be so...

390
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,901
Dismissive of my son.

391
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,820
No, no. He's a nice, simple boy.

392
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,780
Adelita has a stick up her ass.

393
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,072
I hope so.

394
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,994
I sent her to France
to get that stick there.

395
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,934
Now Adelita speaks three languages

396
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,671
and is going to Stanford
or Berkeley in a year.

397
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:58,156
You kept your boys close to you,
no matter what you were involved in.

398
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,551
Who made the better choice?

399
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,976
I hope Cesar
feels like cuddling tonight.

400
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:13,150
- What?
- Governor of the sofa bed.

401
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,359
Wait. What?

402
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:24,535
So...

403
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,621
That was fun, shopping...

404
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:30,741
Trying on clothes...

405
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:33,583
Buying some.

406
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:35,810
That's what we did.

407
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,106
So...

408
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,360
Strap-on...

409
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,821
- How does that work?
- Don't worry, honey.

410
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:06,908
We'll get to that.

411
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:32,140
- What are you doing in here?
- I was looking for gauze.

412
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,018
I needed to change my bandage.

413
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,272
Why don't I help you?

414
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,318
Is that okay?

415
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,055
Are you all right?

416
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:48,116
I didn't think anyone was in here.

417
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,407
There are 7 bathrooms in this house.

418
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:52,454
You don't want Adelita
to know that you shit.

419
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,371
Shut up.

420
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,951
Nasty.

421
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,252
You're reading a book?

422
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,879
Yeah. So?

423
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,759
Can you hurry up, please?

424
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:25,238
Light in here sucks.

425
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:30,198
I'll do the rest myself.

426
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:51,962
Spider goats!

427
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,453
Damn it.
It was your shift.

428
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:57,267
Bullshit.
It was your shift.

429
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:59,394
Jesus. Clean yourselves up.

430
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,189
I have something on my face?

431
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,733
You two idiots want to get back
at mom, right?

432
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:06,819
All right.

433
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:10,281
Let's do this right.

434
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,891
Don't worry.
I'll sleep in the guest room.

435
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,136
When Stevie's old enough,
I want him to go far away from here.

436
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,067
There will be nothing to run from.

437
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,185
I can beat Pilar's clown.

438
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,479
I fucked up my kids.

439
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,899
We'll fix them.

440
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:50,278
I've been reading about formula,

441
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,104
and I've changed my mind.

442
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,078
You should feed him from your body,
keep him close.

443
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,657
He doesn't want my milk anyway.

444
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,516
Maybe Adelita's right.
Maybe I'm... toxic.

445
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:10,833
Sweetheart, you're not toxic.

446
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,677
You're his mother.

447
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:16,822
Come here.

448
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,728
We will be patient,
and he'll take your milk again.

449
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:29,182
Look.

450
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,571
The consultants
set up a Twitter for me

451
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,220
to connect with the people.

452
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:38,827
I already have 3,000 followers.

453
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:43,627
We're opening my campaign office
in Tijuana tomorrow.

454
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,627
Would you come?

455
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,094
Look. Govlover22 thinks
you're hotter than Gavin Newsom.

456
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:58,832
Well, what can I say?
The people have spoken.

457
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,612
- I did what you asked.
- <i>Bueno</i>.

458
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,339
The federal judge.

459
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,488
Already?

460
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,241
You didn't hurt him?

461
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,413
No, he found himself the subject
of potentially embarrassing photos.

462
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,453
Is that a... a pig?

463
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:28,294
Javelina. It's like a pig.

464
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,545
I admire the originality.

465
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:33,049
He'll push the transfer through.

466
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:37,844
He can win this.

467
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:39,596
We can beat Pilar's man.

468
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,475
Look at him.
This is what he's meant to be doing.

469
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,327
Yes, it is.

470
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:09,610
It's okay.
