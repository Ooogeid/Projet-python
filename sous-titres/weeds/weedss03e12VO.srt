00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,860
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,150
Conrad,this is celia.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,450
I fucked a black
man -- conrad.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,840
Just a little something to say
thank you for all your help.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,070
Welcome to your new home,ms.hodes.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,950
We'll have to keep it in the corporation's
name for the first six months.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
I thought dean was out of your life.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,740
He was,till the handitard
went and drove off of a cliff.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,620
The initial surgery was
successful,but he'll need several more.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,490
There's no one else but you.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,610
Oh,god.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,340
I have to sell the majestic house.

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,020
You can't sell the majestic house.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,210
If you try,you'll go to
jail for accepting a bribe.

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,180
How you doing,baby?

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,860
Oh,i'm fucking
pregnant again --

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,950
Some indian kid i
mercy-fucked for u-turn.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,260
God bless the new majestic1

19
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,030
I quit.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,020
Make this easy for me.

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,440
We can do it on the table.

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,930
We need these votes.

23
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,260
I'm thinking a golf membership.

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,980
Your membership's been revoked.

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,030
Sullivan groff and this whole
fucking place can kiss my black ass.

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,410
I'm an elected official1

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,120
You were elected by a
city that no longer exists.

28
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,810
This council is not finished looking into
your questionable investment in aguatecture.

29
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,700
Aguatecture.

30
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,580
You're soaking in it.

31
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,900
You can tell me what goes on here.

32
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,640
Fountains.

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,320
Celia came to aguatecture.

34
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,170
What does she know?

35
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,830
She knows you fucked her boyfriend,

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,860
And she knows you're dealing
again,and she'll be in touch.

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,270
You should be very afraid of me...

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,900
Slut.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,910
I watched you have sex with
the best man i've ever known.

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,120
- You watched?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,720
I've never been able to come vaginally.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,690
How long did you watch?

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,740
I want in.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,600
I want in on your
action,you mean slut...

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,380
Cunt,whore... Bitch.

49
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,500
You coming down with tourette's,celia?

50
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,700
I know everything you're
doing,and i will tell the police.

51
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,500
That would not be advisable.

52
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,140
Not taking my threat seriously
would not be advisable.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,270
Playing by the rules has gotten
me nowhere but fucked,so i am done.

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,700
And you will start paying for
the many,many sins against me --

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,960
In cash,right now.

56
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,210
Okay.

57
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,720
In my line of work,i realize that

58
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,300
i'm susceptible to
blackmail,shakedowns --

59
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,810
Whatever you want to call it.

60
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,770
And up to now,i've been accommodating
the extortionists in my life. But today...

61
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,440
Call it bad
timing,call it karma --

62
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,200
I've reached a
tipping point --

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,440
A critical mass,if
you will. And i'm done.

64
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,300
No more.

65
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,770
So,celia...

66
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,340
If you go to the police...

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,760
If you continue to threaten
me or my family in any way...

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,660
I will kill you.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,990
I will kill you.

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,650
I will end your life.

71
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,410
Mom1

72
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,630
Shane1

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,290
Say hello to mrs.hodes.

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,530
You are a fucking sociopath.

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,660
Thanks for stopping by.

76
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,470
Ou really going to kill her?

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,750
She threatened mommy.

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,740
And we can't have that.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,510
So i had to scare her.

80
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,190
This is kind of how it's
gonna be from now on. Huh?

81
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,550
Yeah.

82
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,090
I think it is.

83
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,630
What are we doing here?

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,140
He promised me golf.

85
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,080
He promised me power.

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,390
Then he bent me over and he fucked me up the ass like
an innocent altar boy alone in the vestry after services,

87
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,520
Lured by promises of juice and cookies.

88
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,460
That's some vivid imagery there,doug.

89
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,580
With his stupid hair.

90
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,520
What grown man has blond hair?

91
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,610
All right,time to go. Come with me.

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,380
- We'll get dean,sell some wacky.
- No.

93
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,450
It's time for doug to
rise from the ashes.

94
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,680
I must reclaim what's
rightfully mine,Andy,

95
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,090
and i must fuck his shit up.

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,050
As god is my witness,i will get him.

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,050
Well,i see you're in the disturbing
throes of revenge-scheming

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,150
And you're not letting go,so
i'm gonna leave you to it.

99
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,330
Catch you later,man.

100
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,510
Victory will be mine,andy.

101
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,580
Dumb name will know my
wrath -- the wrath of doug.

102
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,540
It's comin'.

103
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,750
So,now i come back once,twice a year,

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,430
Get a pastrami on rye down
at langer's,see the kids,

105
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,920
See the grandkids.

106
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,800
Then i can't wait to get
back to my place in maui.

107
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,030
I got a girlfriend --
name is hepualaha'ole.

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,400
Roasts whole pigs in her
backyard. She's crazy.

109
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,270
Anyway,so,i get a call
from the fire department,

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Said they got to do an inspection.

111
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,940
Said they left a bunch of cards.

112
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,380
I said,"come by tomorrow morning."

113
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,420
tomorrow?

114
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,210
Got to be tomorrow.

115
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,360
I'm going back to hawaii tomorrow night,

116
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,110
And i promised them i would
personally let them in.

117
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,460
I got a lot of buildings
down here,ms.James.

118
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,350
I got to stay in good with the l.a.f.d.

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
Tomorrow?

120
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,430
You got some illegals back there,eh?

121
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,340
Hey,everybody does.

122
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,530
It's the way business is done.

123
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,590
Don't worry.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,570
We'll come by in the morning.

125
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,690
We'll be out of your hair by first bell.

126
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,630
No,it's not that. It's just,we,um...

127
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,830
You know,we work with
polymers and resins.

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,010
You box them,you get them out of here,

129
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,510
You pull them back in
as soon as they're gone.

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,650
It's the cost of doing
business,darling. And what is this,huh?

131
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,550
Once a year? It's not so bad.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,270
Anyway,thank you for the coffee.

133
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,260
It was absolutely delicious.

134
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,400
But i'm gonna send you some kona.

135
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,830
And i'm gonna see you in the
morning,bright and early,huh?

136
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,010
I love the,uh...

137
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,620
That didn't take too long.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,990
You charm the slacks
off the landlord,heylia?

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,420
He bringing the fire marshal
in here first thing tomorrow.

140
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,350
We all going to jail.

141
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,140
Holy shit.

142
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,730
Says it's every building,every year.

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Now,how the fuck you
didn't know about this?

144
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,190
How am i supposed to know
about the fire marshal?

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,780
You in charge,big man.

146
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,300
You're supposed to find this shit out.

147
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,910
What do we do?

148
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,450
Don't look at me.

149
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,700
I just work here.

150
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,590
Silas? All right,i'm coming right now.

151
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,690
Mommy's got to go somewhere.

152
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,070
Of course you do. There's an emergency.

153
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,240
- Can i come?
- No.

154
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,760
You suck.

155
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,320
I know.

156
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,040
But one day,i'm gonna
make it all up to you.

157
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,200
I swear.

158
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,650
I'm gonna babysit your kids,

159
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,420
Give you the down payment
for your first house.

160
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,940
I'm gonna send you to
europe after college. Hey.

161
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,140
We'll rent a house at the
beach one summer,take walks.

162
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,510
We'll look back on
this as the dark time.

163
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,890
Where are you taking me?

164
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,620
Therapy.

165
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,930
What kind of therapy?

166
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,080
Special therapy.

167
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,410
Dad,the doctor has you on
a graduated-step program.

168
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,820
- I have your exercises charted
in a binder. - What? - Beer

169
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,370
What kind of therapy requires beer?

170
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,260
Uh,regression therapy.

171
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,360
It takes you all the
way back to high school.

172
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,670
Cold1

173
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,940
You can feel that. Sorry.

174
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,070
And that's excellent.

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,610
I'm happy for you,man.

176
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,300
Take this and give it to the therapist
So she knows what plan you've been on.

177
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,150
We're parking close and partying hard.

178
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,180
- Bye,honey.
- Bye,dad.

179
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,860
- Mom's here.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,440
Like i can wave my magic
wand,make it all better.

181
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,830
We got eight hours till these
need to be back under light,

182
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,830
******To break it all down,find a
new grow house, and set it up again.

183
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,240
So,where we taking it?

184
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,990
Where are we taking it?

185
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm just the buyer.

186
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,330
It's your crop. You pay for it.

187
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,600
Dying plant,coming through.

188
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,890
That's bullshit.

189
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,620
You gave us money. We
planted a crop with it.

190
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,780
The crop is yours.

191
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,470
Can't smoke it yet. I suggest
you find us someplace to move it.

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,180
Oh,so you jump,and i'm the net.

193
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,270
Pretty much.

194
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,840
Kind of strange role
reversal we got going on,huh?

195
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,960
Fuck you.

196
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,460
Fine,but you got to find us someplace
tonight,or we out of business --

197
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,710
Actually,you out of business.

198
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,540
I also need some people who can help,

199
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,040
Not stand there slack-jawed,arguing
about who fucked up.

200
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
Shit.

201
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,750
You got to be kidding me.

202
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,380
Nope.

203
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,960
See that biker chick over there?

204
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,430
She's been eyeing me for weeks.

205
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,840
I sell here all the time.

206
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,950
Hey.

207
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,860
You are using me to get laid?

208
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,350
You've been cooped up in
that house for how long?

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,500
Here's a chance for some
exercise,some socializing.

210
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,150
You'll have fun.

211
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,700
My bones are still healing.

212
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,420
No,no,you'll be fine.

213
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,840
A lot of these guys
got fucked up in iraq,

214
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,050
And they're basically
heads on sacks of numb meat.

215
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,100
But you,you can feel your
lap,so you got total advantage.

216
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,670
Ball in. One more man.

217
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
Got him.

218
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,280
- I-i don't know about
this. - Don't worry.

219
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,740
They'll go easy on
you. They're all high.

220
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,170
Your hospital has got to
understand one thing --

221
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,820
i...Have...No...Money.

222
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,080
Fine.Fine. Turn it over
to a collection agency.

223
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,930
They can take my fillings.

224
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,570
Have a nice...

225
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,320
Fucking day.

226
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,390
- I need to discuss something with you.
- Do it out there.

227
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,860
I'd prefer not to.

228
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,990
If you think i'm gonna let you
into my house after what you did...

229
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,860
See? I have knives,too.

230
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,460
Celia.

231
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,290
I need to rent your empty house.

232
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,050
What for?

233
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,940
None of your goddamn business. But...

234
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,090
I'll make it worth your while.

235
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,910
How worth my while?

236
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,490
3 grand a month.

237
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,880
That doesn't even cover my nut. Fine.4

238
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,270
You want to do something
illegal with it.

239
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,240
- 10
- Okay.

240
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,780
You want in on my action,you got it.

241
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,930
We need a grow house.

242
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,810
Can you deal with that?

243
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,740
And you have to use
this house -- this house.

244
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,020
Your other house is empty.

245
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,600
And it's also in my name.

246
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,430
This house is still under some
sullivan shell-corp bullshit name.

247
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,730
Slut.

248
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,850
Okay.

249
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,810
Do we have a deal?

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,440
I will have all my stuff
out by the end of the month.

251
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,390
No,i need it now,as in right now.

252
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,550
Uh,what about my furniture?

253
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,700
Where do you want it? We'll
move it anywhere you want.

254
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,560
No,fuck it. It's only
rental crap anyway.

255
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,680
Just... Stick it outside.

256
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,890
Hey. Everything comes in here.

257
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,350
All right,if we're doing it,let's do it.

258
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,570
Back the truck up into the garage.
We're loading through the kitchen.

259
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,060
Nice to see you again,celia.

260
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,290
Do i know you?

261
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,120
Probably not.

262
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,530
What the hell?

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,270
- We're moving back to the old house.
- Why?

264
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,190
Because you need to be in a more...

265
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Wholesome environment.

266
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,630
- I'm andy.
- denise.

267
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,640
Andy. Little help.

268
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,150
That's my buddy. I brought him.

269
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,710
Andy?

270
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,490
He's working it out.

271
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,370
He's getting his ass
kicked into tuesday.

272
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,060
Oh,is it getting too hard to watch?

273
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,110
Oh,no,absolutely not.

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,970
Oh,really?

275
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,920
Like a little dirt
in our sandwich,do we?

276
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,680
It's probably about my father.

277
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,140
- He was an amateur boxer.
- Yeah.

278
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,880
I like a little dirt in my sandwich,too.

279
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,180
Probably all about my mother.

280
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,340
She was a terrible cook.

281
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,240
Denise,come on. Let's go.

282
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,200
Got to go.

283
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,830
Wait1 At least leave me
a glass slipper,something.

284
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,930
come on,sis.

285
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,650
239 west hill road. Pick me up at 10:00.

286
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,960
Tonight?

287
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,670
Shit,i have a very
bad short-term memory.

288
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
You don't have a pen,do you?

289
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,290
Oh,sorry,baby. No pen.

290
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,710
Hope to see you later.

291
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,980
Hi. I'm isabel.

292
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,800
Hi,isabel. Vaneeta.

293
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,710
- Heylia.
- Good to meet you both.

294
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,350
- Good luck with your operation.
- Thank you1

295
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,700
Ain't that a nice little girl.

296
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,220
I think i seen her on tv.

297
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,120
- Isn't she that huskeroo girl?
- Yeah.

298
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,840
She look thinner in person.
You think they pad her for that?

299
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,270
Trust me -- they
don't pad her.

300
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,700
Hey1

301
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,920
You the crazy bitch drowned our weed.

302
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,940
What the fuck you doing?

303
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,400
All right,take it easy.

304
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,120
I'm on yo' side now.

305
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,840
Where do you want these,conrad?

306
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,890
Over there.

307
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,940
Clinique,just hear me out.

308
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,670
Ain't nothing to
say,faggot,except "send money."

309
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,350
maybe we should get married.

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,960
Where the fuck is it?

311
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,560
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

312
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,700
What kind of man tears a cross off
the roof of a church,a house of god?

313
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,740
An impressive one,i'm guessing.

314
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,220
That's a big fucking cross.

315
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,130
It's not just a cross.

316
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,570
It's an $80,000 piece of art -- a
nathan arnault original,registered.

317
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,810
So if anyone were to try to
sell it,say,it's traceable.

318
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,950
Hey,i went to bed early tonight.

319
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
Care to join me?

320
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,810
You're cute when you're mad.

321
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,220
You're fucking with the wrong man.

322
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,180
I promise i'll be gentle.

323
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,650
Your wife dumped you.

324
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,310
You're living out of
your goddamn office,

325
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,950
Pulling lame fraternity pranks.

326
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,720
You're pathetic,wilson.

327
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,310
I'll send you a bill
for that bong,sully.

328
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,350
That was handblown glass.

329
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,490
Everyone's taxes are gonna
smell like bong water now. Fuck.

330
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,600
Hi.

331
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,050
Come on in.

332
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,830
This is ripper. Sit.

333
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,350
Hey,ripper.

334
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,230
Please don't eat my remaining toes.

335
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,910
Well. This the guy?

336
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,400
- Andy,meet chess.
- Hey.What's up?

337
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,400
All righty.

338
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,980
Ah,look.

339
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,730
He's got a card.

340
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,930
Ah,okay.

341
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,630
Okay. That's cool.

342
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm cool,unarmed,pro-gun control.

343
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,680
What's going on?

344
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,660
Hey,chess,would you like some?

345
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,680
Or is this disapproval
that'll morph into ass-kicking?

346
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,190
Please tell me you want to smoke out.

347
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,650
Ripper,come here.

348
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,170
Yeah,you got a good grip there?

349
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,760
- Where do you get it?
- Where do i get it?

350
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,410
Downtown.

351
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,210
I buy downtown,corner
of pico and alvarado,

352
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,810
from different guys,whoever's
on the corner --

353
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,390
A guy named pablo,a guy named ortiz.

354
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,290
There's ramon,too.

355
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,590
Ramon's got a scar across his
forehead -- knife wound,self-inflected.

356
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,590
So the story goes.

357
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,050
Pablo plays mandolin --
same song over and over.

358
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,140
- Maybe i can save you a trip.
- Really?How's that?

359
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,670
Denise...

360
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,150
Hold ripper.

361
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,520
Come here. Come here.Sit.

362
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,930
Denise,new friend of
mine,what the fuck is going on?

363
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,440
Don't worry. It's all cool.

364
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,120
Hey,look at that.

365
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,790
So...

366
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,920
You want to buy from me?

367
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,770
You know,i'm good right now,but
if i'm ever running low...

368
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,350
I'll tell
you what --

369
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,180
why don't you let mrs.Botwin know
it's available if she's interested?

370
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,290
I mean,after all,we're local.

371
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,580
It's the right thing to do.

372
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,950
Right,yeah.

373
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,730
Makes perfect sense. I'll tell the boss.

374
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,760
Okay. You can go now.

375
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,400
- But,uh...
- Denise will call you.

376
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,290
She thinks you're funny.

377
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,910
Okay,then.

378
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,660
- This was fun.
- Ain't done yet.

379
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,450
Got to get rid of that generator,

380
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,290
Figure out a way to tap the power lines,

381
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,270
Surround the house with
rosemary,lavender --

382
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,770
Ward off the smell.

383
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,310
We got a whole fucking
load of work ahead of us.

384
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,390
Can't we just move them back
after the fire marshal comes?

385
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,830
Not for at least 2 weeks.

386
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,830
We lost 20 in the move.

387
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,210
This here's like a halfway
house for traumatized plants.

388
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,610
Got to let them relax awhile.

389
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,100
You can use my crew if you want.

390
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,870
Might have to.

391
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,610
Don't know how the family
gonna take to commuting.

392
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,740
Heylia gets carsick.
Vaneeta's got road rage.

393
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,120
There goes our road trip to las vegas.

394
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,200
What about you? You okay?

395
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,910
- You need a place to sleep?
- Sleep?

396
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm a black man living on a golf course.

397
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,210
I'm about to spark up
the barbecue,make mojitos.

398
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,410
How's silas doing?

399
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,240
Boy's gifted.

400
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,240
Got a future if he
chooses to go this way.

401
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,970
Yeah.

402
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,420
Do you think i'm a bad person?

403
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,530
I don't think you're a bad person.

404
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,140
No?

405
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,930
No.

406
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,050
Thanks.

407
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,750

408
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,230
You're fucking evil.
