1
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:05,249
- I'm making a buy.
- You come back with five figures,

2
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:06,422
and we'll do business.

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,616
Any chance I could borrow $10,000?

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,180
I know an accountant/councilman

5
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:12,785
with access to a certain
civic investment portfolio.

6
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:13,918
Make it $50,000.

7
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,589
Summer reading from internal affairs.

8
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:18,095
It appears Pete was the brains

9
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:21,255
behind the skimming,
extortion, wiretapping.

10
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:24,832
Good thing for us he turned up the way
he did, and we don't have to get honest.

11
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,982
- How's tim doing?
- How do you think he's doing?

12
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,395
- His father's dead.
- Are you free for dinner tomorrow?

13
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,342
- Who's your friend?
- Peter's ex-wife.

14
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:32,930
Are you fucking insane?

15
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:35,600
- I thought dean was out of your life.
- He was...

16
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:38,311
Until the handitard went
and drove off of a cliff.

17
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:39,624
is he going to be okay?

18
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,412
The initial surgery was successful,
but he'll need several more.

19
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,609
We are getting a divorce.

20
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,485
There's no one else but you.

21
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:47,784
Oh, God.

22
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:50,698
Sanjay, your territories are
colleges, junior colleges...

23
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,909
And gay bars and dance clubs.

24
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:55,250
Tara's completely active in the church.

25
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:57,791
The Lord wants me to sell pot,
Ms. Botwin.

26
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:59,023
Fine, you're in.

27
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:00,458
Do I get a cellphone, too?

28
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:02,255
Yeah. Take Silas's.

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,670
I'd like my phone back.

30
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,005
I have other plans for you.

31
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,224
Teach him to grow.

32
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,653
All right, Nancy. You want your boy
to be my bitch,

33
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:10,204
he'll be my bitch.

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,510
What we need is to redirect
a small portion

35
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,388
of our sewage through your town.

36
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,501
Shit highway could be
our road to riches.

37
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:17,724
We need these votes.

38
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,185
I'm thinking a golf membership.

39
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:21,265
- Your membership's been revoked.
- What?

40
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,481
God bless the new Majestic!

41
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,941
Holy shit!

42
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:26,317
That's a lot of sewage.

43
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,297
That motherfucker...
I'm gonna have him killed.

44
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,654
Weeds - Season 3 - Episode 10

{special thanks to :}

48
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,760
From the boys at sigma alpha delta.

49
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,932
Thank you, Sanjay.

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,098
You may have another.

51
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,519
The youth pastor is a wake-and-baker.

52
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,024
Holy smokes.

53
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,715
Thank you.

54
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:54,572
Why is this all wet?

55
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,120
Water park.

56
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:09,844
That's $20,000.

57
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:13,357
The way things are going, I'll
have the rest in a few days.

58
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:14,500
Why is this stack wet?

59
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,088
Water park.

60
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:19,102
So, all the money goes back
into the Agrestic account.

61
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:20,662
No trails back to us.

62
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:24,851
There's no more Agrestic, Nance.
No town. We're good.

63
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,682
- Let's keep it.
- Doug.

64
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:30,816
I might be a drug dealer,
but I'm no embezzler.

65
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,819
We'll put it back... Eventually.

66
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,869
Until they figure out which way is up,

67
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:38,364
we could use this capital
to our advantage.

68
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:40,803
Yeah.

69
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,943
I'm not comfortable with this.

70
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:46,447
Well, get comfortable.
Buy more drugs, sell more drugs.

71
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,080
And then when we're crazy rich,

72
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,128
we can pay back Agrestic and buy
corn dogs for all of Darfur.

73
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm not sure corn dogs are first up
on the wish list in Darfur.

74
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,755
My point is, we need this capital

75
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,379
if we're gonna be the weed-mart
of the San Fernando Valley.

76
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:03,087
Homegrown depot. Potco.

77
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,127
You need to trust me on this, Nancy.

78
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,873
I don't tell you how to move a brick.

79
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,640
Fine.

80
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,565
For now.

81
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:13,573
Listen, Doug, a word of advice...

82
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,470
Watch your back.
Sullivan's on the warpath.

83
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:16,999
I didn't do anything.

84
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,365
So you had nothing to do
with that pipe exploding?

85
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,118
That was clearly an act of God.

86
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,844
Well, tell god to watch his back.

87
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,142
Nancy, don't anthropomorphize god.

88
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,200
That sounds like fun.

89
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,406
Tim and Shane together?

90
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,231
We could give it a shot.

91
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,306
Yeah, I know where that is. Great.

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,069
Terrific. All right.
We'll see you there. Bye, Val.

93
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,058
You got a call.

94
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,903
From who?

95
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,645
Roy Till.

96
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,230
I don't know Roy Till.

97
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:52,486
Roy Till knew you.

98
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,452
And what did Roy Till want?

99
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,987
I asked Roy Till that very question.

100
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,655
Why are you making me
work so hard for this?

101
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,408
Because Captain Roy Till
is with the D.E.A...

102
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,818
Because he wants you to come down
to his office as soon as possible...

103
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:09,958
Because he said you've probably
been expecting this call.

104
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:16,596
That was my reaction.

105
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:20,206
<i>The side effects
may be urinary incontinence,</i>

106
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:22,633
<i>migraine, fuzzy vision, rapid heartbeat,</i>

107
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,310
swollen limbs, depression, mania,

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,725
nocturnal psychosis,
erectile dysfunction...

109
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,874
Wake up.

110
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,547
It's not a dream.

111
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,160
Here's his feeding schedule.

112
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:36,077
And the physical-therapy
exercises are in the binder.

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,638
- You gonna have to change his diaper.
- Stop...

114
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:40,672
... speaking.

115
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,723
Fine. Figure it out yourself.

116
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,953
I have no memory of giving birth to you.

117
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,973
None whatsoever.

118
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,602
There is no god.

119
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:03,094
You have to change my diaper
so I don't get a rash.

120
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:07,097
Not gonna happen.

121
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,251
I stood by you when you had cancer.

122
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:13,362
Yeah... My cancer didn't stink.

123
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,230
Celia, if I get a rash,
it could get infected,

124
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,736
and my body can't fight off
infection right now.

125
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:23,824
Will you die?

126
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:25,647
Worse.

127
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,834
I'll have to have a lot more surgeries,

128
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,330
and you'll have to take care
of me for a longer.

129
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,872
This is not right.

130
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,794
After we change me,
we should do some exercises.

131
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:41,246
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

132
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,551
Seeing me miserable.

133
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:48,222
It's the only silver lining
on a very dark cloud.

134
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,049
I'm looking for Roy Till.

135
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,216
Nancy Botwin.

136
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,216
Am I in the right place?

137
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,490
Captain Till's been waiting for you.

138
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,072
That's her.

139
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:26,690
I have questions.

140
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,670
- You do?
- Sit.

141
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:39,940
I see you don't use the name Scottson.

142
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,478
Uh, no.

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,974
Kids... Kids are Botwin.

144
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,824
Keeping it... consistent.

145
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,619
You and Pete kept your marriage
awful quiet.

146
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:56,625
Why?

147
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,433
- Do I need a lawyer?
- Frankly, I'm a little surprised

148
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,279
you didn't come clean to us
about this sooner.

149
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:07,308
- Why's that?
- So you could get what you have

150
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:08,634
coming to you.

151
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,765
Why don't we settle all this right now?

152
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,478
And "all this" would be?

153
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,720
Life-insurance check
made out to Nancy Scottson.

154
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,481
Shouldn't be any trouble to cash

155
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,080
if you show the bank a copy
of the marriage license.

156
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:26,854
Also, forms to fill out so...

157
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,813
we can start sending you
his pension checks.

158
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,245
Look at that.

159
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,747
Things from Pete's desk.

160
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,877
That should close the book on all this.

161
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,797
Again, "all this"?

162
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:48,920
We don't know what Pete told you
and what he didn't.

163
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:50,260
Frankly, we don't care.

164
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:53,101
What he was involved with when he died,

165
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:55,599
who he was involved with...
It's all in the past.

166
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,112
We'd rather think the best of him.

167
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:59,748
I'm sure you would, too.

168
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,994
- The best.
- But should it not remain in the past,

169
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,718
well, that would seriously
affect his pension.

170
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,540
Do you understand what I'm saying?

171
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,300
Yes... Completely, totally.

172
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,886
- That's all, Mrs. Scottson.
- Botwin.

173
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,718
Mrs. Botwin.

174
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,508
God bless you.

175
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,184
My condolences.

176
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,446
You are the sun. You control it all.

177
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,735
If you don't keep a light
schedule, seeds will sprout

178
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:49,176
and reach for whatever source
of light they can find.

179
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,701
Not too different from humans,
but that's another lecture.

180
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,353
Point is, you didn't put
the grow light on a timer,

181
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:57,829
so these went toward my light,
made them spindly.

182
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,966
These seeds were your responsibility.
You fucked them up.

183
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:03,234
Sorry.

184
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:07,508
Things okay at home?

185
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:09,574
Are they ever?

186
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,324
Mom okay?

187
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,560
She's a... tough read.

188
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,014
Yeah, I know.

189
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,351
And what happened here?

190
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,627
Brown spots, yellowing moving upward.

191
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,456
Think.

192
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,847
- Um... nitrogen deficiency?
- And what do you do?

193
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,805
Add a solution with
a high "n" rating, like...

194
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,153
advanced nutrients connoisseur?

195
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,487
- That's right.
- Ha!

196
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,080
"ha!" my ass,
you plant-killing motherfucker.

197
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,606
You should have got it right
the first time. Pay attention.

198
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,230
No one is going to take care of you
in life, Silas. Learn and grow.

199
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,874
Move!

200
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:57,366
Save those plants!
That's money out of my pocket!

201
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,178
Oh, shit. That reminds me.

202
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,372
It's from my mom.

203
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,696
She wants more stuff.

204
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,951
Yo, it just slipped your mind

205
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:13,945
that there's thousands of dollars
in your fucking backpack? Jesus.

206
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,268
Damn. I also forgot
there's a diamond up my ass.

207
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:19,215
- You want it?
- Take care of my plants

208
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,953
before you find a foot up there.

209
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,130
Tell your mom I said hi.

210
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,281
Yeah.

211
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,136
Hey.

212
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,456
Tell her, all right?

213
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,230
Sure.

214
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,735
So, let me get this straight.

215
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,483
You say we're going to the apple store,
but instead,

216
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,735
you bring me here and force me to play
with Peter's asshole son

217
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,966
so you can hang out with his ex-wife?

218
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:44,174
Do I have this right?

219
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,150
Uh... yeah.

220
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,534
So not cool.

221
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,013
I'm not proud.

222
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:51,541
You owe me.

223
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,843
It might be fun.

224
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,299
Fine. Debt owed. Let's go.

225
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,537
You think that's funny, dickbag?

226
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,357
That's not even a word, dildock.

227
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,189
I'm not sure this was such a good idea.

228
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,785
They'll be fine.

229
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,643
Uh, blue raspberry or cherry?

230
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,698
- Cherry.
- Oh, wait a minute.

231
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:15,248
Think you owe me some money.

232
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:17,451
Oh. How much?

233
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:19,999
$119,000.

234
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,080
I was gonna tell you.

235
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,583
You <I>married</I> him?

236
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,204
Married -- did that just,
uh, slip your mind?

237
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,435
How do you fit that into a conversation?

238
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,819
"uh, hey, guess what, val?

239
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,979
"before you go down to the DEA's office

240
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,372
"and make an ass of yourself,
let me tell you something.

241
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,526
Peter and I were married."
There. Pretty simple.

242
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,287
It was a drunken weekend.

243
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,307
Completely stupid,

244
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,198
only-on-nine-cosmos kind of thing.

245
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,676
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

246
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:50,672
Well, then how about the fucking money?

247
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,778
I didn't even know
I was getting any money.

248
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,785
Yeah, well, you got it,
so give it to me.

249
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,567
That's Tim's money.

250
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,758
I don't want the money. I'm giving you
the money. Look. Here.

251
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,308
Take it.

252
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:06,111
Just putt, asshole.

253
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,716
It's made out to you.

254
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,709
I'll endorse it over.

255
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:14,715
You can't endorse a $119,000 check.

256
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,098
I'm not stupid.

257
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:17,754
Let's go to the bank.

258
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,900
It's Sunday. Banks are closed.

259
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,105
Then we'll... Deposit it tomorrow.

260
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:26,367
I'll transfer it over,
and you can declare it a gift.

261
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:28,117
It's not a gift.

262
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,832
I lived with that asshole for 11 years.

263
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,206
I earned that.

264
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:34,796
Okay. Bad choice of words.
It's your money.

265
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:37,438
Give me a break already.

266
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,495
You were gonna tell me?

267
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,103
Sure, eventually.

268
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,135
Putt now or die!

269
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,410
Yes! Hole in one.

270
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:53,807
Your son is annoying.

271
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,733
Oh, glass-house-dwelling person...

272
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,730
You're right.
I'm putting down the stone.

273
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:03,838
You want the slushy now?

274
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:05,094
That's okay.

275
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,265
Oh, come on. The ugly, confront-y part
of the day is over.

276
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,274
We're free to have treats now.

277
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:13,139
Why did you have to assume the worst?

278
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,382
I'm used to getting fucked.

279
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:18,285
Well, get over it.
Neither of us is getting fucked.

280
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,469
Poor us.

281
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:22,625
No shit.

282
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,237
Jeez. You ever hear of a phone?

283
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,797
Dana took the charger. I need $100,000.

284
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,908
Majestic is checking the books tomorrow.

285
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:45,679
I bought 10 more bricks.

286
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,034
Putting it back in the business, you
remember that conversation?

287
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:53,031
Oh, god. Me in prison.
I'm way too long for those beds.

288
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,538
And the food --
There is no sushi in prison...

289
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,888
Unless you count dick.

290
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,344
Okay, listen.

291
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:04,010
Why do you need $100,000
if we only took $50,000

292
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,795
for the initial buy?

293
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,639
- Did we take more than $50,000?
- We took $50,000,

294
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:11,250
but I knew it was only a matter
of time before we doubled up,

295
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,364
so I took another $50,000 for my divorce
lawyer and got laser eye surgery.

296
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,098
Recovered in a day -- Fucking miracle.

297
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:19,212
Now I can read the tiny print they use
for warning labels on pills.

298
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,332
Big pharma fucks us coming
and going, Nance,

299
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,483
and I'm going to prison.

300
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,709
I'm going to prison
while big pharma roams free.

301
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,118
There is no justice.

302
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,180
Are you on some big pharma right now?

303
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,763
If I go to jail, will you come with me?

304
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,672
I cannot do it alone.

305
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:35,514
You're not gonna go to jail, Doug.

306
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,433
I might have access to some money.

307
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,638
Have you been hoarding money from your
accountant? 'cause that is not cool.

308
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:45,145
Doug, go upstairs, take a bath.

309
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:47,927
I suggest you try the bath bomb.

310
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,878
The carbonation's delightful.

311
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:51,686
All right?

312
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,353
We'll figure this out.

313
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,864
She never lets me> use the tub, lucky.

314
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:59,234
- I'm going to jail.
- You're not going to jail, Doug!

315
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,648
I'm going to have all kinds
of cock shoved up my ass.

316
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:06,042
I need to say something out loud.

317
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,083
I killed peter.

318
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,577
Did you hear what I said?

319
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,961
Yeah, I heard you. You killed peter.

320
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,332
We all knew that U-turn story
was bullshit.

321
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,899
I guessed poison. Was I right?

322
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:33,916
Silas thought you smothered him
in his sleep.

323
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,931
Shane had some wild theory
about you and a samurai.

324
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,034
My whole family thinks I'm a killer.

325
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,148
You just said you killed him.

326
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:46,012
I didn't actually kill him
or have him killed.

327
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,649
I'm saying that if he never
met me, he'd still be alive.

328
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:50,398
Listen...

329
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:53,839
I taught Stephanie Cooper
how to give head.

330
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:59,778
She died when a guy she was blowing
drove into a swamp.

331
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,563
That doesn't mean I killed her.

332
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:04,213
It means I was
a great teacher...

333
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,061
And he was a bad driver...

334
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:08,942
And the alligators
were hungry.

335
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,902
I got peter's life insurance
and pension money.

336
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,837
- Jackpot.
- No.

337
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,068
I promised it to Valerie
and to Doug.

338
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:21,661
I don't know what to do.

339
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,990
If I don't give it to Doug,
he goes to jail.

340
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,957
If I don't give it to Valerie,
I go to hell.

341
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,993
Jail comes before hell.

342
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,906
Or you could give it all
to me.

343
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,497
Sullivan.

344
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,349
I'm not Sullivan.
I'm the easter bunny.

345
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,286
You want your basket?

346
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,766
Just wait, wait, wait a minute.
Just a sec.

347
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:51,829
I want to freshen up.

348
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,454
Collect my eggs.

349
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:02,728
Celia?

350
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:06,228
You make any noise,
so help me god,

351
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,679
you will be sitting
in that diaper...

352
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,388
For a week.

353
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,630
I'm so impressed by you.

354
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:33,829
Your kindness.

355
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,173
Dropping everything
to take care of a man

356
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,165
you don't love
because he has no one else.

357
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:47,404
- You are the most selfless woman.
- I am.

358
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,250
- I'm wonderful.
- Yes, you are.

359
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,170
- Let's go to the bedroom.
- No.

360
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,427
Fine, fuck it.

361
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,204
- What is that?
- It's the dog, Dryer.

362
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,700
- Okay, it's him. Come on.
- He's in there?

363
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:14,597
He's safer there.
Can't hurt himself.

364
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:16,756
Wait, where you going?

365
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,839
Maybe we ought to take
a little break. Huh?

366
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:28,915
I'll call you.

367
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,145
Thanks for that, celia.
Doggy got a big bone.

368
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:42,824
Little close there, kiddo!

369
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,534
Still hating me.

370
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,132
He's very committed.

371
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,630
- What's this?
- That... That is cash.

372
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:59,076
- It's not $119,000 in cash.
- It's $4,500.

373
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,248
Where's my money?

374
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,403
I have the money.
I just don't have it here.

375
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,559
- This is a down payment.
- I knew it.

376
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,554
I had a little emergency.
You're gonna have it back in a month.

377
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,300
This is a scam, right?

378
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,869
You don't understand.
There's money coming in.

379
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:16,488
No worries.

380
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:19,568
No worries?
I have cards maxed out.

381
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:23,139
I have creditors calling me.
I can't make my rent.

382
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:26,218
I can't wait for money to come in.
I need it now.

383
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:28,356
Jesus.
Why are you in such bad shape?

384
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,814
I've been spending on my cash
on coke and man whores.

385
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:34,552
Why the hell do you think? I work
a middle-class job in the bush economy.

386
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,475
Where's my fucking money?!

387
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,823
It's fucking coming!

388
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:40,086
You spent it already,
didn't you?

389
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,123
That was <I>my</I> money.

390
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,398
Fucked.

391
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:48,850
Fucked, fucked.

392
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:51,820
Not fucked.

393
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:54,510
Just fucked in the head.

394
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,957
Clearly not ready to listen,
so I'm gonna go.

395
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:03,752
I'll call you.

396
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,940
<i>mom, she took my ball!<i>

397
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,011
Fuck your ball.
She took our 100 grand.

398
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:16,788
First of all, Mr. Wilson,

399
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,287
we would like to thank you for
the t-shirts that you brought us

400
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,012
from the 2001 agrestic
5k thanksgiving fun run.

401
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,581
I drew that logo,
The turkey with the sneakers.

402
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,966
That's quite a talent,
mr. Wilson.

403
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:32,137
However, we're here to discuss
the town of Agrestic's financial records

404
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,095
- Not funny t-shirts.
- Of course, Ann.

405
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,283
May I call you ann?
I'm getting divorced.

406
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:41,651
There seems to be an outstanding
loan here, councilman Doug,

407
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,102
made to a company
called aguatecture?

408
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,863
Yes. Yes, there is.
And I have the repayment of that loan

409
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,813
right here in my back pocket.

410
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,136
This is a post-dated
personal check.

411
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,946
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- This is highly unorthodox, Mr. Wilson.

412
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,067
Yes. Yes, it is.

413
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,209
And you're claiming that this
is repayment on the loan to aguatecture.

414
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:04,833
Yes. Yes, it is. You see
the memo line right there?

415
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:07,262
It says, "for aguatecture."
It's a great little business.

416
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,385
A socially responsible,
minority-owned company

417
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:14,520
that makes fountains shaped like houses,
victorians, tudors, even castles.

418
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:15,921
Heartwarming story.

419
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:20,798
Hardscrabble, good people,
invested with our hearts, and paid off.

420
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,940
They're selling like bratwurst
in germany.

421
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,267
Praise the lord.
Hallelujah with the grace of the god.

422
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,811
So be it, amen.

423
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,755
Oh, brother.

424
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,064
Amen.

425
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,841
My wife's a fountain freak.

426
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:37,182
- She'd love those.
- Yeah, where can I get one?

427
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:40,137
I'll hook you all up.
Fountains for everyone. At cost!

428
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:41,591
Thank you!

429
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:51,930
Crust, please.

430
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,933
Thank you.

431
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,901
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I quit.

432
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,749
- Bullshit.
- Not bullshit.

433
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:57,151
- Look at how you treat me.
- How I treat you?

434
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,558
I haven't had lunch.

435
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,572
I left three messages saying
I wanted soup and a cobb salad.

436
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:04,732
So fire me instead.

437
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,190
But I like you.

438
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:11,754
You're a shitty assistant,
but your skin's like milk,

439
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,315
and you're almost as smart as I am.

440
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,698
If you make this easy for me,

441
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:19,037
let me steal all
the office supplies I want,

442
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,576
we can do it on the table
before I go.

443
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:24,381
You would have been a killer
in business

444
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:27,130
if you hadn't pissed away
all your potential on the mommy track.

445
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:30,024
Yeah. I guess
it wasn't meant to be.

446
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,037
Look at you, anal.

447
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:37,030
Shouldn't you just sweep everything off
and ravage me like a rela man?

448
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:41,098
I spent the whole day
organizing this shit.

449
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:49,188
- You bitch !
- Oh yeah, I'm bad. Punish me!
