2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:08,923
My partner is dead.

3
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,719
I'm gonna get this guy,
and I'm gonna kill him.

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,012
He was my partner.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,056
- Oh, holy shit.
- The Tijuana police?

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,475
- Don't enjoy this.
- We should flee.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,935
- And I love you.
- Take Shane up to my sister's.

8
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,356
- She banged Uncle Andy.
- Asshole.

9
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,358
Do not make me go back there.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,108
Everyone hates me.

11
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,779
- Where in the fuck am I?
- You're in Texas, ma'am.

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,946
- Mr. Sandusky.
- I need some pot.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,867
I want to open a store.
Medical marijuana.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,286
- Doug is helping me.
- We can't approve your application

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,432
without the consent
of a law enforcement official.

16
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:42,291
You guys want to sell drugs?
I'm gonna want my cut.

17
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:44,669
You will lie back
and show there is a baby

18
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,295
that is both male and mine.

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,965
You remember Sucio?
He will watch you now.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,758
- Where is Sucio?
- There was blood.

21
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:53,426
Get yourself to a safe place.
Wait for my call.

lesfumistes@gmail.com

24
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:15,537
What are we doing here, Nance?

25
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,105
Big Buffalo Blast.

26
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:21,333
- That's said right on the thing.
- No, here. Family Fun Bowl-O-Rama.

27
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm out of tokens.

28
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:26,848
I bowled seven full games,
I'm being recruited for leagues, so...

29
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,557
I want to go home.

30
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:31,854
You shot a bunny.

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,409
I don't think you're supposed
to blast the bunny.

32
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:35,553
Or the owl.

33
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:38,795
When Esteban calls,
we can all go home.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,698
Then you'll be free

35
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,893
to sit your sister-fucking ass
down on the couch,

36
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,050
get high,

37
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,975
schedule your post-sister-fucking
jerk session

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,943
wherein you'll relive the many pleasures
of fucking my sister.

39
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,107
I see what's going on here.

40
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,829
- Don't. Just don't.
- What?

41
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,512
Fine.

42
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,759
You're jealous.
You're pissed about Jill.

43
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,596
You don't need to wait
for Esteban to call, ergo...

44
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:09,947
- Ergo...
- Ergo...?

45
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,041
- It's not about him, it's about me.
- Really?

46
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,325
- That night in the car?
- That was for the cops.

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,320
- The passion!
- I was trying not to pee in my pants.

48
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:20,104
- Enough!
- You tried to hide your feelings.

49
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,219
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

50
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:23,267
So kiss me.

51
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,056
Go away.

52
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,140
You like me.

53
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:34,570
You like me like me
and that's why you don't want to.

54
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,220
Baby, Andy.

55
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,339
Baby, baby, baby.

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,660
Another man's baby.

57
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:47,998
Another bunny.

58
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,507
I hope that she falls down
a flight of stairs.

59
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,426
This thing is happening
whether we like it or not.

60
00:02:58,497 --> 00:02:59,540
Shit.

61
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,598
- You don't want a pink bear anyway.
- Fuck the bear, I want to win.

62
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,893
Time to go, Esteban's meeting us.

63
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,645
So we do get to meet baby daddy.

64
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:09,647
Be nice or say nothing.

65
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:18,823
I've brought you this.

66
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,576
Those are awesome shirts,
I wish you brought three.

67
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:27,387
So you're the mayor of Mexico
or something?

68
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:30,030
Or something, yes.

69
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:34,046
And you stuck your penis
inside my mother. At least once.

70
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,589
Okay, then. Good night, Shane.
Go upstairs.

71
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,092
You sure it's safe up there?

72
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,261
What happened
to the smelly guard dog?

73
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:44,682
Cesar believes he mixed up
his medications and wandered off.

74
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,976
I mixed Benadryl

75
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,579
and Tegretol one time,

76
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,768
spent three days guessing weight
at the Iowa state fair,

77
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:55,539
got crabs and a tattoo... of a crab.

78
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,946
So he just wandered off
naked and bleeding?

79
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,865
I am told
that's happened before, yes.

80
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:05,661
In that case, thank you for giving him
a gun and the keys to our house.

81
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,621
How about moving into my house?

82
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:17,463
- Did you just ask me to live with you?
- In Tijuana?

83
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,634
Even the donkeys are scared
and that's a fun place to be a donkey.

84
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,414
I own a house here,

85
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,493
in Santa Playa.

86
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:30,019
There's plenty of room.
Room for the boys and...

87
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,146
even room for him.

88
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,647
I'm good actually here.

89
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:35,983
Me too.

90
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:39,111
I think it would be best...

91
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:42,865
Yeah, well, you're not the mayor of us.
And these shirts are lame.

92
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,658
Go to bed, now.

93
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,335
Come on, tough guy.

94
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,652
Nice to meet you.

95
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,472
- You didn't answer my question.
- This is our home.

96
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,849
And where's our home?

97
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,517
Where is this coming from?

98
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:15,997
I received the test results.

99
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:18,633
It is indeed a boy.

100
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,109
My boy.

101
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,740
I see. Your boy.

102
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,305
God, look at the time.

103
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:33,247
We should go to bed,
let this poor guy leave.

104
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,380
Ignacio!

105
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,543
Another guard dog.

106
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,589
- Ignacio will watch over you for now.
- You know what?

107
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,007
I can do the watching,
I'm an excellent watcher.

108
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,511
Right, you and your crabs.

109
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,015
This is for you, Nancy.

110
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,796
"Now and Zen,

111
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,087
"Baby Cradle and Swing?"

112
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,648
It's a little early, don't you think?
I'm not even showing.

113
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,640
I can feel him.

114
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,164
Look at this guy. He's a gorilla.

115
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,157
He's a thug.

116
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:14,077
I mean, take away the...

117
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:19,205
the muscles, the fiery eyes
and the cold heart of a killer,

118
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,462
what does he have that I don't have?

119
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:26,217
I call him Mr. Zappy.

120
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,138
Great, now he's wet himself.

121
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,523
That happens.
I'll get him a towel.

122
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,994
You're gonna love this swing.

123
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,167
Only the best for our boy.

124
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:40,845
Our boy.

125
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,431
"Nothing is exactly as it seems."

126
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,609
"Nor is it otherwise."

127
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,552
What?

128
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,719
It says so right on the box.

129
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:00,961
Smoking in the eco-garden.
Way to raise the bar.

130
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,715
I need to top off my feed bag.
How much jolly green can you get me?

131
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,470
- How much can you spend?
- Four grand.

132
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,739
You have four extra grand?

133
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,139
Unions really
are ruining this country.

134
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:16,892
I got "Choosing Chastity"
in the science room till 5:00,

135
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,351
so I'll meet you after.

136
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,273
That abstinence only bullshit?
Blow it off.

137
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,930
Can't, if I split before the movie ends,
the hamsters get raped with Sharpies.

138
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:29,270
Fuck, fuck.

139
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:31,314
The nesting phase.

140
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:33,994
Am I race-biased

141
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,413
- or is this a new Mexican bodyguard?
- Brand new.

142
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,621
The cat is Milo.

143
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,312
The dog is Otis.

144
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,204
The cat is crazy
and the little dog just follows.

145
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,455
Right.

146
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,677
So, I'm gonna go now.

147
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,367
Good luck.

148
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,565
Have you seen Andy?

149
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,244
He's in the garage, working out.

150
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:01,313
Jump, little dog, jump!

151
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,901
Just in time to support me.

152
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,373
Is this 'cause you pissed yourself
last night?

153
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,241
No... Yes. Anyway, he cheated.

154
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,161
I could use your help
with my zen baby erector kit.

155
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,263
Big showdown coming, Nance.

156
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:23,338
High noon.

157
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,212
I can feel it in my bones.

158
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,508
Where did you get the box o' pain?

159
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,184
What? This is my stuff.

160
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,589
It's my athlete stuff.

161
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:37,342
It's Judah's.

162
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,818
He was good at sports,
I was good at fleeing.

163
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:42,626
I have a bodyguard.

164
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,232
I don't need you to crush my foes
in your armpit.

165
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:49,903
What do you need from me?

166
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:54,633
The doorbell is barking.

167
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:56,801
You look like...

168
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,968
Jamie Lee Curtis in <i>Perfect</i>.

169
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,831
You do, kind of.

170
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:07,963
Good, just so you know,

171
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,998
that's what I was going for.

172
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,106
What a wonderful surprise.

173
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:28,983
- Really?
- No.

174
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,450
Not wonderful, not a surprise.

175
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:35,116
- Do you want to come in?
- Thank you.

176
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,327
It's you.

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,472
You, you, you.

178
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:48,215
It's complicated.

179
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,506
Is that a suitcase?

180
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,382
Yes, it is.

181
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,003
- Listen, I've been thinking...
- You can't stay here.

182
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,096
You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

183
00:09:58,637 --> 00:09:59,598
I was kidnapped.

184
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,611
Yes, thank you so much
for the ransom.

185
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:06,523
They were gonna sell my gall bladder
to the Japanese.

186
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:10,192
Fortunately, my body is a toxic pit.

187
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:13,977
And I escaped.

188
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:15,492
Heroically.

189
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,074
And now, I am homeless.

190
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:21,662
I'm pregnant.

191
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:25,374
- With a baby?
- Yes, with a baby.

192
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,209
Which means

193
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,604
I need quiet.

194
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:31,862
And calm and... Thank you.

195
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:35,476
And happy thoughts around me
as much as possible.

196
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:39,388
And you, Celia, are not quiet.
Not calm.

197
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:43,183
You are so terribly,
miserably, thorougly unhappy

198
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,520
that if I pricked your finger,
you'd bleed a fucking rain cloud.

199
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:50,440
Is it Andy's?

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Come on.

201
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,548
Nobody puts baby in the coroner.

202
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:22,097
This place,

203
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,575
perfect for any business.

204
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,637
There's plenty of room.

205
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,175
Location's great.

206
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,428
Not so eager.

207
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,609
- You gotta Jew these slopes down.
- Please don't do that.

208
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,877
You want the fish?

209
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,445
Buy the fish.

210
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,449
Don't squeeze the fish.

211
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm not squeezing the fish,
I'm sniffing it.

212
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,570
I've every right to sniff the fish
if I'm gonna buy it.

213
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:47,497
- Or rent it.
- We'll take it.

214
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,951
What kind of business
you got anyway?

215
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,377
It's a compassionate care club.

216
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:54,796
That gym for fat ladies?

217
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:57,591
Medical marijuana, actually.

218
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,014
You sell pot in here,
Feds take away my building.

219
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,349
Yeah, well... you eat dogs.

220
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,395
Get the fuck out, ass-whore.

221
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:18,653
Push the seat-back tube down
until it snaps into place.

222
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,331
Snap, snap, snap!

223
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,392
Plastic demon from hell!

224
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,108
Mommy needs to get drunk.

225
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,341
He looked little.

226
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,527
But he's heavier than a sea turtle.

227
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,154
What was he doing out there?

228
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,307
Looking the window.

229
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,492
Maybe waiting
to come to the house for you.

230
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,578
- What was he gonna arrest me for?
- No arrest.

231
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,721
That's very unsanitary.

232
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:29,695
No badge.

233
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,857
Today, he's no cop.

234
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,051
Today, he's Rambo.

235
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:38,762
Wake up.

236
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,193
Remember me?

237
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,862
Angry little <i>princesa</i>?

238
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,091
Help me get him into the bathroom.

239
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,368
- What are you gonna do?
- Put him in the tub.

240
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,454
'Cause he peed his pants, right?

241
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,130
I'm going to burn his clothes,

242
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,458
drain his blood,
and melt his bones with acid.

243
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,830
All right.

244
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,294
Help me.

245
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,139
Not in my tub.

246
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,305
What's that thing supposed to be?

247
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:09,848
Domestic bliss.

248
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,267
Looks like someone
shit out a Tilt-a-Whirl.

249
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,325
You're the moral center of this family,
let me ask you something.

250
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,945
Is it okay to impersonate
your dead brother

251
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,943
and pseudo steal some money

252
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:25,184
if you're gonna use the cash
for the family's greater good?

253
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,194
His passport is upstairs
in my sock drawer.

254
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,345
If I were you,
I'd wear a hat or something.

255
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,330
Resemblance is sort of thin.

256
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,464
And that would be a thumbs up!

257
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,728
Good stuff.

258
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:39,794
What you doing
with all the smokable product, there?

259
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,671
Selling it to my English teacher.

260
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,926
For the family's greater good,
of course?

261
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,763
The family that tried
to ship my ass to Oakland?

262
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:50,680
Sure, think that.

263
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:56,016
Despite the enormous
hypocritical elephant in the room,

264
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,462
I feel compelled to express alarm,

265
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:00,236
and potentially dismay,

266
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,538
and fear that Silas will kill you.

267
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,476
And regret...

268
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,005
that your true North

269
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,674
moral compass is...

270
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,844
gone on the fritz.

271
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,798
What can I say?

272
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,073
I'm a Botwin.

273
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,872
We're not responsible
for anything we do.

274
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:27,758
I order you to release me.

275
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,089
I am a Federal Agent

276
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,314
and this man is wanted
by the U.S. government.

277
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,223
You untie him, he'll kill me.

278
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,059
You have no badge, Roy.
You're out here all on your own.

279
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,727
I'm under cover.

280
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,897
- What did you do to Sucio?
- Who?

281
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,728
The dirty Mexican.

282
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:45,860
- Sorry.
- It's true. He stinks like pig shit.

283
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,362
He killed my partner.

284
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,468
Were you gonna hurt me too?

285
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,595
He's going to kill you, and me.
He's a killer.

286
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,115
Not me, I'm nice.

287
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,122
Untie me, I kill him,
we go watch <i>Milo and Otis</i>.

288
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,284
No one is killing anyone.

289
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,713
Stop kicking each other.
I'm gonna make you pee your pants.

290
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,127
- Whose side are you on?
- She's on my side!

291
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,618
She making baby with the boss.

292
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,472
What's it like, fucking a monster?

293
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,601
Don't make fun of my child!

294
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,383
You can't keep us here,
like this, for long.

295
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,147
Who's it gonna be?

296
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,609
Hello, Nancy?

297
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,503
Make a sound, I kill you both.

298
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,448
You got a boner!

299
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:42,500
It's a perfectly normal reaction
to the adrenaline of combat.

300
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,336
No, no, no. That's not cool, man.

301
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,256
I don't wanna fight no more
with you.

302
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,278
Okay, well,
the door was open so I just...

303
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,963
Not exactly open, but ajar.

304
00:16:57,078 --> 00:16:58,778
Mostly, it was unlocked.

305
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,779
I've been thinking,
I know you said I couldn't live here,

306
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,607
per se, in house proper,

307
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,005
but it is Southern California,

308
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,530
and you do have
that nice screen porch, out there.

309
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,658
With a couch.

310
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
So...

311
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,328
That's fire.

312
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:20,705
Okay, you know, take it easy.

313
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:23,212
Nancy, God!

314
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,670
Hang on a minute.
Okay, Final Net Extra Hold.

315
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,090
This is cotton,
I'm highly flammable, right now.

316
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,133
You know what, you're crazy.

317
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,439
You are fucking crazy
and I hate you!

318
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,539
We'll just talk later.

319
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:51,228
186,437.96?

320
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,946
That's right, Mr. Botwin.

321
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,948
Judah, call me Judah.

322
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:57,534
Well, Judah. I haven't seen
one of these in a long time.

323
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,961
That little collector's item there

324
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,112
was given to my brother and me,

325
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:06,251
we both got one,
this one is mine obviously,

326
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:07,998
when my great-uncle Yetzok

327
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:11,606
tripped and accidentally locked himself
in a freezer chest.

328
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,576
Interesting side note,

329
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:16,118
it's still the only case
of hypothermia in Woodland Hills.

330
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:17,243
Anyway,

331
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,079
it was a lot of money
for a youg boy,

332
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:22,517
but I was smart enough
to put it aside for a rainy day.

333
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,648
Unlike my stupid brother

334
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,720
who blew his on a 72 Ford Econoline

335
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,774
when he needed a place to live
one summer.

336
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,584
God, I bet he wishes
he didn't do that!

337
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,349
Especially with the amazing growth
on that account.

338
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,450
What an asshole.

339
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,077
Actually,
the growth has been average.

340
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:44,205
Your grand-mother has been adding to it
for almost thirty years.

341
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,681
That bitch!

342
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,863
I mean, it saddens me

343
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:51,938
that she would so blatantly
favor one grand-son over another.

344
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,190
Now,

345
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,384
about the hold
that you put on this account?

346
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:57,901
Listen,

347
00:18:58,244 --> 00:19:00,558
I don't know what sort of bullshit
he's trying to pull,

348
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,593
but you tell Judah he's gonna have
to come in here and talk to me

349
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,393
before he's gonna see
dime one of this.

350
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,134
I have been waiting
a very very long time

351
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,566
to say my peace to Judah Botwin
and, by God, I'm gonna say it.

352
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,500
Now, get him in here.

353
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,117
Judah died.

354
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,625
He's dead.

355
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,544
Fast cars,

356
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,922
roden rapes, summers off.

357
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,150
To be you...

358
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:58,065
You think life is your own private
little joke, don't you, Botwin?

359
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,692
You know who else used to think that?
Your parents.

360
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,494
Before you showed up
and shit all over their dreams.

361
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,934
No, nothing shits
on my mom's dreams.

362
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,333
Least of all me.
And my dad's dead, but nice try.

363
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:14,559
Get in, we'll settle up
and I'll give you a ride home.

364
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,594
To be you!

365
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,068
Why can't you just walk away?

366
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:31,105
Why can't you go home?
Forget about all this.

367
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,170
Nothing to go home to.

368
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,733
Nothing

369
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,191
and no one.

370
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,152
Not anymore.

371
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,657
I know it's soon,
but have you thought about dating?

372
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,076
He wouldn't be who you had, but

373
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,161
there's someone else
out there for you.

374
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,500
My ugly cousin Paulo.

375
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,585
He made himself
a fuck doll from a tyre.

376
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,987
- Someone or something.
- You have to choose, Nancy.

377
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,379
Who is it gonna be?

378
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:02,658
I let him go, he kills you.
I let you go, you kill him.

379
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:05,714
- I can't have that.
- Come on, mummy. Pick your favorite.

380
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,517
Cause you're right, I'll kill him.
That's what I'm living for.

381
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,311
See? I tell you.

382
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,354
Or he'll kill me
without blinking an eye.

383
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,232
And then stuff his face and watch
movies like nothing happened.

384
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,192
- That's true too.
- Choose.

385
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,695
I can't.
I'm bringing a child into the world.

386
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,755
I'm not ready to sit here and...

387
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,907
play Buddha and be fucking zen
about who lives or dies.

388
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,158
So we'll ask the magic ball.

389
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,973
Tell me, magic ball.

390
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:45,053
Can these two men part in peace
and live to kill another day?

391
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,357
Go on and shake your magic ball.

392
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,726
Tell yourself you're so noble,
because we're both still breathing.

393
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,605
You've got blood on your hands.

394
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,652
Just sign here and here.

395
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,655
Month to month, three months down.

396
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,866
Well no, I was thinking twelve-month
lease with two months down.

397
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,829
- Fine.
- I'm really glad you changed your mind.

398
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,123
He beat up my cat.

399
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:16,654
I like your style.

400
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:18,586
Just sign the fucking paper already.

401
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:23,773
We're in business.

402
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:25,308
- Partner.
- Partner.

403
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,642
Partners.

404
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,930
Faggots.

405
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:33,072
He was my first.

406
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:36,277
My first boyfriend, my first love

407
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:38,898
and my first... you know.

408
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,583
Then he went away
and my life became a bucket of shit.

409
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,320
Well, I feel your bucket.

410
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,584
I thought that was pretty smart
pretending to be Judah.

411
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,509
State taxes probate,
drain the whole account.

412
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:53,085
Well,

413
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,304
maybe you can help me out.

414
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:59,502
I don't know. I could get fired.

415
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:02,517
Of course the bank
is closing anyway.

416
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,572
Downsizing, recession.

417
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,666
You sort of look like him.

418
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,745
You have the same kind eyes.

419
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:15,833
Tell me more about my eyes.

420
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,182
All right, here is the deal.

421
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:25,862
You go out with me,
and I'll get you into that account.

422
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,010
I was gonna ask you out anyway.

423
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:32,135
Only has to be as Judah.
You're Judah and I'm me.

424
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:35,084
You have to love me
and treat me nice.

425
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,356
Well, there's nothing weird
about that.

426
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,003
Yeah, sure, Margaret.

427
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:43,614
Whatever you say.

428
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:46,006
Max. Judah calls me Max.

429
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,193
Are you all right?

430
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,370
As I see it, yes.

431
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,380
It is certain,

432
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:13,418
it is decidedly so,

433
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:16,056
most likely, outlook good,

434
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,711
signs point to yes, without a doubt,

435
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,667
reply hazy, try again,

436
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,295
ask again later,
better not tell you now,

437
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,242
cannot predict now,
don't count on it,

438
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,384
my reply is no,

439
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,834
my sources say no,
outlook not so good,

440
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,113
very doubtful.

441
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,750
So, no.

442
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:45,942
Not all right.

443
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:03,626
What's gonna happen in there

444
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,563
is not right or wrong.

445
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:09,238
It's not good or bad.

446
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:11,268
It is.

447
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,101
It's what happens next.

448
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:23,805
We chose,

449
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:26,334
you and I.

450
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:29,267
When we came together, we chose.

451
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:32,241
A life.

452
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,573
This life.

453
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:36,659
For you, for me, for our son.

454
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:39,744
There is nothing

455
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:42,785
I would not do to protect that life.
