1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,190
Previously on "weeds"...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,210
you are so beautiful.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,270
You are like a mermaid.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,090
- Maria mermex.
- S?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,880
We could bring her back
here if we were coyotes.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,880
Ihola! Welcome to america! Happy
days. Have you seen this girl?

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,550
I have found the man you're looking for.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,900
He calls himself...

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,300
El Andy.

10
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,290
Moses wasn't half the coyote I am.

11
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,866
This is what my people ate
as we wandered the desert.

12
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,785
I will lead you now.

13
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,627
You shall be a free people!

14
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,633
Estados unidos!

15
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,192
How do you know so much about weed?

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,123
It's my business.

17
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:41,270
I'm fucking a teenage drug dealer?

18
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,062
Soccer shoe. Soccee.

19
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:47,012
- The preggies keep coming.
- We call it f˙tbol.

20
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,341
Igol!

21
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:53,090
- That's your mom.
- What? No!

22
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,471
Hi, mrs. Botwin.

23
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:58,690
Honey, why are you hiding sammy
davis' autobiography behind your back?

24
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:02,143
Who's the king of the school?
The most popular, most athletic?

25
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:04,283
I'm dan.

26
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,470
Don't fuck with me.

27
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,432
- Are you hungry?
- I'm starving.

28
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,011
Boss is taking you to lunch.

32
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,123
Yes, you are.

33
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:43,560
You're bailing on me again.

34
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,963
You should just hang up
now so I can order a pizza.

35
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:50,061
Ahorita, mi amor, I
apologize, but duty calls.

36
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,222
- What are you, batman?
- Yes.

37
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:56,713
Cesar is alfred. I'll make
it up to you, okay? Tomorrow.

38
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:59,902
Do you like lobster? I have a boat.

39
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,820
This is the third time you've canceled.

40
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,432
Not canceled
-- postponed.

41
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:07,753
And you broke a date last tuesday.

42
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:10,452
Well, three beats one.

43
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,740
Some girls might take
that the wrong way.

44
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:16,830
Yeah. But you're not
a girl. You're a woman.

45
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:22,052
An incredibly sexy woman

46
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:26,711
who tastes like white chocolate
when I nibble inside her thigh

47
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:32,602
and run my tongue down her
perfectly smooth, slippery...

48
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:39,230
Ya voy. I'm sorry. I-I'm running
late. I really have to go.

49
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,351
You suck!

50
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:45,231
Tomorrow night. You'll eat
lobster, and I will eat you.

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,792
Yes, you will.

52
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,220
What's this?

53
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:56,110
New grow house.

54
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,611
Grow room, actually. You
have a date or something?

55
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:01,691
No. I'm just... no.

56
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,112
Smells like you have a date.

57
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:05,202
When did we decide you
were gonna move your plants?

58
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,460
Uh, something kind of fell into my lap.

59
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:12,470
Does this something have anything to
do with your mysterious sleepaways?

60
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,141
You noticed?

61
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,520
I thought you were too
busy not going on dates.

62
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,262
Hey, nance.

63
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:22,942
did you get stood up again?

64
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,292
No, I
d-- no.

65
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,180
Smells like you got stood up again.

66
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,911
Perfume and frustration.

67
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,560
But, hey, I'm simpatico.

68
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:37,092
I know why the caged bird sings,
nance. It hurts. The bird hurts.

69
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:41,301
I can be back later with cheetos and malt balls
if you want to get high and listen to my cry tape.

70
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:44,270
Didn't I tell you to move out?

71
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,592
- I'll paint your toenails.
- Maybe.

72
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,053
Where exactly is this grow room?

73
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:56,270
Back of a cheese shop.

74
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,162
Great cover smell.

75
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,500
- Cash or credit?
- Credit.

76
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:12,393
All right. Uh, that'll be, um...

77
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:17,063
$164... and 17 cents.

78
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:20,821
You know, we give discounts for cash.

79
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:26,050
- I only have, like, $37 in cash.
- Done.

80
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,262
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,241
Tell your friends.

82
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,590
Thanks.

83
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:43,602
System's down. It'S... cash only.

84
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:47,930
In this hour, we're gonna
examine a sense of moral justice.

85
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,790
Everybody knows that sometimes
you feel something is right,

86
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:53,610
and sometimes you feel
something is wrong.

87
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,752
Morning, buddy.

88
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,932
Just shaving here.

89
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,653
Taming the whiskers.

90
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:20,202
Those dirty whiskers.

91
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:27,562
Go get 'em, champ. Public education
-- cornerstone of democracy.

92
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,860
The hat.

93
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,602
Oh, buddy.

94
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,821
Oh, no.

95
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,181
So, each plant will yield less.

96
00:05:57,227 --> 00:06:03,542
But because I'm packing so many into such a
small space, the overall harvest goes way up.

97
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,781
The "mr. Botany" thing? It's hot.

98
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:09,451
Bigger harvest means bigger bucks.

99
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,633
Means I pay you back faster.

100
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,442
Maybe we should get
another one of these.

101
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:19,070
- I got a customer.
- I have a boner.

102
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:22,711
Come on.

103
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,472
- You must be rad's mom.
- Yeah. Lisa.

104
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm nancy. Silas' mom...

105
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,180
nancy. Hi, silas.

106
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,300
What are you doing here?

107
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:38,681
Want to make sure you're not...

108
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,260
doing anything stupid.

109
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:45,681
Like... trafficking
with the mexican mafia?

110
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,780
- Can I go back there?
- No.

111
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,980
I would suggest building,
um, a fake wall --

112
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:01,110
something the health
inspector won't mess with.

113
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:05,571
Also, mature plants tend to smell
a lot more than moldy blocks of cow,

114
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:06,513
so you'll
need better --

115
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,363
ventilation.I know.

116
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:14,673
And don't let him leave advanced
nutrients empties around or in the trash.

117
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,001
- It's a big tip-off.
- I know what I'm doing.

118
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,802
You don't know what you're doing.

119
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:23,753
You're growing pot with your...

120
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:28,332
Your girlfriend in a cheese shop.

121
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:33,023
I-I won't let anything happen to him.

122
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:36,393
Because you know what you're doing?

123
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:39,711
Because you're a mom and
you worry about amber alerts

124
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:42,160
and the internet and
the catholic church?

125
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:44,883
You're fucking my
17-year-old son.

126
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,840
Mom.

127
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:51,330
Rad's gonna be 17 sooner than you think.

128
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,200
He's a good-looking boy.

129
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:13,082
All right. Do me up.

130
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:15,292
- I sold you an eight ball yesterday.
- Yes.

131
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:19,591
And thank you very
much. I need another one.

132
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:23,370
See? Cash.

133
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:25,330
- No more for you.
- Excuse me?

134
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,482
You're not good.

135
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:27,922
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

136
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,260
- I told you I'm fine.
- Not fine.

137
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:36,292
Give me the fucking... Blow.

138
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,060
Okay, brace yourself. Deep breath.

139
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:53,140
"Yes I can"? You said I was gonna
freak out. I was thinking gun.

140
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,670
Page 96.

141
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,190
You don't think he'S...

142
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,231
oh, yeah. He's, uh...

143
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,420
are you sure?

144
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:15,466
He's absolutely. I'm
100% positive he'S...

145
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,625
you got to talk to him.

146
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,107
Not this time.

147
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,001
This is way outside my kink zone.

148
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:27,161
- Shane. My baby.
- I know.

149
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:30,141
Silas is fucking rad's mom.

150
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,581
I know, right?

151
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:37,310
It's a world gone mad.

152
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,121
He's gonna notice they're gone.

153
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:46,331
I can't let him -- that's
me, he'S... that's me.

154
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,203
You're right. Take the
pictures. Confront the situation.

155
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,150
Deal with it head-on. Yep.

156
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,362
Fuck!

157
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,611
Or make peace with it. Let it
slide, you know? Boys will be boys.

158
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,123
You ever do
this when you --

159
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:01,771
no fucking way!Thank you,
god! My mom was not hot.

160
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:05,073
Flappy upper arms, strange moles.

161
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:09,141
Why couldn't he have had a gun?

162
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:15,011
Ichingado!

163
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:29,352
Cocaine. øCoca?

164
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:34,222
øEl dolce de... nosey? øSnorty?

165
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:37,701
All right... want to fool around?

166
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,362
What happened?

167
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,770
I had to take a shit.

168
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:42,301
And this is what came out!

169
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,842
No, mames. øQuieres que me maten?

170
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:50,141
Vamos con que ahorita vamos.

171
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:53,450
{\a6}<i>Have you seen this girl?</i>

172
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:53,452
S? Es marÌA.

173
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,852
Please be sure.

174
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,050
I'm very vulnerable right now.

175
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,583
Very sensitive.

176
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes. I know her well.

177
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,613
God bless you. Can you take us to her?

178
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,551
If I feel like it.

179
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,731
Don't tease me, you crusty whore.

180
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:13,340
I think she wants you
to grease the wheels.

181
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,162
Okay.

182
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,672
Shot of tequila for the
sweet, old lady here.

183
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:22,841
- Now can you take me to her?
- No.

184
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:27,260
Listen, you cock-juggling thundercunt.

185
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,992
There we go.

186
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:35,012
Come. That way. I will take you to her.

187
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,112
That's more like it.

188
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,800
I got butterflies.

189
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,800
Yeah, just be yourself, doug.

190
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:44,863
And try not to call her a thundercunt.

191
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,393
Grandma's got wheels.

192
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:58,342
We don't run. We're americans.

193
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,853
Oh, shit.

194
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,260
It is time to pay, cabrÛN.

195
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:10,283
That's the bad coyote belt-stealer guy.

196
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,810
The one who tried to rape
reyna and stab me in the neck.

197
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,020
I pictured him taller.

198
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,283
I will shoot your knee
and shoot your balls.

199
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:20,981
I will shoot your belly and
feed you to the sewer rats.

200
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,391
Does that mean that i can go?

201
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,453
Okay. Okay. Okay.

202
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,543
I'm sorry, man.

203
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:30,833
This is so not cool. My last
meal was a bowl of chile peanuts.

204
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,943
El andy... is a good man.

205
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:44,500
He has brought much happiness
to our familia and our friends.

206
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:49,020
He will not die this day. You will die!

207
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,292
Okay, okay!

208
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:56,840
Hang on here, guys.

209
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:00,082
The way of el andy...

210
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,172
is the way of peace.

211
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:05,191
And creature comforts.

212
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:09,372
Just walk away, mr.
Coyote. Or limp away.

213
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,750
And limp in peace.

214
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,521
We will not harm you.

215
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,713
I just did the whole peace speech.

216
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,830
That was hector.

217
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,671
He no speak english.

218
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,130
She is crazy

219
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:29,572
She should be loked in crazy jail.

220
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,703
With crazy people.

221
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:31,871
I completely agree.

222
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,572
She's bat-shit insane.

223
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,312
She has snakes in her head.

224
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,502
She got a good heart.

225
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,530
Nancy: She fucked up, and she's fired.

226
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:43,451
But let's face it. We
all fucked up, okay?

227
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,423
Kung pao made me piss out of my ass.

228
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,461
Could happen to anyone.

229
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:53,032
But can we just agree to keep
all of our fuck-ups to ourselves?

230
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,380
øS? No cesar. øS? Okay?

231
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,851
I did not fuck up.

232
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:03,210
øquieres cosas? Shit.

233
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,902
la ropa en la store...

234
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:12,301
j-just please ask him if he'd like to take
anything from the store for his troubles.

235
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:16,372
La patrona quiere saber si quieres
una ropita por tus molestias.

236
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,870
Viejas gordas y rencorosas.

237
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:23,131
He says that the store is for ladies
who hate men who made them fat.

238
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,552
Doesn't he have a wife or a girlfriend?

239
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:30,421
Somebody he wants to impregnate?

240
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,633
øTienes una guerita
que qued? embarazada?

241
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,462
Pues, mi hermana.

242
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:38,872
His sister.

243
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:41,351
Is pregnant by her husband.

244
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:45,191
Great. Okay, well, why don't you take a bag
and fill it up with some stuff from the store,

245
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,501
and we'll just forget
this ever happened, okay?

246
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,732
You want me to take care of her?

247
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:53,332
Yeah, go ahead. Maybe I'll wear
something fun to her funeral.

248
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:57,622
Shut up. I'm taking you home.

249
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,803
Okay. Come here, honey. Let's
clean that pretty face of yours.

250
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:06,621
It's me. I can't make it tonight.

251
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,392
This is not a spite cancelation.

252
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:13,323
I have a very sick child on my hands.

253
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:17,791
Tomorrow night? Please?

254
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:27,341
This is not the first
trouble with Nancy.

255
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,281
Problems with Guillermo.

256
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,993
Problems with her people and the tunnel.

257
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,151
She is dangerous.

258
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:39,552
No. No. No.

259
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,452
She is impulsive.

260
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:43,501
She is reckless.

261
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,022
But she is not dangerous.

262
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:48,151
She is putting you at risk.

263
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,723
Really?How?

264
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,721
She is making you reckless.

265
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,631
Did you show her your lion?

266
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,132
Make me a fucking drink.

267
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:08,933
What would you like?

268
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:12,333
Something dangerous.

269
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,483
Something reckless.

270
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,640
With a twist.

271
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,781
Sweetie...

272
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:02,640
uh, sweetie, um...

273
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:05,563
I want to talk to you about, um...

274
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:09,592
I'm just... I'm just...

275
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:11,432
I'm just...

276
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:15,161
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

277
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,792
I think it's a little, um...

278
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:19,311
I don't want to say "weird."

279
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:23,692
Maybe another word for "weird" without
all the weird connotations of "weird,"

280
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:28,192
like "peculiar,"
maybe, or "eccentric"...

281
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:31,100
or how about "quirky"?
Okay, it's quirky.

282
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,772
It's a little quirky to masturbate
to pictures of your mother --

283
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:39,242
to have this sexual kind of relationship

284
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:45,270
or connection or hook up with
a stand-in for your mother.

285
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:50,160
You may think it's okay because this
woman isn't actually your mother.

286
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:54,431
Because these photographs don't necessarily
look like me since you know me as me now,

287
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,992
not me as me then.And,
according to freud,

288
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:02,733
a lot of people want to have sex with their
mother or substitutes for their mother,

289
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:07,952
and it's normal in the planning
stages, but it should stop there.

290
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:13,611
And I realize there's a lot of hormonal
compulsion, some of it beyond your control,

291
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,730
and it's nothing terrible or unnatural

292
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:20,612
or anything we need to
talk about in gory detail.

293
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:24,070
Because sex...

294
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:29,050
sex is good, freud said --
or annie sprinkle maybe said.

295
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:33,541
Sex is great, and you should
have sex safely with your peers,

296
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:37,502
like megan or tara or
playboy or penthouse or juggs,

297
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,581
if you're so inclined to
that particular body part.

298
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:42,863
You should go ahead, fantasize about
having great sex with these people,

299
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,450
but you should probably avoid the areas

300
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:49,212
which include having great sex with your
mother or a substitute for your mother.

301
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,463
And, I mean, things, you know,
happen. It's understandable.

302
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,171
She's blonde. She's got a cheese store.

303
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:58,210
You hide them in a sammy davis jr.
Biography. Who's gonna look there?

304
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:01,122
It happens, but it
shouldn't happen anymore.

305
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,520
And we can swear
-- and I do swear

306
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:08,890
to never, ever, ever
speak of this again.

307
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,360
Well, then...

308
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:21,782
okay, then.

309
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:25,781
We'll just...

310
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:40,920
So, tell me about this boat.

311
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:50,893
Okay. Well... no.

312
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,023
Some other time, then. Okay. Bye.

313
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:16,433
Mom? Mom?

314
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,163
Mom, are you shooting heroin?

315
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:31,623
It's restylane. I-it's for my lips.

316
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:35,320
That needle was sticking
out of your forehead.

317
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,811
Yeah. It works there, too.

318
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:42,122
Not really. You need help.

319
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:47,100
Okay. I'll hold out my
lip, and you put it in.

320
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,683
I'm calling dad.

321
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,112
I'm fine.

322
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,271
Here comes psycho.

323
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,890
There he is.

324
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:03,921
I hear he killed his dad.

325
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:05,861
I think he's mexican.

326
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:09,220
Tolan said he made a
necklace out of dan's teeth.

327
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:11,511
My brother saw him in gym class.

328
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,871
Huge dick.

329
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:14,543
Did you see his limo and his bodyguard?

330
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,123
Mucho fucked-up.

331
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:17,802
- His eyes, too.
-Yeah.

332
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,730
Look, look, look.

333
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,453
Hey, there.

334
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,010
Do you party?

335
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:37,130
Yeah. I party.

336
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:44,600
I mean, you saw her the other day, and
now she's pretty much losing her shit.

337
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:48,123
Oh, well. This can't be easy for her.

338
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,650
You have no idea who
you're talking about.

339
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:52,971
You know what? It doesn't matter.

340
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:56,933
Clock strikes 18, and
I'm done with all of it.

341
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:02,412
Here you go. Greatest american hero.

342
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:04,290
Patch here works at the airport.

343
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:07,290
Big smokers in baggage.
Could be some nice business.

344
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,381
Bulk discounts. And we cater.

345
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:10,642
Oh, right on.

346
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:14,052
And I want you to know I bought
a vaporizer for this shit.

347
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm honored.

348
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:19,941
Well, you inspire me.
Truly. I might write a poem.

349
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,103
Later.

350
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,053
Bon appÈtit.

351
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:27,071
This is totally gonna work! Sandwiches!

352
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,890
We should move in together.

353
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:51,573
Before I say anything, I just want
to say this is completely unexpected.

354
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:57,853
coyote-ing has been a passion
project of mine for a few weeks now.

355
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,150
But I didn't do it alone.

356
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:05,191
It takes a village...
to smuggle a human.

357
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:10,781
And when I see myself up on the wall...

358
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:16,350
I smell the breath of every
sun-stained face I've liberated.

359
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,292
I, uh -- it's, uh --
it's, uh... I'm at a loss.

360
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:22,452
Uh, dos gatos for everyone!

361
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:27,053
And dos dos gatos for my friend, doug!

362
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:33,841
Thank you, raul.

363
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,483
- El andy.
- Yes, sir?

364
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,721
What is wrong with your tall friend?

365
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:41,192
A cloud of sadness hangs over him.

366
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:46,400
The man is in love
with a beautiful notion.

367
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,282
Must be nice being el andy.

368
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,800
Things are awesome for el andy.

369
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,633
Sucks being el doug.

370
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,343
Come on, compadre.

371
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:09,282
We're in mexico chasing a dream.

372
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:12,250
When's the last time you chased a dream?

373
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:14,142
I'm a sidekick, andy.

374
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,963
I'm a sad and lonely sidekick.

375
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,883
I'm andrew ridgeley.

376
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:20,483
What? He's the other guy in wham!

377
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:24,361
The guy who doesn't blow people in
public bathrooms. He had a solo album.

378
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,673
I never bought
it, but --

379
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,741
I bought it, andy.It sucked.

380
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:33,931
El andy... this is the woman
your depressed amigo searches for?

381
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:36,333
People don't even talk to sidekicks.
It's like I'm not even here.

382
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:37,572
That's the one, raul.

383
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:41,311
We will help the sad, tall,
angry, baby man find her.

384
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:44,870
- Thank you.
- You're welcome,El andy

385
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:55,250
and you forget your pruning shears?

386
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,711
Lisa and I have, um...

387
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:08,413
decided to slow things down
and nurture ourselves more --

388
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,922
replenish our reserves
of... oxy... tocin.

389
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:20,412
You got anything that
needs to be washed?

390
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,602
No

391
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:30,092
well...feel free to...

392
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:35,443
raid the fridge, take
the car, play your...

393
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:38,550
music too loud.

394
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,472
Thanks, mom.

395
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,803
You okay?
