00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:17,692
{special thanks to}

5
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,715
Well? I'm waiting.

6
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,308
- If you'd...
- Keep your body still.

7
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:07,576
Move your lips.

8
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,140
Make sentences.

9
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,455
What are those lines?

10
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,239
You'll get a full diagnostic
report from the doctor.

11
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,453
But you know.

12
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,923
You have a week to live.

13
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,314
- That's not funny.
- Tickled me.

14
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,421
What the fuck
are you doing here?

15
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,304
You want to get
some coffee or something?

16
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,987
You're an insane stalker person.
Why would I go anywhere with you?

17
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,134
To talk, to explain.

18
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:35,156
And...
Sorry if I freaked you out.

19
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,449
And I swear I'm not dangerous,
and I'll buy.

20
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:42,717
Latte, cookies, you name it.

21
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:46,781
You're gonna keep stalking me
unless I do this, aren't you?

22
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:50,663
I can't answer definitively
yes or no at this point.

23
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,799
There's a place across the street.

24
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,402
I'll meet you there
in an hour.

25
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,223
Great. That's great.

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,687
- What?
- Could you release the hounds?

27
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,217
- No.
- No?

28
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:06,411
I'm gonna send in another tech
to do your side angles.

29
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:08,840
Might as well
finish what you started.

30
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,478
Ok. Let's make this quick.

31
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,766
It's fucking hot, out here.

32
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,435
- Don't you love coffee?
- Yes, I do.

33
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,767
I love coffee, slept with Peter,
just like you.

34
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,899
We must be long-lost twins.

35
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:41,620
I have those
same earrings at home.

36
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,910
They're nice.

37
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,902
How's... Tim doing?

38
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,238
How do you think he's doing?
His father's dead.

39
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:53,008
I have boys too... two boys.
Dead father.

40
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:57,892
Heart attack, though,
not, well, however Peter died.

41
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,398
Is Tim seeing
a grief counselor?

42
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:03,302
Shane went, but I don't know
if it did anything.

43
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,293
I guess time and...

44
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,431
This is my break,
and you are not my friend,

45
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,934
so why am I sitting here?

46
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,226
Don't you want to talk
about Peter?

47
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,376
Not with some random woman
he was fucking,

48
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,755
who my son hates.

49
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,317
I used to think that
it was because

50
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,980
he wanted Peter and me
to reconcile,

51
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,912
but now I'm thinking
it's because

52
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:25,537
you're a crazy,
stalker, narcissist whackjob.

53
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:30,546
I started sketching again.

54
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:35,035
Jesus, I do sound nuts.
I'm not.

55
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,300
You're right,
this is all ridiculous.

56
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,458
I don't know what I expected.
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:43,416
Nice meeting you...

58
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,992
Even though
you are kind of a bitch.

59
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,643
Bye.

60
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,471
Here. You can throw it away
if you want, Ok?

61
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:09,966
I have two questions.

62
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,407
One, why isn't
the air-conditioning on?

63
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:13,923
I don't think it's working.

64
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,117
And Shane, can I play
brickbreaker on this thing?

65
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,034
Those are for
business purposes only.

66
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:24,238
Sanjay, your territories are colleges,
junior colleges, trade schools...

67
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,336
And gay bars and dance clubs,

68
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:27,698
'cause I'm a faggot.

69
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,991
I can call myself that
but you can't,

70
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:31,857
'cause I'm gay, and you're not.

71
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,926
I'm not ashamed.
This is who I am.

72
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,059
Good for you.

73
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,255
I'll sell to anyone cool who
wants some weed. I'm flexy.

74
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:41,571
Don't be too flexy. Remember we
start with people we've dealt to before,

75
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,099
and we only expand when
a customer has been vouched for.

76
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:46,314
You're forgetting
one key territory.

77
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,671
Hi, Silas. I'm gay.

78
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,339
You can get help for that.

79
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,340
Oh, I know. This guy Stuart's
been really helping me.

80
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,340
Stuart's the best.

81
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,600
Silas, why don't we talk
about this after Tara goes home?

82
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,942
This is about Tara.
Hear me out.

83
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:04,337
Tara is completely
active in the church,

84
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,460
and they have,
like, 10,000 members.

85
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,380
It's a totally
untapped market.

86
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,578
They say when christ
was anointed with oil

87
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,010
by John the baptist,
it was cannabis oil.

88
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,053
That sounds hot.

89
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:20,432
The Lord wants me
to sell pot, Mrs. Botwin.

90
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:21,845
- Really?
- Yes.

91
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,394
And he also wants me
to buy a new BMW...

92
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,555
Preferably the convertible.

93
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:29,812
The good christian people
of Majestic like to get baked.

94
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,003
That explains so much.

95
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,834
Shane,
would you get that, please?

96
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:35,938
So, am I in?

97
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,001
I promise I'm gonna be
your number-one salesperson.

98
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:43,229
- You work on straight commission.
- Fine.

99
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,131
- Never say where you get your product.
- Never.

100
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,125
You realize you're
doing something illegal?

101
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,190
I answer to
a much higher authority.

102
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:54,790
Fine, you're in.

103
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,304
Do I get a cellphone, too?

104
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,041
Take Silas's.

105
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,978
Then how am I supposed to
cover my territory?

106
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,097
You don't. Delivery requires
discretion, which you clearly lack,

107
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:09,339
so I'm gonna think of
something else for you to do.

108
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,225
Someone named Valerie is here.

109
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,070
She says
she wants to talk to you.

110
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,263
What am I doing here?

111
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:23,406
I wanted to apologize
for acting like an asshole.

112
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,088
No, that was fair.

113
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:28,028
I mean... I did stalk you.

114
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,179
Tim's in the car...

115
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,136
I got your address
from your mammogram papers,

116
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:37,368
drove over...
Drove by the house a few times.

117
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,941
Your neighbor on the corner
is really into gnomes, huh?

118
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,140
Did you call before
and hang up?

119
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,743
- Twice.
- Crazy stalker person.

120
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,298
- Call it even?
- No, I'm having you arrested...

121
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,041
Restraining order, the whole thing.

122
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Little shit. All right,
look, I got you this.

123
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,630
It's a bath bomb -- Effervescent.

124
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:01,833
My advice is to let it bubble
between your legs.

125
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,074
The carbonation effect,
it's really enjoyable.

126
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:07,073
And it smells nice.

127
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,878
- Thanks.
- Just take it. I'm an overgifter.

128
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,108
Not a big deal. Oh, well...

129
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,403
I'm gonna go.

130
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,681
Thanks for the bath thing.

131
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:21,645
Oh, and your boobs are fine -- Benign.

132
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,594
Fine and benign.

133
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,283
Aren't you glad I'm not a proctologist?

134
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,230
Well, you have short fingernails

135
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:30,814
but a lot of anger, so...

136
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,447
Okay, I'm gonna go smack my kid

137
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,809
and take him to the shrink.

138
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,934
Oh, hey, um...

139
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,452
Are you free for dinner tomorrow?

140
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,644
The referendum will pass.

141
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:49,658
- I'm tense.
- Ooh, you want a massage?

142
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,224
Yes. In maui.

143
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:56,087
A week in wailea with you when this is
all over. What do you say?

144
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,574
I say I'm one lucky girl.

145
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,369
Hello... Isabelle...

146
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,490
Well, how in the hell
should I know where he is?

147
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,462
Have you tried his cellphone?

148
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:19,298
Well, maybe you should call
child protective services.

149
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:24,121
I'm sure he's fine.
God protects the stupid.

150
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:38,092
I'm not feeling any cold air.
I think it's broken.

151
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,946
When a customer calls in
to the computer database,

152
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,042
he or she types in a client ID Number.

153
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:45,179
- It's not working.
- You haven't even tried it.

154
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,784
No, the air-conditioning.
I don't think it's working.

155
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:54,626
Okay, we need to talk.

156
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,610
Bet your ass we do. Where's Tara?

157
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,772
She's at her youth group.
She's coming by later.

158
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,701
I'm in the middle of
explaining this to you.

159
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,338
Praying that they'll have her BMW

160
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,689
in the color that she wants?

161
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:07,922
What's your problem?

162
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,343
I guess we'll go over it later.

163
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:13,088
Honey I'm sorry. Go eat some cake
or watch Youtube or something.

164
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:14,967
Were you trying to impress her --

165
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,998
The bad-boy drug dealer

166
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:18,853
who drives all the good girls wild?

167
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,039
It's not like that.

168
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,915
She is totally, totally trustworthy.

169
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:26,062
You would know this how?
You met her three weeks ago.

170
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:27,927
In your 17 years on earth,

171
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:31,003
you've gained such great insight
and wisdom into people?

172
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:33,140
She's gonna make a lot of money for us.

173
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:34,719
We know nothing about her

174
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,528
except that she's a fundamentalist

175
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,923
who likes to smoke a lot of pot.

176
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,880
That does not inspire me
with confidence.

177
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,451
You married a DEA Agent.

178
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,788
also, monumentally stupid.

179
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:50,296
I would hope that my children could
learn from my mistakes.

180
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,292
I'd like my phone back.

181
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:55,515
No, as I told you before,
I have other plans for you.

182
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,711
You're coming with me
to the grow house tomorrow

183
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,126
Should I be excited,
or is this, like, punishment?

184
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,274
This is, like,
a way to learn about a business

185
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,031
from the ground up, literally.

186
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,509
This is also, like,
a way to keep you occupied

187
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,503
so you don't, like, go off and do
something else, like, stupid.

188
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,759
Like, get it?

189
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,862
Just a little something to say,

190
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:04,764
"thank you for all your help."

191
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,697
90-fucking-percent of the vote, baby.

192
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:19,198
I'm not gonna answer that.

193
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,653
It might be important.

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,809
Everything that's important
is right here in this room.

195
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:38,452
It's your daughter.

196
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,286
Tell her you're busy till tomorrow.

197
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,606
Then we can eat and fuck all day
without interruption.

198
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:46,731
What?

199
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,700
I can't understand anything
that you're say--

200
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,324
Stop crying.

201
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,917
Isabelle, stop crying and talk!

202
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,181
Son of a bitch.

203
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,244
Will you drop the "steel magnolias" bit?

204
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:21,817
He's still breathing.

205
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,764
Why are you such a cunt?

206
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:28,058
Please don't use
foul language, Isabelle.

207
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,689
People will think
you weren't raised right.

208
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,450
I wonder why.

209
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,228
Ow, stop!

210
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:38,749
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hodes.

211
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,042
Yeah, for who?

212
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:42,965
Is he going to be okay?

213
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,806
He's lucky to be alive.

214
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:48,122
Animal urine disinfected
many of his wounds.

215
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,245
Animals peed on him?

216
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,573
Apparently, several.

217
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,132
Hmm, that's somehow perfect.

218
00:13:57,495 --> 00:14:00,224
He's gonna be all right, though, right?

219
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,857
The initial surgery was successful,
but he'll need several more.

220
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,916
Then there will be a tremendous
amount of rehabilitation needed.

221
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:09,521
We're looking down
a long road here, Mrs. Hodes.

222
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,926
No, not we. Him and you.

223
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,721
Not me. We are getting a divorce.

224
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,424
So, who should I speak to?

225
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:20,594
- There's no one else.
- There has to be someone else.

226
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,364
He was an only child.

227
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,170
Grandma and grandpa are dead.

228
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,511
There's no one else but you.

229
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:29,624
Well, what about the state?

230
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,491
I'm sure there must be some lovely,

231
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,851
state-funded institutions
that will take him.

232
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,169
- Dad.
- Oh, God.

233
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,222
Come on! Move it!

234
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,625
What's going on, Dwight?
Just open the gate.

235
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:51,727
Doug Wilson -- councilman Doug.
I'm here every day.

236
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,961
Don't you remember I wore
that pompom hat the other day?

237
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,143
You loved that hat. Yeah, you did.

238
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,299
What? This is letting
the air-conditioning escape.

239
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,727
Sir I'm sorry but the computer's telling
me that your membership's been revoked.

240
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,195
What? By who?

241
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,144
I don't know, but it's in red.
It's from pretty high up.

242
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:19,856
You have to turn your car around.

243
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,242
No, I'm not moving.

244
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,308
Sullivan Groff
and this whole fucking place

245
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,834
can kiss my black ass.

246
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,978
This is so not over.

247
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,114
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.
I did like your pompom hat.

248
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,755
Save yourself, Dwight, you're too good
for these assholes.

249
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:35,299
Go get a job you can be proud of.

250
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,802
We'll see who laughs last.

251
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,178
Conrad, teach him to grow.

252
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,151
This little fucker?

253
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:43,689
No, hold up.

254
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:46,510
Okay, no, this little fucker
steals our shit,

255
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:50,179
ruins everybody's life and I'm supposed
to be his mentor?

256
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:53,044
Think of it as
a big-brother kind of thing,

257
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,698
or scared straight.

258
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,282
He needs a positive
male influence in his life.

259
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,868
I'm the only man you know?

260
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,160
The only real man.

261
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,050
You think this shit
is gonna fly with me?

262
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,086
It's not shit.
You're the best at what you do.

263
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:07,234
I mean that.

264
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,767
Hey, watch this right here.

265
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,892
Your mother's smooth as butter.

266
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,290
Not always.

267
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:17,953
Your only lines are, "yes, I'm willing
to do anything you say,"

268
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,822
and, "thank you for this opportunity."

269
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,128
How much are you paying me to babysit?

270
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,845
- Pay you?
- That is what I'm doing.

271
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,367
You can't handle him, so you're
giving him to me, to set him straight.

272
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,520
$10 an hour.

273
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:35,790
Don't be cheap with me, I know the going
rate is closer to $15 in the suburbs.

274
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,150
After business is up and
running, I'll buy you a Rolex.

275
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,675
Because all black men
like a little bling-bling?

276
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:41,837
Yes.

277
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,745
Go on.

278
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,448
Make my boy your bitch.

279
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,053
All right, Nancy. You want
your boy to be my bitch?

280
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,629
He'll be my bitch.

281
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,527
Poor guy.

282
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,372
Poor wrecked guy.

283
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,835
Okay, tell me
she gave you a sponge bath.

284
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,533
Tell me she soaped it up,
and then slurped the gobbledygood.

285
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:25,233
Blink once for "yes, "two for "no,"
three for "hell, yes."

286
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,646
Listen, buddy, you don't
have to worry about anything.

287
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,864
Buddy Doug here
has got your back.

288
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,463
Now, in case
you turn into a vegetable,

289
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:39,633
I've taken the liberty,
of drawing up this power of attorney.

290
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:43,146
You need to sign this now,
or your cunt wife will crush

291
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,678
the one part of you that
hasn't already been crushed.

292
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,922
All right?
Just try to work with me here.

293
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:53,932
Sign your name.

294
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:56,260
There we go.

295
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,905
Your assets are protected.
I speak for you now.

296
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:01,641
Do you have any assets?

297
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,888
You've got your milf money
coming to you, buddy.

298
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:08,202
Nance is back in business. Conrad's got
a grow house three times the size.

299
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,027
Money's flowing in like
this morphine in your arm.

300
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,314
Just a little while.
Share the love?

301
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,429
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

302
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,655
He might have a disease.

303
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,826
Let's see if there's any clean needles.
Then we'll just pull the tube.

304
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:30,420
Fair enough.
I could use a little something.

305
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,453
It's so hard
to see him like this.

306
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,013
You think he'll be in pain
if we take the drip out?

307
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,836
He'll be fine. Right, buddy?

308
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,687
You are such a good friend.
We love you, man.

309
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:41,841
- What?
- Bingo.

310
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,853
Does this mean
we can't go to hawaii?

311
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:49,333
No, this means I have to
sell the majestic house,

312
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,140
and then I have to pay
for someone else

313
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:54,790
to take care of
"the magnificent invalid."

314
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,846
Baby, you can't
sell the majestic house.

315
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,263
What can I do?
I need the money.

316
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:02,450
No, seriously,
you can't sell it.

317
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,504
The mortgage is held
by a dummy corporation.

318
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:08,562
You can live in it as long as you want,
but if you try to sell it, the jig's up.

319
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,570
You'll go to jail
for accepting a bribe.

320
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:14,136
Shit. Can you sell it for me?

321
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,978
I thought dean
was out of your life.

322
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:20,339
He was... Till the handitard went
and drove off of a cliff.

323
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,644
You'll think of something.
You're a very resourceful woman.

324
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,814
Fucking rolling blackouts.

325
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:34,925
The planet's overpopulated.

326
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,390
Resources are running out.

327
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:39,180
The world is...

328
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,921
...it's doomed.

329
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:49,135
- More wine?
- Oh, god, yeah.

330
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,850
I have to sit down.

331
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:05,731
When Shane was little,
he called the stars "up aboves"

332
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,841
I Miss the simplicity
of toddlerhood.

333
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:11,953
Amen to that.

334
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,321
I'm failing my children.

335
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,694
Oh, God.

336
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,802
Who isn't?

337
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,809
Yeah.
Tim's kind of a dickhead.

338
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,636
- Fuck you. I love my son.
- Oh, sorry, of course you do.

339
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:38,235
I love my dickhead son.

340
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,037
I have ice-cream cake.

341
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:49,711
I want cake. Give me cake.

342
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,956
Give me cake!

343
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:55,630
Someone's yelling,
and people are sleeping.

344
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,125
How drunk are we?

345
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:01,158
We're not drunk, andy.
We're lubricated.

346
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,784
Is that the technical term?

347
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:06,143
- You got a problem with that?
- No, ma'am.

348
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:07,664
He called me "ma'am."

349
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,410
Get him, val, get him.

350
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,691
You think I'm a "ma'am"?

351
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,082
You are definitely
not a "ma'am." no, ma'am.

352
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,658
I'm getting cake and three
forks, and no one can stop me.

353
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,303
Thank you.

354
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:33,292
- You getting up?
- No, I'm fine down here.

355
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,952
Who's your friend?

356
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:36,844
Do you like her?

357
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:39,783
She's, uh... Who is she?

358
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,808
- She's my new friend.
- About time you got a friend.

359
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,951
Oh, not nice, andy.

360
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,692
Not a nice thing to say.

361
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,873
So, How do you know her?

362
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
She's Peter's ex-wife.

363
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:00,153
I'm sorry, Nance.
Are you fucking insane?

364
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,724
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much.<i>

365
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,873
You know, it's funny,
but if we don't succeed in life,

366
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:08,884
we run the risk of failure.

367
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,432
It's not pollution causing
problems in our environment.

368
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:14,762
It's the impurities
in the air and in the water.

369
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,494
So I say to you,
my fellow majesticans,

370
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,497
change is good...

371
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:22,918
because change... is change.

372
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:30,885
Thank you very much.

373
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,608
God bless you,
and God bless the new Majestic!

374
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:40,575
Thank you!

375
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:00,161
Holy shit.

376
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:05,741
Wow, that's a lot of sewage

377
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:28,784
that motherfucker.

378
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,895
I'm gonna have him killed.
