4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,850
Now, that's a real gun
pressed against your head.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,430
Real bullets inside it.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,690
Look at me.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,800
Now, you look way outside
your world right now,

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,940
but you need to tell your brain
to tell your mouth to tell me

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,910
what you were doing outside
my warehouse with this thing.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,390
- what's your name?
- Guillermo.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,210
But that's my name.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,320
How you know my name, huh?

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,520
How she know my name?

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,980
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,980
How you fucking know my name?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,550
She's with me.

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,420
Oh, is that right? What's her name?

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,080
It's celia.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,420
He wasn't talking to you.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,610
She's my backup.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,990
Fucking bitch was supposed
to stay in the car!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,630
Why am i hearing about this now?

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,550
I don't know.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,170
Why didn't you tell me about
not putting drugs in my car

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,380
or lento the criminal
or the tijuana police?

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Isn't that how it works around here
-- nobody tells anybody anything?

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,180
Why she taking pictures?

28
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,220
I don't know. That's a very
good question. Give me that.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,710
Why are you taking pictures?

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,070
why are you taking pictures?

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,210
I-I was scrapbooking?

32
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,390
Damn!

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,750
Nobody hits my fucking
crew. That's my job!

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,170
Hey, that gun's loaded, blanca.

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,670
You hear that, fucko? Gun's loaded.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,950
Back off, man. Back away.

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,870
Celia, get in the fucking prius.

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,000
She fucked up. It's on me.

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,260
Oh, you damn right it's on you.

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,250
I'll take care of it. Get
in the goddamn car now!

42
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,230
Give me the tooth.

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,380
Open the gate, please.

44
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,320
- This is some sloppy shit.
- Agreed.

45
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,340
You make this go away, okay?

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,330
We got a date tonight.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,190
- It's done.
- Don't forget.

48
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,390
Andy: Always thought
the border would be flat.

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,320
Total popular misconception.

50
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,890
It's quite the workout.

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,120
Calves feeling the burn.

52
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,420
- Neck feeling the burn.
- Esperen.

53
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,090
All right.

54
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,980
Are those pepitas? I love pepitas.

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,640
Thanks. gracias.

56
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,160
Looks real, right?

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,610
Oh, well, sure. Much, much smaller.

58
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,160
Pigs can get huge.

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,000
They had them on a commune
that I crashed at for a while.

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,960
There was this girl, and there was this
charismatic leader guy who slept with the girl.

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,750
I could make one of you
with the hair and everything.

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,700
How much would you pay for that?

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,830
A marzipan portrait. Okay. Marzipandy.

64
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,920
Yeah, at least $10.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,890
Hey slut............

66
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,270
I want to ............

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,050
then drag............

68
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,250
Leave it............

69
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,280
Send the..........

70
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,040
Did you just say that you
missed your mother? Come here.

71
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,360
Ivamos, r*pido! Ivamos, piruja!

72
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,350
Oh, yeah!

73
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,760
Anyone.........

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,240
they die.

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,300
- Yeah?
- Pay your fare, gabacho.

76
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,130
Oh, right. Okay. Let's see. Here we go.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,740
- $6?
- That's like 6,000 pesos.

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,430
Oh, no, no. Not my
"fall guy" belt buckle.

79
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,130
This is a limited edition. Very nice.

80
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,650
- Irapido!
- Yeah, yeah. Here you go. That's one of a hundred.

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,360
- Get in. Get in.
- Okay.

82
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,470
Hello, phone caller. This
is andrew. Andrew botwin.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,340
It pains me we couldn't make
this instant human connection.

84
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,230
Leave a message, and while you
do it, imagine me listening to it,

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,470
where I might be at the
time, what I might be wearing.

86
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,200
Andy, this is me.

87
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,700
Got a little delayed.

88
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm on my way now.

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,190
I'm thinking you probably don't
have cell reception where you are,

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,130
so you probably won't hear this before I
reach you, but it's making me feel better,

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,340
and it's preventing me from
killing celia at the moment.

92
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,460
Oh, yes. I forgot to open with that.

93
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,410
Celia hodes is sitting next to me in
the car, all the way from agrestic.

94
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,170
How did she get here? I don't know.

95
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,260
But when I hear the unbelievably stupid
reason that comes out of her mouth,

96
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm gonna fucking kill her!

97
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,620
So there may be a dead body in the car
when I get there. That's just a heads-up.

98
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,740
I'll be there soon.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,440
Oh, and your outgoing message
is creepy. Please change it.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,700
I want my tooth back.

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,110
You don't get your tooth back.

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,870
I keep your tooth.

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,980
I drill a tiny hole in it
and wear it around my neck.

104
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,760
I become your god.

105
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,160
I can explain.

106
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,780
- All right.
- Okay.

107
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,530
Explain. Explain.

108
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,080
What are you doing with that?

109
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,400
Closets don't get towed.

110
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,760
Just need a little ventilation.

111
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,480
Mom doesn't want those in the house.

112
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,570
Mom isn't gonna find out.

113
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,490
Doors stay locked, lenny's
gone, and no one talks.

114
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,040
Hey, dude. What's going on?

115
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,380
Teenage rebellion.

116
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,250
Fuck yeah. Stick it to the old people.

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,880
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm eating cereal.

119
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,360
I mean why are you here
in our house, mr. Wilson?

120
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,530
Where's your family?

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,120
My family left me, buddy.

122
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,670
My life's a toilet.

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,810
These cornflakes, they're old.

124
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,560
My asshole is on fire.

125
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,490
I hate myself.

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You happy now?

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,900
Check this out.

128
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,790
What is it?

129
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,810
It's honey.

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,660
That could have lead in it, or asbestos.

131
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,930
You're a fucking downer.

132
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,820
Honey flakes.

133
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,710
Don't you wish you had some?

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,010
Inquisitor, ruiner of days,
child of the apocalypse.

135
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,980
bees. Wait. Bees bad.

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,980
Swarm! It's a swarm!

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,290
And they put a fucking
fire hose through my car

138
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,170
and shoved me on a cot and then
they pulled me from the rec center,

139
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,200
threw me into an interrogation
room, and you left me there.

140
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,850
All right, granted, you weren't there, but
your people were there, and they lied for you.

141
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,370
And they put me in
jail, where I was abused!

142
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,510
And this man gave me a chance.

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,550
He is giving both of us a chance here.

144
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,890
All he wants is for us to help
him get that guillermo person.

145
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,970
Get out of the car.

146
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,780
I need a second to take all of this in.

147
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,670
Oh, my god.

148
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,250
You put a fucking gun in my
mouth and you need a moment alone.

149
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,250
Okay, be a bigger person, celia.

150
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,050
Imagine me listening to it, where I might
be at the time, what I might be wearing.

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,710
Let that guide you.

152
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,130
Andy... It's me.

153
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,240
Uh, I'm back in the desert.
Your cooler's here. You're not.

154
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm sorry I got here
late. It wasn't my fault.

155
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,830
Actually, it probably was my fault.

156
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,090
In a grand sense,
everything is my fault.

157
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,110
It's all my fault. Please call.

158
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,240
Oh, this isn't happening!

159
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,430
Nancy? Nancy?

160
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,930
Nance?

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,800
We're gonna figure this out.

162
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,670
It's okay. It's okay.

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
I forgive you.

164
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,090
I know this is overwhelming.

165
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,280
I know that you didn't
mean to leave me in prison.

166
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,560
Y-- you hit that...
window-button thing by accident.

167
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,950
Nancy. Nancy!

168
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,450
Nancy!

169
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,410
Do you believe in reincarnation?

170
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,350
I don't know! I don't know!

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,120
I do. You've proven it to
me. You want to know how?

172
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,350
Yes! Yes!

173
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,280
You've made me a believer because there
is nothing I have done in this life

174
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,800
to accumulate the massive dose of fucked-up
karma you have brought my way, celia!

175
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,580
So now it's all making sense!

176
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,440
Being tested for something I did to you
in a previous life because in this life,

177
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,310
where I've repeatedly allowed
you to fuck me over a fence!

178
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,270
Whatever I do, you keep coming back.

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,520
So...

180
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,330
I accept your forgiveness
for my previous crimes,

181
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,620
and I want to thank you for bringing
me to a more enlightened state of being.

182
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,930
Please don't step on the gas again.

183
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,520
And now, if you so choose, you can
get back in the car, sit silently,

184
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,470
let me try to figure out how to save
our asses on the way to the mall.

185
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,280
Would you like that?

186
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,270
Davenport, iowa.

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,740
Never been there.

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,990
Heard it's cold in the
winter. You bring a parka?

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,770
Big boats. Ocean.

190
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,800
fishermen.

191
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,470
dorado, marlin, shark.

192
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,770
In davenport?

193
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm fairly sure iowa's landlocked.

194
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,280
Tuna, uh... mahimahi. Big.

195
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,150
Yeah, well, I, uh...

196
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,450
Nance, hey. Where the hell are you?

197
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,380
Outlet mall with celia?

198
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,980
guess where I am. In a pudding truck.

199
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,230
I'll tell you about it later.

200
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
Um, you're breaking up.

201
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,900
You're breaking up!

202
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,720
Sorry. Okay, there. Got it. Oh, good.

203
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,860
How much is the bus to san francisco?

204
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,760
From san diego?

205
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,410
$83 is 1,500 lempira.

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,060
Oh, lempira? You're honduran?

207
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,310
S? Yoro.

208
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
Yoro? I love yoro.

209
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,580
- I went to the festival
de la -- - lluvia de peces.

210
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,830
Yeah!

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,730
- It actually rains fish!
- It actually rains fish!

212
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,060
It cost me 16,000 to get here from yoro.

213
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,410
Coyote said it was
only going to be 10,000.

214
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,200
He ke-- he keeps
raising the price.

215
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,180
That's not fair. I mean, a verbal
contract is still a contract.

216
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,260
One old lady was too slow.

217
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,390
He left her to die.

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
He charged us for water.

219
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,300
He broke that guy's
arm, stole his necklace.

220
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,180
We're cargo.

221
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,990
We're... pudding.

222
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,130
No man is pudding.

223
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,470
Uh, mr. Wilson, we could
use your help out here.

224
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,720
Doug: Yeah, I got some problems in here.

225
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,620
What's the matter?

226
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,170
Very allergic to bees.

227
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,420
Face very swollen.

228
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,600
It's not worth it.

229
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,090
Hey, I got customers.

230
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,130
- I'll cut you in.
- 50%.

231
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,070
- 5%.
- 15%.

232
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,530
- And I'm the sprayer.
- Fine.

233
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,560
On three.

234
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,080
One... two... three.

235
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,020
- So, captain roy till -- -
you promised you wouldn't talk.

236
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,050
Stay right here where I can see you.

237
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,610
Can you ask that guillermo when
I can get pam's car back?'Cause --

238
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,660
try not to look homeless.

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
How's the day?

240
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,060
I've had worse.

241
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,560
Uh, I had a long talk with my...

242
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,230
- associate.
- Associate?

243
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,190
Damn. You already keep
too many secrets from me...

244
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,080
tortillera. Lesbiana.

245
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,860
That's your girl outside, isn't it?

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,360
Celia?

247
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,160
Chewie took that
camera over to rite aid.

248
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,550
Must have thought you
were fucking around on her.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,090
Following you everywhere.

250
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,500
yeah. She has trust issues.

251
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,770
Man, I've seen bitches like her.

252
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,370
Crazy stalker bitches.

253
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,830
Got her on a leash now.

254
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,050
Um, this is yours.

255
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,960
So, this is the front room.

256
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,860
Window displays.

257
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,030
Back here, you got two dressing
rooms so the ladies have some privacy.

258
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,370
This is the back room.

259
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,160
There's a bathroom, file cabinets.

260
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,390
We'll get you a safe in
there before you open.

261
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,770
So this is a front --
where you launder money.

262
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,200
It's a maternity store.

263
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,650
We sell comfort and
fashion to pregnant women.

264
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,950
What am I not getting?

265
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,760
This is your new job.

266
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,090
You work here. We're making you manager.

267
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,260
How am I gonna make runs
if I'm running a store?

268
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,580
You don'T.

269
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,650
We need your face here.

270
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,490
Uh, I don't want to work retail.

271
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,620
I want to traffic.

272
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,030
I got a family to support.

273
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,880
I put them through hell. I owe them.

274
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,090
I-I've got to make
a killing, all right?

275
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,900
So write it down.

276
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,940
Write down how much you
want to make this year.

277
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,600
- Just write it?
- Yep.

278
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,620
Ask for more.

279
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,630
Really?

280
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,020
I got to take it to the man above.

281
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,880
I only take it once.

282
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,380
No runs, no dealing, no more drugs.

283
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,510
You got to be clean, professional.

284
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,390
Hire a staff --
people you can trust.

285
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,920
That's very important.

286
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,080
I need this place up
and running in a week.

287
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,860
"Blanca."

288
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,230
Uh, I'm extremely, wildly confused.

289
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,330
You're gonna give me all that money to
manage the san ysidro maternity world?

290
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,870
I am.But
your --

291
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,530
your gap-toothed girlfriend out
there, she makes minimum wage.

292
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,770
Hey slut.

293
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,390
It's time for you to suck...

294
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,950
my dick.

295
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,620
- Mira, cabrona.
- Whoa, hombre! Not cool!

296
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,850
vas a hacer, cabrÛn?

297
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,640
Shit. That's not a clean knife.

298
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,820
Okay, yeah. It's a gun, all right.

299
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,290
Let's all just mellow out.

300
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,560
Oh, my god! I shot you!

301
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,870
Oh, my god! I shot you in the knee!

302
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,330
I didn't know that I could shoot
someone in the knee. That's so random.

303
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,610
And yet brutal and
life-changing. I'm sorry, man.

304
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,090
Get the $6 that he took from me.

305
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,060
It's just you were coming at
me and you're such an asshole!

306
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,980
- Davenport, iowa?
- Yeah, yeah. Davenport.

307
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,650
Yeah, we're gonna get
you there. And marzipan.

308
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,720
- You're both coming with me.
- Vente, v*monos.

309
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,590
Who's the fall guy now, coyote ugly?

310
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,480
I just said that. Did you guys
hear that? I totally said that.

311
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,750
So...

312
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,380
We've had a trying couple of weeks.

313
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,130
We lost our homes. A bubbie.

314
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,440
But we have this food...

315
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,650
and this lovely roof over our heads,
recent bee infestation excluded,

316
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,990
which my father-in-law has offered
up at a ridiculously inflated price.

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,120
I've had a particularly
challenging last 24 hours. But...

318
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,870
But in the drive-through at
popeyes, I found myself saying,

319
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,350
"family combo, please," and
it was a moment of clarity.

320
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,020
What I mean to say is, I was thinking
of you today -- of all of you.

321
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,520
Andy, I think in the past, I've dismissed you as
being the kind of guy you couldn't really count on.

322
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,660
And I was wrong.

323
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,690
You've been a rock for this family.

324
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,410
We need you.

325
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,330
Andy's friends, I'd like to
welcome you to our country.

326
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
I hope you get to stay.

327
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,250
Keep a low profile. Blend.

328
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,580
Shane, I've been unavailable
to you, and that's rotten.

329
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,620
I will be more present.

330
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,420
Silas, you've taken on more responsibility in
a time of upheaval, and it's been admirable.

331
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,200
We still need to talk about the G.E.D.

332
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,590
Doug, I'm sorry you and
dana are having problems,

333
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,540
but you need to find a place of your own to
live, and you need to seek medical attention.

334
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,070
And, finally, maybe, um... possibly...

335
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,870
I think I owe an apology to
the woman sitting to my right.

336
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
I left her holding a very big bag.

337
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,290
It was not my finest hour.

338
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,450
I'm sorry, celia.

339
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,800
All of us are sorry!

340
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,300
- Sorry, celia.
- Sorry, ms. Hodes.

341
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,370
- Lo siento.
- Lo siento.

342
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,080
So, she's going to be staying with us.

343
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,130
We will treat her as family.

344
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,950
You can sleep in my room tonight, celia.

345
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,700
Not in the bed. There's a nice couch.

346
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,630
So now, with that,

347
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,960
let us enjoy the wonderful dessert

348
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,050
our new friend, reyna, has provided.

349
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,490
- Pigs.
- Pigs.

350
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,130
Cheers.

351
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,330
What about till?

352
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:56,060
* Every time I try to tell
you how I feel in my heart *

353
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,060
* my nerve begins to unravel
and the words fall apart *

354
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,250
* let my love light shine
from the prism of my eyes *

355
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,100
captain till.

356
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,920
The widow scottson.

357
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,570
Or is it botwin?

358
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,460
You need to back off -- off
of celia. Off permanently.

359
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,250
And why would I do that?

360
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,310
Because you have a kind heart.

361
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,380
That's a good one. I like that.

362
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,740
"Kind heart."

363
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,610
Okay, sure. Why the hell not?

364
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:42,340
You cop for the grow house, deliver me
guillermo garcia gomez, the councilwoman walks.

365
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,670
I got a better deal for you.

366
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,260
You can give me three
more inches on my dick?

367
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,930
You can listen and
pretend to be a gentleman.

368
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,090
I can play pretend.

369
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,910
You let me buy you a round,
you enjoy drinking it,

370
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,150
you remember that the grow house burned down
in the fire and you have no physical evidence,

371
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,680
you forget celia, you forget me, you
finish your drink, and you go home.

372
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,040
Gomez.

373
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,550
- Guillermo garcia gomez.
- I don't know any gomez.

374
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,510
- If I did once, I don't anymore.
- Not what I hear.

375
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,720
In fact...I'd say other than celia,

376
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,800
the one person you and I have in
common that I do know is peter scottson,

377
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,080
and I knew him very well.

378
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,090
Old fucking news.

379
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,340
Not that old.

380
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,880
We did a good job burying pete.

381
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,380
Did you?

382
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,780
You look angry.

383
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,510
Captain till, I didn't
come here to make you angry.

384
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,130
I came here to thank you.

385
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,760
You backed me into a corner,
and it worked. I got out.

386
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,030
Should have done it a long time ago.

387
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,530
I never made a lot of money at it.

388
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,460
The few times I did, I got
greedy, found a way to lose it.

389
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,490
Got in with the wrong
people, endangered my family.

390
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,590
I was a bad drug dealer. I know it now.

391
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,090
I'm trying something new.

392
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,900
Let me guess.

393
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,400
Feeding the homeless?

394
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,460
Nursing aids babies?

395
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,510
Still too selfish for that.

396
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,630
No, captain till.

397
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,520
I got what the world would
call a normal, boring job.

398
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,010
I wake up in the morning, get dressed,

399
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,990
drive myself to work, put on a name tag,

400
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,240
take my brain out of my skull,
and place it in a drawer.

401
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,250
I spend the next nine
hours smiling at people,

402
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,520
pretending to be interested
in their happiness,

403
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,960
tolerating the company of my
co-workers, staring at the clock.

404
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,240
At the end of the day, I take my name tag
off, open the drawer, reach for my brain,

405
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,630
plop it back inside, walk to the
employee parking lot, drive myself home.

406
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,730
And it's really, really, really boring.

407
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,900
It looks like I'm gonna be
doing it for a long, long time.

408
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,500
Jesus!

409
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,170
Iabre!

410
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,990
No more........

411
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,750
Boxes.....

412
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,280
And you.......

413
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,170
Not ........

414
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
We're good.

415
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,800
What the "f"?

416
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,060
Very good.......

417
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,710
Help him...........

418
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,080
Ready!

419
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,090
Boss!

420
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,230
We're open.......
