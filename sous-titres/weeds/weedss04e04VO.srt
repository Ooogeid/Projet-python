1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,687
Previously on Weeds...

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,511
Please don't put me back in jail.

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:11,973
- I want to know where Nancy Botwin is.
- I can do that.

4
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:15,324
I want to know how she knows this man,

5
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:17,505
when they met, and who introduced them.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,521
- Oh, shit.

7
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:20,857
Learned all you need?
You want to make a real run?

8
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:25,014
Let's go next door to the pet store...
la tienda de mascotas.

9
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:28,281
We researched the insurance policies
on the municipal buildings.

10
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,646
- There are several discrepancies.
- Adiós, buddy.

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:35,705
How'd it go at the track today, Dad?
Catch a few winners?

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:36,873
No? Not one?

13
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,250
Anything? Shocking.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,795
Geharget mach.

15
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:43,963
- What did she say?
- "Kill me."

16
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:47,041
What do you want me to say?
That I want to kill my mother?

17
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:50,039
That I want her dead?
I wish this would all go away?

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,098
We decided it'd be best
to pull the plug, though,

19
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,724
and let her rest in peace.

20
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:58,311
That's it.

21
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,350
- She's still breathing.
- Shane...

22
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,423
Get Mommy a pillow.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,275
Weeds - 4x04

Relecture: mpm, Dapitch666,
Jesslataree, San-A

26
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:52,615
- Isn't that a fire hazard?
- It's on a dish.

27
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:56,094
- What if there's an earthquake?
- I think the odds are in your favor

28
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:59,094
that two houses you live in
won't burn down...

29
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:00,832
although your mother is a wild card.

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,711
Could we all settle down
and honor the dead a little here?

31
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,714
- Did she leave a will?
- Yeah. Everything's mine.

32
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,400
Let's take off our shoes and sit

33
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,384
and pay respect to a courageous woman

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,606
who escaped the clutches of Adolf Hitler

35
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,625
to live a long, productive life...

36
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:25,985
Only to be snuffed out
by a hypoallergenic pillow

37
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,567
from Bed Bath & Beyond.

38
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:29,956
Sit

39
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:50,715
Now what?

40
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,700
Now we remember.

41
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,093
Soon we'll eat.

42
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,722
And then we'll remember more.

43
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,933
How come we never did this for Dad?

44
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,894
Mommy was too sedated to think of it.

45
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,438
How long do we sit and

46
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:07,982
remember and occasionally
break for snacks?

47
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,317
Seven days.

48
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,736
You're kidding, right?

49
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,325
Make sure the front door is left open.

50
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,702
During Shivah, people usually come by,

51
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,410
and they'll bring food
and pay their respects.

52
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:23,372
How is it that all Jews
aren't morbidly obese?

53
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,333
Everything revolves around food.

54
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,765
So sorry for your loss.

55
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,683
Bob Warden, beachfront realty.

56
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:44,894
This is from my mom.

57
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,773
- That's so generous.
- She owns a cheese store.

58
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:54,028
Rad, honey, take off
your skatey wheely thingies.

59
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,366
What's up, dude?

60
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,843
Please get out of my house.

61
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:07,000
Hello.

62
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:10,295
I'm Katie Thatcher.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

63
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:11,796
She was a lovely woman.

64
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,768
Shit.

65
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,217
- Katie.
- Bob.

66
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:21,536
Hi, kids.

67
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:26,376
What's going on? Some sort of séance?
They're bullshit but fun.

68
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,521
We're sitting Shivah for Bubbie.

69
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:29,564
Doug?

70
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,650
- Andy said it'd be cool if I crashed.
- Who the fuck are you?

71
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:36,154
- Doug Wilson. Who the fuck are you?
- Lenny Botwin. I own the house.

72
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,563
I don't think it's gonna be cool
if you crash.

73
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,276
I got the entire town of Majestic up
in my grill, Nance.

74
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,489
I need somewhere to lay low.
I can sleep in my minivan.

75
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,504
I need a place to bust out my nug nugs.

76
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,291
Who are you to tell him to stay?

77
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,168
- He's my friend.
- My mother died.

78
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,920
- My grandmother died.
- Putz!

79
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,130
- Asshole.
- Humboldt fog.

80
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:55,715
Nice.

81
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,177
- So, how'd Grandma die?
- Mom killed her.

82
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,892
You're grotesque.

83
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,686
The jackpot's up to $350 million,

84
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,813
so mind your own fucking business.

85
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,106
Shivah goy...

86
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,111
Quik mart up the street.

87
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:19,697
They're her holocaust numbers.

88
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,435
They're obviously lucky. She survived.

89
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,328
What the fuck is that?

90
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,895
Nancy... GET YOUR ASS
BACK TO WORK. GUILLERMO.

91
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:34,772
They're from a friend of mine.

92
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,777
3... 2...

93
00:05:58,278 --> 00:05:58,978
1...

94
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,198
Attention, beloved
mixed-marriage family.

95
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:04,158
Shivah is over.

96
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:06,828
And this house is now for sale.

97
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:10,289
So, unless you're in a position
to pay me $1.5 million,

98
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:14,002
I suggest you find alternate
accommodations immediately.

99
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:15,647
Where are we gonna live?

100
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:18,339
Apparently that's of no concern
to your loving grandfather.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,134
This house should stay in the family.

102
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,681
Tell you what. For you,
I'm gonna knock off 100 grand,

103
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,823
because I won't have to pay
the Broker's commission.

104
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:28,397
- That's a good deal.
- I want to stay. I'm not leaving.

105
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,562
Fine.
It'll add to the value of the house.

106
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,301
Three bedrooms, two baths,
and a little boy.

107
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,814
I can sell it to a priest.

108
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,942
- You guys could stay in my minivan.
- I got to get my own place.

109
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:41,098
- I said I'm not leaving.
- I heard you, Shane. I get it.

110
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:43,156
- We'll be back later.
- Another bed skirt?

111
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,319
Dust ruffle.

112
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,492
I just wanted to say it's been

113
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:50,362
an amazing experience to have been here
with you for the last few days.

114
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:52,067
I mean, your mother...

115
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,042
She seemed like an extraordinary woman.

116
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,506
Bob, I'm touched
by your outpouring of emotion.

117
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,480
And I think Bubbie would have been, too.
Thank you.

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,301
But I'm gonna go with the hot chick
who walked in here on tuesday.

119
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,224
You're a piece of shit.

120
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,111
- Who's there?
- Nancy.

121
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,373
We used to have a Nancy.
She was a good worker.

122
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:19,607
But she stopped showing up,
and we had to kill her.

123
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,904
Seven days cooped up
with the family felt like death.

124
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:26,979
If I had to sit home for seven days
every time a family member dropped dead,

125
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,952
- I'd never leave the fucking house.
- Thanks for the flowers.

126
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:33,883
You're really not supposed to send
flowers to a Jewish funeral... Shivah...

127
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,958
whatever. Still... very thoughtful.

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,165
I had to smother a guy
with a pillow once, too.

129
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,513
My arms got tired.

130
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,507
You?

131
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,554
Not so much. It was tempur-pedic.

132
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,678
Conformed to her face.

133
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,349
Tempur-pedic. Got to remember that.

134
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,644
- Am I going on a picnic?
- Maybe.

135
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,951
- Depends on which one you pick.
- I choose one of these?

136
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,866
Like "deal or no deal."

137
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:03,395
Except here you got to choose,
so it's more like "deal or deal,"

138
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:07,451
and there ain't those leggy chicas with
suitcases you want to fuck in the mouth.

139
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,828
Red or blue. But be careful.

140
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,038
One of them is very dangerous.

141
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:17,742
Open it.

142
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,215
There's a gun in here.

143
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:25,967
And a juice box.

144
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:30,138
And $5,000.
And another $5,000 after you come back.

145
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,223
What do I need a gun for?

146
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:35,478
You're going to the desert.
They got rattlesnakes.

147
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,562
Maybe the chupacabra.

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,523
- This makes me nervous.
- It's just a pickup.

149
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:43,660
You don't even have to cross the border.
You just sit in your car,

150
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,153
and México comes to you.

151
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,532
- I want $15,000.
- You chose the red. Red pays $10,000.

152
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,801
This is the same address.
It's the same thing.

153
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:56,813
But no juice box.

154
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:03,962
So, I figure we'll ask for $2,000,000
and settle for $1.5.

155
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:07,048
I'm thinking we ask for
1.2 and settle for a mil.

156
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,301
That's insane.

157
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,422
We're a block from the beach.

158
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,599
There's a charter school
right down the street.

159
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,223
There's no schvartze in sight.

160
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,472
There's a recession,
the banks aren't lending money,

161
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,603
and when they don't lend,
people aren't buying.

162
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,938
What about the Chinese? They're loaded.

163
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:23,524
- They prefer Orange County.
- Jesus Christ.

164
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,194
I got a $1,100,000 borrowed
against this place.

165
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:28,447
Well, if you want to sit on it
for a couple of years,

166
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:32,564
- I'm sure the market will bounce back.
- Well, with all due respect, fuck you.

167
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:35,503
- I'm gonna go with Bob Warden.
- He'll tell you the same thing.

168
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,039
And his tits won't get you
an extra 50k at closing.

169
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,124
You want to have dinner later?

170
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,918
I'll be in touch, Mr. Botwin.

171
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:44,258
That's a no?

172
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,216
The banks aren't lending.

173
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,218
How do they know how much it is worth?

174
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:52,554
Well, they break it up into categories.

175
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:55,414
Yellow is dreck, green is crap,
blue is shit.

176
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:57,558
- Here. Come and help me.
- With what?

177
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,180
- A treasure hunt.
- Cool!

178
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:04,106
I found Nancy.

179
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,777
And she was with Guillermo.

180
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,113
They talked, and then he left,

181
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:14,848
and then she didn't leave the house
the whole week.

182
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:16,923
It was weird.

183
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,330
There was this strange meeting.

184
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,041
I think she's more powerful
than we think.

185
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,256
People came with food.

186
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,176
They took off their shoes.

187
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:28,797
See?

188
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,467
Look. That's Doug Wilson.

189
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:34,470
She's getting her crew back together.

190
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,807
So, what do you make of all of this?

191
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,769
I make that someone jewish died
and that you're no Diane Arbus.

192
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:45,087
This is new to me, okay?

193
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,317
I mean, I am taking pictures
with a plastic camera.

194
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,669
I'm trying.

195
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,697
Guillermo Garcia Gomez.

196
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:55,742
I told you. I saw them together.

197
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:57,576
He was driving her Prius.

198
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:01,330
So, what do we got? She's sitting Shivah
and he's environmentally sensitive?

199
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,125
Boffo work, agent Hodes.

200
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,545
You miss wearing orange?

201
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:13,134
No, I just... I need more time.
Please?

202
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,786
Sing with me.

203
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,931
- What?
- Sing with me,

204
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,405
and I'll give you more time.

205
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:27,244
Going once...

206
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,870
You are an obsession

207
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,609
I cannot sleep

208
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,200
I am a possession

209
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,534
Unopened at your feet

210
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,595
There is no balance

211
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,709
No equality

212
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,095
Be still

213
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,924
I will not accept defeat

214
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,177
So...

215
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,529
what do you guys think?

216
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,934
- Awesome.
- Legendary.

217
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,348
I can't feel my left...

218
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,103
anything.

219
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,207
I have a son your age.

220
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:12,151
Handsome, lean, bright-eyed.

221
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,680
You suck dick, Silas?

222
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,156
No, I don't, Mr. Wilson.

223
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,076
- Well, he does.
- That's his choice, isn't it?

224
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,675
Nope. My fault. I made him gay.

225
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,562
My wife... gone.
Also my fault.

226
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,168
Warts... not gone.
Technically my fault.

227
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,002
City of majestic... broke.

228
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:34,163
Cpa license... revoked...
I assume. Didn't check.

229
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:36,958
My life...

230
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,803
an abyss.

231
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:43,933
Can you use the downstairs toilet
from now on, Mr. Wilson?

232
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:49,322
- Kick a man while he's down.
- No, really. Use the downstairs toilet.

233
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:53,353
You think you're better than me,
Botwin, 'cause your van has no windows?

234
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,027
Doug...

235
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,738
that's a window.

236
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,137
A window to what, Andy?

237
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:04,029
Look at us.
Purposeless, directionless, homeless...

238
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:05,758
just less.

239
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,336
- Do you suck dick, Silas?
- You asked me that already, Mr. Wilson.

240
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,141
Oh, right. Right.

241
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,709
Do you like the taste?

242
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:22,012
I hate to interrupt this... think tank.
Andy, I need you.

243
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:25,433
- I'm toasted.
- There's no math involved. Come on.

244
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:29,852
Hurry up.

245
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,400
You suck dick, Silas?

246
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,193
What if there's no money?

247
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,356
There's money, believe me.

248
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:41,115
Bubbie was convinced
the Nazis were gonna rise again.

249
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,678
So, when she got too old
to schtupp her way out of a camp,

250
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:46,871
she started hoarding money for bribes.

251
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,290
- That's crazy.
- That's not crazy at all.

252
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:52,493
Listen, genocide can happen again
if we're not vigilant.

253
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,211
It must never happen again.

254
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:55,838
It has happened again.

255
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:59,925
- What are you talking about?
- Genocide. In Rwanda, Cambodia, Bosnia.

256
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:03,896
No, no. To Jews.
It must never happen again to Jews.

257
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:06,632
What do I give a shit
about the other places?

258
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,392
Jackpot!

259
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,269
Good old jewish paranoia.

260
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,312
The trick is making it work for you.

261
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,569
Looks like 15 dimes in here.

262
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,157
- How would Bubbie have gotten up there?
- Money's probably up there for decades.

263
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,367
Well, this bill's from 2004.

264
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,852
So? She wasn't even bedridden till 2006.

265
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:31,832
Listen, she was a very spry woman
in her day.

266
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:33,584
This one's from 2007.

267
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:36,710
What are you... the money detective?
Give me that.

268
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,549
I don't think that's Bubbie's money.
I think it's my Mom's.

269
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:44,639
Why would your mom have $15,000 in cash

270
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,096
hidden in a hatbox?

271
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,602
What did she do?

272
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,065
She found it.

273
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,017
What are we supposed to be waiting for?

274
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,037
No idea.

275
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:19,847
How will we know when it arrives?

276
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,017
We'll know.

277
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,886
Broadcast number 11: A visit...

278
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:32,194
I saw someone following us.

279
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,652
- Nobody was following us.
- I saw headlights.

280
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:36,880
- Those are fireflies.
- Not in California.

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,198
- It's Silas' weed.
- It's good weed.

282
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,796
I'm so proud.

283
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,595
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

284
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,093
God damn it!

285
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,931
Oh, God, we're so out of here!

286
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,042
- Start the car.
- Calm down.

287
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,840
What if it wasn't a lizard?

288
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,449
What if it's a fucking alien?
I'm all fucked up.

289
00:15:58,569 --> 00:15:59,961
- Take me home.
- I can't.

290
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,731
- Why didn't you bring more snacks?
- Such a good idea.

291
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,342
- Calm the fuck down, or I'll shoot you.
- All right!

292
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:06,760
All right.

293
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,694
Lost my cool.
Bringing it back in.

294
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,141
Oh, God! Under control.

295
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,107
Under control.

296
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:20,055
Drug-smuggling badass waiting for...

297
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,661
don't know what...

298
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,231
in the middle of...

299
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,297
don't know where, with a gun.

300
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,867
- Starting to freak out again.
- Andy!

301
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,250
Where did your mother get this money?

302
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,160
I told you, she found it.

303
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,630
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

304
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,673
- Is your mother a prostitute?
- No.

305
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,134
She wears those dresses all the time

306
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,348
and keeps odd hours and deals in cash.

307
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,138
What happened to all the cheese?

308
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,403
- Is that her pimp?
- My mom is not a prostitute.

309
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,614
Well, she's definitely
a criminal of some kind.

310
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,116
- Did she rob a bank?
- No.

311
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,910
- A costco?
- No.

312
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,620
Is she a coke dealer?

313
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:17,498
No.

314
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,838
What happened to all the cheese?

315
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,184
Weed!

316
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,639
Your mother's a weed dealer.

317
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,724
Give me back her money.

318
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,230
Are we gonna die tonight?

319
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,843
Probably not.

320
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:48,278
Still, we could. Let's say
thoughtful things about each other.

321
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,285
You're... a good person.

322
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,831
You've really stepped up for the kids.

323
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,758
You make me laugh.

324
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,363
I'm glad you're a part of the family.

325
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,172
I miss Yael.

326
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,339
Thank you, Andy. That's very sweet.

327
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:13,487
She might have been the one.

328
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,889
There is no "one,"
Andy. We're all alone.

329
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,726
You're saying Judah wasn't the one?

330
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,504
He died.

331
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:22,187
I'm still here.

332
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:25,796
Holy shit.

333
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:28,892
Oh, holy shit.

334
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:32,429
That can't be good.

335
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,700
It looks like the border patrol

336
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:36,869
or the police.
Or the army.

337
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,856
Shit!

338
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,379
What do we do now?
What do we do? What do we do?

339
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,090
- Don't enjoy this.
- No, no.

340
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:57,848
I know... get a room.
We're moving on.

341
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,141
Identificación?

342
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,186
Honey, are we in Tijuana?

343
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,021
I told you to take a left.

344
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:05,531
 Mujeres, huh?

345
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,478
They like to be bribed.

346
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:11,051
It's a cultural thing.
He won't take offense.

347
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:13,196
- Shut it.
- Kiss me again.

348
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:26,441
- What was that?
- I don't know.

349
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,711
What was the wave?

350
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,586
Oh, God.

351
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,414
- Is that, um...
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:47,656
Shit.

353
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,070
That's a lot of product.

354
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,623
I'm in a Prius.

355
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:58,647
These are police running drugs.

356
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:01,423
It's so corrupt.

357
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,422
We got to move to Mexico.

358
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,607
It was eerie.

359
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,369
Mom lifted up the pillow,

360
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:14,369
and all of a sudden,
there was no noise.

361
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,767
It was just a body there...
not a person.

362
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:20,952
And I kept thinking,

363
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:23,655
"I should be feeling
something right now."

364
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:27,066
But I didn't... I didn't know her,
you know? I didn't...

365
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:30,188
I didn't know her,
so I shouldn't feel bad about it.

366
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:31,692
Right?

367
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,738
Check it out.
Some asshole's van is getting towed.

368
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:38,633
What?

369
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:41,618
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! My plants!

370
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,248
What is all this noise?

371
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:48,667
Our grow house just got towed.

372
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,886
It's a whole operation.

373
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:56,636
Fuck my...

374
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,974
carbon footprint.

375
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,189
I want my S.U.V. back.

376
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,119
Wait. Wait.

377
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,049
Where do I sit?

378
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:17,502
Right here.

379
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,910
On this cooler.
I'll be back in 45 minutes.

380
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:26,440
You're gonna leave me here
in the middle of the desert?

381
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,456
No, don't.

382
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:28,586
No. No.

383
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,503
Leave one of the bags here,

384
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,753
and then we'll come back
and get it later.

385
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:34,787
No way.
It might not be here when we get back.

386
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,969
I'm not telling Guillermo
I lost $50,000 worth of his drugs.

387
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,549
What am I gonna eat?

388
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:43,090
- What am I gonna drink?
- It's 45 minutes!

389
00:21:45,812 --> 00:21:46,997
I'm scared.

390
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:51,781
Here. Here.

391
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,736
I'm still scared.

392
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:02,366
I get it now.

393
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:05,090
- You get what?
- Why women tolerate you.

394
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,244
You kiss well.

395
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:08,761
Really?

396
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:10,557
Really.

397
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,379
Better than Judah?

398
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:14,520
Stay...

399
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:15,729
right...

400
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:16,797
there.

401
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:26,807
45 minutes!

402
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,192
My car was towed.
I'm here to pick it up.

403
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,781
- Make, model, and color?
- It's a van,

404
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,448
over there.

405
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:46,050
You know, you can't park on Ocean

406
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,998
unless you have a sticker.

407
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:49,478
Good to know.

408
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,676
So, how much?

409
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,293
If you don't have a sticker,
I'm supposed to call the cops.

410
00:22:56,788 --> 00:23:00,146
You don't have to do that.
Can we... Can we work this out?

411
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:03,797
I drive my little brother's car pool
to school every day.

412
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,901
I... I need my van.

413
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:10,767
So, where do the kids sit
with all the pot in the back?

414
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,606
Look, man what's it gonna take?

415
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,159
Hey, Weiner.
What's it gonna take?

416
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,615
About 4 ounces.

417
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:27,325
Shit.

418
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,702
Great shit.

419
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:33,415
Seriously, kid,
you got a gift.

420
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,141
Where are you going?

421
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,544
Paris.

422
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,884
If I can get to the aviation club
by tomorrow night,

423
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,468
there's a super satellite
for the World Poker Tour.

424
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:46,260
You can't take Mom's money.

425
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:47,553
It's my money.

426
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:49,633
No, it's not. It's Mom's.

427
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:51,975
She's gonna be pissed if you take it.

428
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:55,103
Well, you tell her to consider it
first month's rent.

429
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:55,996
Also,

430
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:59,405
tell her I expect 10 grand
to be made by direct deposit

431
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,475
on the first of every month
to my Pokerstars account.

432
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,488
Here. I wrote this down.

433
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,658
- "Botwinbig"?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:10,535
My screen name.
That's all you need.

435
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,153
When are you coming back?

436
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:14,581
The minute not-Francie
misses a payment.

437
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,171
You tell her that, too.

438
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,128
Uncle Andy was right.
You're an asshole.

439
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,048
I'm an asshole, and I'm a shit.

440
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:26,116
But let me tell you something,
shmendrick.

441
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:29,096
There's a lesson in this for you.
You know what it is?

442
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,056
Yeah. You're an asshole.

443
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:32,474
Yeah, besides that.

444
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,363
Sometimes life throws you
unexpected surprises.

445
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:39,480
You go looking for something,
you find something else.

446
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,412
Your mother taking out my mother,

447
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,516
it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

448
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:46,988
You know why?
Because Bubbie was my fucking cooler.

449
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,450
I got to get out of this place.
I've been here too long.

450
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,298
You and your drug-dealing mommy,

451
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:55,247
you can stay here and float me
till the market comes back.

452
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,579
Real estate always bounces back.

453
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,920
It's like spaldeens.
You know what spaldeens are?

454
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:04,782
They bounce.

455
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,010
Anyway, wish me luck,

456
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,395
although I don't think
I'm gonna need it.

457
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:10,626
And, uh,

458
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:13,423
let me give you
some grandfatherly advice.

459
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,699
Don't ever play poker.

460
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:18,348
You with the pa-pa-de-de-de,

461
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:20,031
you're a giant tell.

462
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:21,795
All right, kid.

463
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:23,400
Take care.

464
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:40,513
It's Nancy. Leave me a message.

465
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,640
It's Nancy. Leave me a message.

466
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,138
It's Nancy. Leave me a message.

467
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,066
Hola.

468
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:06,568
- Policía?
- No.

469
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:07,573
Amigo.

470
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,276
Esta bien.

471
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,435
Hi.
How's it going? What's up?

472
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:13,448
Hi. Hi.

473
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:14,711
Hello.

474
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,625
- Hello.
- Hola.

475
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,134
You guys heading towards,

476
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,584
Ren Mar?

477
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,802
Davenport. Iowa.

478
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,757
Close enough.

479
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,099
- The Tijuana police?
- Shocking, ain't it?

480
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,216
You didn't have a bigger car?

481
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:42,663
I drove with a duffel of marijuana
in my passenger seat.

482
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,551
- What if I'd been pulled over?
- Take it down a peg, chiquita.

483
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,150
You're here. It's all good.

484
00:26:47,331 --> 00:26:48,485
Yeah, another test.

485
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:49,694
Life is a test.

486
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,972
Enough philosopher king bullshit.
Money, please.

487
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,621
- What is this?
- It's a promotion.

488
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:01,164
Another run?

489
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,624
Those won't start a car.

490
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,084
What will they start?

491
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,087
Meet me this afternoon
by the border at the outlet mall.

492
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:09,974
Clocking out, boss.

493
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:13,969
Who is this bitch?

494
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:17,299
We caught her outside listening.

495
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:19,557
She had a camera.
The lady was taking pictures.
