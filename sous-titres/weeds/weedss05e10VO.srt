<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,091
- Do me up.
- I sold you an eight ball yesterday.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,553
- I need another one.
- How much you got?

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,096
My fiancé said the funniest thing.

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,539
You asked him to kill
some loco DEA agent?

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,559
Gee, thanks.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,101
You did me a solid.

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,979
- We can't get our weed back.
- I will help you.

9
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,406
After I slam his dick

10
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:27,692
- in this drawer.
- I can do this.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,280
I could sell a lot more makeup

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,782
if I give a free gift.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,076
I can't steal their weed.

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,453
Just tell them
that you got ripped off.

15
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,165
I've got a crooked dick
and there's no pot?

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,707
It wasn't my fault.

17
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,212
Eighths go in the compacts.
Half ounces in the eye-shadow kit.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,837
Everyone, let's see that plastic.

19
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:51,257
Adios, losers.

20
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,511
New condo.
I did this all on my own.

21
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,930
Selling You're Pretty! cosmetics.

22
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,223
May I help you, sir?

23
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,350
I want to make money
selling your face chemicals.

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,478
- You think you can handle a full order?
- Damn right, full order. Fill me up.

25
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,271
After the election,
we will be married and be a family.

26
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,149
- What election?
- I'm running for <i>governador</i>.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,320
What the fuck was that?

28
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,029
Her name is Pilar Zuazo.

29
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:16,117
She's jut protecting
my public image.

30
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,318
This little milk ball was a mistake.

31
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,538
I am the father of this child.

32
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,580
Not according
to your dear friend Pilar.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,291
I couldn't put Esteban's name
on the birth certificate.

34
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,711
So you put my name on it.

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,461
You're a frozen margarita, Andy.

36
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:30,755
- I'm a doctor.
- Why did you agree to go out with me?

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,010
I am fascinated by how this is gonna
play out with the gangster baby-daddy.

38
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:36,262
- Marry me.
- Let's go downstairs.

39
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,390
What are they saying?
Find out what's going on!

40
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,267
I love you and you love me,

41
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,568
so I am here, and I am not leaving.

42
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,817
Mom?

Perro Insano

By the Fumistes team.
lesfumistes[at]gmail.com

45
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,833
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!
Is he all right?

46
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:08,961
- Look at all my blood, Mom.
- Is it just his arm? There's...

47
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,756
- There's blood...
- I can't even feel it.

48
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,883
There's two holes.
One in, one out.

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,677
- Through the meat, it missed the bone.
- Is that a good thing?

50
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,096
Put our people on the street.
Bring me a name.

51
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:23,188
You don't shoot at a man
in front of his family.

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,841
It sounded like a slap.

53
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,811
He slapped me with a bullet.
Isn't that weird?

54
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,295
Shane, it's weird
and it's fucked up and it's scary,

55
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,443
and I want to go to the fucking hospital
right fucking now.

56
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,613
Hospitals report bullet wounds
to the police.

57
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,780
I don't care!

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,200
- I need a vodka.
- You're a doctor all of a sudden?

59
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,453
A nurse, in the army.

60
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,061
Like Hot Lips Houlihan?

61
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,825
<i>Caliente</i> lips.

62
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,833
Fuck you! Fuck your mom
in the ass with a screwdriver!

63
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:57,718
What was that?

64
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,094
The shooter.

65
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,467
Fucking A.

66
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,396
I don't get it,
I've been at this all morning.

67
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,162
I found a high-volume area,
followed the script.

68
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,320
- What am I doing wrong?
- This is our corner, get your own.

69
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,862
Cram it, brownie.

70
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,450
- I told you, I'm a nature scout.
- I know what I said.

71
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,825
No one wants your crap.
Go away.

72
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,080
We're trying to send goats
to African people.

73
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,500
- They already have goats.
- Not these goats.

74
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,336
You pinch one more of my sales,
I'm gonna flick you in the God nipple.

75
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,046
It's called a bindi.

76
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,173
Everyone knows it's "bindi."

77
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,009
I love You're Pretty! cosmetics.

78
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,846
- Really?
- Do you know Celia Hodes?

79
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,681
I just started buying from her.

80
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,226
Yes, Celia! Love that woman.
This is the same stuff.

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,951
- Really?
- Yep.

82
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:49,937
Perfect.

83
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,166
Yesterday,
I bought two eye-shadow kits

84
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,233
and I'm already out,
so I'll take two more.

85
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,904
Two eye-shadow kits in one day?
That is hot.

86
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,740
My husband would kill me
if he knew how much I spent on weed.

87
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,220
Yeah, right.

88
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,580
Wait... What are you talking about?

89
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,623
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,021
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:18,132
She thinks you're selling pot
like your friend, you fucking idiot.

92
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,529
It's been a while
since my trauma rotation,

93
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,604
but I'd say
you got pretty lucky here.

94
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,100
If you're gonna get shot, it's good
to get shot the way you got shot.

95
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,985
You didn't tell your mom
about me sending you out there, did you?

96
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,479
I like the bandages.
That Audra does nice work.

97
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,825
Percocet for the pain.
Take it easy with these.

98
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,411
- They're not Mentos.
- That's a lot.

99
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:50,663
I'm just gonna take two
for my headache.

100
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:53,082
Maybe three.

101
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,127
Did she ask about me?

102
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,591
You take this, you watch movies,
you feel better.

103
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,092
About your arm, life,

104
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:04,914
everything.

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,312
All I'm saying is that every time
I think shit can't get more fucked up,

106
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,232
shit gets way more fucked up.

107
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,198
I want to go float in Lake Esteban.

108
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,300
That pool's got a tide.

109
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,387
And me floating in it.

110
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,554
Like a leaf through a filter.

111
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,234
Or a bug.

112
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:38,391
Please don't tell anyone
I was a nurse.

113
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:41,005
No one gets inside. No one...

114
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,303
gets near you.

115
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,971
Do you like my watch?

116
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,387
It's yours.

117
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,114
They will tease me.

118
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,438
Say "medic."

119
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,315
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:01,565
Why?

121
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:04,113
- Because you got hurt.
- I'm okay.

122
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,073
Shane, you got shot.

123
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,032
That was bound to happen
sooner or later.

124
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,597
No, it's not supposed
to happen at all.

125
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,252
"When is he gonna get shot?"

126
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:15,915
It's not crossing your mind
when you pretend to be the Tooth Fairy.

127
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,170
It was this thing that happened today.
Other things happen other days.

128
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,275
- Things will happen tomorrow.
- You're not getting hurt again.

129
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:23,841
I promise you.

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,784
- I'm fine.
- Shane.

131
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,309
Shane, look at me.

132
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:30,378
You're never getting hurt again.

133
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,435
You should be worrying about Stevie Ray.
He's just a baby.

134
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,940
You're still my baby.

135
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,194
You think I can have
that sandwich now?

136
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:57,249
Oh, please...

137
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,785
Like I give a shit.

138
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:02,254
You're a hard man to find.

139
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,449
What are you doing?

140
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:10,888
It's a cup.

141
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,098
Of course.

142
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,435
I need a hookup.

143
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,271
Turn around. Let me see that <i>culo</i>.

144
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,960
Kiss my <i>culo</i>.
I'm looking for <i>drogas</i>.

145
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,194
Weed. Not Mexidick.

146
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,945
I need a steady supply
and I'm not talking

147
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,873
nickel-and-dime bags here.

148
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:32,378
I'm big.

149
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,094
Getting bigger. Major league.

150
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,950
So, you cut me a deal now and later,

151
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,028
I'll let you be my heavy.

152
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,820
You can sniff out
all the assholes in my life

153
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:45,672
and then bury them in the yard.

154
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,544
What's my cut?

155
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,556
Ten percent bonus
after first delivery.

156
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:56,642
I got to go.

157
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:58,852
Twelve? Twelve percent?

158
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:00,925
Fifteen?

159
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,609
- Seventeen point five percent.
- Twenty.

160
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,362
Fine.

161
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,009
Give me a call in a couple of days.
I'll have it ready.

162
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,015
The bullet was meant for me,
wasn't it?

163
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:56,869
You need to take your family
and leave.

164
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,377
No need to keep me in suspense.
Who wants me dead?

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,090
A person who will not stop
until she gets what she wants.

166
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,956
You cannot kill Pilar.

167
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:22,478
You'd be shot
before you even got close.

168
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:27,104
Why don't I start with the person
who's been reporting to her?

169
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,612
What will Esteban do when he finds out
you set up the mother of his only son?

170
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:35,949
- Think it through.
- Why didn't you just let it happen?

171
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,529
I realized your death
would be the end of him.

172
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,834
And his happiness is my happiness.

173
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:48,879
That's pretty gay, nurse Cesar.

174
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,010
I tell you what, I'm gonna forget
your momentary lapse in loyalty.

175
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,403
You spared my life,
I'm sparing yours.

176
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,680
But you owe me, big time.
And you hurt my kid.

177
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,559
So count to three.
Are you right-handed?

178
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,063
Count.

179
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,342
One...

180
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,109
two...

181
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,034
Three.

182
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,957
- There you are.
- Jesus, Andy. Heart attack.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,380
You're stealing from a drug lord.

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,299
Bold. Hot.

185
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:38,544
My clinic has to fight for every swab,
but this stuff is just sitting here.

186
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,919
- Don't rat me out.
- What's my silence worth to you?

187
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:45,182
How about patching up
your 14 year-old nephew's bullet wound,

188
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:47,736
and neglecting to report it
to the police?

189
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,111
No, not enough.

190
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,616
You also have to go out with me.

191
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,193
To hear music, jazz.

192
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,612
Jazz, really? You like jazz?

193
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,123
For sure.

194
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,330
Name one jazz musician.

195
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:02,119
Doctor Teeth.

196
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,871
- He's a Muppet.
- He's a jazz Muppet.

197
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:06,584
Pass.

198
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,860
What? Wait, wait.

199
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:14,056
So, you reject me
over chips and salsa,

200
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:17,150
then you flirt with me
at little Stevie's weenie roast.

201
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,777
And now I'm asking you
on a proper sophisticated jazz date

202
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:21,888
and you pass?

203
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:25,326
I was too harsh on the date,
so I gave you a second look,

204
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,851
and you look good.

205
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,979
Then I looked closer
and that's when I saw it.

206
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:32,441
What? A cancerous mole or something?
How long have I got, Doc?

207
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,976
Give it to me straight.

208
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:35,485
You're hung up on Nancy.

209
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,760
What? Oh, God. No, no, no.

210
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:40,516
It's complicated.

211
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,618
We're family. I'm her baby daddy.

212
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,078
Ink, not sperm. Meaningless.

213
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,149
I'm trying to man up.

214
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,375
So yeah. Maybe I'm a little
tangled in Nancy's drama,

215
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,210
but it's a fledgling effort.

216
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,856
Jesus, Audra, why are you shitting
all over my effort?

217
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,424
Is this an occupational hazard,
aborting everything?

218
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,343
It's not a life yet, Andy.

219
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,240
You're just making excuses.

220
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:05,891
This is why you're single.
You're a hot doctor

221
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,686
but you're alone, 'cause you're always
making excuses instead of taking a risk.

222
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,980
This is a pretty valid
fucking excuse.

223
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,358
You said "fucking". I'm telling.

224
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,313
Goodbye, Andy.

225
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:18,831
Doctor Lehman.

226
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:20,989
Jesus, another one?

227
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,702
Are you stealing?

228
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,052
Is it really hurting?

229
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,530
I can set up a movie for you.

230
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,345
Maybe I can find a porn channel.

231
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,181
I get it.

232
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,772
If I got shot in my jerk-off arm,
I would be mad too.

233
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:57,265
I'm not mad.

234
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,001
How many pills did you take?

235
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,198
None.

236
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,374
Well, that's dumb.

237
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,453
I'll get you a glass of water.
Give me your pills, I'll open 'em.

238
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:12,457
Why have them
if you won't take them?

239
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,066
Because...

240
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:15,891
they're mine.

241
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:25,927
I like the way it feels.

242
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:28,223
Like a knife

243
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,006
popping the same balloon
over and over.

244
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,812
Only you don't have
to blow up a new one.

245
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:38,108
I can make the pain go away anytime
with a pill.

246
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,299
But I don't want to.

247
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,523
I don't have to think
about anything else.

248
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:47,588
It's great.

249
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:54,802
Great.

250
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,549
That's the last of it.

251
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:20,200
- Who knew you had so much stuff?
- Thank you for helping me move in.

252
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,887
I really appreciate it.

253
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:24,946
What's 12 flights of stairs
between partners?

254
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:28,658
Exactly, and we could not risk
using the elevator.

255
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,418
- There's an elevator?
- Where did those idiots

256
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,206
get all this pot anyhow?

257
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,201
Some guy named the Wizard.

258
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,853
Check it out.

259
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,659
Four dead bolts.

260
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,796
Steel-reinforced hinges.

261
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,206
Coded entry system.

262
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:49,429
You really got
this place locked down.

263
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,111
Plus, there is a security gard
downstairs,

264
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,797
and channel 3 on the television

265
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,431
picks up a live feed
of the front gate.

266
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,796
I am protecting our investment.

267
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,943
You are scary good at this.

268
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,195
Thank you.

269
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,948
- I know.
- What if I need to get in?

270
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:13,203
Maybe you need a secret knock.

271
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:14,976
Really?

272
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,605
- Cool, like what?
- I don't know.

273
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,002
Maybe you should make one up.

274
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,719
I got one.

275
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,073
How's that?

276
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,944
Security, there's a sweaty Jew
in my hallway.

277
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,941
- How much?
- A lot of money.

278
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,785
It'll be your bank account.

279
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,571
You can access it with an ATM card
from any country.

280
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,197
Also...

281
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,825
- Pick a place, somewhere far.
- Are you serious?

282
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,828
Europe, go to Europe.
Western Europe, the food's better.

283
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,836
- Amsterdam?
- Sure.

284
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,292
Amsterdam, start there.
I'll get you a Europass.

285
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,538
You can go to museums,
stay in hostels,

286
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,724
seduce traveling Australians.

287
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,548
What's the catch?

288
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,926
There is no catch.
This is what you do when you're young.

289
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,089
You travel through Europe
with a backpack.

290
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,623
Someone in this family
should be doing something normal.

291
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:15,599
Why not you?

292
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,626
I have been replaced
as candidate for governor.

293
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:29,613
You leave tomorrow.

294
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,494
It was Celia, she forced me to lie.
I didn't want to do it.

295
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:39,456
What did she promise you?
Sex? Money?

296
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,708
No, she...

297
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,209
She never promised me anything.

298
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:46,046
Betrayer! Cock-breaker!
How could you do this?

299
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,852
- I didn't have a choice.
- I am belly-up, buddy.

300
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:51,051
You put a key on my kite
in a shitstorm.

301
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,219
I dropped 5 grand on lip liner.

302
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,066
You took away my business.
My splooge doesn't want to come out.

303
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,058
It's stuck in a pocket
between my balls.

304
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,706
How do you think I feel?
She squeezed me out.

305
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,582
I was gonna be a drug kingpin.

306
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,398
I was gonna be Tony Montana.
I got nothing.

307
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,301
- What's with all the moving boxes?
- I gotta give up the space.

308
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,297
- I can't afford to keep it.
- This a fresh pot?

309
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,449
She looted me, buddy.

310
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,785
- Wanna call the Feds?
- I'd be disbarred.

311
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:20,372
- I'd be fine.
- We're in this together.

312
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,791
- Not until we're even.
- Even?

313
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,001
Teeny Deany.

314
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,213
- Dip 'em in.
- What?

315
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,923
Whip 'em out, dip 'em in.

316
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,258
Are you out of your mind?
Get away from me.

317
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,441
You want to go up against Celia?
You're gonna need my help.

318
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:38,515
Drop the pants.
Dunk the Dean nuts.

319
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,475
My ba... No, not my balls.

320
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,644
Yes, balls.
And I see you trying to get hard.

321
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,521
No way! Flaccid in the acid.

322
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,064
- But...
- Dunk.

323
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,210
You have the votes.

324
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:10,579
Why aren't you fighting?
You could win.

325
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,233
I don't know.

326
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,795
Pilar has an army.

327
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,313
You have the people.

328
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,805
In America,
we call it "wagging the dog."

329
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,559
Well, in my country,
dogs travel in packs.

330
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,144
So, that's it? She wins?

331
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,443
She won.

332
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,221
Now, we can be married.

333
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,694
And have a beautiful lavish wedding,

334
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:35,321
with all our friends and family.

335
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:37,574
I will feed you cake.

336
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:43,516
Small ceremony.
No friends. Limited family.

337
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,290
Chocolate cake, Entenmann's.

338
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,836
I cannot put you and your family
in any more danger.

339
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,840
So you would run if it wasn't for me,
if you didn't have a family?

340
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,884
I did not say that.

341
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:58,928
And you would win.

342
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,235
I would win.

343
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,465
Then do it.

344
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,157
So, I gave it some thought,

345
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,451
and I...

346
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:24,496
respectfully decline your offer.

347
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,748
No, you're not declining. No.

348
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,675
- I'm not going.
- This is not up for discussion.

349
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:33,379
Esteban's decided
to run for governor independently.

350
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,799
I'll be sure and wear
his campaign T-shirt.

351
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,891
Which means you not here.

352
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,639
Which means one son less
to keep track of, to worry about.

353
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,474
Shane is here. Stevie is here.

354
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,939
They're kids. You're old enough
to take care of yourself.

355
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,865
Your brothers will be fine.

356
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,997
Say "Excuse me."

357
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,333
I'm announcing in a week.

358
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,863
- You should be gone before then.
- Listen to him.

359
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:03,278
I appreciate you being preemptive
for once in our lives, but...

360
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,191
How is it that I have to beg
an 18 year-old

361
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:07,413
to travel Europe
with a wad of cash and my blessing?

362
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:12,108
How is it that you expect to me believe
that my brothers will be fine?

363
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,587
No one is fine around you.

364
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:16,337
So...

365
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:17,977
I'm staying.

366
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,905
Here, in this house.

367
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,809
This beer is warm.

368
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,889
Someone get me another.

369
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,392
Where's the fucking staff?

370
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:28,990
I have thirst.

371
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,478
No more beer.

372
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:34,149
And you... better protect us.

373
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,452
I can do that.

374
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,107
He can do that.

375
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,431
So, I'll...

376
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,422
move my shit in
and the two of you can...

377
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,290
stop dicking around already
and get married.

378
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,750
And on we'll go.

379
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,643
One big happy...

380
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:05,661
Get in the pool, fags!

381
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,622
You're early,
I'm not even dressed yet.

382
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,355
What's that?

383
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,012
Wedding present.

384
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,234
I filled out all the forms

385
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,826
to put Esteban's name
on the birth certificate,

386
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,850
so sign them and we're done.

387
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:34,760
You didn't make a registry.
So, this will have to do.

388
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:39,009
I actually did make a registry.
Weeks ago. Williams-Sonoma.

389
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:43,009
- We could use a new tortilla warmer.
- I'll get right on that.

390
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,222
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

391
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:52,067
Do you have a...

392
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:54,896
plan?

393
00:21:56,011 --> 00:22:00,005
I'm gonna go back to the house
and spread out my life like a map.

394
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,184
Deliberate on the topography,
chart my path,

395
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,616
maybe call a girl
who calls me on my shit.

396
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,092
You love him.

397
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,668
You're going down a road.

398
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,158
I'm going down a road.

399
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:34,686
- I think I'm happy for you.
- I think I'm happy for you too.

400
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,659
See you downstairs?

401
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:54,849
Guess you and I are husband and wife

402
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:56,812
for the next...

403
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,206
15 minutes.

404
00:24:01,115 --> 00:24:02,434
You want to fuck?

405
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,442
You in my fuck trailer.

406
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,862
I just had a baby, it'd be
like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.

407
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:11,574
You gotta work those Kegels.

408
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,833
I got a cousin, she practiced putting
pressure on a cucumber every day.

409
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:19,352
Then, she stopped,
'cause it got stuck in there.

410
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,210
Three months later,
a pickle fell out.

411
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,795
I'll have to try that.

412
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:27,622
- I could fuck you in the ass.
- That's tempting.

413
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,509
But I'm not here to socialize.

414
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:32,595
Why are you here?

415
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,454
I want her dead.

416
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:47,472
Cake?
