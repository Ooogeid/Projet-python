<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,760
How about moving into my house?
There's plenty of room for the boys.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,470
- Did you ask me to live with you?
- We're going to Denmark.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,181
The Mexican mafia
is not gonna find us in Copenhagen.

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,058
- Mr. Sandusky.
- I need some pot.

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:20,227
- How much can you spend?
- Four grand.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,104
Get in, we'll settle up.

8
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:24,022
To be you!

9
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,151
- What kind of business you got?
- Medical marijuana.

10
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,654
- We're in business, partner.
- Partner.

11
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,322
- Partners.
- Faggots.

12
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:36,535
186,437.96?

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,162
You go out with me,
and I'll get you into that account.

14
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:42,207
Only it has to be as Judah.
You're Judah, and I'm me.

15
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,251
There's nothing weird about that.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,669
You remember Sucio?

17
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,170
He will watch you now.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,756
- Where is Sucio?
- He's missing, there was blood.

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,884
You have to choose, Nancy.
Who is it gonna be?

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,554
I'm not ready to be fucking zen
about who lives or dies.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,139
We chose this life.

22
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,099
For you, for me, for our son.

23
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:00,642
There is nothing

24
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,985
I will not do
to protect that life.

By the Fumistes team
lesfumistes@gmail.com

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,124
Can you smell that?

28
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:27,043
You know the one thing about women
that terrifies me above everything?

29
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,214
- How can she eat that?
- The fact that your periods sync up.

30
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,885
It's not even food,
it's just nitrates and fillers and...

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,678
So freaky and wolfish.

32
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:39,639
- What's a filler?
- I bet you're an alpha she-wolf.

33
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,828
I bet all women in your orbit
snap to your cycle.

34
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,561
- It's terrifying.
- Excuse me.

35
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,354
Not in the habit of butting in,

36
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,815
but those can't be the best
for your baby.

37
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,444
Well, it's not a baby yet
and I'm not keeping it.

38
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,613
An abobo, huh?
Hoovertown,

39
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:59,534
we used to call it "going to Van Nuys,"
cause the place we'd go was in Van Nuys.

40
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,980
Sorry to have bothered you.

41
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:04,206
I've gone to Van Nuys 5 times.
It's no big deal. For me.

42
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:07,088
The ladies tended
to get a little weepy.

43
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,043
Except for Deirdre.

44
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,172
But I found out later
she had Asperger's.

45
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,476
- Five?
- My point is this...

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,397
Science.

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,516
I haven't seen you
since the first ultrasound, how are you?

48
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,976
I've been nauseous.
It's my sense of smell.

49
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,520
Bionic, huh?

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,313
I could be a superhero.

51
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,832
One of the miraculous weirdnesses
of pregnancy.

52
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:32,383
Mostly I smell...

53
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:35,987
the bad things.

54
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,823
I'm surrounded by men.

55
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,505
I breathe through my mouth
so much, my lips chap.

56
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,453
I'm fine, really.
So you do abortions too, right?

57
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,624
- How late is too late?
- You still have some time.

58
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,521
Is this something
you're seriously considering?

59
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,670
I don't know, no.

60
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:55,257
I'll think about it.

61
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:57,467
Everything looks fine.

62
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,886
Try to find an oasis.

63
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:01,749
Create one if you have to.

64
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,933
And I would surround myself
with nice smells.

65
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,478
- What, like flowers?
- I was thinking pancakes.

66
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:11,982
But flowers too, yes.
Herbs, maybe.

67
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,838
Would you like me
to make you another appointment?

68
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,863
- For a follow-up?
- For whatever you decide.

69
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,119
Fucking cockbreath asshole!

70
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:25,905
Dickhead!

71
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,498
Shitbrain! Man-cunt!

72
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,603
Angry rich White children.

73
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,719
You're rich and White, why so angry?

74
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,431
Shane got jacked for his weed.
I just like seeing shit break.

75
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,141
Jacked?

76
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,640
Ripped off. Much pot, no pay.

77
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,020
By his English teacher.

78
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,357
So, what you going to do about it?

79
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,941
- Potting soil.
- Overpopulation.

80
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,915
- Basil.
- Hive collapse.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,038
- Credit default swaps.
- Lavender.

82
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,870
- Somali pirates.
- What's this one?

83
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,002
- North Korean nukes.
- Lovage. Herb lovage.

84
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,787
Mexican drug lord
gangster-politicians.

85
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,200
- Golden oregano.
- <i>American Idol</i>.

86
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,979
Did you know that this baby

87
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:18,256
has a one-in-five chance
of being autistic?

88
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,633
What did I buy marjoram?

89
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,348
And I'm not talking the fun
card-counting savant kind either,

90
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,551
I'm talking zombie-eyes,

91
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,058
soothe-rocking, behelmeted.

92
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:31,019
- What do you think of coriander?
- I think nothing of coriander.

93
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,365
Although it's nice in a curry.

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,524
- You have to get rid of this baby.
- No, I don't.

95
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,739
Flush it. Listen.

96
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,112
I'm coming into some money.

97
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,699
We'll run, get a fresh start.

98
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,577
These are very dark waters

99
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,819
you're swimming in,
even for you.

100
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,417
What are you doing with all this?

101
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,769
I'm gonna plant things,

102
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,857
and they'll bloom and flourish
and smell good, and maybe...

103
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:03,718
the moods will rise
and the dark waters will clear.

104
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,983
Money. Bricks of it wrapped in...
I don't want to tell you.

105
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,251
Gophers and bunnies
are gonna eat your plants.

106
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,516
I'll build a fence.

107
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,789
Well, maybe the gophers
are already inside.

108
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,221
Just waiting and growing.

109
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:18,942
- Shut up!
- Sucking the nutrients from your soil.

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,112
- Shut up!
- You gotta abort that gopher, Nance.

111
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,827
- How's the sample?
- Sucks.

112
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,370
Total ditch weed.

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,623
We only have three good strains
and I'm out of contacts, we're fucked.

114
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,375
That is a pickle.

115
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,244
- You should go see the Wizard.
- Who?

116
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:42,071
Buddy of mine from high school.
Dropped out, went into real estate,

117
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,967
market tanked,
so now he's a pot agent.

118
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,511
- Pot growers have agent?
- Sure.

119
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,014
Growers are usually too stoned
to do math.

120
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,057
That's true. Math is hard.

121
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,560
- I'll set up a meeting for you, Si.
- Me too!

122
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,411
I want the hookup
for the meeting and the buying.

123
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,023
Negotiations can be tricky.

124
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,483
Fuck off! I'm a master negotiator.

125
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,192
Besides, you can't negotiate.

126
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,112
No one's gonna take
a blond man seriously.

127
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,630
Hooked, hooked!

128
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:32,562
Hello?

129
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,393
Who's there?

130
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,146
- I have a gun.
- Don't shoot, it's me.

131
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,776
Liar, you don't have a gun.

132
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,404
You're squatting in my garage?

133
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:47,448
I have nowhere to go.

134
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:49,700
My family is in ruins.

135
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,105
Shards.

136
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,164
They left me to rot in Mexico.

137
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,390
- Get out of my life.
- Cancer.

138
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,383
Loss of station.

139
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,999
Loss of tooth.

140
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:05,007
- You threw away my tooth.
- Get out of my life.

141
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,303
I just lose and lose and lose and lose
and you have everything.

142
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,781
Get out of my life.

143
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,765
And now, a baby.

144
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,733
A Mexican baby, but still.

145
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,689
So, allow me
this tiny little pathetic crumb...

146
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,082
To stay in your garage

147
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,569
while I figure out
what the fuck I'm doing with my life.

148
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,737
Albatross,

149
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:29,281
my own personal cinder block.

150
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,726
Two days. I don't want to see you.

151
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,664
Thank you, Nancy.

152
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,503
Can I have my old job back
at the maternity store?

153
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:58,669
Fuck!

154
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:00,979
Botwin?

155
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,191
- That's right, motherfucker.
- And Hodes, jerk.

156
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,027
- Don't mess with her, she's <i>loco</i>.
- I really am.

157
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,448
Get the fuck out of here before I kick
your nards in, you little cock goblin.

158
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,283
With your fake gun.

159
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,835
Take nerd girl with you.
Your usual sidekicks are much hotter.

160
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:22,209
You know that lesson you taught
on point of view in fiction?

161
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,379
It was really helpful, Mr. S.
I think I get it now.

162
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,924
To you, I'm just some dumb kid
you can rip off.

163
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,968
From my perspective,

164
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,927
you're that titanic loser of a teacher
I once had

165
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,765
who jacked the wrong kid.

166
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:42,312
Unfortunately, you're also now part
of our friend Ignacio's story.

167
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:43,975
And your chapter

168
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,000
is very very short.

169
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,779
Here, it's all there.

170
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,550
- Take it.
- I didn't ask your permission.

171
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,408
You faux-adult, you skidmark!

172
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,410
You apartment makes me sad.

173
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,738
Take something else.

174
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,999
For penalty.

175
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:05,169
Okay... the Ray Bans.

176
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,089
And the rollerblades.
Is it a Zune?

177
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,507
Take that.

178
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Not my axe.

179
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,830
Okay. Now that you called it your axe,
I'm for sure taking it.

180
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,976
Now shoot him in the leg.

181
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,983
Not the bird!
I meant the man!

182
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,737
Poor little birdie. Go!

183
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,700
Aging goofball.
Career in the shit tank.

184
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,833
Middle class kid. Lost.

185
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,270
Not smart enough for academics,
not talented enough for sports.

186
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,166
My point,

187
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,794
you two don't strike me
as a particularly serious duo.

188
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,415
We are serious, bro.

189
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,590
Serious as ass cancer,
serious as Nagasaki,

190
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,133
serious as a Sean Penn movie.

191
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,114
Look,
we've got a solid business plan,

192
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,089
a community itching
for legal product,

193
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:00,015
and your buddy C.P.,
he's got our back.

194
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,999
C.P. is functionally retarded.

195
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,849
I used to hang out with him
'cause his step mom had Jell-o Pops

196
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:07,231
and his sister let me finger-bang her
in the pool-house.

197
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:10,067
Fucking loved Pudding Pops.

198
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,861
Why don't they make those anymore?
You know what I mean?

199
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,988
I stock everything
in your dispensary.

200
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,324
And I mean everything.

201
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,458
Great. Perfect.

202
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,537
- We're in.
- Okay.

203
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,854
Let's do the paperwork.

204
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,598
So we'll start
with the small-market contracts.

205
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,631
- Adding the 75$ delivery fee.
- Whoa, whoa, there. Delivery fee?

206
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,256
- We have to pay our drivers.
- You have to pay your drivers.

207
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:37,992
- Doug.
- Let me negotiate. This is what I do.

208
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,138
No deal, Wizard.

209
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:44,101
Fuck you and your bullshit charges
in the butt.

210
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,604
- It's a standard fee.
- Okay, here's my counter offer:

211
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:49,439
eat my balls.

212
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,589
Sorry, Wizard.
Shut up.

213
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:54,518
If you can't take the stress
of tough negotiations, maybe...

214
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,322
Did you hit "save" first?
That's a very unstable operating system.

215
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,161
- We're done here.
- Please...

216
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:11,598
You say you validate?

217
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,956
Dead Mexican!

218
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,651
Dead Mexican.

219
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:36,609
Dead Mexican.

220
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:40,304
Dead Mexican!

221
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,124
It's me. Still...

222
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,834
Still weighing
the whole moving-in thing.

223
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,117
But guess who I ran into?

224
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,062
Our old friend Sucio.

225
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,731
He's looking a little stiff,

226
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,901
so if you could send someone
to pick him up

227
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:17,562
soon.

228
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,834
He's hanging out in the garage.

229
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,490
Okay, bye.

230
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:26,525
Keep him company.

231
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,447
I didn't realize we were going
full period with this thing.

232
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,273
I would have worn
my Loverboy headband.

233
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,830
I look ridiculous. I knew it.

234
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:41,267
- But my guild encouraged me.
- No, Mags, you look...

235
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,096
- Your guild?
- Online gaming world.

236
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:45,792
I'm a mage.

237
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,101
Believe it or not, I'm actually
pretty outgoing and popular there.

238
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,902
Popular in the game as a mage.

239
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,563
My spell-hit ratio
is like off the charts.

240
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,104
You think I'm pathetic.

241
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm dressed like Molly Ringwald.

242
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:04,946
Sorry, I have this fierce imagination.
I always have.

243
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:06,743
No, it's admirable actually.

244
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,991
I can't remember
the last time I imagined anything.

245
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:11,958
That is so sad.

246
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,139
Fondue.

247
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,297
- This is where we went on our date.
- Totally exciting.

248
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,913
I happen to love dipping things
into other things.

249
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:24,537
The fun is that
you get to cook the meat yourself.

250
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,257
That's what Judah said.
What you said.

251
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:29,224
What I... Yes, what I said.

252
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,392
Me, Judah.

253
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,729
You cook it yourself.

254
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,286
What made you finally ask me out?

255
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,698
I mean, you're such a stud muffin.

256
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:47,367
I guess when I saw you at the...

257
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:49,911
At the food court,
I worked at Hot Dog on a Stick.

258
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,086
The way that you handled
the batter...

259
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:54,555
I saw you and I figured...

260
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm just here for the summer,

261
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,255
and life is short,
and people are such phonies...

262
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,280
Like J. D. Salinger said.

263
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,802
Oh, my God, you always quoted that.

264
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,552
That's right.
Judah read that book every summer.

265
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:12,251
Phonies. Goddamn phonies.

266
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,305
But you're not a phony, Mags.

267
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,822
You're real.

268
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,733
And I'm real.

269
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,493
Me, Judah.

270
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,095
Let's be real together.

271
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,327
I want you to take my virginity.

272
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,239
What the hell is that?
Hi, Isabelle.

273
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:08,793
It's a theremin.

274
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,909
It's one of the earliest
electronic instruments.

275
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:13,495
Super. What's it doing in my house?

276
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,831
We found it. By a dumpster.

277
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,621
You don't have to lie to her.

278
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,694
I was selling
Silas' leftover cheese pot.

279
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,879
My shitball teacher jacked my stash.
So I jacked him back.

280
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,841
Ignacio helped us.

281
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:32,138
- You helped Shane rob his teacher?
- You're welcome.

282
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:37,060
I can't live like this anymore.
What have I allowed in my house?

283
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,564
Shane was a good kid.
Now he's robbing his teacher.

284
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,185
I am so sorry

285
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:47,802
that I exposed him
to the world of criminal activities

286
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,765
for the first time.

287
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,676
Silas, come here. Look at this.

288
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,726
A self portrait
from my blue balls period.

289
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,248
Ever get tired
of being a complete joke?

290
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,633
What?

291
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm delightful. People love me.

292
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,277
Not to be in business with you.

293
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,279
I was a well-respected CPA.

294
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,531
Notice the use of the past tense?

295
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,831
You hurtful toothy little shit!

296
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,161
Teefy!

297
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:37,621
Man boobs.

298
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,290
You don't make up the names.
That's my thing. Goldilocks.

299
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,751
No, I could do better.
Mormon face.

300
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,629
Gigantor, embezzler.

301
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:47,172
Girlfriend deporter.

302
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,966
Stop it, deaf girl fucker.
Deaf fucker!

303
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,509
Bad dad! Abandoner!

304
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,428
Orphan father-killer!

305
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,524
I'm sorry, Doug.

306
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,293
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,181
I just say things.

308
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,922
Sometimes...

309
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,474
Sometimes I actually think
I'm slightly retarded in the mouth.

310
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,110
And you didn't kill your father.

311
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:21,514
Shane did.

312
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,726
The body is where?

313
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,161
So, what are you gonna do, exactly?

314
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,415
Is that acid?

315
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,526
Do you have to cut him up
into little pieces before?

316
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,546
Lady leaves now.
Goes gets a falafel or something.

317
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,589
I don't really have anywhere to go.

318
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,426
I'm sort of between things,
right now.

319
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:18,013
Fresh from a spell with some
revolutionaries in your country.

320
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,931
Rudolfo, you know him?

321
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,100
Piercing eyes, total vagina.

322
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,869
Nancy is tossing me out on my ass.

323
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,023
And I finally understand

324
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,167
what Rudolfo meant
when he babbled on

325
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,444
about the powerless
needing to use their weakness

326
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,988
as an advantage.

327
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:38,033
I just wish that I had something
that I could use...

328
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,511
We were right here.

329
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,309
It was so romantic.

330
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,098
Here?

331
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,104
Give me your jacket.

332
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,852
You were talking
about how lame <i>Footloose</i> was.

333
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,606
And I kept thinking
"When is he gonna jump me?"

334
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,484
- I love <i>Footloose</i>.
- That's Judah's gay brother talking.

335
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,652
I mean...

336
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,065
Queer bait.

337
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,302
All the dancing, homo-city...

338
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,533
Judah, you're so fucking boss.

339
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,997
Judah, stick it in me.

340
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,665
You really just said that.

341
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,126
Judah, bork me with your hot tool!

342
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,504
And you said that too?

343
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:36,049
Is anything wrong?

344
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,426
- Should I suck you?
- No, no, that's...

345
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:41,387
I mean, that's not what we did.

346
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,348
You're right. I was like this.

347
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,033
Come on, Judah, make me a woman.

348
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,522
- Maybe we should save ourselves.
- You want the money or don't you?

349
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:51,981
You know what I want.

350
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,817
Judah!

351
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:55,775
Copenhagen.

352
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,362
Copenhagen.

353
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,414
What do you know? Imagination.

354
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,246
God, Copenhagen.

355
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,426
Judah, yes! Judah!

356
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,932
Bork me! Bork me!

357
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,407
Hi, Nancy Botwin.

358
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,242
I'm Shane's mother.

359
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,704
Could you put down the bat?

360
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:51,465
Thanks.

361
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:55,560
We brought back
your instrument thingy intact.

362
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,982
And a replacement animal companion.

363
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,731
It's an iguana.
They eat greens and fruits.

364
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,723
Birds carry germs,
it's a major turn-off for the ladies.

365
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:11,309
I brought back
your rollerskates, sunglasses,

366
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,681
I'm gonna have to give you an IOU
on the video thing.

367
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,814
Anyway, Shane?

368
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,985
I'm sorry I killed your cockatoo.

369
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,112
He was an innocent casualty
of youthful vengeance.

370
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,990
He taught me a valuable lesson

371
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,950
about the destructive power
of fire arms.

372
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,136
So, his death was not in vain.

373
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,277
You're getting an F,
now get the fuck out.

374
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,336
- That wasn't necessary.
- You killed Seacrest.

375
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,255
- And he apologized.
- Get the fuck out of my apartment.

376
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,799
That was really dumb.

377
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,676
- What are you doing?
- Mom?

378
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,764
Stealing from students is a no-no.

379
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,349
It's unseemly,

380
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,418
not to mention gross abuse
of your position,

381
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:54,145
you're never gonna do it again.

382
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,605
I won't, I'm sorry.

383
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,399
- Can I kick him?
- No. By the way, you're grounded.

384
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,818
No video games, no Twittering,

385
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,862
nothing electronic,
it's desensitizing.

386
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,385
Puts you out of touch
with your humanity.

387
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:07,283
You can't afford that.

388
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:14,040
Remember, fruits and greens.
Take care of him.

389
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,960
This is gonna be
a whole new start for you.

390
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,390
I'm going into your house
to take a bath.

391
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,018
Try it
and the toaster goes in with you.

392
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,599
Do you want to know
what I did tonight?

393
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:34,143
I watched a dead body

394
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,431
get removed from your old coldspot,

395
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:39,232
and sealed into a barrel of acid.

396
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,653
Those guys were so sweet,

397
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:47,093
they even let me take some choice photos
before they left.

398
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,117
Look, it's Nancy's house.

399
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:53,294
So yes, I think that I will be
taking that bath,

400
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:57,329
and also I think
I'll be living in that garage

401
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,085
for as long as I want.

402
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,358
I'll need some cash
to fix the place up.

403
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,983
I hear Ikea is having a tent sale.

404
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:07,278
Selfish pregnant cunt.

405
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:09,917
Good night.

406
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:23,943
They're dead.

407
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,349
All dead.

408
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,324
Snuffed out.

409
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:31,117
Bunnies.

410
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:33,528
Slugs.

411
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,538
Black fucking slugs.

412
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:38,875
They're everywhere.

413
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,546
It's an inside job.

414
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,897
I put barriers up, they just...

415
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,478
slipped right through.

416
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,344
I got the money.

417
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:52,380
- There's a lot.
- What? How?

418
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:53,681
It doesn't matter...

419
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:58,054
I need a shower.
I need to be sandblasted.

420
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,938
I need a hug.
The point is, I have it.

421
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,254
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

422
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:11,627
It isn't safe here anymore.
It's all wrong.

423
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:15,703
You know
Celia's living in the garage?

424
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,333
Yes, we had a nice long conversation
about what happens when flesh hits acid.

425
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:24,489
Why is fucking Armageddon
always coming down on me?

426
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:27,502
You do it.

427
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,634
You do know that?

428
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,303
You have to know that it's all you.

429
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,259
Forget Van Nuys.

430
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,655
Keep the baby, it does not matter.

431
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,492
But we leave.

432
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,987
- Shane did something...
- That's why we have to go.

433
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,288
It's not safe here.
Even your plants...

434
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,470
- But Esteban...
- Leave him a note.

435
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,167
- A note?
- Write him a note,

436
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,800
like the olden times.

437
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,587
Break his heart in ink.

438
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,382
He will understand if he loves you.

439
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,468
- I do have a nice handwriting.
- In the morning,

440
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:13,637
we go.

441
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,518
I'll throw some Ambien
in Ignacio's smoothie

442
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,850
and we hit the road
as soon as his eyes close.

443
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,643
- Andy.
- Tomorrow night,

444
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,244
we're someplace new.

445
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:28,213
It doesn't even have to be Copenhagen.
It can be fucking Van Nuys.

446
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,696
Wherever. We're a family.

447
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,307
And then, we're done with all this.

448
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,708
And we'll be safe.
I know that I'm just, you know...

449
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:41,858
I'm Andy, but...

450
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:46,217
We could be more.
I would like to try.
