00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:03,183
Hello.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:04,964
- Hi.
- My son.

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:06,737
Tim and I were just gonna
play a game.

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm just not really
very good at games.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:11,325
Well, my mom is. I guess
she's a lot smarter than you.

6
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:12,822
Kesheshian says goodbye.

7
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,824
- Peter... he's dead?
- Yes!

8
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,372
Agent Fundis, D.E.A.

9
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,124
I'm here to talk about
Peter Scottson.

10
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:20,489
- I'm his partner.
- The one who burps?

11
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,095
I get stares.
Children cry and run away.

12
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:25,692
Want you to give a friend
of mine a call.

13
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,953
We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses.

14
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:29,135
Needs a caterer.

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,390
I'd like to solve the mystery
of the school

16
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:32,722
that receives federal funding

17
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,933
yet permits a religious
curriculum in direct violation

18
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,227
of church/state separation
mandates.

19
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,028
Sit down, Shane Botwin.

20
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,500
I have cancer.

21
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,107
Puppies are coming off, Nance.

22
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:46,736
After reconstructive surgery,
you're gonna feel good as new.

23
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:50,897
I'm separated,
dancing my way to divorce.

24
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,643
You're gonna help me
celebrate.

25
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:56,381
My last two relationships...
both guys ended up dead.

26
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,334

29
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:00,519
Captain.

30
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,149
All right, Fundis,
tell me a story.

31
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,612
A man flying a kite
found Scottson.

32
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,135
We think he was stuffed
in a drainpipe

33
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:16,273
until a grate busted
in the rain and...

34
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,326
Up came Pete.

35
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,298
Can't you take something for that?

36
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,584
I've tried everything,
Captain.

37
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:24,943
Well,
pop a fuckin'breath mint.

38
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:28,086
- What did you eat, pastrami?
- On rye, Sir.

39
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:29,208
What else, Fundis?

40
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:32,077
Well, a close-range shot
to the head.

41
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:33,529
It's ugly.

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,209
Who, why, when?

43
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,206
I've been trying to figure
that out since he went missing.

44
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,489
You know, retracing his steps,
asking...

45
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,942
What's that?

46
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,190
Summer reading
from internal affairs.

47
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,085
Quite the ripping yarn.

48
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:56,616
Retracing his steps?

49
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,540
How about covering your ass?

50
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,968
You got another story
you want to tell me, Fundis?

51
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,097
My career just took a swan dive
into a shitcan.

52
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,958
I want to thank you for that.

53
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,235
I'd like to thank Pete, too,

54
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:09,754
since it appears
he was the brains

55
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,282
behind the skimming,
extortion, wiretapping,

56
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:16,014
evidence-planting operation
you two had going.

57
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,205
But good thing for us
he turned up the way he did

58
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,722
and we don't have to
get honest.

59
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:21,283
So here's the new story,

60
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:23,851
agent asshole motherfucker
choke-on-my-dick.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,143
You got three days to find
whatever money is left over

62
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:28,609
from your little side business,

63
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,587
and before you clean out your
locker for early retirement,

64
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,084
take your uniform
to the dry cleaner's

65
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:37,922
'cause we have a fucking hero
to stick in the ground.

66
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,666
Peter Scottson served
with dignity and honor

67
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,984
in one of
our most difficult jobs.

68
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,837
And for those of us here today,
there will be no rest

69
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,881
until those who put him here
are brought to justice.

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,415
Dear Lord...

71
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,427
We sadly send you
another son in blue.

72
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,538
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

73
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:03,154
Amen.

74
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,067
Hello?

75
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,390
What are you wearing?

76
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,656
<i>You gave me the day off, boss.</i>

77
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,964
Oh, come on.
Indulge a pervert.

78
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,170
Black dress, black shoes,
black everything.

79
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,220
Bet you look better in red.

80
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:43,181
Not appropriate
for faking grief.

81
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,057
Don't know what that means.
Don't care.

82
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,712
<i>- I bought you a gift.</i>
- You should take it back.

83
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,805
<i>Don't you want to know
what it is?</i>

84
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,249
It's my day off.

85
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,772
When are we gonna have sex again?

86
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,821
When I'm feeling desperate again.

87
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:01,783
<i>And when do you think
that might be?</i>

88
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:56,115
You get lost on your way
to forest lawn?

89
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:00,866
Never knew the man.

90
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:04,651
Is Conrad around?

91
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,324
Do you see Conrad?

92
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,703
How about one time...
just for laughs...

93
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,175
I'll ask you a question,
and you maybe answer me,

94
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,731
you know, like a human?

95
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,059
What can I say?

96
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,485
You bring out the "fuck you"
in me.

97
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,944
Fine. Moving on.

98
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,813
Bringing good news.
You're free.

99
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,992
Abe Lincoln beat you to it.
What else you got?

100
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:27,577
I took care of your debt.

101
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,954
You don't owe Marvin anything.

102
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,544
I mean, you're gonna
have trouble

103
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:34,130
moving your shit on the streets,
but you still have me.

104
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,877
I have a new territory
opening up,

105
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:38,240
three times the size
of Agrestic, so...

106
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,541
You're welcome.

107
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,394
No thanks necessary,
since I assume...

108
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,638
None are coming.

109
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,639
- What's that?
- I'm making a buy.

110
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:57,139
Little miss Nancy do-good
burying her boyfriend

111
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,266
and back to dealing dime bags.

112
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,961
All things
in their proper place.

113
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,769
Praise Jesus,
blah, blah, blah...

114
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,429
Oh, am I boring you?

115
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,816
Well, I will stop
wasting your precious time.

116
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,909
We're a bulk business now,

117
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,834
so you can take your little
milk money down to the corner.

118
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,822
- Can I talk to Conrad?
- He's over with the pot clubs.

119
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:23,216
Large customers
with large money.

120
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,760
Now, you come back
with five figures,

121
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,337
and we'll do business.

122
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:29,860
Hell...

123
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,086
I'll even throw in a fountain.

124
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:48,574
Hey, Nance.

125
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:49,872
Doug.

126
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,048
Cooking in my kitchen.

127
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,372
There's a reason for that.

128
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,249
Andy's on set.
I'm helping him out.

129
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,217
Oh, that's nice.

130
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,994
Oh, that's from the tall one.

131
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:03,053
Leif garrett-y,
"blue lagoon-ish."

132
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:07,167
Said you were out of weed,
then took off with a blonde,

133
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,137
- tiny tits, big cross.
- Tara.

134
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,265
And your other one, big
vocab, creepy eyes.

135
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,494
He's outside
with what's-her-name.

136
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:17,426
- Celia's dyke.
- Isabelle.

137
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,165
Hey, Mrs. Botwin.

138
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,577
Hello, Isabelle, Shane.

139
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:24,750
An unlikely duo.

140
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,159
We've bonded through sin.

141
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,443
And school suspension.

142
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:30,412
- Suspension as in...
- Don't come back until you love Jesus.

143
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:32,741
- They call it reflection.
- And we got three days of it.

144
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,355
And how are we
going to reflect?

145
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,136
Wii tournament.

146
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,165
My first paycheck!

147
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,330
My son's bringing in
more money than I am.

148
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,353
Any chance I could borrow
$10,000?

149
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:02,238
How fast can you turn it around?

150
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:05,679
Seriously? I'll turn
it around in a month.

151
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,800
You got 10 grand?

152
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,861
If you could form a dummy corp
and I form a dummy corp

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,339
and you can find a supplier to accept
the check, I know an

154
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:14,760
accountant/councilman

155
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:16,760
with access to a certain
civic investment

156
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,098
- portfolio
- can you do it?

157
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,693
- have before.
- Do it.

158
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:24,845
Make it $50,000.

159
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,029
Aguatecture.

160
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:28,980
What is that, a colonic spa?

161
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,786
Shane, where's your
karate contact sheet?

162
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,500
Drawer by the coffee maker.

163
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,920
All right, Lex, come on, baby.

164
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:50,346
Big finish.

165
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,372
Show them how they do it
in jersey, baby.

166
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:55,101
Oh, yes! Lovely, people!

167
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,498
Cut! Cut!

168
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,926
Let's take a break.
Everybody, rinse out.

169
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,390
- We'll be back in 10.
- Wow Paul, great scene.

170
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:03,670
You're really an artist.

171
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,923
Well, thanks. We don't hear
that enough in this business.

172
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:11,559
And that's a tragedy. I mean, the
genre's been hijacked by amateurs, sure,

173
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,217
but when I see
your attention to detail...

174
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,164
the framing, the risks you take...

175
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,632
it makes this viewer...

176
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,208
I guess you should know.

177
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:23,193
- I've always wanted to...
- Be in porn?

178
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,209
Every caterer does.

179
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,886
Well, I think I could be great.

180
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,388
Look, I respect your ambition,

181
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,120
and I'd love to make it happen
for you, but I work with gods.

182
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,351
Jessica, she comes like a fountain.

183
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,731
Lex is packing a fucking Buick.

184
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,999
It's all about that something
special in this business.

185
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,385
What makes you special, Andy?

186
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,099
"Footfuckers," scene 1,
"A" camera, mark.

187
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,782
And action.

188
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:55,865
Coming!

189
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:01,677
Hello.

190
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,211
I have a package for Mrs. Dowling.

191
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,961
Are you authorized to sign for it?

192
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,779
Your feet must be aching

193
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,578
from all the walking around that you do.

194
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:12,363
Well, there's a lot of walking.

195
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:16,177
Well, why don't you come inside
and, uh... Take your shoes off?

196
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,761
Oh, that's right.

197
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,577
Use your something special, kid.
show me what you got.

198
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:23,935
Use that big toe!

199
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:26,007
That's fucking great!

200
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:29,606
"Foot Fuckers 2: Viva Las Vegas"
Scene 1, "a" camera, mark.

201
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:31,319
And action.

202
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,256
Coming!

203
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,266
Room service.

204
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,001
I ordered that about two hours ago.

205
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,115
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the elevator got stuck.

206
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,653
I had to climb all 43 floors
to get here.

207
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,936
Well, your feet must be killing you.

208
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,483
Listen, there's a huge market for these
fetish videos, mostly eastern Europe.

209
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,755
You're gonna be a huge star in Belarus.

210
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,039
I mean, huge!

211
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:57,385
Good! Good!
Get dirty, Andy! Get dirty!

212
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,867
I finish with
the backyard, Mrs. Dowling.

213
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,334
Okay, okay, thrust.

214
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,869
- Thrust!
- Oh, cramping, cramping, cramping!

215
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,568
Well, if it isn't the music man
of Majestic.

216
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:29,011
My partner in altruistic bullshit.

217
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,106
How are you this afternoon,
councilwoman?

218
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,795
<i>Smiling.</i>

219
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:35,749
You got my gift?

220
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,499
Not why I'm smiling.

221
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,047
<i>But, yes, I did.</i>

222
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,642
<i>Piece of advice...</i>

223
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,994
never send a woman a dress
she might not fit into.

224
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:50,109
- Did you try it on?
- <i>It's a size 2.</i>

225
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,127
Flattering and annoying
at the same time.

226
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:56,036
<i>I thought your breasts
would look good in red.</i>

227
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,820
Well, it's a nice thought.

228
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,791
Listen... I want to see you.

229
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:06,924
Wear whatever dress you want
or no dress at all.

230
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:08,733
I'm almost divorced.

231
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:10,433
Mazel tov.

232
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:11,625
<i>Would you...</i>

233
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,179
Like to help me celebrate?

234
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,418
You know where I live.

235
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,776
I do. I do, indeed.

236
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,297
See you, councilwoman.

237
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,714
Are you sure you want to do this?

238
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,912
Yeah.

239
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,413
All right, hold it up to your
mouth and I'll light it.

240
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,677
- How is it?
- It's...

241
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,698
kind of gross.

242
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,213
You feel anything different?

243
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,655
I feel like I want to brush my teeth.

244
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,201
Maybe it's bad shit.

245
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,151
But my dad gets it from your mom.

246
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,891
You know... My mom's... A drug dealer?

247
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:01,833
I saw her come over once.

248
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,175
I didn't tell anyone.

249
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,345
I won't tell anyone.

250
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,424
Thanks.

251
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,193
You gonna try it?

252
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:17,613
Yeah.

253
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,224
This is that moment where
I finally become cool, right?

254
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,032
No.

255
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,180
Just stoned.

256
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:04,925
Stop it.

257
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,816
That's very funny, Tim. Open the door.

258
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:22,846
Open the fucking door!

259
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,216
You don't talk to me.

260
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,218
- You can talk to me about anything.
- No, I don't want to talk to you!

261
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,839
Thanks.
that was my first boob.

262
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,051
How was it?

263
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:04,255
Good.

264
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,257
Do you want to touch my...
you know?

265
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,897
Not really into penises.

266
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,490
Why haven't we ever
hung out before?

267
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:24,033
I don't know.

268
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,271
My mom hates your mom?

269
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:30,833
I think my mom's secretly
in love with your mom.

270
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,803
I think my dad loved me
more than my mom does.

271
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,210
My mom's a bitch.

272
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,103
But I miss her.

273
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,588
I don't know why.

274
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:47,556
Do you feel stoned?

275
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,426
I guess.

276
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,189
I don't see
what the big deal is.

277
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:54,483
Yeah.

278
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:55,881
I prefer beer.

279
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,244
I prefer touching your boob.

280
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,593
You want to make a buy?

281
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,978
I said,
would you like to make a buy?

282
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,020
All right, let's just cut.

283
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:35,691
Cut.

284
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,166
You did great, kid,
you really did. Come on up.

285
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:39,969
You got
your foot in the door --

286
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:42,480
or in this case,
your foot in Jessica.

287
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:45,889
- Hey, go get Lex.
- Wait, wait ! That's it?

288
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,419
"Thanks for the foot.
go warm up the hot dogs"?

289
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,855
- I've been working all day here.
- What do you want, a medal? It's a job.

290
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,639
And, yeah...
go warm up the hot dogs.

291
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,808
Well, that's bullshit.

292
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:00,818
Hey, I'm talking to you,
Paul St. Moritz!

293
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,508
You know, I always stood up
for pornography.

294
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,582
I believed in it. I thought
it provided an essential service,

295
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,840
light up a young person's
imagination,

296
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:13,358
help a sexless marriage,
keep a predator off the street!

297
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,835
I thought porn was magical.

298
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,788
Now I see it
for what it really is.

299
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:20,736
It's a flesh factory,
and we are all slabs of meat.

300
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:25,569
Lex here is not an unbelievably
enormous dick.

301
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:27,519
And I'm not a foot.

302
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:30,002
- You're not a foot, Andy.
- Thanks, Lex.

303
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,225
We're human beings.

304
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:33,765
I gave you my something special,
and you ate it.

305
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:38,680
You took something beautiful,
like Jessica's vagina,

306
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,656
and you made it
just a place to put a foot.

307
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,612
You need to do some
soul-searching, my friend.

308
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:48,253
This whole industry does.

309
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:53,529
It exploits, it dehumanizes,
it degrades men.

310
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,720
Everybody back to one.

311
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,256
{\}Back to one!{\}

312
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:00,934
This is from Nancy.

313
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:03,984
First time I ever took a check.

314
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:06,077
She says
she wants her fountain.

315
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:10,617
Conrad!

316
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:15,092
- And what's your name?
- Judah.

317
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:18,848
- And this is...
- Sunshine.

318
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:20,534
Is that right?

319
00:21:21,102 --> 00:21:23,694
Well, Mr. Judah, Ms. Sunshine,

320
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:26,576
you tell the city of Agrestic
we're impressed.

321
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,094
And you tell Nancy
if this check bounces...

322
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,672
- She better start running.
- I'll do that.

323
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,295
Stop.

324
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:44,328
- I want to, but I can't.
- Stop.

325
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,629
I have cancer.

326
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,441
I had cancer.

327
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,092
They cut them off.

328
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,253
These are, uh...

329
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:03,728
Spare parts.

330
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:08,422
I don't care.

331
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:33,319
- No, I need to leave my top on.
- Celia Hodes,

332
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:38,916
you're a smart,
ambitious, sexy woman.

333
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,998
I'm embarrassed.

334
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:45,810
I haven't gotten hard
on my own for two years.

335
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,986
I've been popping
magical boner pills.

336
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:51,317
- Magical boner pills?
- Yeah.

337
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,216
I took one in your driveway
half an hour ago.

338
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,531
Do you like my penis any less?
{\}Hmm?{\}

339
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,012
No. No, I don't.

340
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,572
We're used.

341
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,879
It doesn't mean
we can't be sexy.

342
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:15,232
Doesn't mean we can't
-- pardon my language,

343
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,252
fuck like bunnies.

344
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:34,580
Cool.

345
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:53,045
If I still had feeling in my nipple,
I bet that would be amazing.

346
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,185
All right, enough.
Listen to me.

347
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:58,319
<i>I barely know you.</i>

348
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,715
<i>But the first time I saw you,</i>

349
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:04,334
<i>there was something about you
that was so familiar,</i>

350
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,764
<i>familiar in the best way.</i>

351
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:12,005
<i>Like we shared something, like...</i>

352
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:13,861
<i>we had a secret.</i>

353
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:16,848
<i>I just want to know you.</i>

354
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:18,283
<i>I don't know why.</i>

355
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,194
<i>I just do.</i>

356
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,542
<i>Okay. Stop talking.</i>

357
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,753
- Hello.
- Hi

358
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:40,929
Mrs., uh, botwin.

359
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:43,299
- That's me.
- I'm Valerie.

360
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,915
You want to take a step up
to the X-ray machine?

361
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:47,147
Okay.

362
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,780
- You're the doctor?
- Oh, no, doctor's at lunch.

363
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:58,230
I just take the X-rays.
You can take out your breast.

364
00:24:58,796 --> 00:24:59,800
What?

365
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:02,838
Oh, right. Right.

366
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,179
Mammogram's nothing
to be nervous about.

367
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,974
- It'll be over in a minute.
- Right. Sorry.

368
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:10,210
I'm sorry.

369
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:13,144
Why are you apologizing?
You've got great breasts.

370
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,051
These?

371
00:25:14,154 --> 00:25:15,913
You should see some of the jugs
we get in here.

372
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:17,096
Gravity's cruel.

373
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,446
All right, lift up your breast

374
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,980
and get as much of it
onto the plate as you can.

375
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:26,412
Just get it all on there. Just
spread it out from the bottom.

376
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,684
Just right on there.

377
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,626
Yeah, no, that's great.
That's great.

378
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:33,060
Okay, now you're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure

379
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:34,879
when I lower the top.

380
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,217
- Uh, uh...
- And smush.

381
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:41,991
Okay, I know it's probably
uncomfortable, but I'm fast.

382
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,097
Do you like this job?

383
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,130
Are you locked in?

384
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,462
Oh, yeah. Ready to go.

385
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:00,947
I know who you are.

386
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,338
Excuse me?

387
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,945
I...

388
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:08,663
know...

389
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,457
who...

390
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:12,770
you...

391
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:14,529
are.

392
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,723
So, Nancy Botwin,
why are you here?

393
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,235
And what do you want?

394
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,908
And why the fuck
are you stalking me ?
