00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,458
<i>Previously on </i>Weeds...

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,507
There's a tunnel.
You make a bust...

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,553
You get Guillermo,
and it never comes back to me.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,347
I know you're the rat.

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,281
And rats die.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,377
You're the knocked-up
<i>puta</i> whore rat.

7
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:21,896
She end up in a landfill.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,034
We should flee.

9
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,282
- And I love you.
- I'm pregnant.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,077
I need you to take Shane
up to my sister's in the Oakland house.

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,579
Jill Price-Gray, with a hyphen?
Bitch face?

12
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,290
- They're awake.
- Oh, hi!

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,919
No, you deserve to be appreciated,
and me too, you know, because...

14
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:48,506
it's just been a long time
since I was appreciated.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,843
- Why are you still here?
- I will organize everything.

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,762
Do not make me go back there.

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,056
I have no friends.

18
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,891
You ought to grow
in a national park.

19
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,727
All right,
these are mine now, Silas.

20
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,772
Now get the fuck out of here
before I have to shoot you in the head.

21
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,400
- No, it's the doorbell.
- Her doorbell barks?

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,819
- I'm here to keep you company.
- I don't need company.

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,424
- He thinks you do.
- Call off your goon.

24
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,742
You should be taking better care
of my baby.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,037
What's the point?
When am I gonna end up in a landfill?

26
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,081
I haven't decided.

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,045
You...

28
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,356
don't dictate

29
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,008
the terms of this arrangement.

30
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,303
Time to go.

31
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,808
Weeds 503
Su-Su-Sucio

32
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:43,525
By the Fumistes team.
lesfumistes@gmail.com

33
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,514
I am through with you.

34
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,432
Right back at you.

35
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,633
You remember Sucio.

36
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:32,526
He will watch you now.

37
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:44,621
Sucio usually
tortures people for us.

38
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,623
Now he's the one being tortured.

39
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,375
Don't you have people to kill?

40
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,821
Is it too much to ask
that he takes a shower?

41
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,992
He's comfortable
with his man smell.

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,028
Live with it.

43
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:16,925
Whatcha writing?

44
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:19,828
Ransom note.

45
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,134
Exciting.

46
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,161
Ransom note.

47
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,705
Here you go.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,168
You sure you shouldn't type that?

49
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,586
This is a rough draft.

50
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,979
<i>Insisto.</i>

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,343
You should say "demand,"
not "insist."

52
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,014
You don't have a list of insists,
you have a list of demands.

53
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,190
Please.

54
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:49,102
I've been writing ransom notes
since I was a very young boy.

55
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,196
Who are we kidnapping?

56
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,190
We intend to kidnap
the Minister of Commerce.

57
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,736
<i>He</i> has people who are willing to pay
for his return.

58
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,281
Cold.

59
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:05,577
Some people just aren't writers.
Some people are talkers.

60
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,792
So, come on, let's try it.

61
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,276
You talk
and I'll just write it down.

62
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,917
Thank you,
but I can handle this myself.

63
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:17,172
Please, you're a lost puppy.
Let's start again.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,674
- You must stop this.
- Stop what?

65
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,926
I am not a puppy, I'm a man.

66
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,845
- You are undermining me.
- I'm not.

67
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:28,767
Rafael <i>y</i> Lopez.

68
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,894
Lopez.

69
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,033
Rafael used to pick on him at school

70
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:37,108
and that dynamic
still hasn't changed.

71
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,485
Send Gutierrez.

72
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,241
I'll just finish this up.

73
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:55,084
- Nance.
- Do I know you?

74
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:56,522
Not funny.

75
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,673
Brother-in-law. No shootie.

76
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,618
Su-su-sucio?

77
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,737
It's a Phil Collins...

78
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,815
- How did it go with Shane?
- How do you think it went?

79
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,860
He had to sleep
in Scott's marathon-trophy room,

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,596
share a bathroom
with the children of the corn.

81
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:28,242
- Those twins are creepy.
- He's safer there than he is here.

82
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,996
How's my mature
responsible older sister?

83
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,790
She's looking hot.

84
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:35,792
She is?

85
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:40,963
- Time's been kind to the Price sisters.
- Don't lump us together.

86
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,882
- But you're so alike.
- No.

87
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,468
We're nothing alike. Nothing.

88
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,636
<i>Nada.</i>

89
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,850
No. Bathroom. <i>Baño</i>.

90
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,477
No, shoo.

91
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,313
So...

92
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,404
Really, you've never
heard that song? Su...

93
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,465
Okay, well,
that cuts off my breathing.

94
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,528
<i>Payaso.</i>

95
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,123
Oh, I'm a clown? Is that...

96
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,252
Okay, I can live with that.

97
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,597
I have to go the doctor, now.

98
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,434
I'm bleeding.

99
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,072
- This place gives me the creeps.
- Welcome to my pregnancy.

100
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,793
No one here speaks English,
I'm thirsty,

101
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:37,371
and afraid to drink the water,

102
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,917
the magazines in the waiting room
are all in Spanish.

103
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,982
I'm sorry this is so hard for you.

104
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,613
You were behaving recklessly again.

105
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,157
Maybe it's all the rough sex
I've been having.

106
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,034
Who is this?

107
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,749
Esteban, Andy:
my brother-in-law.

108
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,206
The father of my child: Esteban.

109
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:00,960
I pictured you taller.

110
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:04,173
He's not needed here.

111
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,657
I think she begs to differ.

112
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:12,263
That's your cue to begin
begging to differ.

113
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,641
You talk like a clown.

114
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,601
<i>Payaso.</i>

115
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,646
Why is that the worst thing
you guys can say to someone?

116
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,069
A Mexican gyno.

117
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,757
Nance, if you're putting together
a Mariachi band,

118
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,108
yes, go Mexican.

119
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,533
Down there, you want a Jew.

120
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,055
<i>Una problema?</i>

121
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,182
No cramping?

122
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,708
Just some bleeding.

123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,520
You have not ingested
cocaine or methamphetamines, huh?

124
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,942
I can assure you I've been off cocaine
and amphetamines for almost a week.

125
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,236
Joke.

126
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,963
You're okay. Don't stress yourself.

127
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,591
I see you for your next visit.

128
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,180
Now you go straight home.

129
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,010
- Can you drive me?
- This little crisis

130
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:41,852
has already disrupted my schedule.

131
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,720
Now, go relax.

132
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:48,192
If I hear you're not relaxing,
there will be consequences.

133
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:55,659
Congratulations,
you're gonna be such a great dad.

134
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,490
Psych.

135
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,506
See that? Outdoor shower?

136
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,839
Feel free to use it any time.

137
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,983
Stand down. That's my son.

138
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,319
My son who's supposed to be in the woods
tending to his clones.

139
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,821
Went down a bad road.
Who's this guy?

140
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,324
He's my bodyguard, Sucio.

141
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:47,542
Do you want some coffee?
I just brewed a fresh pot, just for you.

142
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:52,858
Shit.

143
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,174
Baby, sorry.

144
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:58,570
You know, you don't look it.
In fact, you look great.

145
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,765
Gorgeous, thin.

146
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:03,391
How much do you need?

147
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,147
I want to open a store.

148
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,984
A totally aboveboard
and legit retail establishment.

149
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,365
What exactly would this aboveboard
and legit retail establishment sell?

150
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:20,992
Medical marijuana.

151
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:23,453
Come on!

152
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,899
Obama is President.
They're not gonna bust them anymore.

153
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:27,791
You got contacts
at the Justice Department?

154
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,091
It was in the paper,
if it's legal in the state,

155
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:32,631
the Feds won't come after you.
It's no-risk.

156
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,685
Where marijuana's involved,
there's always risk.

157
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,751
My exciting and death-defying
adventures in the drug trade

158
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,320
should've taught you this by now.

159
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,041
I will only buy
from growers with prescriptions.

160
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,779
I'll go through all the proper channels,
I promise.

161
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:48,395
I will do it right here, in Ren Mar.
I got it all worked out.

162
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,900
Like it or not,
you've made this the family business.

163
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,363
At least, I'm doing it legal.

164
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,700
Opening a retail store
is nuts in this economy.

165
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:02,961
I'm selling weed.

166
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,320
It's as close to recession-proof
as it gets.

167
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,697
Besides, Doug is helping me,
he knows all about running a business.

168
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:12,011
How reassuring.
Just keep him away from the inventory.

169
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,046
- Guineo, guineo.
- Is that a yes?

170
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,801
I mean it, Silas, don't let Doug
anywhere near the product.

171
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:26,558
No, stop. Other son.

172
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:30,354
Who's supposed to be in Oakland.
What are you doing here?

173
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,437
I'm done.

174
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:34,107
Sucio, that's my sister.

175
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,775
You can shoot her, if you want.

176
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:38,027
Not really.

177
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,529
She banged Uncle Andy.

178
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,681
- You didn't.
- What? I can do things.

179
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,993
- Oh, my God.
- She's a screamer.

180
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:48,485
Will you shut up,
you weird little pervert?

181
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,749
He was taking pictures
and he was gonna show Scott.

182
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,571
Good move.

183
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:58,298
You're going back with Aunt Jill.
You will keep your mouth shut

184
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,845
to her husband and her children
about what a nasty whore their mommy is.

185
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,615
- Is that clear?
- No, he's all yours.

186
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,198
In so many ways.

187
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,266
Can I go upstairs and unpack?

188
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,105
Bye, Aunt Jill.

189
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,337
Your little monster
is not coming back to my home.

190
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:25,287
Perfect Jill Price-Gray,
perfect husband in a perfect house.

191
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,244
Can't do the only thing
I've ever asked her in my whole life.

192
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,247
You're joking.
Every sentence out of your mouth

193
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,786
starts with "Jill, would you,
could you, do you mind if."

194
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,879
- You know why I stopped talking to you?
- Cause you're a self-righteous bitch.

195
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:39,926
You know what? I don't need this.

196
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,341
I'm better. This was a slip.

197
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,120
I've worked through my codependence.

198
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,232
I'm done bailing you out
when you get into trouble.

199
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,668
You don't bail me out,
you just lecture.

200
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:52,425
- That's a cute necklace.
- Then I'll spare you the lecture.

201
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,355
I got it at Nordstrom. You know what?
I think I got this online at Etsy.

202
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:00,734
Please.

203
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,988
Do me this one favor.

204
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,824
Shane's not safe, here.

205
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:08,284
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

206
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,954
Nothing. I'm just... pregnant.

207
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:15,124
- Who's the father?
- It's complicated.

208
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,418
- It always is with you.
- You know what, Jill?

209
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:19,837
If you're not gonna help me,
then fuck off.

210
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,717
Is he the father?

211
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:26,904
Sure.

212
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,513
You really will sleep with anything.

213
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,641
- Look who's talking.
- We have electrical tape, right?

214
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,395
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:37,938
Asshole.

216
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,156
Come on, is it so out of character?

217
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,857
Let's get out of here.
Do you live near here?

218
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,621
- Upstairs.
- Really?

219
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,308
Okay, let's go upstairs.

220
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,776
Everything seems to be
in order, here.

221
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,904
Social security numbers,
and... Wait, wait.

222
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,281
Where it says state fully

223
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:33,014
the exact nature of business
for which a license is required,

224
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,621
you only wrote in "Retail."

225
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,537
Sorry about that.

226
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,047
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

227
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,090
Pot luck?

228
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,508
Club. Pot club.

229
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:48,592
Pot club?

230
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:52,429
Not a pot club.

231
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:56,058
It's a medical marijuana dispensary.

232
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:57,851
Oh, my...

233
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,235
It's gonna be huge.

234
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,148
I'll be right back.

235
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:10,165
What an uptight bitch.
It's totally legal.

236
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,783
I'm starting to feel
like this was a bad idea.

237
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:14,910
Think she's got food in her drawers?
I'm starving.

238
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,159
Who is she talking to?

239
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,563
Jackpot!

240
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,376
Sour punch bites.

241
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,086
We should leave.

242
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:26,098
I'm very high and I'm not paranoid,

243
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:29,007
so you being not high
should be even more not paranoid.

244
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,885
Unless you are high.
Are you high?

245
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:33,090
You're right.

246
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,264
What we're doing here
is perfectly legal.

247
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,933
- Perfectly.
- I've got nothing to be afraid of.

248
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,318
Nothing.

249
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,121
Except maybe that guy.

250
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,873
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
we can't approve your application

251
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:50,086
without the signed authorized consent
of a local law enforcement official.

252
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,238
Law enforcement?

253
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,069
Great.

254
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:54,616
Sour punch bite?

255
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:57,327
No, thank you.
I have some of my own.

256
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,935
Okay, wait, wait, let me think.

257
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:07,004
Oh, yes, I have a good one.

258
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,450
- I don't think I like this game.
- Keep going.

259
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:12,941
I bet your mother never told you
about the time

260
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,929
she dated her math teacher
in junior high.

261
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,556
Gross.

262
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,116
It's total bullshit.

263
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,643
I bet she was a real heartbreaker,
in junior high.

264
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,889
Body fully developed,
precocious, sophisticated,

265
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,543
bored with all the other kids
her age.

266
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,634
Not really.

267
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,437
Flat, cliquey, "B" average.

268
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,786
First, more wine?

269
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:34,531
- This whole not drinking thing sucks.
- More for us.

270
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:36,658
Anyway,

271
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,495
his name was Mr. Schiff,

272
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,439
and he threatened
to stab himself in the heart

273
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:46,202
with a geometric compass
when she dumped him.

274
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:47,836
That is so fucked up.

275
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,408
First of all, he was delusional.

276
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,746
Second of all,
I rejected all of his advances.

277
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:55,177
Third of all,
I was getting all A's in his class.

278
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,648
He finally got fired,
divorced his wife,

279
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:00,223
and camped out on our front lawn
until daddy had him taken away.

280
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,767
He used to send you notes
from the loony bin.

281
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,603
Why is this your favorite story?

282
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:05,703
It's awesome.

283
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:07,899
Why don't you ask your Aunt Jill
about the time

284
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,665
that she missed the bus
and was late for class?

285
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,321
Thrilling tale. Screwed up
her whole sense of right and wrong.

286
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,953
You know what, just once admit
that you had sex with Mr. Schiff.

287
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,313
Admit that you had a crush on him
and you were bitter

288
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,541
because he was more attracted to me
than he was to you.

289
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,697
You are still
just a raging narcissist.

290
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:33,543
Why are we arguing about this?
I was 13, the man was a pedophile.

291
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,051
Ladies, please.
This is the Shabbas dinner.

292
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:38,344
I'll be upstairs throwing up.

293
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,644
I don't mean to be judge-y,
but where did she meet that guy?

294
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,607
Home Depot?

295
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,526
So, am I hearing this right?

296
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:11,674
Next to Molly's pet depot,
where I got my first dog, Scraggles,

297
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:14,464
across from the surfside
pancake hut,

298
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,775
you guys wanna sell drugs?

299
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,949
Exactly.

300
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:21,522
For medical purposes only.
Strictly compassionate care.

301
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,392
Boys, this is a wholesome town.

302
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,976
I grew up here,
lived my whole life here.

303
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,447
I even plan
on being buried here, so...

304
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm gonna want my cut.

305
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:36,705
Cut?

306
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,947
Fixed monthly payment
or percentage of the sales.

307
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,333
Your choice.

308
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,328
Can we have a second?
We're new to this whole extortion thing.

309
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:46,540
Take your time.

310
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:49,315
I'm gonna help old Ms. Spencer
cross the street.

311
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,239
- What do we do?
- When I was on city council,

312
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:57,614
I gave the owner of a gay bar
the same choice.

313
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,259
He wanted to open up a place
called "The White Swallow".

314
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,762
He chose the percentage.
Sucky choice.

315
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,265
Turned out the only fruits in Agrestic,
besides my son Josh, grow on trees.

316
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,226
Lot more stoners here in Ren Mar.

317
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,297
But I'll cook the shit
out of the books.

318
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:11,802
Great.

319
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:18,450
You two pick a poison?

320
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,196
- Monthly payments.
- Sweet.

321
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:22,292
Wait, wait. I said the percentage.

322
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:24,473
You said the percentage sucks.

323
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:28,369
Yeah, for me.
But in that story, I was him, not us.

324
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:29,494
See?

325
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:32,074
Now I'm confused.

326
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,417
Can I start over?

327
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:35,709
Sorry, fellows. No backsies.

328
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:38,028
Monthly payment it is.

329
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,693
Now bus over that application.

330
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,319
Stoked.

331
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:56,604
We were playing him.
There wasn't... I was...

332
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,098
I took the percentage in the story.

333
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:01,320
But that was not me.
You understand what I'm saying?

334
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:15,918
Okay. Enough.

335
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,092
I know your calling card
is this whole rugged, unwashed thing.

336
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,882
I can't take it anymore.
You're gonna have a shower.

337
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,592
- <i>No comprendo.</i>
- <i>Comprendo</i> this.

338
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:27,546
- <i>Señora.</i>
- Come on.

339
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:30,321
- <i>Por favor.</i>
- Come on. You're gonna love it.

340
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:31,623
Okay.

341
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,933
Soap.

342
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:36,718
<i>Jabón</i>: soap.

343
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:38,957
Shampoo.

344
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,443
Don't really know the word for that.

345
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,611
Towel.

346
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,656
Don't really know
the word for that either.

347
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,686
Loofa?

348
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:06,621
I'm just gonna get your loofa, okay?
Wait a minute.

349
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,620
- You're gonna mis your flight, baby.
- I don't care, it's okay, I don't care.

350
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,567
Screw the flight, this might be
the last time I come by fucking.

351
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,301
I'm working on it.

352
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,384
Oh, God. That's it, that's it!

353
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:35,247
Fucking shit.

354
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:40,961
That's it, I got a little more.

355
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,050
I know you're naked.

356
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:49,318
Maybe even clean.

357
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,400
I know it's very scary for you.
And new.

358
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,324
Have you seen Sucio?

359
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,619
He was showering. Now he's gone.

360
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,343
Come on, Shane.

361
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,761
Here we go.

362
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:21,898
Cover your ears.

363
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,088
Stay where I can see you
and you can't see anything.

364
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:27,466
- I'm close.
- You're fucking hot.

365
00:22:29,177 --> 00:22:32,554
- You're so good.
- Oh my God.

366
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,644
God!

367
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:42,963
Fuck, yes. I love that.

368
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:44,566
We gotta go. Now.

369
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:46,611
- It's not safe.
- What the fuck?

370
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,142
I waited until you came.
Be grateful.

371
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,406
Both of you get dressed.
Meet us at the car.

372
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,589
Someday when you're older
and you're in therapy,

373
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,401
you'll make sense of all this.

374
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:57,315
Wake up, lady.

375
00:22:58,204 --> 00:22:59,207
Wake up.

376
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,837
I'm gonna need to see your passport.

377
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,215
Where in the fuck am I?

378
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:10,175
You're in Texas, ma'am.

379
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,609
- Where are we going?
- Airport.

380
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:31,041
I'm gonna drop off Aunt Jill,
then we're gonna go and get Silas.

381
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,365
This is exactly
why you should have stayed with her.

382
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,512
At least, with you I'll go quick.
With her, it's a slow death.

383
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:39,329
When's your return flight?

384
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:40,914
Two hours ago.

385
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,432
You'll get on standby.

386
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:44,895
Come on, can we go?

387
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,421
I'm not ready to go back.
Andy, let's just go to a hotel.

388
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,340
Jesus, what does he do?

389
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,133
Great and careful work.

390
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:54,052
Please get in the fucking car.

391
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,514
Get in the car.
Get in the car, please.

392
00:23:57,682 --> 00:24:00,080
Get in the fucking car.
Get in the car! Get in it!

393
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,352
Not until you tell me
what's really going on here.

394
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,524
And don't start with the fucking
Korean's bullshit, more bullshit!

395
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:09,324
You really want to know
what's going on?

396
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,975
I fucked up my entire life
in ways you can't even imagine

397
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,615
and I don't think I'm gonna be able
to get out of it this time.

398
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:18,159
And what am I supposed
to do with that?

399
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:20,995
Get on the plane, go back
to your family, be glad you're not me.

400
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:23,957
Sorry, but I would fucking
love to be you.

401
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,347
- Getting kind of stuffy in there.
- Get back in the car.

402
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:29,212
- Oh, you're fighting.
- Back in the car!

403
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:33,800
You just took off
and put it all on me.

404
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:37,762
I was a kid. You were older.

405
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,348
By a year and a half.

406
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,184
I couldn't handle it, okay?

407
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:44,477
Guess fucking what?
Neither could I!

408
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:47,346
What do you want me to say?

409
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,786
How about "Thank you"?

410
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:53,403
"Thank you for staying
in the hospital with Mom, Jill.

411
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,989
"And for doing it
all over again with Dad, Jill.

412
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,901
"And for making the funeral arrangements
for both of them.

413
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:01,929
"And I'm sorry, Jill, by the way,
that I couldn't be there to help.

414
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:05,071
"I was off playing ballerina
and then getting laid

415
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:08,903
"while you were wiping shit
and writing do not resuscitate orders."

416
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
All right.

417
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:15,967
I'm sorry.

418
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,915
I'm sorry I am, have been,
such a disappointment.

419
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:23,737
I realize that's a lot
to hang on to and...

420
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:26,352
It must really suck.

421
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:29,893
Now would you please
get in the fucking car?

422
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:40,142
I hope that you're staying off your feet
and taking it easy.

423
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:42,167
I'm on my feet. I'm fleeing.

424
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,900
What's going on?
Where is Sucio?

425
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:47,214
<i>He's missing. There was blood and...</i>

426
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,053
Guillermo told me that if he found out
that I'd ratted about the tunnel,

427
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:51,853
he'd kill me.
So maybe...

428
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:54,005
- maybe his guys...
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

429
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:56,564
You would be the one who was dead,
not Sucio.

430
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,551
Now get yourself to a safe place

431
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,012
<i>and wait for my call.
Do you understand?</i>

432
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:05,464
I realize you haven't decided
whether or not to kill me

433
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,934
after I have the baby, but

434
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:10,452
- can I have Cesar back for now?
- Wait for my call.

435
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:15,622
You still want to be me?
