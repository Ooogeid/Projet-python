3
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,867
<i>Welcome back, SG-9.
Stay in the Gate room.</i>

4
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:47,010
<i>General Landry will be down
for a short debrief.</i>

5
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,618
So, after 10 years
and about 1,000 e-mail requests,

6
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:04,504
I finally get my own parking spot.

7
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,044
Two days after...

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,209
Sir.

9
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,595
Sir.

10
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,431
- Major Davis.
- Morning.

11
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,060
- Good morning, Colonels.
- Major.

12
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:41,104
Dial it up, Chief.
They're right on schedule.

13
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,748
- What am I signing this time?
- Nothing, sir,

14
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,752
- just wanted your autograph.
- <i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

15
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,477
You don't want to come along?
Might never be another one.

16
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:54,313
Tempting as it is,
I'll be doing paperwork the whole time.

17
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:57,910
Besides, one general
looking over your shoulders is plenty.

18
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:00,560
Yes, speaking of Jack...

19
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,630
He went ahead with SG-3
to officially hand over the prisoner.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,270
- Guess he knows who we're dealing with.
- Such precautions are unnecessary.

21
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,251
Half of the free Jaffa fleet
stands guard over the Tok'ra homeworld

22
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,311
to ensure that the execution of Ba'al
takes place as planned.

23
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,018
You know better than anyone, muscles,
this is an extraction,

24
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:18,990
not an execution.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,928
Oh, well, this is just in case.

26
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:29,230
No. No, no. Airman,
you're not walking

27
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,165
into my first extraction ceremony
carrying that thing.

28
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,749
- Wait a minute. This is your first?
- Yeah, it should be interesting.

29
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,390
- lt'll blow your mind.
- lt is pretty incredible.

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,590
Witnessing a Goa'uld being extracted
from a host is one thing.

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,749
Actually experiencing it
is something else.

32
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,734
To feel the sensation of the symbiote
that has controlled your every action

33
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,510
for so many years,
while you watched helplessly

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,070
from the darkest recess
of your mind,

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,545
as it is finally excised
from your body

36
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,230
and left to writhe
in the light of day...

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,390
Well, that is incredible.

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,278
<i>Chevron seven locked!</i>

39
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,310
- Go to it, SG-1.
- Okay, this I gotta see.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,269
I'll leave the light on.

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,572
Never in the history of boredom

42
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:31,407
has anyone been more bored
than I am right now.

43
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,694
Come on, sir, it's only been...

44
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,799
It's almost over.

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,590
The crimes they're listing
are starting to sound familiar.

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,301
Crimes?

47
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,109
That's what they've been crooning about
for the last three hours?

48
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,630
- Quite the ditty, ain't it?
- It's not fair to the host, anyway.

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,368
Vala, you don't really think
there's any hope for the...

50
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:57,350
I mean, you were host to Qetesh
for a relatively short period of time.

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,358
Ba'al inhabits this guy
for 2,000 years.

52
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,021
Revive the prisoner.

53
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,681
- Watch him try and make a run for it.
- Well, with all this security,

54
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,872
I really don't think
he's going to get very far.

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,475
Vala?

56
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,990
The prisoner will step forward.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,768
Ba'al,

58
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,989
last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

59
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,794
murderer of untold millions,

60
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,435
these will be your last words.

61
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:42,892
Speak.

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,234
I have nothing to say to the Tok'ra.

63
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,173
SG-1

64
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:02,356
and General Jack O'Neill.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,990
Well, well.

66
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,069
- How's tricks, B?
- I've been better, I'm afraid. And you?

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,193
- Not so bad, actually. Quite good.
- How nice for you.

68
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,319
- How about those last words?
- As you wish.

69
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,350
Teal'c...

70
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,790
I will always regret
that you never became my First Prime.

71
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,790
And where is my dear Qetesh?

72
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,390
Well, Vala was here.

73
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,840
- lnteresting.
- She's probably gone to the bathroom,

74
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,317
for heaven's sake.
I'm next in line, by the way.

75
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:46,470
- Can we get on with this?
- There is one more thing.

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,189
You've all made a terrible mistake.

77
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,510
- Yes, that is what they all say.
- There can be no doubt of your crimes.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,790
What I mean to say is, I'm not the last
of the Goa'uld System Lords,

79
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,390
though I do admit,
I may be last of the clones.

80
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,869
There were so many of us.
It is difficult to be certain.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,109
Mitchell?

82
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,030
We tracked them all, sir.
This one is the last one.

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,510
You sure?

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,655
That is, after all, why we've come,

85
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,310
why we had to endure all that singing.

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,917
Get rid of the last bad guy,
and then there's cake.

87
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,435
Carter?

88
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,385
As you know,
in order to track his clones,

89
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:32,150
Ba'al gave them a tracking device
detectable from anywhere in the galaxy.

90
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,404
He also placed one in himself,
so we couldn't tell the difference

91
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:37,116
between a clone and the original.

92
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,825
And because he was the original,
he was the only one of us

93
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,245
who possessed a tracking device
that could be removed.

94
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,894
So, you see,
the last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

95
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,110
the last of my dear brothers

96
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,779
is still out there,

97
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,084
and since as of this moment
he knows he's the last,

98
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:56,910
he has very special plans for you.

99
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,949
"Plans," you say.

100
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,509
A recently completed failsafe device

101
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,555
should an unfortunate circumstance,
such as my...

102
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,033
imminent death, arise.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,113
It was you who gave us the idea,
actually.

104
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,845
I suspect it has already been put
into action.

105
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,196
He lies.

106
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,274
He does that, you know.

107
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,809
We shall see.

108
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,097
It is time.

109
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,864
This is going to be cool.

110
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,002
Make your course three-five-zero.

111
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:24,030
Three-five-zero.
Aye, Captain.

112
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:29,670
We'd be in Boston by now if
we weren't zigzagging over the Atlantic.

113
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,550
You'd rather make it easy
for the U-boats?

114
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,430
We're not at war yet.

115
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,566
And, we're riding too high in the water
for a U-boat captain to waste a torpedo.

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,550
Check to see the cargo's secure.

117
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:48,553
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

118
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,320
If I knew myself...

119
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,072
That's no torpedo.

120
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,438
What is it, Captain?

121
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,635
Emergency stations! All hands!

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,225
- Maintain your heading, son.
- Aye, sir.

123
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,317
I'm gonna check for damage.

124
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,764
Secure the ship.
Make ready the Chappa'ai.

125
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,229
Take your time, Jaffa.

126
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,956
We have all the time in the world.

127
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,996
Begin the extraction process.

128
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,230
Seriously, did anybody see
where Vala went?

129
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,052
Maybe extractions bring up
too many bad memories.

130
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:11,891
Have you ever tried
to find a bathroom in a pyramid?

131
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:14,924
She cannot have gone far, O'Neill.
There are...

132
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,350
- Carter?
- I don't know. He wasn't beamed out.

133
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:23,110
- He was there one second, and...
- The next he was gone, like Vala.

134
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,790
I think we'd better get
the hell out of here.

135
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,287
Everyone, remain calm!

136
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,510
What have you done
with my people?

137
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:39,349
Sir!

138
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,474
Jack.

139
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:49,913
Go to the Gate.

140
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,451
- Not without you.
- Go.

141
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,790
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go.

142
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,469
Carter!

143
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,575
The vessel is secure, my lord.

144
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:37,986
Dial the Chappa'ai.

145
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,869
Jackson!

146
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,475
Move!

147
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,349
Okay, not Earth.

148
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,710
- I dialed Earth.
- I know, Iike a hundred times before,

149
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,990
but my keen professional eye
is seeing a few differences

150
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,550
between this place
and Stargate Command.

151
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,564
That, for one, and...

152
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,249
The Stargate

153
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,238
is in a box.

154
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,237
Carter, what's going on?

155
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,197
Sam?

156
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,388
I don't know.

157
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:41,579
Look,

158
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:45,031
I know what happened back there,
but we need you in the here and now.

159
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,237
Wherever or whenever that is.

160
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,470
Right.

161
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,237
Looks like the active Gate
warmed things up for a bit.

162
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:02,976
Warmed things up?

163
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,881
Yeah, because the temperature's
falling again.

164
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,550
It's just gone past minus 20.

165
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,539
Okay, that's chilly.
Let's not just stand around.

166
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,190
I don't see anything
that could be a DHD.

167
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,328
This has to be connected to what
was happening on the Tok'ra homeworld.

168
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,830
All right, so Vala and Teal'c
disappear into thin air,

169
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,950
we gate into somebody's freezer,

170
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:42,069
put the pieces
of that puzzle together, and...

171
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,944
I got nothing. You?

172
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:47,985
Well, there is almost no EM of any kind
from any direction

173
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,354
to help us determine our location.

174
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,270
Mayday.

175
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:03,656
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
Do you hear me? Please respond.

176
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,025
Mayday. Mayday.

177
00:19:05,195 --> 00:19:07,916
I don't think
anybody's going to hear you.

178
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,550
- We're in the cargo hold of a ship.
- What?

179
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,872
Not just any ship.

180
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,191
- This is the Achilles.
- That name's familiar.

181
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,702
Yeah, it was the ship
that brought the Stargate from Africa

182
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,334
before the outbreak of WW ll.

183
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:28,950
No, that's not why.

184
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,990
They thought the Stargate
might be a weapon,

185
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,229
so they wanted to keep it out
of the Nazis.

186
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,937
- Do you realize what this means?
- Guys, I hate to interrupt,

187
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:39,696
but the temperature's falling.
We just passed minus 40.

188
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,550
- Celsius or Fahrenheit?
- At that temperature, they're the same.

189
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,430
Really? Didn't know that.

190
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,952
We've got about three minutes
before frostbite sets in.

191
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,830
Hypothermia, five minutes after that.

192
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,597
I'm already starting
to lose the feeling in my fingers.

193
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,925
Break out the camp stove
from the emergency pack.

194
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:56,637
You mean the one
that was with Teal'c?

195
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:01,070
We can't light a fire in here.
There's nowhere to vent the smoke.

196
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,063
Cover your ears.

197
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:17,704
You realize that's not going to
do much.

198
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,592
I'm not done yet.

199
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:23,430
If you don't blow a hole
in the ice with that,

200
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,589
the blast is gonna come flying back
into this compartment.

201
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,098
Or worse, what if that ice
is holding back seawater?

202
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:32,985
Yeah, I admit, there's...

203
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,193
a few problems with this idea.

204
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:38,150
Carter, how cold is it?

205
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,514
Minus 43.

206
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,918
Fire in the hole.

207
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,469
Well, it's warmer.

208
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,261
Yeah, I'm seeing stars.
Let's get this fire started.

209
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,343
What was that?

210
00:21:16,513 --> 00:21:19,590
Okay, the explosion must've
dislodged the ship from the ice.

211
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,910
Don't tell me. We're sinking.

212
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,550
- We had to leave sooner or later!
- Foul-weather gear.

213
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,389
There's got to be some
around here somewhere.

214
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:05,350
- We've got water coming in over here!
- I've got something!

215
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,510
Jackson, try this on for size!

216
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:14,229
Carter!

217
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,386
We've got to go!

218
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,869
Jackson!

219
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,670
Jackson!

220
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,669
The ship was warmer.

221
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,961
- You want to go back?
- No, I'm good.

222
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:24,848
All right.

223
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,042
So, which way?

224
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,330
Well, we're above the Arctic Circle,
so does it really matter?

225
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,390
- South it is.
- Daniel!

226
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,030
I know.

227
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,550
Back on the ship,
my foot went through the deck

228
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,075
where water was coming in.

229
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,550
It froze the laces on my boots.
I couldn't get it off.

230
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,589
Jackson, what did you wanna go
and do that for?

231
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:56,342
Look, we'll just have to help you walk.

232
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:00,096
No, I can't feel a thing below my knee.

233
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:03,451
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

234
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,430
Look, I'm being selfish, here.

235
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,693
Our only chance

236
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:15,559
is for you guys to get within
radio range of some kind of help.

237
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,350
The sooner you go,
the sooner you can send help for me.

238
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,792
Go, don't waste time!

239
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:29,983
Once that sun rises,
it's going to warm right up.

240
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,070
Jackson.

241
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,348
Daniel.

242
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,595
Bye.

243
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:05,354
Oh, shit!

244
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,792
I keep wondering
what Daniel was gonna say.

245
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,833
- When?
- Back at the ship, he got all excited

246
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:21,190
when he said,
"Do you realize what this means?"

247
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,687
That Ba'al had gone back in time to
stop the ship that was carrying the Gate

248
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,580
from ever reaching the United States.

249
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,951
- By sending it to the North Pole.
- Yeah, apparently.

250
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,967
Carter, that is a terrible plan.

251
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:37,117
Yeah, but you have no problem
with the fact that he went back in time?

252
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,515
All I'm saying is,
why not just sink the damn boat?

253
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:43,597
I think the bigger point here
is that Ba'al has rewritten history.

254
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:47,089
Teal'c and Vala just disappeared
because they never joined SG-1.

255
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,349
The Stargate program never happened.

256
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,670
In which case,
I would have never crashed in my F-302,

257
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,476
which means I wouldn't have
a titanium pin in my leg, killing me,

258
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:56,510
- which it is, right now.
- You're right.

259
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,870
- You're right, it's a paradox.
- Thank you.

260
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,832
Or maybe because we were in transit
through the Stargate

261
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,764
when the timeline shifted.

262
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:07,367
Well, Ba'al never would've intended
that Gate to wind up anywhere

263
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:09,590
but the bottom of the ocean.
Something went wrong,

264
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,310
and we were not supposed
to make it back to Earth alive.

265
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,970
That's his first mistake.

266
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,271
Maybe he's already taken over
the entire planet.

267
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,402
Humanity could be enslaved,
for all we know.

268
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,778
That's quitter talk.
All we got to do is stay alive

269
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:23,354
until you figure a way to undo this.

270
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,911
- Undo this?
- You heard me.

271
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:28,928
Mayday. Mayday!

272
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,709
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
Mayday!

273
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:42,932
Sam, we have to keep moving.

274
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:44,110
Why?

275
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:47,270
If we're gonna freeze to death,
here's as good a spot as any, isn't it?

276
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:51,869
I don't like this spot.

277
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,163
Cam, come on. What is the point?

278
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,150
There's no one around for hundreds...

279
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:00,070
What is that?

280
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,190
- Which one of you is Mitchell?
- That'd be me.

281
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,933
Jack O'Neill, Special Forces.

282
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,231
Oh, my God!

283
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,454
We thought you were dead.

284
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,154
Well, back at you, ma'am.

285
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,629
- Do you recognize her?
- Sure do.

286
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:49,590
Sir, we've got to go back for Daniel.

287
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,910
What we have to do
is get you people off this ice.

288
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:53,907
- Major Wood!
- Yes, sir!

289
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:57,031
I marked the "X" and dropped the buoy.
It should be along any minute, sir.

290
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,630
Mitchell, I don't know what you're doing
in the Arctic with a dead astronaut,

291
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:03,110
but I'm going to need some answers.

292
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:06,510
Yeah, well, back at you.

293
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,270
- What are we looking for?
- There! Your ride!

294
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,909
Colonel O'Neill!

295
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,909
- Permission to come aboard!
- Permission granted, sir.

296
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:57,101
The C.O. would like you
to make it snappy.

297
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:00,110
Sonar picked up
a Russian sub nosing around.

298
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,908
Let's go.

299
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,237
- Down scope.
- Aye, sir.

300
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,959
Colonel,
welcome aboard the Alexandria.

301
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:21,949
Captain, thanks for the ride.

302
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:24,150
We're always happy
to help the Air Force.

303
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,093
Chief,
escort our guests to the ward room.

304
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:28,469
Escort our guests to the ward room.
Aye, Captain.

305
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:36,870
- Colonel, isn't that...
- lf it isn't, it's her twin sister.

306
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:40,037
I'm gonna need a couple minutes
to debrief those two.

307
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,958
You mean those three.

308
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,527
What?

309
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:46,373
Officer,
prepare to stationary dive.

310
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:49,787
- I intend to take her down immediately.
- Aye, Captain.

311
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:52,076
Stationary dive, stationary dive.

312
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:09,164
Jackson!

313
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,870
- Daniel.
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.

314
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,357
Us? What about you?

315
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:19,305
Oh, no, the sub actually came up
about a half hour after you guys left.

316
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,933
It must have heard
the Achilles going down.

317
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:25,795
Scared the hell out of me, too.
I thought I was hallucinating.

318
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,433
In fact, I still am afraid I might be.

319
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:31,750
They pumped me up with something...


320
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,430
No, it's...

321
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,772
It's all real.

322
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,184
How bad is the leg?

323
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:40,630
They say I'm probably going to lose it.

324
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:43,576
Hey, you know,
I thought I was dead.

325
00:31:43,746 --> 00:31:47,150
I guess in the grand scheme of things,
I can't really complain that much.

326
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,271
Excuse us.

327
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,595
Jack?

328
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,950
Are there any more of you
I should know about?

329
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,270
No. Look,

330
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:04,214
I understand how weird this is...

331
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:06,270
About four hours ago,
one of our satellites

332
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,190
took the damnedest picture
you ever did see.

333
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,590
How did you get here so fast?

334
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,085
I was already on my way up here
to supervise a training exercise,

335
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:22,510
and then I got orders to make a drop
to determine what caused

336
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,030
this.

337
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:29,709
Whatever that was is gone.

338
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,390
And you have no idea what this is?

339
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,004
You're the astronaut, you tell me.

340
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:40,812
The device that made
what you see in this picture,

341
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:43,310
an energy vortex created
prior to the establishment

342
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,910
of a stable wormhole,
is called a Stargate.

343
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,847
Now, normally, we use it
to travel to other planets,

344
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:52,189
but this time we came through it
from an alternate timeline,

345
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:55,162
one where, amongst other things,

346
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,423
I'm not an astronaut.

347
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:05,750
Yeah, that's pretty much
how I had it figured.

348
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,550
Actually, she's telling the truth.

349
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,913
And who are you?

350
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,629
Daniel Jackson.

351
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,249
In the timeline where we come from,

352
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,310
we've actually traveled
to several hundred planets together.

353
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,065
- "We," as in you and...
- Yeah, in fact, in our timeline,

354
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:28,670
I'm the closest thing you have
to a best friend.

355
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,930
Yeah. Yeah, I'd buy that.

356
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,012
Okay, you're from Minnesota.

357
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:35,910
Yeah.

358
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:40,349
Eleven years ago, your son shot himself
with a 9mm he found in your closet...

359
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:42,550
All right. Stop it, right there.

360
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,150
My kid is fine.

361
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,149
He's at home, and he's fine!
What's wrong with you?

362
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,937
Obviously, some things are different
in this timeline,

363
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:53,677
- but what you have to understand is...
- No, I don't!

364
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:57,430
I don't have to understand anything!
More importantly, I don't want to.

365
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,968
As far as I'm concerned, you're just
a pile of paperwork waiting to happen.

366
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:04,349
- Jack, please...
- And stop that!

367
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:10,564
Jeez.

368
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:14,700
You should at least warn your superiors
that this planet is in great danger.

369
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,797
I'll get right on that.

370
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,954
All right, they can have access
to food, water,

371
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,323
and any medical attention
they might need,

372
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,542
but they cannot go past this door
except to use the head.

373
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:31,954
And nobody comes in or out
until we can surface, and

374
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,898
- deal with these freaks.
- Aye, sir.

375
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,541
- Samantha Carter?
- Yes.

376
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,709
It's common knowledge
that four years ago

377
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,870
a computer failure forced the
space shuttle lntrepid's main engines

378
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,897
to shut down before it could reach a
safe orbit or a secondary landing site.

379
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,470
When the autopilot also failed,

380
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,308
Mission Commander Samantha Carter
stayed behind to fly it,

381
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:12,870
while her crew bailed out
of the escape hatch.

382
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,019
The orbiter went down over the Atlantic,
and her body was never recovered.

383
00:35:16,189 --> 00:35:17,190
It wasn't me.

384
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,297
- You just said your name...
- Stargate Command is a branch...

385
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,412
of the United States Air Force.

386
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:25,440
Founded in 1990-something,
I forget the exact year,

387
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,521
for the purposes of exploration and...

388
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:31,138
It was less an altered timeline than
it was this kind of multiverse thing...

389
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:32,630
It operates in secret...

390
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,703
I know what you're thinking, and...

391
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:37,718
- you're thinking I'm insane.
- And it was capable of operating, but

392
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,685
- none of the random addresses...
- A list?

393
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,668
- You want the list of every planet...
- And that's when I realized

394
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,590
that the symbols were constellations,

395
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:47,924
and it was just a matter of determining
which of the 39 symbols...

396
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:49,924
represented the point of origin.

397
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:53,247
The symbols in a combination of seven
represented a Gate address...

398
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,951
and the home planet.

399
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,550
Why do you think this is funny?

400
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,715
- Because it is.
- Everything I can think of, I told you!

401
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:05,570
Listen, whereas I've been trying
to tell you Earth is in serious danger,

402
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,753
- you don't seem to give a rat's ass!
- Okay, fine!

403
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:11,630
O'Neill wants nothing to do with us?
What about Landry?

404
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,910
If you would like to hear the answer
to that question,

405
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,072
why don't you go ahead
and play your tape back?

406
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:20,990
- I want to take a break.
- I want to talk to somebody else.

407
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:26,106
I am agitated, because this is not
the way things are supposed to be.

408
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,550
- Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
- General, thank you for coming.

409
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,670
You flew F-4s in Vietnam.
You have a daughter named Caroline.

410
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,776
You're wild
about Fulvous Whistling-Ducks.

411
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,869
Stop right there, son. I believe you.

412
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:39,629
You do?

413
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,433
I've been listening to all three of you
for quite a while now.

414
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:45,870
It's a hell of a story. The fact is...

415
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:52,630
Are the other two already in the hangar?
Good, we'll be right there.

416
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,901
I can't stand having to repeat myself.

417
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,299
Follow me.

418
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,778
Yeah, see,
I knew that about him, too.

419
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:18,325
- Hey, you guys. Having fun?
- Oh, joy.

420
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:21,448
You've been at this for five days.
Eat something.

421
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,149
It's not like you didn't feed us.

422
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,750
Fine, I don't like to eat alone.
You should know that.

423
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,470
Sir, you're probably wondering
why I requested

424
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,710
that you be brought all this way up
to meet with us.

425
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,310
Actually, you all did.

426
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,467
Something about the fact that I'm
the sort of man who would understand.

427
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:54,370
You'll have to forgive me.
I was at your memorial service

428
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,598
on the front lawn
of the White House.

429
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,480
I imagine you're
an extraordinary person

430
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,710
in whatever timeline
you happen to be in.

431
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:07,397
- Sir, if you don't mind my asking...
- You don't exist.

432
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,288
That is to say, there's no record
of a Colonel Cameron Mitchell

433
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,601
fitting your description
in the U.S. Air Force,

434
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:14,514
or anywhere else,
for that matter.

435
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:17,465
And you, Dr. Jackson,
were last seen in Egypt,

436
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:20,790
attempting to find proof
that aliens once visited Earth and...

437
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,353
that the pyramids are landing pads
for their spaceships.

438
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:30,077
I take it that in your timeline,
that you're not a discredited whack-job

439
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:33,309
- living on the fringes of society.
- That really depends on who you ask.

440
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,630
- Not I need to make this about me...
- There was one Mitchell of note

441
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,870
who served in the Merchant Marine
in the late'30s.

442
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,749
The captain of the freighter Achilles.
That's how I know the name.

443
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:48,530
Grandma had a picture of him standing
beside his ship in Boston Harbor.

444
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,109
It's the one in my locker right now.

445
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:58,146
Ba'al must've killed the crew
when he Gated aboard.

446
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,029
You're literally a grandfather paradox.

447
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,157
That's what Dr. Lee said.

448
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:12,201
Sir, I realize
that it may be extremely difficult,

449
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:15,670
if not impossible, to recover
the Stargate from the Arctic Ocean,

450
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,425
- but there is another one...
- The one in Antarctica, you mean?

451
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:21,014
I'm told we're sending a team
to check it out.

452
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,968
We need to do more
than check it out, sir.

453
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:25,989
We need to use it.
We have to set things right.

454
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,149
- How, exactly?
- I've been thinking about this.

455
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,509
Now, Ba'al must have built
some sort of temporal device.

456
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,189
- Time machine.
- Yes.

457
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,091
Now, if we could use the Stargate
to contact one of our allies...

458
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:37,989
That will not be allowed to happen.

459
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,173
Sir, you don't understand
what will be lost

460
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:42,823
if we can't return things
to the way they're supposed to be.

461
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:46,230
"Supposed to be" is relative,
Dr. Jackson.

462
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,390
The allies we've met,
the technologies we've acquired,

463
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,597
- the hundreds of planets we visited...
- We can do all that,

464
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,750
assuming we can recover the Stargate
in Antarctica,

465
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:57,989
and assuming it does
what you say it does.

466
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,273
I'm sure we'll use the thing to go out
and explore the galaxy.

467
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,749
There are a lot of excited people
around here.

468
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,752
With respect, sir,
you're missing the point.

469
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:09,510
The timeline was altered
by one of our enemies.

470
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,429
The System Lord, Ba'al.
You talked about him at some length.

471
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,350
Because he's a very real threat.

472
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,708
According to your own story,
it's been 70 years

473
00:40:17,878 --> 00:40:20,010
since the timeline was changed.

474
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,640
If all this is part of some plan,

475
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:24,430
where is he?

476
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,149
Man has a point.

477
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,087
If his plan was to take over Earth,

478
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:31,841
he would have to reestablish a
power base with the other System Lords.

479
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:35,012
Now, that wouldn't be easy.
Now, if his plan died with him, then...

480
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,078
Or he's still in the process
of establishing his power,

481
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:39,589
and it's a matter of time.

482
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:41,470
This is as far as we're willing to go.

483
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,029
In exchange for signing
a non-disclosure agreement,

484
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,146
you'll be given identities,

485
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:49,960
a place to live in different parts
of the country, for obvious reasons.

486
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,181
And you better
behave yourself in public,

487
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,750
otherwise you'll end up
on the front page of The Enquirer.

488
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,940
Sir, don't do this.

489
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,357
The decision has been made
at the highest level.

490
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:03,425
I'm sure that, in time,
your advice will be welcome.

491
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:06,150
If and when the Navy
gets this Stargate up and running,

492
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:09,410
you can come aboard as consultants,
but you will never, ever,

493
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,430
be allowed to step through that thing.

494
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,870
You're afraid we're gonna try
and repair the timeline.

495
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,230
You've made that intention
abundantly clear...

496
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:19,310
- Because we have a responsibility.
- But you don't have the right!

497
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,333
If you were to succeed,

498
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:26,789
events in the lives of thousands,
if not millions of people,

499
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,589
would never have happened!
My goodness, people,

500
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,190
the arrogance of
what you're asking us to help you do

501
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,110
is mind-boggling!

502
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:49,748
Maybe if I wasn't woken in the middle
of the night and flown to Alaska,

503
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:52,887
I might be more like the kind,
sympathetic former general

504
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:55,479
you were hoping I'd be,
but trust me,

505
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:57,989
if you lived in this timeline...

506
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,709
We'd want it to stay the way it is.

507
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:05,085
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to go back to my wife

508
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:07,589
and my very pleasant retirement.

509
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,523
And you all have new lives to begin.

510
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:13,002
They're ready to board the aircraft!

511
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:17,249
It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

512
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,589
Yeah.

513
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:25,670
It truly was.

514
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,430
At no time are you to make contact
by any means

515
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,035
with Mr. Jackson or Ms. Carter
without prior authorization.

516
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:51,966
Any such attempt will be seen
as a breach of this agreement...

517
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,967
You will be provided a suitable home,
vehicle, and a living allowance,

518
00:42:57,137 --> 00:43:00,556
which may be augmented without penalty
should you choose to seek employment

519
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:02,710
in any field other than the following:

520
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,728
astrophysics, aerospace, engineering...

521
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:07,617
At no time may you discuss, write,

522
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,357
or otherwise communicate the matters
and/or events

523
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:12,110
as stated in this agreement

524
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,110
with any person
other than your authorized contact.

525
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,271
Is that clear, Dr. Jackson?

526
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,993
Dr. Jackson?

527
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:22,670
Yeah, I'm sorry.

528
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,950
This is the place.

529
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,164
I guess it is.

530
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,466
- Do you need help getting out?
- No, I think I can handle it.

531
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,110
Keep the change.

532
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,084
How's it going, Cam?

533
00:44:43,254 --> 00:44:45,604
Hey, Mrs... Heather.

534
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:47,851
Heather. Caught myself this time.

535
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:49,070
Finally.

536
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:51,070
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

537
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,150
So, when do we get to go for a ride?

538
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,989
I'm gonna take it
for a road-trip test drive,

539
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,549
so maybe when I get back.

540
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:01,190
I'll hold you to that.

541
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:03,043
Come on.

542
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:08,021
Oh, damn, that's trouble.

543
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:05,509
Can I help you, son?

544
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,699
I apologize for the intrusion.

545
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,366
I spent some time here when I was a kid.

546
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:14,587
What's the name?

547
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:16,095
Mitchell.

548
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,561
Cam Mitchell.

549
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:21,605
I've lived here over 35 years.

550
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,618
Really?

551
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,654
Who was here before that?

552
00:47:26,024 --> 00:47:27,079
Hendersons.

553
00:47:28,803 --> 00:47:30,097
Harry and Lorna.

554
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,721
So you knew Harry?

555
00:47:34,357 --> 00:47:35,163
Yeah.

556
00:47:36,656 --> 00:47:39,394
I was just a boy,
but they were nice people.

557
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:47,510
Look, I know this is weird,
but do you mind if I go inside?

558
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,350
I have an image of the place
that I can't quite shake.

559
00:47:51,357 --> 00:47:54,552
Well, what the hell,
I'm not doing anything. Come on.

560
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:19,894
Hello, Dr. Jackson?

561
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:27,420
Yes, I'm sorry I'm calling so late.
I'm calling from the States, and...

562
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:32,066
Well, I've stayed in that hotel
myself a number of times,

563
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:33,917
and I just thought that you might...

564
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,059
Well, because I wanted
to tell you something.

565
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:42,359
That you're right.

566
00:48:43,742 --> 00:48:46,140
About everything,
about the pyramids, about...

567
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,136
what the glyphs said about
aliens visiting Earth. Everything.

568
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:51,158
It doesn't matter who I am.

569
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:53,750
Let's just say I'm someone
who believes in your work,

570
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,419
and you should, too.

571
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,380
No, no, no, I do. I really do. I...

572
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:02,675
You have to have more faith
in yourself, Dr. Jackson.

573
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:05,800
Hello?

574
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:09,135
Hello?

575
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:09,773
Put me through to your commanding
officer. Tell him it's Col. Carter.

576
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,270
- I need to speak to him now.
- Mr. Mitchell?

577
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,776
<i>... this stunning footage
just in from our affiliate station...</i>

578
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,472
Son, you'll want to see this.

579
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:19,111
<i>... alleged alien craft

583

According to White House sources,</i>

584
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,427
<i>there has been no communication
from these vessels,</i>

585
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,670
<i>but neither have they taken

586
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,317
<i>The President has called for calm,</i>

587
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,476
<i>but we are told our armed forces
are on high alert.</i>

588
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,578
Hello?

589
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,750
Great.
I was thinking about you guys.

590
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,830
I thought they'd at least allow us
to see each other, but every time l...

591
00:50:59,278 --> 00:51:01,036
No, I don't have a TV. Why?

592
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:26,030
Bring in the prisoner.

593
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:49,310
Well done, Teal'c.

594
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,260
It is my honor to serve Lord Ba'al.

595
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:57,510
Yes, it is. But generations from now,

596
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,306
they will speak of Master Teal'c
of Chulak, First Prime of Ba'al,

597
00:52:01,476 --> 00:52:04,150
first leader of the free Jaffa nation.

598
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,510
Shol'va.

599
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,205
Apophis,

600
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:21,727
Iast of the System Lords
to stand against me.

601
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:23,875
What have you to say
to your new sovereign?

602
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,756
May your reign last days

603
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:28,910
and your death, years.

604
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:33,430
That's actually rather good,

605
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:34,790
isn't it?

606
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:43,768
Did you plan to say that
when you walked in?

607
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,150
Or was it just off the top of your head?

608
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:05,147
My Lord, Cronus hails us.

609
00:53:06,848 --> 00:53:08,053
Clean this up.

610
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,316
<i>Lord Ba'al,</i>

611
00:53:13,486 --> 00:53:17,710
<i>the squadron of Al'kesh that
you ordered to the Tau'ri have reported.</i>

612
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:19,566
<i>It is as you promised.</i>

613
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:23,390
<i>They number in the billions,
and they are defenseless.</i>

614
00:53:23,724 --> 00:53:24,654
Excellent.

615
00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:27,190
You may reveal the coordinates
to the rest of the fleet.

616
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,710
We shall leave on my order.

617
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:30,231
<i>As you wish.</i>

618
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:37,470
There is a god standing here
with wet hands.

619
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,586
Teal'c,

620
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:49,710
you may tell your warriors that their
dream of freedom is one step closer.

621
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:51,790
I shall, my Lord.

622
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:55,259
Well?

623
00:53:56,217 --> 00:53:58,780
I am in awe of your accomplishment.

624
00:54:00,135 --> 00:54:03,790
You have predicted every move
of your enemies

625
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:07,367
and fulfilled every promise
to your allies.

626
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:09,901
Ra, Nirrti, Cronus, Zipacna,

627
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:13,421
all once-powerful System Lords, and now,

628
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:15,388
they all serve you.

629
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:17,662
They serve us, my queen.

630
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:22,315
- I am truly privileged.
- I know.

631
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:26,185
I can't help myself.

632
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,501
<i>There is no nation on this Earth</i>

633
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:34,208
<i>that does not share in our resolve
to defend our world.</i>

634
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:38,305
Until we give them more to talk about,
they're gonna play this speech to death.

635
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,340
What about the Russians or the Chinese?
Are they hearing anything?

636
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,098
There's been no response of any kind
from the alien craft, sir.

637
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:46,398
We've tried every frequency there is.

638
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,670
Why would they come all the way

639
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,110
from wherever the hell it is
they came from,

640
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,124
fly around with a bunch of F-16s
on their asses for half a day,

641
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,246
and then just sit there?

642
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,810
They're advance scout ships,
Mr. President.

643
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,910
You asked they be brought to the command
bunker the moment they arrived, sir.

644
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,029
That's fine, Alex, thank you.

645
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:07,476
Henry Hayes.

646
00:55:07,974 --> 00:55:10,990
Thanks for coming.
You were saying, Mr. Mitchell?

647
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:13,548
The ships in orbit are called Al'kesh.

648
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:16,425
They serve both as scouts
and as ground-support bombers.

649
00:55:16,595 --> 00:55:18,668
And they're nothing
compared to what's coming next.

650
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:19,769
Really?

651
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:21,966
- So, what's coming next?
- Death.

652
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:23,243
Slavery.

653
00:55:24,477 --> 00:55:26,228
More slavery, more death.

654
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,574
If you want to say, "l told you so,"
go ahead and get it off your chest,

655
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:34,950
but then you can do one of two things.
You can help, or you can leave.

656
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:37,417
- Okay, bye!
- Jackson.

657
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:40,830
Right, I forgot to say, "l told you so."

658
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,654
Now, are you going to help, or not?

659
00:55:43,937 --> 00:55:45,750
Have you recovered the Stargate?

660
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,185
We couldn't locate
the one you sent down,

661
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:51,990
but we did manage to find the other one
in Antarctica. It's still there.

662
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,721
Why didn't you bring it back?

663
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:57,661
Well, the Navy suggested, and I agreed,
what better place to build a facility

664
00:55:57,831 --> 00:56:00,726
and start a testing program
in complete secrecy

665
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:02,590
than McMurdo base?

666
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:04,409
Why weren't we told?

667
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:08,411
You'd be surprised at some of the stuff

668
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:11,375
we do around here
without running it by you.

669
00:56:11,545 --> 00:56:13,187
It isn't operational yet, is it?

670
00:56:13,357 --> 00:56:15,710
Not yet, but we have
our best scientists working on it.

671
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:18,267
How quickly can you get us there?

672
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:20,236
Don't forget,
I'm the one who gave the order

673
00:56:20,406 --> 00:56:22,226
to keep you away from that thing.

674
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,830
Erasing the timeline

675
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,430
is not an option.

676
00:56:26,903 --> 00:56:28,630
Then why are we here?

677
00:56:30,476 --> 00:56:32,590
When I was first briefed on you three,

678
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,750
I thought my Chief of Staff
was yanking my chain.

679
00:56:36,452 --> 00:56:38,200
I didn't believe him
the 2nd time, either.

680
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,433
Finally, he had to bring in
the National Security Advisor

681
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:43,470
to convince me that he wasn't kidding.

682
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:46,979
On page 2000-and-something of the brief,

683
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:49,406
one of you, I can't remember which,

684
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,325
talks about how I handled

685
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:55,049
a similar invasion in your timeline
to the one that might happen here.

686
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:57,001
Of course, in our case,
you had the benefit

687
00:56:57,171 --> 00:56:59,580
of an operational Stargate Program
for about seven years.

688
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,952
To be fair, it was actually
the Ancient weapons platform

689
00:57:02,122 --> 00:57:03,430
in Antarctica that saved us.

690
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:04,863
Exactly.

691
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:11,482
- Shouldn't it still be there?
- It's under a mile of ice.

692
00:57:11,652 --> 00:57:15,262
The Army Corps of Engineers have been
drilling at the coordinates you gave us

693
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,950
for the last three months.

694
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,798
- We're not there yet, but we're close.
- Even so, its power source is depleted.

695
00:57:20,968 --> 00:57:23,065
We'd need a fully-charged
Zero Point Module.

696
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:25,390
Taonas. There's no reason
it still shouldn't be there.

697
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,280
We'd have to steal a cargo ship.

698
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,257
It's not like
we haven't done that before.

699
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:31,785
Once we recover the ZPM,
we can gate directly back to Earth,

700
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:34,573
because the Stargate's already
in Antarctica. We'll just need...

701
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,283
Someone with a gene
that could operate the chair.

702
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,510
If there's still time,
sir, this can work.

703
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:41,950
That's the SG-1 I read about.

704
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,862
If the control crystal's intact
and the power relay's in position,

705
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:47,902
I should be able to dial out the Gate
in a couple of hours.

706
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:49,713
General Hammond?

707
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,880
Sir, it's good to see you.

708
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:57,301
If you say so.

709
00:57:58,296 --> 00:58:01,143
There are four F-15s
on the tarmac at Andrews,

710
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:04,144
each carrying minimal armaments
and extra fuel tanks.

711
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,976
Once the Stargate is operational,

712
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:09,081
you'll be escorted through
by a squad of four marines.

713
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,900
- That's not negotiable.
- To keep us on the mission.

714
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,342
That's not necessary, sir,
but we'll take the back-up.

715
00:58:14,512 --> 00:58:18,141
Even if it goes according to plan,
it'll take a couple of days to get back.

716
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,541
What are you going to do
if Ba'al shows up before then?

717
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:23,150
Is there anything we can do,
Dr. Jackson?

718
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:26,830
Well, I wouldn't mention us.

719
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:28,920
Thought of that one.

720
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:30,990
Good luck.

721
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:33,459
To all of us, sir.

722
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,920
There it is, my friends.

723
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:56,950
This little world
in the middle of nowhere,

724
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,553
lost and forgotten until now.

725
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:01,470
Thanks to our Lord Ba'al,

726
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,630
it is ours to enslave
and pillage as we please.

727
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,062
It is an abomination they have been
allowed to breed to such numbers.

728
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:10,110
Their Stargate has been buried
for centuries,

729
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,672
and was subsequently involved
in an unfortunate boating accident.

730
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,228
Hence, they have been
completely cut off from us.

731
00:59:17,398 --> 00:59:19,030
They know nothing of the Goa'uld.

732
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,630
Nevertheless, they are
far too many to control.

733
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,830
We'll just blast them
to the brink of extinction.

734
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,789
That will not be necessary.

735
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:28,550
- But it would be enjoyable.
- I agree.

736
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:31,363
You are all so stuck in your ways.

737
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,344
If we were to wipe them out
by the billions,

738
00:59:33,514 --> 00:59:35,550
the survivors would despise us
for all eternity.

739
00:59:36,926 --> 00:59:40,717
I know something of these people.
I have studied them for some time.

740
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:44,730
If we give them cause to fight,
they will fight to the bitter end,

741
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:48,114
but if we promise them a grand future,

742
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:51,419
if we offer them our loving kindness,

743
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:56,270
then I assure you, my friends,
they'll fall for it completely.

744
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,270
As you have done with your Jaffa?

745
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:02,510
If by that you mean the Jaffa who,
with the promise of freedom,

746
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,946
managed to defeat the combined armies
of the System Lords,

747
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,381
yes.

748
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:11,479
And that promise will be fulfilled.

749
01:00:12,148 --> 01:00:13,469
I'm sure it will.

750
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:16,297
In fact...

751
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,277
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my Lord.

752
01:00:19,796 --> 01:00:21,754
Camulus has kindly offered

753
01:00:21,924 --> 01:00:24,189
one half of his domain, Australia,

754
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:25,902
to the free Jaffa nation.

755
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:28,589
- I have said no such...
- Your generosity...

756
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:30,678
brings a god to tears.

757
01:00:32,935 --> 01:00:34,989
Now, let us be clear, my friends.

758
01:00:35,477 --> 01:00:38,095
The lands of the Tau'ri that you receive
and the many millions of humans

759
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:40,719
that inhabit them are a gift.

760
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,321
Be grateful,

761
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:45,459
or be silent.

762
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,872
Return to your ships.

763
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:53,349
I shall contact the Tau'ri myself.

764
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:55,492
- Yes, my Lord.
- Yes, my Lord.

765
01:01:01,304 --> 01:01:03,269
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my Lord.

766
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,638
There is something
I want you to search for.

767
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:17,349
Ships, sir. Dozens of them.

768
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,225
They just popped up out of nowhere
a few minutes ago.

769
01:01:20,395 --> 01:01:21,584
Hyperspace.

770
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:24,126
I read the brief.

771
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,696
What's the status of SG-1?

772
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:28,709
They should be airborne
in a few minutes.

773
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:31,961
At this time, Mr. President,
it's my recommendation

774
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:34,203
we take our forces to DEFCON 2.

775
01:01:34,504 --> 01:01:35,338
Do it.

776
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:39,874
We should inform SG-1 that they're here.

777
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:41,083
Yes, sir.

778
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:50,530
<i>Jackson, you may want
to strap in back there</i>

779
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,311
<i>and get some sleep.
Should be a long, boring ride.</i>

780
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:54,669
<i>Yeah, I hope so.</i>

781
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,074
Colonel Mitchell!

782
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:02,571
<i>We've received a message
from Washington.</i>

783
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:04,451
<i>I'm told you'll understand.</i>

784
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:06,307
<i>They're here.</i>

785
01:02:29,605 --> 01:02:30,822
What is that?

786
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:33,659
Something I've kept in stasis
a very long time,

787
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:36,440
so that one day I could place this call.

788
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,408
He's on the phone?

789
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:46,784
It came directly through
the White House switchboard.

790
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:49,686
- From the spaceship? Ba'al?
- Lord Ba'al.

791
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:51,360
His words, not mine.

792
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,633
Yeah, right.

793
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:56,589
Thank you, Alex. Hello?

794
01:02:57,155 --> 01:02:58,434
Mr. President.

795
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:01,986
I was beginning to think I wasn't going
to get through your gauntlet of minions.

796
01:03:02,156 --> 01:03:04,008
<i>Who is this? Who am I speaking to?</i>

797
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:05,315
I am Ba'al.

798
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:07,680
I assume by now you've detected
the presence of my fleet

799
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,229
in orbit over your planet?

800
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,189
As a matter of fact,
we have our eye on you.

801
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,811
<i>Please forgive this primitive means
of communication,</i>

802
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:17,270
but if I were to land my ship
in your rose garden,

803
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,278
or appear as a hologram in your office,

804
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:23,591
what kind of race of beings
would you think we are?

805
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:26,309
I wanted to give you
my personal assurance

806
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:29,269
that we come in peace,
seeking nothing more than friendship.

807
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:31,509
Well, we're glad to hear that down here.

808
01:03:32,503 --> 01:03:34,827
Let me further assuage your concerns
by meeting you in person

809
01:03:34,997 --> 01:03:36,160
in your Oval Office.

810
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:39,429
I'm sure something can be arranged soon.

811
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,110
I was thinking this afternoon.

812
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:45,310
<i>It is the kind of thing
I can clear my schedule for.</i>

813
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,631
Excellent. Then perhaps we can get...

814
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,050
Put that down.

815
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:56,395
Mr. President,

816
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,405
I'm afraid
I'll have to get back to you later.

817
01:04:04,271 --> 01:04:05,682
He hung up on me.

818
01:04:06,707 --> 01:04:08,875
The edges of the Shikra blade
have been honed

819
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,589
to the thickness of a single atom.

820
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,528
I must keep my hand very still,

821
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,126
for fear that one slip
will cut you in half.

822
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,600
Now,

823
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,118
tell me, how can you possibly know
so much about this world?

824
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:27,264
I told you, my sweet.

825
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:30,189
You've been studying in secret.

826
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:31,251
When?

827
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:33,601
You haven't allowed me
to leave your side

828
01:04:33,771 --> 01:04:36,172
in 50 years.

829
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,986
Every time you defeated your enemies,
you were one step ahead

830
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:42,817
and now you're as familiar with their
world as if you've lived among them,

831
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:45,377
and you even have
one of their communication devices. How?

832
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,404
For a short time, I confess,
I did live among them.

833
01:04:48,574 --> 01:04:51,900
- When?
- Another life, another time.

834
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:55,831
This world offers
many pleasures, Qetesh.

835
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:58,588
Pleasures I intend to share with you.

836
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:04,989
Not good enough.

837
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:16,070
My Lord, forgive the intrusion.

838
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:18,585
Think nothing of it, Teal'c.

839
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,604
I have the results of our search
of the southernmost continent.

840
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:24,029
There is a Chappa'ai, as you predicted.

841
01:05:25,169 --> 01:05:27,350
Thank you, Teal'c. You may leave us now.

842
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,343
However, my Lord,
it is not lodged within a crevasse.

843
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:33,229
The humans have moved it to a small
settlement and taken it inside.

844
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:35,295
It does not appear to be yet functional.

845
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,278
What?

846
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:39,151
They have also drilled a shaft
deep inside the ice

847
01:05:39,321 --> 01:05:40,743
elsewhere on the continent.

848
01:05:40,913 --> 01:05:42,061
Impossible.

849
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:43,804
How could they have known?

850
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,353
Instruct the fleet
to bombard both locations

851
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:48,308
from space immediately.

852
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,795
Is that your wish, my Lord?

853
01:05:50,965 --> 01:05:51,841
Do it,

854
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:55,520
and report back to me when it's done.

855
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,534
Now, tell me,

856
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:06,352
my sweet.

857
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:10,817
Is your plan going as well
as you expected?

858
01:06:16,995 --> 01:06:19,313
<i>You realize Ba'al is going to figure out
where we're headed</i>

859
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:22,597
<i>before we get
within 1,000 miles of McMurdo.</i>

860
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,436
<i>- He thinks we're dead, remember?
- Oh, we have him now.</i>

861
01:06:31,518 --> 01:06:32,844
Hail the fleet.

862
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:36,669
This is Teal'c
aboard the Sovereign's flagship.

863
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:39,420
Lord Ba'al has given the order
to destroy targets

864
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,948
at the following coordinates
near the planet's South Pole.

865
01:06:42,118 --> 01:06:45,429
Assign what vessels you see fit.
Fire when ready.

866
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:56,113
I talked to Ba'al directly,
and despite his assurances,

867
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:59,916
I have reasons to distrust him.
Very good reasons.

868
01:07:01,228 --> 01:07:04,604
Yuri, I have to tell you about something
we're working on in the Antarctic

869
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:07,830
that might help us deal with them.

870
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:10,676
It involves an artifact
we found a couple of months ago...

871
01:07:10,846 --> 01:07:12,269
Mr. President?

872
01:07:12,531 --> 01:07:13,689
Hold on a sec.

873
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,470
- Do you know who I'm talking to?
- Yes, sir.

874
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,069
A few minutes ago,
we lost contact with McMurdo.

875
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:23,239
The first report was something about
brilliant flashes of light in the sky,

876
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:25,149
then explosions all over the compound.

877
01:07:25,705 --> 01:07:27,737
We also lost contact
with the drilling site

878
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:30,789
above the Ancient weapons platform
at roughly the same time.

879
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:33,974
We're trying to get satellite pictures
to confirm.

880
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,895
So much for afternoon tea
in the rose garden.

881
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:40,306
Yuri, that project in the Antarctic
I was telling you about?

882
01:07:40,476 --> 01:07:41,989
It's going backwards.

883
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,392
- My Lord.
- Stay back, Teal'c.

884
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:54,669
My Lord, shall I enact
your final instructions?

885
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:56,506
No, you idiot, save me.

886
01:07:56,676 --> 01:07:59,989
- Try it, and I will kill him.
- You intend to kill him regardless.

887
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:02,398
No! There must be some arrangement.

888
01:08:02,921 --> 01:08:05,389
Actually, my love, he's right.

889
01:08:10,718 --> 01:08:12,319
Jaffa, treason!

890
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,951
<i>Sierra Golf One,
we're receiving an encoded message.</i>

891
01:08:31,121 --> 01:08:32,228
<i>Stand by.</i>

892
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,645
<i>Message reads,
"McMurdo has been destroyed.</i>

893
01:08:37,815 --> 01:08:41,041
<i>"Return to your previous position
and stand by for further instructions."</i>

894
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:44,320
<i>Understood.</i>

895
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:45,730
<i>So much for that.</i>

896
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,188
<i>What further instructions can there be,
other than, "Kiss your ass goodbye"?</i>

897
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,469
<i>Oh, let's pull about turn and find out.</i>

898
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,224
- Master Teal'c.
- I am on a mission for the Sovereign.

899
01:09:02,394 --> 01:09:04,869
We will cloak the ship immediately
and await further orders.

900
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:09,913
Hail Cronus.

901
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:18,754
<i>My queen.</i>

902
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:21,030
Our Lord Ba'al has seen the light.

903
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,549
He now wishes to blast the Tau'ri
into extinction.

904
01:09:24,796 --> 01:09:27,489
<i>You are most persuasive.</i>

905
01:09:28,278 --> 01:09:29,669
We shall return in three days.

906
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:33,510
The more of the planet you've destroyed,
the more richly you shall be rewarded.

907
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,709
And if you see Teal'c, kill him.

908
01:09:36,996 --> 01:09:38,997
<i>As the Sovereign wishes.</i>

909
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,864
Jaffa, set a course for Praxyon

910
01:09:44,034 --> 01:09:46,793
and engage the hyperdrive
at maximum speed.

911
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:48,513
Yes, my queen.

912
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:53,268
This world is not enough.

913
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,307
The Sovereign's flagship
is leaving the fleet.

914
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:11,949
The Sovereign is dead,
betrayed by Qetesh.

915
01:10:12,634 --> 01:10:15,709
Our only hope of avenging him is
to arrive at Praxyon before she does,

916
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,229
and the only way to do that
is through a Chappa'ai.

917
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:20,829
But you yourself ordered it destroyed.

918
01:10:21,234 --> 01:10:22,918
There is another.

919
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,386
<i>Thanks for the top-up, boys.</i>

920
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,229
<i>Sierra Golfleader, we're going to be
right back where we started...</i>

921
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:41,549
<i>Son of a bitch! Carter, break right!
Break right!</i>

922
01:10:54,676 --> 01:10:55,749
<i>What city is that?</i>

923
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,106
<i>Washington.</i>

924
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:06,951
Listen to me,

925
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:10,634
because I don't think either one of us
has much time left.

926
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:14,470
If you have anything,
any information that could help...

927
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,715
Yuri, I can't hear you! What?

928
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:21,714
You've also discovered an artifact?

929
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:24,909
Where is it located?

930
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:28,343
<i>We're receiving another encoded
message with new flight instructions.</i>

931
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:31,309
<i>Message reads,
"The Russians have the other one."</i>

932
01:11:31,713 --> 01:11:33,620
<i>- Hello.
- "Do what you need to do."</i>

933
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,149
<i>Roger that.</i>

934
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,540
<i>Coordinates received. Stopping for gas.</i>

935
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,069
<i>I estimate ETA at 19:30 Zulu.</i>

936
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:42,916
<i>Let's do what we need to do.</i>

937
01:11:54,512 --> 01:11:58,349
We're on emergency power, sir, and
all the elevator shafts have collapsed.

938
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:01,721
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon.

939
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,401
Do we have confirmation
that our message got through to SG-1?

940
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:05,525
Yes, sir.

941
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:08,834
By now, they're well over
the North Atlantic.

942
01:12:15,753 --> 01:12:18,687
<i>That last KC-135 pilot was a bit stingy.</i>

943
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:20,096
<i>Fuel's going to be close.</i>

944
01:12:20,564 --> 01:12:24,549
<i>I have multiple contacts down range
approaching at Mach 3.5.</i>

945
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:26,939
<i>- Gliders?
- Yeah, that's a good bet.</i>

946
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,869
<i>They're coming through at 80,000 feet.</i>

947
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,922
<i>Sierra Golf escort,
we must complete our mission.</i>

948
01:12:33,092 --> 01:12:34,121
<i>Do you understand?</i>

949
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:37,695
<i>Affirmative. Sierra Golf One and Two,
proceed to target. We will engage.</i>

950
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,799
<i>Here they come.</i>

951
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:58,030
<i>Just go ahead
and fall asleep back there, Jackson.</i>

952
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,621
<i>It's gonna be a long, dull ride!</i>

953
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,752
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.
How many on our six?</i>

954
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,349
<i>Too many!</i>

955
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,210
<i>We can't shake them at altitude.
We're gonna have to go down to the deck.</i>

956
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,390
<i>Yeah, we're right behind you.</i>

957
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,510
<i>I've got another contact, six bogies,
dead ahead, coming right at us.</i>

958
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,353
<i>Sorry, Sam,
we're kind of busy right now.</i>

959
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,269
<i>I don't think they're gliders.
They're MiGs!</i>

960
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:44,738
<i>Jackson, get on the radio!</i>

961
01:13:49,548 --> 01:13:51,029
<i>What the hell did you just say?</i>

962
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,636
<i>"We're Americans.
Please shoot the people chasing us!"</i>

963
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,430
<i>We have been expecting you! Good luck!</i>

964
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,160
<i>Yeah, back at you.</i>

965
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,749
<i>I can see the coast.</i>

966
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:14,389
<i>Sierra, rejoin,
we're going to head on down.</i>

967
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,908
<i>Copy that.</i>

968
01:14:45,117 --> 01:14:46,747
This is not encouraging.

969
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:49,685
Where is everybody?

970
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,730
At home with their families,
where I should be.

971
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,979
I need to speak to the lead scientist
on this project.

972
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:56,310
He is not here.
None of them have been here for weeks.

973
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,190
- Really?
- We had no idea of purpose of artifact.

974
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,935
We named it Anchor,
because it was found on bottom of ocean.

975
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,910
Are there any grown-ups around
that we could talk to?

976
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,911
Boys, we need power.

977
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,990
What you see now is emergency batteries.

978
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,950
We lost main power to facility
over three hours ago.

979
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,590
Oh, okay, we understand that,
but we've come a very, very long way

980
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,990
to use this device.

981
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,870
I cannot give you what I do not have.

982
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,030
- What was that?
- It sounds like a ship. Al'kesh?

983
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,470
And it's landing on the roof.
Just great.

984
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,830
- We must get out of here.
- Hey, your weapon.

985
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,313
Hands up.

986
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:07,575
Don't.

987
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,596
Teal'c?

988
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,085
How do you know my name?

989
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,630
I can do better than that.
You're from Chulak,

990
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:26,110
your best friend goes by the name of
Bra'tac and you're the First Prime of...

991
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,470
Jackson, whose mark is that?

992
01:16:28,945 --> 01:16:29,755
Ba'al.

993
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,310
- What did he promise to win you over?
- The freedom of my people.

994
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:36,430
- I'll give him credit.
- Ba'al is dead.

995
01:16:36,975 --> 01:16:38,270
Slain by his queen.

996
01:16:38,531 --> 01:16:40,270
Oh, don't tell us, Qetesh.

997
01:16:43,146 --> 01:16:43,946
Indeed.

998
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,124
Why?

999
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,677
That is none of your concern.

1000
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,190
Allow us passage through the Chappa'ai,
and your lives may be spared.

1001
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,150
Or you tell us what you're up to,
and your lives will be spared.

1002
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,110
My only concern is my mission.

1003
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,510
Which is?

1004
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,896
To avenge Ba'al's death.

1005
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,230
The final task of a First Prime.

1006
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:05,030
- lndeed.
- Sounds great.

1007
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,998
- We'll help out, right?
- Sure, why not?

1008
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:08,557
- I'm not busy.
- Let's do it.

1009
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:10,710
I do not require your assistance.

1010
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,999
My ship has been detected.

1011
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,830
Its shields have been extended to
protect this building and the Chappa'ai,

1012
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,470
but it will not hold for long.

1013
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:27,390
What do you say we all get out of here?

1014
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,814
We can all die here
when that shield fails,

1015
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,432
or we can go through the Gate together
and continue this discussion

1016
01:17:38,602 --> 01:17:40,590
on the other side.
It's up to you.

1017
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,994
This device will power the Chappa'ai.

1018
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,636
I like that. No hesitation.

1019
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,694
Let's go! Go!

1020
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,550
Give me a reason
I should not kill you where you stand.

1021
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,339
Because you're a good man.

1022
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,834
Because

1023
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,550
somewhere, deep down, you realize
we're supposed to be on the same side.

1024
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,443
Because we can offer you
the freedom of your people.

1025
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,526
Really?

1026
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,990
This is Ba'al's failsafe. It has to be.

1027
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,805
I think this whole place
is his time machine.

1028
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,230
Teal'c, you have to understand,
in the timeline we just came from,

1029
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,309
the Goa'uld are defeated
and the Jaffa are free.

1030
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,630
Now, Ba'al used a machine to go
back in time and change all of that.

1031
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,750
He made you his First Prime
and Qetesh his queen

1032
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,478
so he could control you.

1033
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,193
This is the secret
for which Ba'al was murdered.

1034
01:19:50,363 --> 01:19:51,912
That's why you think she's coming?


1035
01:19:52,082 --> 01:19:53,830
She wants to use
this device for herself.

1036
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,986
- That cannot be allowed to happen.
- See? We agree about everything.

1037
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,550
Let us use this device, we can return
history to the way it was meant to be.

1038
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,830
The Goa'uld will be gone?

1039
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,172
- My people will be free?
- You have our word.

1040
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,642
Let it be done.

1041
01:20:20,222 --> 01:20:23,030
It'll just take me a few minutes
to figure out exactly how it works.

1042
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,710
That may be all the time we have.

1043
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,550
By my reckoning,
Qetesh will be here at any moment.

1044
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,950
Thank you.

1045
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,630
Well, you heard the man.

1046
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,750
There must be satellites
orbiting every one of these stars.

1047
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,670
There's hundreds of them,

1048
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,150
each sending real-time telemetry
back to this computer through subspace.

1049
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,390
Exactly how does that add up
to a time machine?

1050
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,310
They're looking for something specific.

1051
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,431
- Solar flares.
- Exactly.

1052
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,550
Until now, other than Ancient
technology, the only way we know

1053
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,550
of traveling through
time is to pass through a wormhole

1054
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:09,052
as it intersects the magnetic field
of a solar flare.

1055
01:21:09,222 --> 01:21:11,120
With enough satellites
and enough computing...

1056
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,310
Yeah, that's brilliant.
Which button do we press?

1057
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,150
Yeah, I think it's a little
more complicated than that.

1058
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,510
Actually, not much.

1059
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,470
We just need to choose a time and place

1060
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,030
sometime before Ba'al can put his plan
into motion.

1061
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,633
They are here.

1062
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:27,228
If you wanna go back
to the Cretaceous period,

1063
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:29,590
we can go right now,
otherwise we have to wait for a flare

1064
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,550
capable of sending us back to a time
and place that's a little more useful.

1065
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,160
Sam!

1066
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,990
I've found one,
but you're not going to like it!

1067
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,950
- Why not?
- It'll send us back to 1929.

1068
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,231
That's 10 years too soon!

1069
01:22:30,171 --> 01:22:33,113
Well, it'll have to do,
because I'm just about out of...

1070
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,710
Once I dial the Stargate, we'll have
less than 20 seconds to get through!

1071
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,114
Dial it up and get your ass down here!

1072
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,949
Carter!

1073
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,189
Teal'c!

1074
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,709
Jaffa!

1075
01:23:56,794 --> 01:23:57,594
Teal'c.

1076
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,554
You are the most

1077
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,314
stubborn Jaffa I have ever known.

1078
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,240
Perhaps

1079
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,988
I shall choose you as my First Prime

1080
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,150
after all.

1081
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,080
I...

1082
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,310
think not, Qetesh.

1083
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,560
I...

1084
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:45,366
die...

1085
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,720
free.

1086
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,150
Make your course three-five-zero.

1087
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,470
Three-five-zero. Aye, Captain.

1088
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:22,070
We'd be in Boston by now if we weren't
zigzagging all over the bloody Atlantic.

1089
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,110
You'd rather make
it easy for the U-boats?

1090
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,952
We're not at war yet.

1091
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,150
Check to see the cargo's secure.

1092
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,230
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

1093
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,069
If I knew myself...

1094
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,070
Captain.
We're about to be boarded.

1095
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,117
- Boarded?
- Get over there.

1096
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,996
- How?
- Don't shoot until I do.

1097
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,954
Back up.

1098
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,203
Who are you?

1099
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,910
You might say
I'm a friend of the family.

1100
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,630
What happened here?

1101
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,598
Well, that could
take a while to explain.

1102
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,116
Begin the extraction process.

1103
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,431
Behold!

1104
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,270
The last of the System Lords.

1105
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,871
I guess that was worth seeing.

1106
01:28:38,863 --> 01:28:39,691
What?

1107
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,734
That's all you have to say?

1108
01:28:41,904 --> 01:28:43,990
Well, you guys made it out
like it was this big deal.

1109
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,714
I expected something more spectacular.

1110
01:28:46,884 --> 01:28:47,684
Nope.

1111
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:51,556
That's pretty much
the extraction ceremony, right there.

1112
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,390
Yup. Right.

1113
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,116
So, lunch, anyone?

1114
01:29:00,938 --> 01:29:02,829
- I'm buying.
- I'm in.

1115
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,969
Actually, sir, I was hoping we could
go over the plans for the new moon base.

1116
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:08,676
What moon base?

1117
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,310
You know,

1118
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:12,531
I think I might stay awhile and

1119
01:29:14,206 --> 01:29:15,630
help him through this.

1120
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,712
- Yeah, I thought you might. Have fun.
- Thanks.

1121
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:24,197
He's in for an interesting afternoon.

1122
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,509
Indeed.

1123
01:29:33,817 --> 01:29:35,504
What was he talking about when he said,


1124
01:29:35,674 --> 01:29:37,821
"You've all made a terrible mistake?"

1125
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,510
- We shall never know.
- I know I ain't gonna worry about it.

1126
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,669
I was just thinking,
what if he really wasn't the last one?

1127
01:29:44,839 --> 01:29:46,670
- He was the last one.
- As far as we know.

1128
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,884
Yeah, as far as we know,
but you can't obsess about this stuff.

1129
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:53,124
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- I know I am. Come on, let's go.

1130
01:29:53,294 --> 01:29:54,990
When was the last time he bought lunch?


1131
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,434
Good point.
