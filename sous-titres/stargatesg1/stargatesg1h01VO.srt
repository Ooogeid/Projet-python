1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:01,569
Spanning ten seasons

2
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:03,586
with over two hundred
episodes,

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,915
"Stargate: SG-1" has travelled
to countless planets,

4
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:10,434
encountered different races
and met numerous aliens,

5
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,609
some friend and some foe.

6
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:15,350
They have worked tirelessly
to use whatever means necessary

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,669
to acquire technology

8
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:20,209
that could help Earth in its battle
against unforeseen aggressors.

9
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:23,548
But one of the biggest reasons
for "Stargate: SG-1"'s success

10
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,652
has been the way
that Earth-based mythology

11
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,837
has been woven
into the show's fabric.

12
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:30,669
"Woven" is a fantastic way
of putting it, Michael.

13
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:34,007
You know, over ten seasons the show
has always found an entertaining way

14
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,102
to put a "Stargate" twist
on a mythology.

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,790
Join us as we take you deep into
ten years of "Stargate: SG-1" mythology.

16
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:44,258
And don't worry: we'll sort it all out
for you by the end of this show.

17
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,412
We hope.

18
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:47,221
... We hope.

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,688
Behind The Mythology Of Stargate SG-1
<i>(v. 0.9)</i>

49
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,510
If mythology is defined
as a set of stories,

50
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:34,568
traditions or beliefs associated
with a particular group,

51
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:37,420
arising naturally
or deliberately fostered,

52
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,665
then the writers of "Stargate: SG-1"
were certainly doing everything possible

53
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:43,126
to create a deep and
layered mythology

54
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:44,774
that "Stargate"
could call its own.

55
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,570
<i>Make no mistake,</i>

56
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,672
<i>Osiris will return</i>

57
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:56,224
<i>and the rivers of the
Earth will run red with blood.</i>

58
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,371
<i>I think the role that mythology
has played in the show</i>

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,404
<i>has obviously been</i>
a very important one.

60
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,793
I mean, from the
genesis of the series

61
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:14,794
it was based
in Egyptian mythology.

62
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:16,710
This is just incredible.

63
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>You know,
being the cradle of civilisation,</i>

64
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,778
<i>we often wonder
the hows and the whys</i>

65
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,427
<i>and this gave</i> at least

66
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,155
a sci-fi perspective of

67
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,896
what could have maybe <i>possibly
happened back in those ancient times.</i>

68
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:39,122
Jack, I think that
this is a map of a vast network

69
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,010
of Stargates - Stargates
that are all over the galaxy.

70
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,638
<i>The Stargate's a key
mythological element in the show</i>

71
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:48,088
<i>because it fits into a number
of mythological systems:</i>

72
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,663
the Egyptian,
the Celtic, the Norse

73
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,409
- which are three major systems
that operate in the show -

74
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,807
all have references to

75
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:59,726
"bridges," for example, that
traverse one world to the next.

76
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:02,350
The Stargate is
the means of seeding

77
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,988
all of the planets
with different mythologies,

78
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:07,820
so as a narrative device
it works perfectly.

79
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,833
You know, I think people
love to see

80
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:14,898
stories that
they're <i>familiar with;</i>

81
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,256
<i>you know, mythological stories,
things that they've heard before,</i>

82
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:22,145
<i>explained with
the "Stargate" twist.</i>

83
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>I think that's one of
the best things about "Stargate"</i>

84
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,855
<i>I think it's one of the first things
that attracted me to the feature film</i>

85
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:31,840
<i>was the concept of
the idea that certain</i>

86
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,952
myths or questions or, you know,
the great wonders of the world,

87
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:39,101
or different relics like
the pyramids that are left behind are

88
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,169
yet to be really <i>properly explained
and everybody's got some</i>

89
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,950
<i>high-falutin' theory. That's what's
great about science fiction and</i>

90
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,984
<i>asking the "What if?"
questions is that</i>

91
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,621
<i>we can put
our own spin on that</i>

92
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:52,169
<i>because we have artistic licence
to do whatever we want.</i>

93
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,096
<i>The wonderful
thing about </i>

94
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:02,164
<i>"Stargate" the series is that we've
been able to borrow from the Egyptians,</i>

95
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,806
<i>we've been able to borrow from
the Greeks and the Romans and now</i>

96
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,887
we're working on Arthurian mythologies
but we're actually able to conjure up

97
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,462
with our imagination
some speculation and ideas

98
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,899
that other people had toyed with
because there are no right answers;

99
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,819
so we can create something and
it really makes... as opposed to just

100
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:19,190
making people escape,
it makes them kind of think and go,

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,348
"Well, that might be true,"
or "That's not true."

102
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,988
The parchment told us
that five virtues

103
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,873
would guide us in our
quest for the Sangraal:

104
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:28,511
prudence, kindness, charity,
wisdom, and faith.

105
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:32,496
Now, we displayed prudence in finding
a way out of the temporal maze;

106
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,527
charity in escaping
the forcefield trap;

107
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,187
kindness by helping the child
and finding the hidden passageway;

108
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,755
and wisdom in
solving the riddles.

109
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,697
The only virtue left is faith.

110
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:55,343
<i>Mythologies are designed to give us</i>
a sense of how we fit into the universe.

111
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:58,967
They ask where we're coming from
and where we're going.

112
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,840
So, where are you from?

113
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:05,147
Where we come from and
where we are going are all the same.

114
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:09,133
Oh, I get ya.
Wherever you go, there y'are.

115
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,865
<I>And what</i> we see when we look
at mythological systems and what

116
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,682
our intrepid heroes, SG-1,
see when they look out

117
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:20,318
and the vast panoply of characters
that they meet there is really yourself

118
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,743
Everywhere you go,
there you are.

119
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,768
And that's one of
the reasons that "Stargate"

120
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,595
works so well is because
it does have this hook

121
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:32,396
into ancient mythologies and a lot of
fans are fascinated with the whole idea

122
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,765
of the ancient mythologies
because they use it

123
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,905
as a sort of
scientific explanation

124
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,252
for things that can't really
be explained otherwise.

125
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:44,226
There's a legend around here
about a Hall of Thor's Might.

126
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:48,593
There's a time
and place for mythology.

127
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,634
Uh, with all due respect, sir,

128
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,570
we thought Thor's Hammer was a
myth until we proved it was real.

129
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:57,742
In fact, "Stargate" is something that
you might call cultural bricolage.

130
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:02,414
It's a way of going through all
of human culture and picking up

131
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:05,124
little bits and pieces and
sticking them together,

132
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,747
but sticking them together
using the Stargate as a glue

133
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,921
and making it into a really,
really interesting story.

134
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,752
<u>Major General Jack O'Neill.</u>
U.S. Air Force

135
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,925
<u>Dr Daniel Jackson.</u>
Civilian. Egyptologist.

136
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,215
<u>Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.</u>
U.S. Air Force Astrophysicist.

137
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,876
<u>Teal'c</u>
Former 1st Prime to Apophis.

138
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,355
<u>Teal'c</u>
Leader of Jaffa Rebellion.

139
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,951
<u>Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell</u>
U.S. Air Force.

140
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,515
<u>Vala Mal Doran</u>
Human Alien,

00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,288
<u>Vala Mal Doran</u>
Former Thief and Con Artist

142
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:33,219
There's a ruler for mythology
in terms of heroes, I know that, but

143
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:37,761
it's also a good rule of
television. You can pair off...

144
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,703
We're gonna split up.
I'm with Teal'c. Wait up.

145
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:45,740
<i>and you can cover a good dynamic
of different kinds of hero.</i>

146
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,905
You've got your
military person in Jack O'Neill;

147
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:53,267
later on, then Mitchell;

148
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,353
Bullets Bounce!

149
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,574
and you've got
your warrior in Teal'c...

150
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:10,395
You have Daniel Jackson
as an intellectual and scientist...

151
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,313
Unless we want
a really bad reputation,

152
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:15,945
We should avoid shooting the first
people we meet on a new planet.

153
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,504
and Sam,

154
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:23,469
possibly the hardest character
to have to try to portray.

155
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:28,177
She's almost all of them:
she is the warrior;

156
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,432
she is the thinker;

157
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,796
When the local suns sets
and it gets dark,

158
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,203
you can actually see
a luminous layer of ionised gas

159
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,809
around the dying
core expanding.

160
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,155
Fascinating.

161
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,288
and, of course, a woman.

162
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,211
<i>Boy, does she have</i>
a lot on her plate,

163
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,052
and she can pull it off.
It's amazing.

164
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,198
How good is this?
We've got the band back together.

165
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,422
You sure with
the extra backup singer?

166
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:56,664
Ah, she's good fun.

167
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:59,105
Plus, we figured
if Jackson were to...

168
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,485
- Die.
- That's the word.

169
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:01,872
It would jeopardise
the mission.

170
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:04,170
<i>As the series progresses
- especially a series that</i>

171
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,709
has gone as long as "SG-1" -

172
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,281
you start creating a...

173
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,047
I've been referring to it as a sort
of critical mass of its own mythology;

174
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:16,346
mythology that stops
borrowing from other cultures

175
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,477
and ancient Earth history and
starts,

176
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,669
basically,
a self-generating mythology.

177
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,961
From the very first
episode of Season 1,

178
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:34,616
there was little doubt
that SG-1 was in for a wild ride.

179
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,393
With the introduction
of the Goa'uld,

180
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,085
Apophis and
his foot soldiers the Jaffa,

181
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,958
"Stargate: SG-1" got into a battle

182
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,935
that would span
eight long and exciting seasons.

183
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,819
Keeping true
to the original movie,

184
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,995
the producers of "Stargate: SG-1"
maintained Egyptian mythology

185
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:52,151
as a driving, antagonistic force
throughout the show.

186
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,221
<u>Who</u> : Parasitic race bent
on conquering all planets

187
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:04,027
Take human hosts and pose
as ancient Egyptian Goods.

188
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,173
<u>Physiology</u> :
Larvae produced by queens.

189
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:10,027
Offspring are born evil with genetic
memory and intellect of lineage.

190
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,339
<u>Goa'uld Technology</u> : Live
thousands of years due to Sarcophagus

191
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,235
- Cures Diseases, heals injuries
and revives the dead.

192
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:19,029
Side effects : Negative
psychological impact.

193
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,259
<i>The Goa'uld are kind
of opportunists, you know?</i>

194
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:30,129
They take technology
and they use that,

195
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,268
<i>and they also take
on the roles of gods.</i>

196
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:36,433
If you want
to dominate a culture

197
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,367
that already has a god,

198
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:43,033
<i>what could be easier</i> than
to step in and say, "Well, that's me."

199
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,369
- Hathor?
- Yes.

200
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:47,625
Have you heard of her?

201
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:51,309
Hathor was the Egyptian goddess
of fertility, inebriety and music.

202
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,973
- Sex, drugs and rock `n' roll?
- In a manner of speaking, yeah.

203
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:58,289
<i>The Goa'uld take a human</i> host
and that personality is repressed.

204
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:01,748
<i>The symbiont that is
the Goa'uld has genetic memory</i>

205
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,499
<i>of the Queen
that spawned it and so</i>

206
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,905
they have memories
that go back thousands of years.

207
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,454
The gods of the Egyptians
tended to be

208
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,275
combinations of
animal and human,

209
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:19,999
and what better to represent
the combination of an animal and human

210
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:22,530
<i>than a serpent invading
a human body?</i>

211
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,743
<i>The Goa'uld are established
already in the movie and then</i>

212
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:28,955
<i>in the pilot of the series as</i>

213
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,474
<i>the main bad guys for the show</i>

214
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:35,823
and they have these
very ceremonial ways.

215
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:39,470
They are essentially
posing as gods

216
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,505
<i>and so they take on all
of the pomp and circumstance.</i>

217
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:48,149
<i>One of the things that's interesting
about Egyptian mythology is</i>

218
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,796
<i>that the iconography is
so recognisable and</i>

219
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:54,462
is associated with grandeur and

220
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:58,100
bombast and <i>excess.</i>

221
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,131
<i>They're basically an arrogant worm.
They're sort of a small creature</i>

222
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,935
<i>that has adopted the vastness</i>

223
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,286
<i>and the power
of a pre-existing system</i>

224
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:10,829
<i>and so the spectacle</i>
of the Egyptian model

225
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,236
is really, really important
to the show.

226
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:17,111
<u>Who:</u> Leaders of the Goa'uld.
Assume persona of an Earth-based god

227
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:20,305
and rule by force through
armies of Jaffa warriors.

228
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,492
<u>Balance of power:</u>

229
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,548
The System Lords
rarely trust each other,

230
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,623
and frequently battle
amongst themselves.

231
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:28,014
<u>Physiology:</u>
Most of the System Lords

232
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:31,247
have inhabited the same
host body for millenia.

233
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:35,174
Yu, the Jade emperor, was so old
that he could not leave his host.

234
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,802
The System Lords can't be trusted,
either as a group or individuals.

235
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,949
They're posturing egomaniacs

236
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,476
driven by an insatiable
lust for power,

237
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,282
each one capable
of unimaginable evil.

238
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,864
Once your good guys
have defeated your bad guys,

239
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,201
suddenly the
bad guys look weak.

240
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,482
You either need new
bad guys <i>that are either more bad,</i>

241
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:57,639
<i>or you need more
bad guys.</i>

242
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,139
The System Lords really are just
the most powerful Goa'ulds.

243
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:03,992
I am Baal.

244
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:06,319
As in "boccie"?

245
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:09,467
<i>They are
the Goa'ulds</i> who

246
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:13,372
have their own armies,
their own fleets <i>of ships</i>

247
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,674
<i>and their own territories
among the stars.</i>

248
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:18,718
<i>I think</i> with the System Lords
what was important

249
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,153
- because in every
pantheon of gods

250
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,253
there was
a hierarchical system -

251
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:27,128
and I think that it was important
because you had all these

252
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:31,976
System Lords warring with each other
who all seemed to represent different

253
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,168
deities from different
mythos in Earth lore.

254
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,078
Whom do you serve?

255
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,719
- Anubis.
- What?!

256
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,323
- You lie!
- He is dead!

257
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,674
That was what you assumed
after you attempted to murder him.

258
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,936
Because of the hierarchical system,
you could only have things

259
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,152
going a certain way. This guy had
to be more powerful than that,

260
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,196
if that's the way it was painted out
in our history and the way

261
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,326
our ancestors
understood this.

262
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,693
<i>So it's really interesting when
you get an episode like "Summit"</i>

263
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:03,103
<i>when you have all these guys in
the same room but they all represent</i>

264
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,850
<i>different
cultural distinctions.</i>

265
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,778
<i>There's Amaterasu,
which is Japanese...</i>

266
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:09,738
<i>A god from
African mythology...</i>

267
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:12,305
<i>- Cronus, that was Greek...
- Bastet, which is Egyptian...</i>

268
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,678
<i>Yu, from the Chinese mythology,
although interestingly enough,</i>

269
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,747
Yu was a character who

270
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,224
wasn't a god in the
Chinese mythology.

271
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,840
He was - I think - an architect
or sort of a high official.

272
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,046
They kind of
adopt the culture.

273
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:31,535
The Goa'uld kind of become
the god they're portraying.

274
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,063
<u>Who:</u> Slaves of
the Goa'uld bred

275
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:42,005
to fight their battles.
Incubators for Goa'uld young.

276
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,344
<u>Physiology:</u>

277
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,769
Carry Goa'uld symbiote
that functions as Jaffa's

278
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,944
immune system.
When symbiote reaches

279
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,252
maturity in 7-8 years
it must take a host.

280
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,264
<u>Jaffa technology:</u> Staff weapon
- preferred weapon of Jaffa warriors.

281
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:58,009
Uses naquadah power and
fires an energy plasma blast.

282
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:02,792
The Jaffa were originally created
as foot soldiers for the Goa'uld.

283
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,646
Kill the rest.

284
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,352
<i>The Jaffa are literally</i>

285
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:13,061
the incubators
for Goa'uld children.

286
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,891
- What the hell is that?
- It is an infant Goa'uld,

287
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,870
the larval form of the gods.

288
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:29,597
I have carried one since
I was a child, as all Jaffa carry one.

289
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,676
<i>To show their devotion</i> and
servitude to the Goa'ulds,

290
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:36,011
they wear their symbol
on their forehead.

291
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,112
<i>The First Primes
get the gold ones.</i>

292
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,465
<i>They've been cut
into their foreheads</i>

293
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,000
<i>and molten gold has been
poured in and it's kind of</i>

294
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,870
<i>a special rite of passage
to get the First Prime tattoo.</i>

295
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,861
As time went on and
we began humanising

296
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,365
the Jaffa and more and more
were exploring the fact that

297
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,409
they were essentially
innocents.

298
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,030
They weren't doing what they were
doing because they were evil,

299
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:58,437
unlike the Goa'uld who are
genetically <i>pre-disposed to be evil.</i>

300
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:02,649
I can save these people!

301
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:05,614
Help me!

302
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,991
Essentially we tell
the Jaffa story through Teal'c.

303
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,220
Help me.

304
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,157
Many have said that.

305
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:19,804
But you are the first
I believe could do it.

306
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,700
<i>Teal'c, being dissatisfied
with his situation,</i>

307
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:28,733
found out very early on that there
are other Jaffa that felt the same way.

308
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:33,133
- Why do you defy me?
- Because you are not a god.

309
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:37,127
You are a parasite
within a child

310
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,588
and I despise you.

311
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:42,316
<i>The basis of the movement,</i>

312
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:46,099
<i>and the basis, I think,
of any movement - is the people.</i>

313
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:51,022
<i>I think that really showed that
a society of people are</i> not controlled

314
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,895
from the top down, but
from the bottom up.

315
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,944
I die

316
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,262
free!

317
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,971
<i>They finally rise up,
led by Teal'c,</i>

318
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:08,786
<i>and throw off the yoke
of </i>Goa'uld oppression and

319
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,354
win their freedom.

320
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,683
In the battle against the Goa'uld,
Earth needed allies,

321
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,750
and with perfect timing,
we met the Asgard.

322
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,930
Borrowing from
the look of the Roswell greys

323
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,275
and a long-standing
Norse mythology,

324
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,085
the Asgard represented
a strength

325
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,009
that SG-1 had not seen
since meeting the Goa'uld.

326
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:36,596
It would later foster
a friendship and an alliance

327
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,754
that would run
throughout the entire series.

328
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,709
<u>Who:</u> Benevolent and
powerful technological gods

329
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,330
who protect rather than enslave
peoples they believe as

330
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:51,577
too simple to understand
their science.

331
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,397
<u>Physiology:</u>
A dying race that reproduces

332
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:55,109
<u>Physiology:</u>
entirely through cloning.

333
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,802
<u>Asgard technology:</u>
Asgard Stones, control functions

334
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:01,333
in Asgard mothership
including communications,

335
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,634
holographic projection,
navigation and transport beams.

336
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,008
Initially what we had was,

337
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:10,984
SG-1 were the good guys
and the Goa'uld were the bad guys,

338
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,618
but the Goa'uld
were so powerful

339
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:18,656
<i>that there was really no way
that SG-1 even stood a chance.</i>

340
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:22,725
That's why the Asgard were introduced.
In a way, the Asgard were

341
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:26,077
as much an adversary
to the Goa'uld

342
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,486
as we were, and
we became friends with them.

343
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:31,856
So, where am I?

344
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:36,349
This is the Asgard planet Othala
in the galaxy of Ida.

345
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,885
<i>So the Asgard are
important</i> because

346
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,523
they do take the show
in a new direction

347
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,091
largely by introducing
a new race,

348
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,874
a new power
in the galaxy.

349
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:50,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think this is... Thor's chariot.

350
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,802
An Asgard mothership.

351
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,810
I've heard them described
in Jaffa legend.

352
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:00,501
<i>In "Thor's Hammer,"
these people</i> believed

353
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:04,193
that they would always be
protected by their god, Thor.

354
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:11,891
<i>They appear to have</i>

355
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,931
all of the accoutrements

356
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:18,623
of <i>ancient Norse gods.</i>

357
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,907
I am Thor.

358
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,316
You are brave
to come before me.

359
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,261
O mighty Thor,
we need your help.

360
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:28,774
<i>Originally they're
presented in hologram form</i>

361
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,949
<i>as mighty Norse gods.</i>

362
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:35,462
<i>When you see the Asgard</i>
for what they are, they are

363
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:36,748
wildly different.

364
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:39,528
So we get that kind of contrast,
which sort of shows

365
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:44,362
the relationship between what
we imagine and what is actually real;

366
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,926
but we also get things like,
for instance,

367
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,066
the notion of custodial gods,
right?

368
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,578
So Thor replaced Odin,
the warrior god,

369
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,124
because he was
a custodial god.

370
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,834
He looked after farms,
not raiders;

371
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:01,487
and Thor and the Asgard
are custodial aliens

372
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,912
the Protected Planets Treaty
and so forth.

373
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:07,551
The Asgard will attempt to negotiate
with the Goa'uld System Lords

374
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:11,314
to include Earth in
the Protected Planets Treaty.

375
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:15,285
That's a good thing, right?

376
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,888
I think it was really
interesting to

377
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,807
- because of these aliens
who are not gonna fit in

378
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,447
and be able just
to converse openly -

379
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,908
So they had to do some research
and if they're dealing with

380
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,478
primitive civilasations so
they had to do some research of,

381
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:31,044
"How do we communicate to these
people and how do we get them to

382
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:34,481
possibly do our bidding...
or just

383
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:37,863
find out a little bit more about them,"
so the idea that they used technology

384
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:42,975
to imitate human-type life forms
that appealed to a specific culture

385
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:45,900
like the Norse people
at the time.

386
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:49,111
I think that's a little bit
more interesting to me, and

387
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:52,370
something that went on throughout
the entire serie and just kept evolving.

388
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,938
The coordinates are set.

389
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:58,262
Are you ready,
Colonel Carter?

390
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,943
Ready as I'll ever be.

391
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,442
Initiating transport.

392
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,740
<u>Who</u> : Technologically
advanced "bugs" programmed

393
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:14,283
by creators with only one
objective self replication

394
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,824
<u>Created By</u> : Android Reese as
toys and protectors.

395
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:20,414
Designed to replicate at all costs,
she eventually lost control of them

396
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,623
<u>Physiology</u> : Individual blocks
exert a reactive modulating energy field

397
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:27,179
on other blocks allowing them
to reassemble in a new form.

398
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,112
Eventually evolved
into human form replicators.

399
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,992
Shortly after the asgard were
introduced, we realized.

400
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,437
we've created
an adversary for the goa'uld

401
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,099
that are in fact so powerful,

402
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,446
That it doesn't really
make sense why

403
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,959
the asgard haven't
wiped the goa'uld out

404
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,087
And

405
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:48,057
it was kind of looking at that
hole in the series that

406
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:51,999
that, you know, made us
invent the Replicators.

407
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:57,858
<i>The original replicators</i>
introduced in sg-1,

408
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:02,505
were these <i>little mechanical
creatures that consumed metal.</i>

409
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:05,016
What, are you saying they're
actually eating the ship?

410
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,117
Ingesting
the alloys, yes.

411
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,966
They will continue until
they risk compromising

412
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,440
the integrity of the hull.

413
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,344
<i>You had the asgard
that are so advanced</i>

414
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,904
That had obviously
advanced past the use

415
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:21,661
of these crude
projectile weapons.

416
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:24,107
Who were trying to use
energy-based weapons.

417
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:26,007
And it wasn't having
an effect.

418
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,860
You have demonstrated their
weakness may be found through a less

419
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,876
sophisticated approach.

420
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:35,555
We are no longer capable
of such thinking.

421
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,591
Wait a minute,
you're actually saying that

422
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,390
you need someone
dumber than you are?

423
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,550
You may have come
to the right place.

424
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,892
And as a result, replicators
had pretty much overrun their galaxy.

425
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,039
And we ended up
doing a better job.

426
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,355
Of handling the threat
they posed to our galaxy.

427
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,102
<i>The replicators</i> gave us a really
interesting thoughtless

428
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,331
Bent-on-destruction kind of
antagonist for us to face.

429
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,325
<i>But it also highlighted
our own</i>

430
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,377
<i>need to walk carefully when
dealing with artificial intelligence</i>

431
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,617
<i>and dealing with technology
that gets away on us,</i>

432
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,345
<i>So i thought that was
a nice avenue for us</i>

433
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:09,874
<i>to peruse for
a while as well.</i>

434
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:14,686
<i>It's a good example of how</i> an
enemy, how a <i>race evolves.</i>

435
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:17,689
<i>And becomes part
of a series' canon</i>

436
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:21,229
<i>and part of the ground
from which you build stories.</i>

437
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,739
As the writing continued to cultivate
the mythology of the show.

438
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:34,868
The scope of just how much the
Stargate opened us up to the universe

439
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,649
Was becoming more evident
with every new episode.

440
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:40,351
In the same season that we met the
Asgard we came across

441
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:43,928
a new ally that would prove fruitful
in the fight against the Goa'uld :

442
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:44,937
The Tok'ra

443
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,763
<u>Who</u> : Highly advanced
alliance of Goa'uld resistance.

444
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:51,570
Main goal is the destruction
of the System Lords.

445
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,369
<u>Physiology</u> : The Tok'Ra
take symbiotes by choice

446
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,809
and share a mutually
beneficial relationship.

447
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:59,281
<u>Alliances</u> : Tok'Ra/Tauri
alliance grew stronger when

448
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:02,501
Colonel Carter's father
Jacob Carter became

449
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,426
host to the
Tok'Ra symbiote Selmak

450
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:07,780
Kiss me.

451
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,849
You're kidding, right?

452
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,777
No, I'm not.

453
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,394
<i>Really the reason we
invented the Tok'Ra</i> was

454
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:25,512
how do you get out
of the problem of having

455
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:27,820
a Goa'uld in one
of your main characters,

456
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:31,794
<i>the twist is: what if that
Goa'uld was actually a good guy?</i>

457
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:39,990
<i>One of the elements</i> of the show
that I really enjoyed was

458
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,355
the philosophical difference
between being a Jaffa,

459
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,152
being a Goa'uld,

460
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,381
and being a Tok'Ra.

461
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:50,845
Goa'uld take hosts.
Tok'ra do not.

462
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,019
Ours wish to be so.

463
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:55,355
We have a truly
symbiotic relationship.

464
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:59,230
<i>The Tok'Ra have been</i> a
long-standing ally.

465
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,386
But their numbers are few

466
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,078
and they've always
been a little wary of

467
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:05,786
sticking their
necks out too far.

468
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,494
SG-1's search for allies and
its desire to acquire technology

469
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:12,413
that could help Earth in its
battle against unforeseen aggressors.

470
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:16,047
was only overshadowed by the quest
to understand the bigger picture.

471
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:18,623
Who started it all?

472
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:21,826
It was the introduction of the
Ancients to the Stargate universe

473
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,357
that added a rich new layer
to Stargate's mythology.

474
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,381
<u>Who:</u> Race of ascended beings that
exist in a state of enlightenment.

475
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:33,885
<u>Alliance:</u> One of the four great
races of the Ancient Alliance

476
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,512
consisting of the Asgard, the Nox,
the Furlings and the Ancients.

477
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:40,713
<u>Ancient Technology:</u>
Ancient Repository - a device within

478
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:44,295
a sealed chamber holding
the archive of ancient knowledge

479
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,500
capable of downloading
directly onto a subject's mind.

480
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,967
<i>The Ancients and ascension
are very much about</i>

481
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:08,378
<i>the continuation of
the human</i> soul beyond

482
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,206
humanity as we know it.

483
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:16,233
- I'm an Ancient.
- What?!

484
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:20,332
Not me, but the Others
like me. They're the Ancients.

485
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,814
This is written in one of the oldest
dialects of the Ancients

486
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:27,355
I always suspected, but
I never really knew for sure.

487
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,596
What does it say?

488
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:31,475
It says they evolved from a race
of humans that lived long before us,

489
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:34,246
that they were wiped out by
a plague sweeping across the galaxy

490
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:37,797
and that many learned
to ascend and the rest died out.

491
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:41,441
- I have to go.
- Daniel!

492
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:46,586
We've kind of said that
the Ancients are us.

493
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,112
We are...

494
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,099
the second evolution
of this physical form.

495
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:55,614
And the idea of the
Ancients is that they evolved.

496
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:59,195
<i>Eventually they became
so knowledgeable of the universe</i>

497
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:02,578
<i>and of the understanding of
existence that they were able to</i>

498
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,319
<i>shed their human bodies
and turn into energy.</i>

499
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,967
<i>And the philosophy that they
then have to adopt</i>

500
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,827
because it empowers them
so much is to not interfere.

501
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:18,387
If you know what it is we're
looking for and as an ascended being,

502
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,574
I have to assume you do.

503
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:25,389
As Doctor Jackson knows, it is against
our highest law to interfere.

504
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:29,878
They refer to that
most important question

505
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:32,702
or one of the two most important
questions of mythology.

506
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,411
The first one is:
Where do we come from?

507
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:37,721
Actually they answer both of those where
do we come from? and where are we going?

508
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:41,539
So they are Origin and Telos, right?

509
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,404
The beginning and the end.

510
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:47,350
The markings on the
wall are a language. It's a bible.

511
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:49,458
No, actually it's more
of an instruction book

512
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,615
on how to reach this
ethereal plane of existence.

513
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,604
Some kind of other world. It's natural
the Jaffa who found this place

514
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,970
would have interpreted it
as a passage to the afterlife.

515
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,852
Slow down there Grasshopper.

516
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:02,683
If the Ancients were really the first

517
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:07,403
form, human form that lived
on Earth and built the Stargates

518
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:09,736
and then went out
into the galaxy from here,

519
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:13,544
as evidenced by the fact that it's
our constellations  on the Stargate,

520
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,974
then they had to have been
on Earth millions of years ago,

521
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:18,119
<i>in which case there
should be some evidence of it.</u>

522
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:21,093
- I don't think this is it, Sam.
- What do you mean?

523
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,395
The dome's too small.
It's like Taonas.

524
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:28,564
It's obviously not a city,
it's just an outpost of some kind.

525
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,785
- This isn't Atlantis?
- I don't think so.

526
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:33,261
<i>The lost city of Atlantis!</i>

527
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,360
<i>It's interesting,</i>
because it was mystical

528
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,746
even at the moment
when we first heard about it in Plato

529
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:43,648
it had already been sunk <i>in
the sea for nine thousand years,</i>

530
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:47,121
<i>and so it brings with it
that huge suitcase</i>

531
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,217
<i>of history</i>

532
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,621
<i>and associations
with that banished past.</i>

533
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,550
As the seasons moved on
and SG1 aligned with

534
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,987
their allies to
overpower the Goa'uld

535
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,330
the show took
on a new direction.

536
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,483
Events occurred that led the
SG-1 team to a new race

537
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,518
which caused them to
re-examine everything

538
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,581
they thought they knew
about the Gate-builders.

539
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,272
Robert, I think
quite correctly said,

540
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,565
Look, let's,

541
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,712
let's introduce a new bad
guy. Let's introduce a new

542
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:25,080
a new long-term large arc
that can be,

543
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,892
that can be,
essentially a new mythology

544
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:31,128
that's still very much
within the Stargate universe.

545
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,397
Once upon a time there was a race of
people that were on a great journey

546
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,940
through space across the universe.
They were called the Altera.

547
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:42,551
After much time and I think
this means thousands of years

548
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:46,267
they found a great belt of stars.

549
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:49,204
And they lived happily ever after.

550
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,184
Have you found something,
Daniel Jackson?

551
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:00,880
It says that the Alterans named
their new home Avalon

552
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,665
and that they built
many Astria Porta.

553
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,250
Stargates.

554
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,746
In "Avalon 1" Vala comes
through the Gate

555
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:11,862
and she is carrying this treasure map
and the treasure map leads us...

556
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:15,482
the treasure happens to be here
on Earth and it's a cache of

557
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:17,913
treasure and possibly weapons
and technology that

558
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,565
we have been looking
for for years.

559
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:23,230
Avalon was actually a place where Merlin
helped Arthur a mortal ascend.

560
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,475
Are not the Ancients
prevented from interfering

561
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,170
with the existence of mortals?

562
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:30,692
Ascended Ancients yes for the most part
but it's possible Merlin wasn't actually

563
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:34,531
ascended himself but was in fact just a
human far along the evolutionary path.

564
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:37,560
What does this have to do with
where this alleged treasure is buried?

565
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,532
There are a number
of conflicting interpretations

566
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:41,990
but certain threads point
to the Knights of the Round Table

567
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,686
gathering great treasures from
the far corners of Arthur's domain

568
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:46,789
and hiding them in
a magical stronghold at Avalon.

569
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:50,225
The idea that Glastonbury Tor is the
place where King Arthur is buried, now

570
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,479
immediately, shining
a light on that makes you go

571
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,911
"What the heck does that
have to do with anything?"

572
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:56,812
You realise what this could mean?

573
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:03,915
Woah! We've always
presumed that the Ancients

574
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:07,045
were the first evolution
of humans in this galaxy,

575
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,823
but, but this ...

576
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:13,089
this is the first evidence
suggesting they came here

577
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:15,781
long ago from somewhere
far, far away.

578
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,230
Colonel Mitchell.

579
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:19,234
<i>The Alterans is a way of</i>

580
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:21,572
<i>distinguishing the Ancients
being an entire culture</i>

581
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,082
<i>the Ori and the Alterans
being the two</i>

582
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,440
<i>aspects of that that broke
off in different directions.</i>

583
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,385
<i>The discovery</i> that
the Alterans actually

584
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:30,700
potentially exist in
another galaxy

585
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,591
was our way

586
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,657
- in Season 9 - of
separating those two.

587
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:39,205
We always kept referring to
the Ancients as one distinct

588
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,624
governing body that
was always looking on

589
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,818
and we just referred
to them as the Ancients;

590
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,557
and then the discovery
that there are ...

591
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,754
if there is a good one, then there
must be a bad one here too.

592
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,421
Hallowed are the Ori.

593
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,360
The new direction of
the show had begun

594
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,690
and the tides were turning
with every mission.

595
00:30:58,032 --> 00:31:00,545
The introduction of the
fundamentalist Ori served

596
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,132
notice that the battle
to keep the galaxy safe

597
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,538
was far from over.

598
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:12,989
<u>WHO:</u>
Ascended beings that

599
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,731
use advanced technology
and spiritual knowledge

600
00:31:15,732 --> 00:31:18,547
to deceive the non-ascended
humans into worshiping them.

601
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:21,809
<u>Great Divide:</u> The division
between the Ori and the Alterans

602
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,564
was a result of the emergence
of two different philosophies.

603
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:29,103
The Alterans followed
a more scientific/rational outlook

604
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:32,512
while the Ori developed
fundamentalist religious beliefs.

605
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,010
The Ori - unlike the
Ancients who

606
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,977
have adopted
this kind of hands off

607
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,779
policy towards our galaxy

608
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:44,075
the Ori are very hands on

609
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,972
and are the antithesis of
the Ancients we've created.

610
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:51,959
I wanted the new bad guys
<i>to have the same feeling</i>

611
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:56,106
<i>to have the same essence
that the relationship with</i>

612
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,574
<i>the Goa'uld was at the
beginning of the series.</i>

613
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:03,196
<i>They could be</i> posing as gods
but have even more power.

614
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:06,190
It's all lies and propaganda
as far as they're concerned.

615
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,495
We're wrong; they're right.
They're good; we're bad.

616
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:13,243
We must worship the
Ori or die. And they will

617
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,552
fight until we are dead
or they are. Period.

618
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:20,316
One of the things that we
intentionally did <i>was looked</i>

619
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,331
<i>at the colourful
flamboyance of the Goa'uld</i>

620
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:27,086
<i>and took a decidedly
darker approach to the Ori.</i>

621
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:30,672
<i>The Priors are quite obviously
the priests of the religion.</i>

622
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,287
What's interesting
about them is that,

623
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,099
again, they have
supernatural abilities.

624
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:43,956
<i>The Ori, as ascended
beings, have a certain</i>

625
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,744
knowledge of the
way things work;

626
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,996
of humans and of evolution
and so they can impart

627
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:57,718
advancements on people. They
can wave their magic wands

628
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:01,060
<i>and give people psychic
abilities or telekinesis</i>

629
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:04,908
<i>or super-strength, whatever.
And the Priors have that.</i>

630
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,383
<i>So when the Priors say,</i>

631
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:08,491
Hey, we represent the
Ori and guess what?

632
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:11,156
We have the ability to,
you know, plant our staff

633
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,038
in the ground and
part the Red Sea,

634
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:15,806
uh, people tend
to believe them.

635
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,487
Behold the gift

636
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:21,385
the Ori have
bestowed upon me.

637
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,987
<i>It was interesting to
create bad guys that</i>

638
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,598
<i>from their point of view
are maybe not so bad.</i>

639
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,295
<i>I mean, the warriors the people</i>
who believe in Origin are saying,

640
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,536
Hey, come on, you
know. they're saying is

641
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,791
Behave yourselves
and we'll help you ascend

642
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:40,932
What is there for any and
all to gain by choosing

643
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:42,652
the path of Origin?

644
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:46,790
Those seeking eternal
salvation can follow

645
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,637
the word of the Ori.

646
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:52,410
Those that do not
shall die as mortals.

647
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,566
It is as simple as that.

648
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:57,869
<i>The twist is that</i> they're
actually not helping people ascend.

649
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:02,112
The Ori are actually a small
group of ascended beings

650
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:05,388
who are manipulating people
because they actually gain

651
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:10,253
some sort of energy,
power, from the worship

652
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,708
of human beings.

653
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:14,397
For starters, did you
know that the Ori

654
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:15,939
need people to worship them

655
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,200
because that's how
they gain their power?

656
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,631
- He didn't know.
- No, he didn't know that.

657
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,990
They're not fulfilling the
one promise of the religion,

658
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:26,716
and that is that if you're
good, you're gonna be

659
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:29,162
you're gonna be
brought up to their level.

660
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:32,436
I never dreamed I would one day
be fit to serve the Ori in this way.

661
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,962
By killing people you
know nothing about?

662
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,577
All I need to know is that
they are an enemy of the Ori

663
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,680
that they reject the
teachings of Origin

664
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,481
and would have us
stray from the path.

665
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:46,780
These

666
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:49,370
so called unbelievers:

667
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:51,406
they're so far away.
How can they affect us?

668
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,282
Evil must not be allowed
to fester anywhere.

669
00:34:55,372 --> 00:34:58,716
<i>Tomin is an excellent
example of a character who</i>

670
00:34:58,815 --> 00:35:01,865
<i>gets swept away in this
religious fervour, if you will.</i>

671
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:06,088
Unlike the Ori or even the
Priors to a certain extent

672
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,861
he's not an evil individual
but incredibly misguided,

673
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:14,283
and so you feel sympathy
for the character.

674
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:15,979
Fear not.

675
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,107
Once we warriors of Ori
have vanquished the wicked,

676
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,292
I shall return.

677
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,428
<i>I was really interested
in making the warriors</i>

678
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:29,971
<i>multi-dimensional. I really
wanted to</i> kind of understand

679
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:32,227
what it would be
like on the other side.

680
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:34,309
- You have to listen to me.
- No!

681
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:37,146
I am deaf to all but
the teachings of Origin!

682
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:40,533
<i>So by putting</i> Vala

683
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:43,701
you know as behind
enemy lines,<i> so to speak,</i>

684
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,713
<i>and having her
develop this relationship</i>

685
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,640
<i>I mean, here's a guy who
she really could have</i>

686
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:52,173
<i>probably spent her life with
who just also</i> happened to be,

687
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,276
you know, a holy crusader.

688
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:56,453
Now,

689
00:35:57,036 --> 00:36:00,514
hear the words of the Orici.

690
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:04,078
<i>Right from the get-go we knew that
if we had gotten into Season 10,</i>

691
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:06,632
<i>we needed to kind of
put a figurehead on that;</i>

692
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:09,139
<i>put a real face on the bad guys.</i>

693
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:12,947
<i>We created the character
who has a knowledge of the Ori</i>

694
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,565
<i>in the form of a
human being. She was,</i>

695
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,324
<i>you know,
immaculately conceived,</i>

696
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:21,334
<i>Vala carried the child and
then the Ori kind of snuck</i>

697
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:24,228
one of their own over the border
and cheated the Ancient rules.

698
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,887
We're not rejoining the fleet.
You're coming with me.

699
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,738
No. I can't abandon my army.

700
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:31,206
It's not your army.

701
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,876
Of course it is.

702
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,961
As your mother,
I'm putting my foot down.

703
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,681
You're too young
to have your own army.

704
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:39,175
With the introduction
of Adria, who

705
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,772
I liken to an evil
Joan of Arc ...

706
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,273
What of the village?

707
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,654
Have they agreed to accept
the teachings of Origin?

708
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:47,942
- No.
- Then burn it.

709
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,425
<i>we have a character
who not only embodies,</i>

710
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,710
you know, the spirit of the Ori

711
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:58,095
but is able to interact
with us on a physical level

712
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,397
I think with the
introduction of the Ori to

713
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:06,056
the mythology of "Stargate,"
what it's done is that it's

714
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:08,845
allowed us to be a little
bit more intellectual,

715
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:11,357
a little bit more
contemporary with

716
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,511
our usage of the word "god" in
the context of science fiction.

717
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,013
What is a god,

718
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:21,126
but a being that is
worshipped by those beneath?

719
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:23,529
Is great knowledge, power,

720
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,565
understanding not enough
for you to revere the Ori?

721
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:29,892
Respect, yes, certainly; but

722
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,862
that doesn't mean I would murder
innocent people in their name.

723
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,620
People were saying,
"Oh my God, the Ori

724
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,115
they're so powerful <i>and
the Priors are so bad.</i>

725
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,997
<i>I mean, how is the team
ever gonna defeat them?</i>

726
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,580
<i>How are they ever gonna win?<i>

727
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,993
<i>And I mean, that's kind
of what we wanted.</i>

728
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,311
<i>That's what the
fan reaction was, I think,</i>

729
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:50,029
<i>at the beginning</i> of the
series when, you know,

730
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,971
here we have the Goa'uld and they
have all these ships and technology.

731
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,611
How are we ever gonna beat them?
Well, eight years later we did.

732
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,853
We kicked their asses and
now we have <i>to set up</i>

733
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:01,716
<i>a situation in the same series</i>

734
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:04,750
<i>where our heroes can
once again overcome</i>

735
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:08,142
<i>what seem to be
incredible odds to win.</i>

736
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:16,508
As SG-1's focus turns to
the birth of a new enemy,

737
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:19,830
the show delves further into a
world of Arthurian mythology

738
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,968
and leads us on a
chase for the Holy Grail.

739
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:25,994
Have you heard of Merlin?

740
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,661
Merlin.

741
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:30,726
King Arthur and the
Knights of the Round Table

742
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:33,530
- Was an Ancient?
- I think so.

743
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:37,561
See! That is what
I'm talkin' about.

744
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:41,751
Merlin wasn't a particularly
spiritual character

745
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,293
in Arthurian legend.

746
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,899
He was a guy that

747
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:50,864
manipulated things so
that Arthur was born

748
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,679
<i>and then helped Arthur with
the business of being king.</i>

749
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:57,835
<i>In "Stargate",</i> it's sort of the
other way around again.

750
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:01,661
He comes down from a holy
place, from being ascended,

751
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:04,578
and helps people towards

752
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,194
defending themselves on
the physical plain and

753
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,615
also against spiritual dangers.

754
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:14,539
It made sense that this guy,
Merlin had the capability of

755
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,276
of being a wizard and

756
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:20,378
sending Arthur on
this quest because

757
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,516
he really was a very
powerful... alien, if you will.

758
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:28,045
Welcome, ye Knights
of the Round Table,

759
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:33,251
men of honour, followers
of the path of righteousness.

760
00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:37,415
Only those with
wealth of knowledge

761
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:39,741
and truth of spirit

762
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:42,362
shall be given
access to the underworld.

763
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:44,902
You know,
the Merlin/Holy Grail

764
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:50,368
is a search - is a search for
something that would be the answer,

765
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:53,144
the solution to our problems,

766
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:57,398
and it's the main thrust of

767
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:59,776
Season 10: searching for

768
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:04,120
the device that hopefully, you
know, if used properly would

769
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,405
<i>actually kill the Ori.</i>

770
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:10,011
Your world, as well as countless
others, are in danger of being overrun

771
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,420
by an enemy far more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

772
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,783
They are called the Ori,
and they will destroy anyone

773
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,356
- who does not kneel before them.
- We learned a long time ago

774
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,968
Merlin was working on a weapon
that could be used against them,

775
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,664
and the key to finding that
weapon is inside that library.

776
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:28,237
The Holy Grail is a really
interesting figure because

777
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:30,391
it's again a pseudo-Christian

778
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:34,926
artefact that was never actually
accepted officially by the Church,

779
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:37,638
but it has that sort of
strong Christian association

780
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,595
brought by Joseph of
Arimathea to England

781
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:44,541
and being associated with
resurrection and purity of heart.

782
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,207
Prudence, wisdom, charity,
kindness, and faith.

783
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,149
Let these be your guide
on this perilous quest.

784
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:55,406
<i>So it has this really</i> long history,

785
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,599
but it's associated with
the quest and with

786
00:40:58,177 --> 00:41:01,712
nobility and with chivalry
and all those kinds of things

787
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,574
and it has, therefore,

788
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:06,633
a really strong
redemptive quality to it.

789
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,770
It was lost because
humanity was wicked,

790
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,478
so that, notion that when we find
it there's a kind of redemption

791
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,203
but it's tricky in this context
because it's also associated

792
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,292
with potential genocide, right,

793
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:20,926
in the fact that it could
destroy the Ori and

794
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,948
anybody else who
happens to be ascended.

795
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,273
And I think that through us
using this we were able

796
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:29,120
to take something other
than just using deities

797
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,100
and their stories;
we were able to take

798
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,698
a little piece of our own
unexplained history possibly and say,

799
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:37,932
Hey, what if it did happen but it didn't
happen <i>quite like people think it did?</i>

800
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,458
We're talking about
the Holy Grail?

801
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,355
Every movie I've seen,
that's a cup.

802
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,598
No. The notion that the
Grail was a cup or chalice

803
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:46,857
particularly the one used
by Christ at the Last Supper

804
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:48,252
was a late addition
to the myth.

805
00:41:48,343 --> 00:41:50,940
Similar accounts describe it
variously as a dish or platter

806
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,407
or in the case of
von Eschenbach

807
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,503
and other Middle Eastern-influenced
chroniclers as a stone

808
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:56,923
that fell from the heavens.

809
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:01,633
<i>From the feeding of the Goa'uld
to the discovery of the Ori</i>

810
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,167
<i>from meeting the Asgard to
the search for the Holy Grail,</i>

811
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:08,625
<i>"Stargate: SG-1" has created a
rich and complex mythology</i>

812
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,993
<i>that has given the fans a
reason to tune in every week.</i>

813
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:14,705
<i>Someone once
compared "Stargate"</i>

814
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,371
<i>to a really cool, long
and complicated novel</i>

815
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:21,098
<i>that doesn't ever have to end.</i>

816
00:42:21,178 --> 00:42:24,744
<i>The only way you can have
that kind of complex,</i>

817
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,415
<i>rich, detailed mythology
is to have it</i>

818
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:29,756
<i>slowly evolve over the course</i>

819
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:33,599
<i>of ten years. Hard to
believe when you say that.</i>

820
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,454
<i>The success of the show</i>

821
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:39,773
<i>I think is very much tied to
that larger superstructure:</i>

822
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:41,863
<i>the ability to take</i>

823
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:46,251
<i>something that we know,
something that we recognise</i>

824
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,921
<i>the pyramids, for example and
to give it to us in a new way.</i>

825
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,474
<i>So, after ten seasons and
over two hundred episodes,</i>

826
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:57,360
<i>"Stargate: SG-1" has - with the help
of some of the world's greatest myths</i>

827
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,149
<i>taken the fans on a fantastic voyage.</i>

828
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:04,641
<i>And the voyage continues.</i>
