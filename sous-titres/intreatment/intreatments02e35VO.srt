<i>You have no messages.</i>

00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:53,855
God, Paul.

3
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,106
If you're not coming,

4
00:00:57,231 --> 00:01:00,208
couldn't you just call
and tell me you're not coming?

6
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,279


7
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,132
Are you

8
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:28,754
going out?

9
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,833
You look great.

10
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,103
Thank you.

11
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,668
I'd ask you where you were going

12
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:44,143
but I know that you have
your boundaries as a therapist.

13
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,599
Look, I hate to do this,
I hate it when my patients do it,

14
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,499
but I've asked my lawyer
to call me about the hearing.

15
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,106
And...

16
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,278
I'd rather be

17
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:11,826
here

18
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:15,244
- if it's bad news, okay?
- Sure.

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,432
I was so relieved
that you didn't ask for the letter.

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,173
I decided not to send it.

21
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,940
Yeah, I was having lunch

22
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,442
with the kids last Sunday and Rosie
actually asked me about the case.

23
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,445
And I told her
about the settlement offer

24
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,063
and she said,
"Dad, you can't do this.

25
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:39,868
"You can't confess
to something you didn't do.

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,437
"You're the good guy."

27
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,089
She'd been so rude to me all night
about other stuff.

28
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:48,453
I guess she's still angry
about the divorce.

29
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,275
And then suddenly in one sentence,
she made me feel better

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
- than I'd felt all week.
- I'm glad.

31
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:57,259
So then I called my lawyer
and I said I wasn't interested

32
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,827
in the settlement,

33
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,591
which meant they went through
with the hearing

34
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,460
- this morning.
- So how did that go?

35
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,812
I don't know yet. I wasn't there.

36
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:14,163
The lawyer said
technically, I didn't have to be.

37
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,170
- You didn't go?
- I overslept.

38
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,825
And why do you think
you chose this morning to oversleep?

39
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,929
Yeah, the subconscious thing.

40
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,247
Probably because
I didn't want to go.

41
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:32,753
And I just didn't feel like begging
some judge to let me keep my job.

42
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,005
You felt showing up
would be begging?

43
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,177
I don't know.

44
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,611
So why are you dressed up?

45
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,435
I want to hear about your life.

46
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,699
You want to hear about my life?

47
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,982
You don't wanna talk
about your own life?

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,150
Exactly.

49
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:59,259
I'd rather talk about
how your lawyer felt the hearing went.

50
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,548
- Did he say anything?
- Yeah, he said not to quote him...

51
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:04,973
'cause these guys hate to be quoted

52
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,202
but he said that he thought

53
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,415
that it went well.

54
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,849
Did he say when you'd find out?

55
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:18,035
Anytime between today
and God-knows-when.

56
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:22,398
- So you're in limbo.
- Caught between heaven and hell,

57
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:23,973
waiting for my fate

58
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,831
to be decided, yeah.

59
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,868
That must be what this whole year
has felt like to you.

60
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,811
You've been under enormous pressure.

61
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:35,345
Is that why you dressed up?

62
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,067
That blue looks
really really good on you.

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,574
It's the same color
as the dress you had on that night

64
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,787
I saw you and David coming out
of that club on the eastern shore.

65
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,610
- It was the 4th of July.
- I remember.

66
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:54,735
I had

67
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,916
this crummy summer job.

68
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,757
And I was parking cars,

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,925
and...

70
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,674
I brought out the wrong car

71
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:07,681
and he asked me to go back
and get his convertible.

72
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,306
And I looked at him and I thought,

73
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:13,063
"Of course.
Why wouldn't she be with him?"

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,378
Yeah, we had a wonderful dinner
and we danced.

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,644
And then we came outside and there was
my most dedicated graduate student.

76
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,378
We were all so in love with you.

77
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,616
Don't be silly.

78
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,392
How could we not be?

79
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,188
You were brilliant,

80
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:38,211
and we believed everything you said.

81
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,424
What are you talking about?
You argued with everything that I said.

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,558
Yeah, but you made us do that.
That was your technique.

83
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,600
We were so fascinated by you.

84
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,040
We wanted to know

85
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,691
everything about you.

86
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,966
What's happening with you today?

87
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,355
What is it
you don't wanna talk about?

88
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,030
What happened here between us
last week,

89
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,086
or your case, or your patients,

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,987
- your children?
- No, none of the above.

91
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,503
Can you tell me what it is?

92
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,224
It's my lawyer.

93
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,990
- Are you sure you want me to stay?
- Please.

94
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,119
Hello, Ellis.

95
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,194
<i>I just spoke with your judge.</i>

96
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,927
- <i>I've got news.</i>
- What sort of news?

97
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,752
<i>First off, he was livid.</i>

98
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:53,511
At me?

99
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:54,964
<i>No,</i>

100
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,331
<i>at Mr. Prince,
for wasting everybody's time.</i>

101
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,003
<i>The judge hasn't written the ruling yet,
and he said not to quote him,</i>

102
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,778
<i>but there are no triable issues
of fact.</i>

103
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,442
- What?
- <i>He said it's a tragic story,</i>

104
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,764
<i>but he's going to dismiss
the action.</i>

105
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,725
<i>He's throwing the case out!</i>

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,235
- Are you saying it's over, Ellis?
- <i>I'm glad for you.</i>

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,259
- <i>I know this thing was a weight.</i>
- Thank you so much, you know.

108
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,902
I really appreciate
everything that you've done.

109
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,430
And...

110
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,283
I know I haven't been the easiest person
in the world to deal with,

111
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,151
but I just wanted to say

112
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,018
thank you.

113
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:38,515
<i>Nobody's nice
when they're being sued.</i>

114
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,324
<i>The important thing
is justice was served.</i>

115
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,872
<i>Come see me next week.
We'll go over it.</i>

116
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,376
<i>But tonight, you go out and celebrate.
You hear me?</i>

117
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,001
Yeah. Thanks, Ellis.

118
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:49,975
Good bye.

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,080
- I'm so happy for you.
- My God, it's amazing.

120
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:59,602
I'm so glad this judge could see
what the truth was.

121
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,503
How long do you think it's gonna be
before I really...

122
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,328
before I really feel it?

123
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,790
Before you wake up some morning
not thinking about it?

124
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,362
Or not go to bed some night
without thinking about it.

125
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,830
That's so great.

126
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,866
Now you know
you can keep your practice.

127
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,911
What are you gonna do?

128
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,127
You were in limbo about that
last week as well.

129
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:34,011
How did you do with your patients
this week? Was it hard to see them?

130
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,997
I did what you said.

131
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:39,246
I acted as if I believed

132
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,769
- I really was helping.
- And did that help?

133
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,939
To be honest,

134
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,314
I was kind of skeptical at first.

135
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,439
I felt a bit like a hypocrite,

136
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,779
and that they'd see that.

137
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,947
Of course you'd feel that way.

138
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:57,272
But then weirdly enough,
something started to happen.

139
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,920
I was talking to Oliver's dad

140
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,917
about the responsibility

141
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,419
of what it means to be a father
and keeping in touch

142
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,172
with your kid.

143
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,632
Really, I was talking
for both of us.

144
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,971
But I think I reached him.

145
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:17,388
I mean, I was still doubting myself,

146
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,386
but I just kept at it, you know?

147
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:25,711
I just couldn't believe that something
so simple could actually...

148
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,153
could actually work.

149
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,816
And it kept working, you know?

150
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,394
You're a good therapist.

151
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:39,566
And I'm sure you did
a lot of good work this week,

152
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,412
despite how uncertain you felt.

153
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:50,522
April left.

154
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,131
Therapy?

155
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,750
Why?

156
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:57,964
In part because I took her to chemo.

157
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,047
I don't regret it,

158
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:02,764
but it did

159
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:06,041
- alter our relationship.
- Of course.

160
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:08,682
But also,

161
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,991
I think she just needed
to stop thinking about herself.

162
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,111
She wanted some...

163
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,363
space.

164
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,369
She wanted to breathe,

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
to live.

166
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,693
And did you try
to convince her to stay?

167
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,520
Of course I did.

168
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:32,949
I'm worried that she doesn't have
the tools to survive another crisis.

169
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,800
But part of me, I have to say,
is really proud of her.

170
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,552
For rejecting you?

171
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,195
For rejecting therapy.

172
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,459
I meant, for acting out against you.

173
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:50,098
That's not what she was doing,
though.

174
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:52,421
She wasn't punishing me

175
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,202
or her parents.

176
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,124
She's fighting cancer.

177
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:59,031
She needs all of her energy
for that.

178
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:02,576
- And you were able to accept that?
- I was surprised

179
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,050
by my reaction.

180
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,782
I know I have this need to rescue,

181
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:13,092
but I really understood
her reasoning

182
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:15,768
completely.

183
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:20,874
You know, Walter and April,

184
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,056
they both think
that the world is supposed

185
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,564
to be

186
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,922
on their shoulders,

187
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,796
and they're both incapable
of receiving

188
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,272
support.

189
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,263
One's stopping therapy,

190
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,593
- the other wants more sessions.
- So you're going to continue.

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,285
You know what I realized this week?

192
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,082
Practicing this way, I may never know
whether I help people or not.

193
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,645
It's not like I'm trying to get them
to pass their driving test

194
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,044
or do better on their SATs
or something.

195
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,565
The only measure I have
of whether I'm helping somebody or not

196
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,451
is how my patients feel about it

197
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,594
and how their lives

198
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,112
go on from there.

199
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:12,146
And they won't know that
until long after we've stopped therapy.

200
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,484
- What are you saying?
- I guess what I'm trying to say is that

201
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,526
these people come to me,
they want me to fix their problems,

202
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:21,815
and the truth is,
I think all I can do is just

203
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:26,368
walk with them for a while,
keep them company during a rough patch.

204
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,445
I don't think anybody's life
can be figured out,

205
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,176
but it is in our nature
to keep trying to make sense of it.

206
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:35,498
And sometimes we can use help.

207
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,946
That's when, if we're lucky,
there's somebody in the room

208
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,321
who can listen.

209
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,261
It doesn't have
to be somebody perfect, somebody...

210
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:48,567
sufficiently screwed up to actually get
what we might be going through.

211
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,158
Someone like you.

212
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,425
- On occasion.
- And not someone like me.

213
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,063
No, Gina.

214
00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,511
Not for me.

215
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,819
Not anymore.

216
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,255
When did you come
to this conclusion?

217
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:11,599
I don't know.

218
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,149
Please don't take this personally.

219
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,486
I'm not...

220
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:24,705
No, I'm not taking it personally.

221
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,984
You know, I'm just...

222
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,434
I'm just disappointed
that we're here again.

223
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:34,757
I know.

224
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:37,993
I know.

225
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,671
But it is different this time.

226
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:46,092
I'm not doing this

227
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:47,502
in anger.

228
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,665
And I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

229
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,206
- I want you to know that.
- Thank you.

230
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,474
Let's not drag it out, you know.

231
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,960
After last week, really,
what is there to say?

232
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,403
I understand.
I just want to be sure you're aware

233
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,311
of why you're doing
what you're doing.

234
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,511
What is it you think
I'm not aware of?

235
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,165
Obviously, last week took a toll,
a big toll

236
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,021
you know, on both of us,

237
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:21,592
I know that I crossed a line,

238
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:26,216
but you also lost
two patients this week.

239
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:27,617
I know.

240
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:29,885
Well, has it occurred to you

241
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,860
that you're angry at them
for abandoning you,

242
00:14:32,994 --> 00:14:35,539
and that may be why you've decided
to abandon me?

243
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,417
- That's a little reductive, isn't it?
- No,

244
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:40,685
but this is:

245
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,832
you began the week questioning
your value as a therapist,

246
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,924
and you're ending
it questioning mine.

247
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,697
I'm not questioning you.

248
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:50,722
I'm questioning the way we interact,
you and I.

249
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,905
I don't think it's healthy
for either of us.

250
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,861
You're always questioning me,

251
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,036
blaming me.

252
00:14:57,713 --> 00:14:59,305
I think I've come to represent

253
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,183
everything you struggle
with in your work...

254
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,636
Emotional restraint,
delayed gratification,

255
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,919
not indulging your love
or your desire for a patient.

256
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,544
You've made me your boundary cop...

257
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:16,258
The mentor who's prevented you
from having anything you ever wanted.

258
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,233
And I beat you up for that.

259
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,965
It must have been exhausting to have

260
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,400
to play my mother all these years.

261
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:29,541
If I came running to you,
it was because I needed my mother.

262
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,508
If was angry at you,
it was because I was angry at my mother.

263
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,615
Honestly,
I don't know how you put up with it.

264
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,240
But you did,
and you got me through it.

265
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:42,137
All I'm saying is,
you don't have to do it anymore.

266
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,190
You're releasing me now.

267
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,164
Yes, I am.

268
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,130
You know, Paul,

269
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:56,376
if you need to go, you go.

270
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,748
But I'm concerned
that you may be punishing me

271
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,709
because I failed to protect you.

272
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,756
But you didn't fail me, Gina.

273
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,758
This has been my sanctuary.

274
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,498
All the parts of myself that
I don't like, that I'm ashamed of...

275
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:18,118
I could bring them here,
and it was always okay.

276
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,118
Do you think there's a connection
between the lawsuit ending

277
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:22,937
and your stopping therapy?

278
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,293
It's just time.

279
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,512
The things I needed for so long
have changed.

280
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,380
I can't keep coming to you

281
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:38,163
for the mothering I didn't get,

282
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:40,872
and you shouldn't have
to provide it.

283
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,932
So you're not running away
from home?

284
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,041
I'd rather think of it
as moving out.

285
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,588
I'm going to make my way
in the world.

286
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:51,469
- Where will you go?
- I'm not going anywhere.

287
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,344
I'm still going to keep
being a therapist...

288
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,764
Maybe not all private sessions.

289
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,732
Some days I just sit there in the room
with a patient and I feel like...

290
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,854
I don't know...
I feel like we're two mice with our...

291
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,568
- legs caught in a glue trap.
- Oh, god.

292
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:14,321
It's a horrible feeling.

293
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,065
Maybe it's the chair.

294
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:20,870
I hate that fucking chair.

295
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,289
- You could get a new one.
- I did.

296
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,364
It felt good in the store.
But here's the thing about a chair...

297
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,456
You never really really know
until you've sat in it

298
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:33,063
for 40 hours a week for a month...

299
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,927
Month in, month out.
By then it's too late.

300
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,470
Do you want to practice standing up?

301
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,621
Maybe.

302
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,667
Maybe I need to be in a group practice,
so at least when a patient leaves

303
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,728
I could go into the lounge
and run into some other people

304
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:51,651
and talk about politics or books
or anything, for Christ's sake.

305
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,070
Have you thought about supervising?

306
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,106
I don't think

307
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,353
I'm at a role-model place
in my life right now, Gina.

308
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,728
I think you'd be a good supervisor.

309
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:05,040
I mean, you'd have compassion
for your students.

310
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:08,459
And the more a supervisor has seen,
the more valuable he can be.

311
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:13,246
I'm fairly certain at this point that
no case would shock or surprise you.

312
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:16,709
That would make
a young therapist feel very safe.

313
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,284
Maybe you're right.

314
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,479
The one thing I have figured out...

315
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:25,059
I just need to be with more people.

316
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,392
I don't need a break
from being a therapist.

317
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,267
I need a break from...

318
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:34,786
Just from this.

319
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:39,115
You know?
I need to stop analyzing

320
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:40,875
my life.

321
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,281
I need to start living it.

322
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,552
I need you to let me go.

323
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,809
Well, part of me would love to.

324
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,049
I just worry about the timing.

325
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,750
You're still in mourning.
You're alone. You're isolated.

326
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,542
You don't have a life
outside of your practice.

327
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,764
Are you talking
about me or you, Gina?

328
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,206
I'm talking about you.

329
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,281
Did something else happen this week?

330
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,985
- What do you mean?
- Did you meet someone?

331
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,718
- Why do you think that?
- I don't know.

332
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,204
I did have a conversation this week
while I was...

333
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:30,702
I was waiting for a coffee.

334
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,777
I was on my way to the subway

335
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:34,827
and

336
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,257
she was on her way to the gym.

337
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,633
And what did you talk about?

338
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,058
I told her she looked like a runner.

339
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,891
She said that was
the best part about running.

340
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:48,955
And I said...

341
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:52,246
"Do you know this book,
<i>The Memory of Running</i>?"

342
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:55,485
- I don't know it.
- Neither did she, but...

343
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,987
it was just great to stand there and

344
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,989
just talk to her about a book,

345
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:03,979
you know?

346
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,331
I got so excited, I ruined it for her.
I told her the whole story.

347
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,499
- What's the book about?
- It's about redemption,

348
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:15,669
I suppose.

349
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:19,506
And did you make a plan
to see this woman again?

350
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,701
Her name is Wendy.

351
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:24,783
We live on the same block.

352
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:28,747
I'm sure we'll run
into each other again.

353
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:35,294
And you?

354
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,335
Me what?

355
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,902
Do you have a date tonight?

356
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,000
Is that why you're wearing
that dress?

357
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:45,604
- I do.
- I knew it.

358
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:49,870
So who's the lucky guy?

359
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Right.

360
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:55,983
Boundaries

361
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:58,656
until the bitter end.

362
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,254
You're an excellent therapist, Gina.

363
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:05,886
I never would have survived
without you.

364
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,373
Thank you.

365
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,833
Paul, this is the point where,
you know,

366
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:28,329
I'm supposed to say
"My door is always open",

367
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,245
but I'm not going to say that.

368
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:35,347
I understand.

369
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:45,177
So...

370
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:48,658
our time is up.

371
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:50,911
Good luck.
