<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:06,366
US Navy aircraft hit a target
on the outskirts of Baghdad.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,202
Turns out it's a madrasa.

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:09,992
It's an islamic religion school.

5
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:11,795
Boys studying the Koran.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,219
Sixteen of them dead.

7
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:16,042
I flew that mission.

8
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:17,742
"Madrasa murderer."

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,807
Shortly after you complete this mission,

10
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:23,844
you work yourself up
into a state of extreme exertion.

11
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,935
Don't you think
there's a strong desire there

12
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,383
to atone for your actions?

13
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,201
You're going back to a place
where you dropped a bomb.

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,575
Your face is on the internet
and there's a price on your head.

15
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:46,076
Surprised?

16
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:50,450
I didn't think... I didn't think
you'd come back again.

17
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:52,387
I'm back.

18
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,038
Good.

19
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:55,650
Come on in.

20
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,966
Would you like some coffee?
I've just made a pot.

21
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,568
Yeah, coffee's good.

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,139
How do you like it?
I got...

23
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,729
Skim, whole milk.

24
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,937
- Got some soy here...
- Black.

25
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:15,792
I like to taste the beans.

26
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:20,421
I bet you need a lot of coffee
to listen to the fuck-ups in here.

27
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:23,615
I don't drink coffee.
Just tea...

28
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:24,901
I keep it...

29
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,198
I keep it for my patients.

30
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,205
Blood plessure. Irregular heartbeat.

31
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,627
No, I've just...
I've just never really liked the taste.

32
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,439
Ah, a subconscious
irregular heartbeat.

33
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:37,595
What, do you get checkups?
EKG?

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,547
Yep! Every year.

35
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,585
And? How's your heart?

36
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,408
It's perfect.

37
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:46,542
Look, Alex, I'm...

38
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,740
I'm really glad that you came back.

39
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,039
To tell you the truth, I was...

40
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,868
I was a little worried
after you left last week.

41
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,234
'Cause I wanted to go back to Baghdad?

42
00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:59,093
Well, I went.

43
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,415
Man, Paul!

44
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,370
Sorry, but the one thing
I don't compromise on is coffee.

Transcript:
Sync: Benj!

46
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,972
Is that your reaction
whenever the coffee isn't perfect?

47
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:32,928
Isn't perfect?

48
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,835
Paul, this is like attempted murder,
your coffee.

49
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:39,337
But let me hear your interpretation.
It's obvious you have one.

50
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,450
Not really, I...

51
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:44,158
I remember I used
to have this patient, once, and...

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,526
He would come here and before
each session he would say, "Stop."

53
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,467
And then he would pop a pill.

54
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,455
And... it was just...

55
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,536
- a ritual...
- What are you trying to say?

56
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,393
Well, I think in his particular case,

57
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,168
what he wanted to show me
was his distress and his...

58
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:02,989
His pain.

59
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,254
I don't know, maybe with the coffee,
it's...

60
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,141
Maybe you're just telling me that

61
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,639
you're only gonna come
to the therapy under...

62
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:13,850
your conditions, and anything
that you don't like, you're gonna...

63
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,311
spit out right away.

64
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,518
Don't you think you're being
a little traumatic?

65
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,558
- Come on, Paul.
- Maybe.

66
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,393
Why did you come back?

67
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,897
I want your advice
on another little matter.

68
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:36,666
Besides, you deserve to know
how my trip went.

69
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,154
Being that you helped me decide to go.
For all the wrong reasons, by the way,

70
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:42,783
because my visit didn't do
what it was supposed to...

71
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,011
And what was it supposed to do?

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,941
Let's just go to the chase, okay?

73
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,006
Saturday morning,
I'm standing near the bomb strike.

74
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:53,008
Just like in London after the Blitz,
just rubble, you know?

75
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,215
This area had been hit
again and again

76
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,386
by us, by them,
by suicide bombers.

77
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,232
We hooked up with a Red Cross unit.

78
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,599
And they took us
to this makeshift hospital.

79
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,247
It's a triage unit.

80
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:09,558
There weren't enough doctors
to treat everybody.

81
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,104
It was chaos.

82
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,742
What did you do?

83
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,530
I was just watching.

84
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,083
You gotta understand,
in my line of work, I'm 10,

85
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,172
15,000 feet up in the air.

86
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:25,247
Missile locks in on a target,
by radar on a screen.

87
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,569
I don't see people.
I just press a button.

88
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,268
Just it was kind of crazy to be
down there all of a sudden.

89
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:40,766
How did that make you feel?

90
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,525
Coming a face to face with the victims?

91
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,674
How would it make you feel?

92
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,978
Scared?

93
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,748
- Guilty.
- See that would be the normal reaction.

94
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,767
I knew this should have been
the drama of my life, but I felt...

95
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,288
nothing!

96
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,880
And then I realized...

97
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,921
the system did a great job on me.

98
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,092
What do you mean, "the system"?

99
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,190
Listen, there's people down there.

100
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,091
Arms and legs missing,

101
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,340
faces blown off...
It's carnage.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,954
And the parents are walking around,
they're waiting to see

103
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,359
if their children are gonna live or die
all because of what I did.

104
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,410
But what can I tell you?
To me they look like...

105
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,126
200 people standing
in line at a pharmacy.

106
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:36,571
Did you feel any connection with them?

107
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,442
Did you feel in any way...

108
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,088
responsible for what they'd suffered.

109
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:45,582
In that moment, all I cared about was
whether they cheated me or not.

110
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,330
I mean, the system.
The people on the madrasa...

111
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,431
It wasn't any difference
than seeing it on TV.

112
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:54,045
The only thing in my mind
in that moment was whether

113
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,682
the system knew that the buildings
near the target's bunker,

114
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:59,096
the one that was supposed
to get my one ton bomb...

115
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:01,903
If they knew these buildings
were full of children...

116
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,849
Or not, as they claim.

117
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,384
- Nothing else mattered.
- So it was really important for you

118
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,902
to know that
you had done the right thing.

119
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:14,450
Like you said last week,
if you hit the target, you sleep well.

120
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,243
And all those people whose...

121
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:23,483
suffering you were responsible for...

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,342
Could you not see them?

123
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,376
No, I saw them.

124
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,486
I felt norhing for them.

125
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:36,521
And then I realized
how ingenious that my body

126
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,972
has a built-in separation mechanism.

127
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:42,016
- What does that mean separation?
- Compartmentalization.

128
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:46,152
I'm standing there and all I cared about
was whether I made a precise hit.

129
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,571
The enemy is a formula...

130
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,520
Size of building,
amount of people, multiplied by

131
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,044
the amount of explosive divided by 100
equals a number of estimated casualties.

132
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:59,529
You understand? I'm standing there
and I don't feel anything.

133
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,981
I had this friend who died.

134
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:14,460
Four months ago.

135
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:17,380
Anyway, I...

136
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,136
I went to the funeral, and...

137
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:25,473
All throughout the service I kept saying
to myself, "Why don't I feel sad?"

138
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,930
I though to myself:
"Maybe I didn't love him,

139
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,366
"Maybe I didn't care."

140
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,322
I tormented myself for about a week.

141
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,471
Anyway, finally...

142
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,665
I realized that actually I felt

143
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,346
a great deal.

144
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,784
Even the fact that
I was so busy with my

145
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:46,425
guilty feelings...

146
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:50,723
Even that attests to how much
I felt about him.

147
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,903
Yeah, but what are you saying?
That I was feeling...

148
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,972
- But I didn't feel what I was felling?
- I think...

149
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,523
that you have very, very...

150
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,255
deep feeling about these people.

151
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,810
But something strong inside you

152
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:09,922
prevents you
from acknowledging those feelings.

153
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,183
Not just to me or to anybody else.

154
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,817
- But to yourself.
- I don't understand what you're saying.

155
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,586
I don't get what you're telling me.

156
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,269
Feelings are not a philosophy.

157
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:23,923
You either feel or you don't.
You can't bullshit about it.

158
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:26,916
- You think I'm bullshitting?
- Listen, I'm paying you

159
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,011
150 bucks for less than an hour
and I don't see you making an effort.

160
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,561
You're supposed to be smarter than me
and I'm not feeling that.

161
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,645
So we're competing?

162
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,758
To see who's is the...

163
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,877
Who's the smartest.

164
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,895
You know, Alex,
I think that

165
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,808
here like everywhere else,

166
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:46,827
like with thee coffe for instance,

167
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,930
you're concerned with what's the best.

168
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,024
It must be...
It must be difficult.

169
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,477
Come on, give me a break.

170
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:00,607
It must be kind of frightening
for you to feel...

171
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,162
empathy with these people.

172
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,446
So you create this kind of ultimate

173
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:09,709
reality for yourself
with those people where,

174
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,492
"Oh no, they were just waiting
in line at the pharmacy.

175
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,493
"I'm just the accidental tourist.

176
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:19,003
"Not the pilot who bombed them.
Who killed their family."

177
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,697
I wish you were right.

178
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,593
But it's much more fundamental.

179
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:33,081
If you hold on to this organ...

180
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,489
called guilt feelings...

181
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,036
And I believe that's what it is.
It's an organ.

182
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,824
Like the spleen or liver.

183
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:44,461
The system will cul it out of you
completely.

184
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,101
Understand? I have no way
of feelling guilt anymore.

185
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:52,846
I don't have the organ.

186
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:55,822
So you really believe
it's possible to...

187
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,559
amputate such an organ?

188
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:04,358
You went back to Iraq.

189
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,035
Why was it so important
for you to go back?

190
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,361
To risk your life just to...

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,844
Just to be there.

192
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:15,426
I told you I wanted to check
if anything was left.

193
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,178
And...

194
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,311
And I wanted to see what happens
when I come down from that top view.

195
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:24,738
But nothing happened?

196
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,152
That's right, nothing.

197
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,456
Can we...

198
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:34,364
Can we go back for a moment
to the site of the bombing?

199
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:38,250
Can you describe one moment
when you said to yourself,

200
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:41,630
"I should be feeling something now,
right now.

201
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,405
"And I don't."

202
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:57,553
There was a moment. I don't know
if it's what you're looking for.

203
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:01,933
But there was a moment
when this old man came over to me...

204
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,123
He had been burned.

205
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:05,944
His arm was bandaged.

206
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,621
He kept looking at me
with a strange little smile.

207
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,429
Which means "I know you."

208
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,222
"I know you."

209
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,556
I ignored him at first,
but a few minutes later he was back.

210
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,031
"I know you, I know you,"
he kept saying.

211
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,524
For a second I thought he recognized me,
but I didn't really believe that.

212
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,977
I doubt he'd ever seen
the internet but...

213
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,798
In some deep intuitive way...

214
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:41,714
He knew.

215
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:45,223
He knew I was the man
who dropped the bomb

216
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,965
that destroyed the whole street
we were standing on.

217
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,165
You could be...

218
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,282
You could be describing
a mystical experience,

219
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,245
like a dream.

220
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:06,609
Yeah, it was like a dream,
like a totally bizarre dream.

221
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,015
He started looking like some old warlock
out of a fairy tale or something.

222
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,516
He wouldn't leave me alone.
He kept pointing at me.

223
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,492
I know you.

224
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:17,834
And I looked in his eyes.

225
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:23,020
And he was sort of amused,
kind of friendly.

226
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:26,060
Like my father looks at me when
he thinks I've done something wrong.

227
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,100
Like he knows my secrets. Like no matter
what I do, I can't hide from it.

228
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,950
And I was frozen there.

229
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,360
And by that time people had gathered
and they were watching us.

230
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,247
Finally someone from the church
group came and pulled me away,

231
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,140
but that old man,
he never took his eyes off me.

232
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:53,389
You still think it's too early
to talk about your father?

233
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,967
Why, because he popped
into my head for a second?

234
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,559
You people.
What is it with you people?

235
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,319
I give you a little crumb
and you lunge at it.

236
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:10,701
I'm just asking myself, alex,
what was it about that old man that

237
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:14,424
- makes you think about your father?
- Let me tell you something:

238
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,854
If there's someone who does
not know the meaning of guilt,

239
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,075
it's my father.

240
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:19,422
You know why?

241
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,242
Because if he could feel,

242
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,946
he wouldn't have survived.

243
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,486
You know,
my father killed his father

244
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,169
with his bare hands.

245
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,549
Yeah.
And that's a fact.

246
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:36,771
Man, i'd love to see him on this couch.

247
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,263
Man, doc, you'd have
a field day with him.

248
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,092
You want to talk about it?

249
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:46,783
Oh, now I got your attention.

250
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:53,982
I don't think I can tell it
as well as he does. But i'll try.

251
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:57,390
Mid-'50s, right?
Jim Crow Oklahoma.

252
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:03,385
My old man had pissed off the local
good ol'boys by trying to organize

253
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:05,927
some black labor at this factory.

254
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,711
They tried to threaten him
but my dad didn't back down.

255
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,399
He's a tough son of a bitch,
i'll give him that.

256
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:13,955
Anyway, the whole thing,
it just escalated.

257
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,631
And...

258
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,397
this mob with hoods
attacked his house.

259
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,221
My uncle Ronnie was
on the front porch with a rifle.

260
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,616
They shot him down.
Shot my aunt Jeannie too.

261
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,500
And then they came inside.

262
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,458
My father takes the rest of the family,
they run downstairs

263
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,683
to the boiler room,
to the basement.

264
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:35,214
Right near the boiler, they all crammed
into this area, this hidden room.

265
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,176
My grandfather, his father,

266
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,730
was very sick.

267
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,613
Dying of lung cancer.
And he had this...

268
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,661
Apparently he had this...

269
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,524
This wheezing
and this hacking cough.

270
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,218
So my father puts his hand

271
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,868
over his father's mouth and nose
and he kept it there

272
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,794
while they searched the basement,

273
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,100
kept it clamped tight.

274
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,549
Then when they finally cleared out,

275
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,282
my grandfather was dead.

276
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,677
He'd suffocated.

277
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:09,741
There it is.

278
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:11,347
That's...

279
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,704
That's a horrific story.

280
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:15,996
Tells it every year
on my grandfather's birthday.

281
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,367
It's a tradition.

282
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:20,496
And you really believe
he doesn't feel guilty about it?

283
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,054
I'm telling you,

284
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:25,580
he always used to say,
"leave the guilt for the white man.

285
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,040
"We can't afford it."

286
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,249
It's possible that he's saying that...

287
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:36,014
it's dangerous to feel guilty,

288
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:37,805
that it's a kind of weakness.

289
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:40,466
Maybe that's a message that...

290
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,316
you've grown up with.

291
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,795
What can I say?
That's just my father's way.

292
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,983
- But is it your way?
- I don't know.

293
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,713
Hey, it works for him.

294
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,798
Doesn't necessarily make him an asshole.
People love my father.

295
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,451
My wife is crazy about him.

296
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,024
You should see him at...

297
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,809
At family dinners.
He's got her off in a corner and...

298
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:02,811
telling jokes and... I don't know.
She appreciates him.

299
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,914
Maybe that's why we lasted
as long as we did.

300
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:09,834
You say "lasted"
as if it was past tense.

301
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:16,004
Yeah, actually, that's why
I came to see you today.

302
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,063
There's this issue with my wife.

303
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:22,756
What happened was,
when I came home from my trip,

304
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:24,595
it was late,

305
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,792
and the kids were already asleep.

306
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:31,756
And I saw my wife.

307
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:35,737
- What do you mean, you saw your wife?
- I looked at her.

308
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:38,739
I really looked at her.

309
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,466
She was sleeping
in front of the television.

310
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,049
For an hour,
an hour and a half nonstop

311
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,989
I sat there
without taking my eyes off her.

312
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:55,129
When was the last time you watched
your wife sleep for an hour straight?

313
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:59,055
Well, I usually fall asleep
before she does.

314
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:01,871
Well, try it once,
you'll be surprised.

315
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,347
What'll surprise me?

316
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,092
What you'll discover...

317
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:09,157
About her,

318
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,378
about yourself.

319
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:15,678
I was looking at her,

320
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,593
looking at every inch of her body.

321
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:21,608
And I said to myself...

322
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,662
"Who the hell is this woman,

323
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,465
"sleeping on the sofa
in front of the tv?

324
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,299
"What the hell does she know about me?

325
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,440
"What does she think
she knows about me?

326
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,735
"And what the hell am I doing,

327
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,849
"living with her

328
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,473
"in the same living room,
in the same house

329
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,093
"with the same kids
for the past 15 years?"

330
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,739
Understand?

331
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,134
And i'm sitting there
opposite her, right?

332
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,407
She doesn't imagine
what's going through my head.

333
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,051
And you know what happened?

334
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:04,991
She starts grinding her teeth.

335
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:09,549
Now it's the first time i ever saw
her grind her teeth in her sleep.

336
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:11,357
And I'm talking something sick,

337
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:12,930
frightening.

338
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,901
The sound that came out of her mouth...
How do you...

339
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,305
You could cut diamonds
between her teeth, okay?

340
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,434
It really fucked me up.

341
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:24,344
- Sounds pretty upsetting.
- Shocking, I tell you.

342
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,787
And suddenly I understood.
For the past 15 years

343
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,773
this woman's been so busy
pretending that everything's okay

344
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:33,864
flowing.
She's a model mother, a model wife,

345
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:37,047
an outstanding lecturer
at a communications college.

346
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,051
Very impressive in front of
my fellow pilots. And it turns out

347
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:43,188
she takes it all out
on her teeth at night.

348
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:46,485
You know,
that's pretty common, actually.

349
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,528
They don't think
it has anything to do with stress.

350
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:55,503
It has to do with flaws
in the structure of the jaw.

351
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,123
You really believe that?

352
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,761
No, it's connected to her stress.

353
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,184
In what way?

354
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:02,381
In what...

355
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:07,668
She is a totally repressed person.

356
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,552
And all her repressions
come out at night,

357
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,927
in her sleep.

358
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,151
So she grinds her teeth.

359
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:19,264
You think Michaela may have trouble
with her feelings too?

360
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,010
You think I don't feel?
Wait till you meet her.

361
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,147
Everything is just like clockwork.

362
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,799
Clockwork, that's what...
It's clockwork.

363
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,940
The kids have been going to bed
at the same hour

364
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,664
since they were two days old.

365
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,749
They got sick on a fixed date.

366
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,952
We'd have sex

367
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,135
on a fixed date In a fixed position.
And Michaela even farts

368
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,966
once a year on a fixed date.

369
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,459
Once a year

370
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:48,179
on the night after Easter Sunday
she farts. She lets herself fart once,

371
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,767
maybe twice, a little one,
not that much. Then it's over.

372
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:53,813
No farting for the rest of the year.

373
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,217
Man, she's a programmed person.

374
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,126
Every emotion is under control.

375
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,245
Sounds like
you're a little angry with her.

376
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,329
- What... Why...
- Just the way you talk about her.

377
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,175
No. Takes a lot more than michaela's
schedule to make me angry.

378
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,133
I got the impression before
when you were speaking that...

379
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,090
Maybe you're a little angry
with yourself, Alex.

380
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:24,147
I mean, you went all the way to Iraq
and you couldn't feel anything.

381
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:25,713
I don't know.

382
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Maybe.

383
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,710
Have you spoken to Michaela about it?

384
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,981
Of course.
Over our morning coffee.

385
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,902
She says, "Yes, honey.
I grind my teeth.

386
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,378
"You only noticed it now?
You are such a sweetheart.

387
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,843
"That's what I'd call love."

388
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,694
Then she said,
"Baby, please cut down on your coffee.

389
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,301
"Remember what the doctor said?"

390
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,371
Since my heart attack she lets me
have one cup of coffee a day.

391
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,130
And that battery acid you gave me,
that's not coffee.

392
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,795
- That doesn't count.
- Okay.

393
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:00,332
So you don't like Michaela
worrying about you,

394
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,413
treating you like you're sick?

395
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:07,243
It's just...
It's like she's on a mission.

396
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,542
To get me back up in the air asap.
She says i'm fit as a fiddle

397
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,881
and I need to be knocking
on the navy's door to get back.

398
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,692
How long has it been since you've flown?

399
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:17,386
- Two months since my heart attack.
- It must be hard

400
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:19,307
to be away from that world,

401
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:22,191
Not to be part of what used to be the...

402
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,087
The center of your life.

403
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:27,951
First of all, i'm still one of them.
So you can relax on that.

404
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:31,404
But mean while, sitting at home thinking
about the possibility that you...

405
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:34,701
- That you might never fly again.
- Of course i'll fly again.

406
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,828
People with worse injuries
have bounced back.

407
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,791
Do you want to go back, Alex?

408
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,265
When the time is right.

409
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:44,302
But Michaela's dying for me to go back.

410
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,952
And at night she grinds her teeth
like some kind of...

411
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:50,423
Alex, it's not like
she changed overnight.

412
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,143
What are you saying?

413
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,893
I think there are things about michael
that really bother you.

414
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:58,194
Because they reflect something

415
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:00,635
inside you
that you can't live with.

416
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,226
Like what?

417
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,693
Like her passion for you to fly again.

418
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:09,125
I'm not 100% convinced
that you actually want to go back.

419
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,137
Maybe because...

420
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:17,203
you're having trouble
forgiving yourself.

421
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,279
Okay, all of this just reinforces
my decision to leave home.

422
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:25,589
What?

423
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:29,701
Why?

424
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,399
Yeah, I don't think...

425
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,361
It's pointless
to drag this out for years.

426
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,547
When a person decides
he's not in love with his spouse

427
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:41,106
he shouldn't have to put off
leaving home. Isn't that so?

428
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:42,980
It's over. it's dead.

429
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,159
I've had friends
who've reached this conclusion.

430
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:47,817
They go to 3 years of couples therapy
and they end up separating.

431
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,460
So what's the use?
I say cut that shit.

432
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:52,347
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

433
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,901
I mean,
it is possible to overcome a crisis.

434
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,223
Do you know what I realized?

435
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:00,894
That I was never in love with her.

436
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:02,932
With Michaela.

437
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:08,280
Do you know what that means?
What a terrible realization that is?

438
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,088
What do you expect me to do?

439
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,670
Find a lover like my dad?

440
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:20,755
Start coming home late at night?
I don't even have a good excuse anymore.

441
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,961
I won't do anything
but sit on my ass and watch tv.

442
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:26,264
So what?

443
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,912
You look upset.

444
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,865
No, i'm just...

445
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:38,297
- I'm just a little concerned.
- Well, don't be.

446
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:41,707
- I feel a great relief.
- No, i'm sure.

447
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,883
There must be tremendous relief
in just...

448
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:46,530
walking away.

449
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,212
- I'm not convinced it's the solution.
- Why not?

450
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,832
I suppose because i ask myself:

451
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:57,774
"Who are you really leaving?"

452
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,025
Maybe you're leaving her because she's
such a frightening reflection of you.

453
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,212
Maybe you're leaving yourself,

454
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,890
not your wife.

455
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:08,523
It's irrelevant.

456
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,133
I have no reason to go back.
We're finished. We're done.

457
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:17,572
Have you said anything
to her about it?

458
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:19,619
Not yet.

459
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:22,159
I thought i'd consult with you first.

460
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,502
Is this really a consultation?

461
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,006
Because you know something?

462
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,044
Again, I feel like I'm a rubber stamp
for decision that you've already made.

463
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:35,544
On the contrary, this meeting
clinched the matter, not before.

464
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,000
You can take credit for it.

465
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:39,551
Why are you always giving me credit?

466
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,666
You know,
it's not that you give me credit.

467
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,840
What you're really doing
is you're asking me

468
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,028
to accept responsibility
for your big decisions.

469
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,743
And you know what?

470
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,471
It's not me making these decisions,
it's you.

471
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,568
You knew
before you walked through that door

472
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,663
that you were gonna go back to iraq.

473
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:03,784
You knew before you ever brought up
the subject of Michaela's teeth grinding

474
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,191
that your marriage
was deeply in trouble.

475
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:10,027
These aren't conclusions
that you've come to here on this couch

476
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,438
in the last week with my permission.

477
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:21,651
Aren't these things that have been

478
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:26,520
boiling over inside you
for a very very long time, alex?

479
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,234
I got to go.

480
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,502
Like you say, my time is up.

481
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,932
Hey, don't worry.

482
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,737
I'll keep you posted.
