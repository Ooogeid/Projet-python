1
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,938
Is... is something wrong?
We've been kicked out of our apartment.

2
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,307
We couldn't afford the mortgage

3
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,582
and we didn't know where else to go.

4
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,345
We were just joking.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm going on vacation.

6
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,893
VO: michvanilly, salomon

7
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:00,349
Oliver Week 4

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,729
So is luke on the way?

9
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,393
He's running late, of course.

10
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:08,143
But he will be here to pick up Oliver
by the end of the session.

11
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,254
Can I {\I wanted to see if I could }speak
to you alone for a minute?

12
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,684
- I have to leave a little early.
- Sure.

13
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:16,018
Oliver, if you get hungry,
I have some snacks in my purse, okay?

14
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,562
I'm not hungry.

15
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:20,992
I'll just be a little bit.
Will you be all right?

16
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,544
I'll do my homework.

17
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,924
I just wanted to thank you.

18
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,861
Thank me?
For what?

19
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,748
For everything.

20
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,992
Right after our session last week luke
and I took oliver out to dinner

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,716
and we explained everything about
the adoption just like you asked us to.

22
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,139
And immediately the clouds lifted.

23
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,142
Good.

24
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:57,604
So you've noticed a positive change
in Oliver's attitude?

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,995
This week he's gotten all
of his homework done even before dinner.

26
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,076
He made a terrarium for his turtle

27
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,227
out of an old pasta box.

28
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:09,962
Plus he stopped gorging
himself on food.

29
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,339
And he already looks better.

30
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,190
And it's all thanks to you.

31
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,019
Thank you, Bess.

32
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:19,851
I appreciate the compliment, but...

33
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:23,408
I'm really not so sure
it's anything I did.

34
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,517
He's even sleeping
through the night now.

35
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:28,628
You have no idea what a relief it is
to know that I can finally leave town

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,276
and not freak out that something
disastrous is gonna happen.

37
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,695
My friend michelle,
she's gonna be here

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,252
at a quarter past in a rental car.

39
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,409
You seem eager to leave.

40
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,453
We want to get a jump on traffic{\, you know}.

41
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:45,364
Michelle and I haven't done
a trip like this since college.

42
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:46,539
And...

43
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:50,586
I don't even care where we go. I just
want to get in the car and just drive.

44
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,771
I know the feeling.

45
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:56,654
And the only reason I can even
consider leaving town right now

46
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,302
is because oliver is doing so well.

47
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,402
So thank you again. I really
appreciate everything you've done.

48
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,699
I don't mean to concern you, bess,

49
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,787
but I'm not so sure
that Oliver's changed as much as

50
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,397
you would like to believe.

51
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:13,188
What do you mean?

52
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,088
It strikes me as unusual that...

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,871
his issues, his problems
have just cleared up overnight.

54
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,661
Yeah, it's more than unusual.

55
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,880
It's like a magitrick.

56
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,750
Yeah, it is a lot
like a magic trick,

57
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,242
by which I would mean that...

58
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,728
there's a very good chance
that this is an illusion.

59
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:40,000
But you haven't even
talked to him yet.

60
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,129
Most people can't break
their patterns in one week, bess.

61
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,518
So you're saying
that I can't leave him?

62
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,462
No, I'm only saying it's possible
that he started behaving well because

63
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,909
he doesn't want you to see him
as the source of your troubles.

64
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,296
The source of my troubles?

65
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,699
If anything,
he's been the saving grace.

66
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:05,552
Maybe Oliver believes that
if he behaves perfectly that...

67
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,444
he can solve all the problems
between you and Luke.

68
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:15,033
I really don't know what
you're trying to do to me here.

69
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,263
How am I confusing you?

70
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:21,165
For a month now you've been
telling me that I'm stuck

71
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,099
and that I need to get
my own life together

72
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:25,014
and let my son grow up into a man.

73
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,684
And then the first chance I have
to go have some fun on my own,

74
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,703
you say,
"he's just pretending to do well

75
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,938
and he actually
needs you very badly, bess."

76
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,626
But I'm not saying you need
to stay here and take care...

77
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:40,755
I haven't taken a vacation
without Luke and Oliver in six years.

78
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:45,242
And I think I more than deserve to take
a little time for myself right now.

79
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,244
Okay, why right now?

80
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,858
What, besides the fact
that my ex-husband has a new girlfriend?

81
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,211
I saw how hard
that was for you to hear.

82
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:02,120
No, I'm actually glad
that Luke is sleeping around now,

83
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,171
because now it is
very clear that we are done.

84
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:08,682
He's even started
interviewing replacements.

85
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,560
But last week you were
very angry about that.

86
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:15,038
It was a bucket
of cold water in my face.

87
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:17,714
I've got to get my life together.

88
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,394
Oliver's gonna be staying
at Luke's more often now

89
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,523
and when he's gone I can't just pace
around the apartment like a ghost.

90
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,702
I know what you mean.

91
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,460
I've never lived by myself before.

92
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,254
You can't imagine what that's like.

93
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,177
I think I can.

94
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:46,022
Why don't you tell me
how you and Luke got together?

95
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:56,215
I got pregnant
my last semester in college.

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,205
I moved right out of the dorm
and right in with luke.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,210
It certainly wasn't
what I had in mind.

98
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:06,606
I have a feeling that nothing
that's happened in the past 12 years

99
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,118
has been what you've had in mind.

100
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,881
Luke and I had just gotten
back from spring break.

101
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:23,786
I remember his dorm room
smelled awful because

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,323
his roommate had left a pizza
on the counter before vacation.

103
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:32,365
I told him I was pregnant and

104
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,398
he dropped to his knees right on
the shag rug and asked me to marry him.

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,272
I remember thinking,

106
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,318
"this is probably the most important
moment of my life

107
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,936
and the room
smells like moldy pizza."

108
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,573
So did you

109
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,975
want to marry him?

110
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,644
I was crazy about luke.

111
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,171
And I was sure I would never
stop being crazy about luke.

112
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,913
I was 21.

113
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,660
That's very young
to make a big decision.

114
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,356
My parents were furious at luke.

115
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,435
We drove to hartford
and we took them out

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,848
to the best restaurant we could afford,
which was ruby tuesday's.

117
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:15,225
Really classy, right?

118
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:20,906
My mom was so upset.
She nearly

119
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,344
choked on her fried shrimp.

120
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,700
But then oliver was born and,

121
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,659
- you know...
- What?

122
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:38,912
It's amazing.

123
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:43,170
The moment they saw Oliver,
it's like their daughter disappeared.

124
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,465
I just became
the mother of their grandchild.

125
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,828
But that's how I felt about him too.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,228
The first night I brought him home

127
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:58,410
I sat by his cradle and I watched him
sleeping and I thought,

128
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:01,212
"this is the best thing
I'm ever gonna do."

129
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,495
You haven't said anything
about how luke felt.

130
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:11,664
That's a good question.

131
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,273
You're not sure?

132
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:16,411
To be honest, for a few years there

133
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,296
we didn't see that much
of each other.

134
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,623
He was just getting
a toehold at work.

135
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:23,263
I was so busy with oliver.
It was like we were just

136
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:27,297
working opposite shifts
in some struggling startup business,

137
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,083
But I gotta hand it to luke,

138
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,328
as soon as Oliver
was ready for kindergarten

139
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:37,404
we were doing well enough
for me to start my master's.

140
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:42,429
I could tell you about the next
five years, but what's the point?

141
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:46,615
I just couldn't concentrate.

142
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,022
My kid was sick
or he couldn't sleep or

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,450
there was a bully
at the nursery school.

144
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,278
Did you feel that oliver was

145
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,417
- a burden?
- No.

146
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,136
No, of course I didn't think
he was a burden.

147
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:05,360
That's not what I'm trying to say.
It's...

148
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,821
school just didn't seem real to me.

149
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:11,508
It was just making criticism
about criticisms

150
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,304
and making these meaningless
distinctions and

151
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,481
looking at art and pretending to see
things that probably aren't even there.

152
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,506
And then I looked at my son and...

153
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,230
are you saying that Oliver is the reason
that you didn't finish college?

154
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,693
I'm not blaming him.

155
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:31,711
I'm not.
It was my decision to put him first.

156
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,169
But, you know,
I look up now and I'm 33 years old

157
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,936
and I've never had a job in my life.

158
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,598
And I'm terrified.

159
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,858
What are you terrified of?

160
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:47,753
Uh, my son is getting older.

161
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,363
My husband isn't my husband anymore.

162
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,747
I'm just overeducated enough

163
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:58,491
to be completely unemployable
at any sort of meaningful job.

164
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,136
You can contradict me
here at any time.

165
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,485
Bess, you could also look
at this as an enormous opportunity

166
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,397
to reconnect with the person
who disappeared 12 years ago

167
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,108
and to take a leap into the unknown.

168
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,101
I don't understand you at all.

169
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:19,548
I spend too much time
with Oliver and I'm

170
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:21,950
and I'm overprotecting him,
I'm smothering him.

171
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:25,286
And I try to get away for a little
while and I'm abandoning him.

172
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,390
So either I'm taking too much care
of him or too little care of him.

173
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,593
Seems like this is an argument
that you're having with yourself.

174
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:37,292
Truth is...

175
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,803
I don't know what to do.

176
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,649
I don't know what to do.

177
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,245
Michelle is probably
waiting for me right now.

178
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,070
She's been in the rent...
There she is.

179
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,694
I can't talk about this anymore.
I'm on vacation.

180
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,664
Oliver will be fine, right?

181
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:08,646
He's 12 years old.
It's a week.

182
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,945
Are you asking for my permission?

183
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,831
No, I'm not...

184
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,484
I'm a grownup, okay?
I was asking for your advice.

185
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,759
Isn't that your job?

186
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:25,055
Oliver sweetie, you wanna
come in and say goodbye?

187
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,315
Are you leaving now?

188
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,654
Yes, Michelle's waiting for me.

189
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:34,010
Your dad will be here to pick you up.
I {\just }wanna make sure you're okay with that.

190
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,235
I feel fine.

191
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,970
You're not just saying that, right?

192
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,870
It's the truth.
You don't have to worry about me.

193
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,295
I will be calling you every day.

194
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,385
And if you have any problem
or you just wanna talk,

195
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,209
you can even wake me up in the middle
of the night. I don't care, okay?

196
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:03,722
Thanks again for everything, Paul.
And I'm sorry to run out on you.

197
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:05,235
No problem.

198
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,845
Okay, go ahead.

199
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,445
- Bye.
- Bye.

200
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,935
Hey, Michelle.

201
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,757
Well, your mom told me it's a long time
since she's been away on a trip.

202
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:41,968
- I'll be fine.
- So you got things under control, yeah?

203
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,915
- I'm good.
- So, how has...

204
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,183
How has the week been for you?

205
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,015
I did all my homework.

206
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Good.

207
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,625
And how's the turtle?

208
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,551
I made a new house for him
out of an old pasta box.

209
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,676
Cool.

210
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,446
I put in grass and leaves
from the park.

211
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,825
So you've made a nice home for him.
That's great.

212
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,335
Are you...

213
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:13,255
Are you sure you're not worried
about your mom going away?

214
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,398
Last week you were telling me that

215
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,682
you were having trouble
going to sleep

216
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:28,811
and that when your mom and dad came in
to check on you that you were kind of...

217
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,102
- pretending to be asleep.
- I'm sleeping fine.

218
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,570
Good.

219
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,066
So you're not tired in class or...

220
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,068
I just said
I'm getting enough sleep.

221
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,034
And how are things
going at your dad's?

222
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,953
Why don't you ask him
when he gets here?

223
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:55,735
And how's school?

224
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:06,901
A couple of weeks ago, you told me
this story about a party.

225
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:10,320
And then there was a boy
who did something mean to you.

226
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,684
Eric. He pissed on my shoes.

227
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,885
You haven't {\really }said anything about him.
Has he been bothering you?

228
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:19,575
How?

229
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,545
Ruining my life.

230
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,510
There's this girl Maya.

231
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:27,235
Yeah, she was the girl
who had the party.

232
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:30,250
We have Humanities together.

233
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,039
And we were partners
for this colonial life project.

234
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,650
I don't know what that is.

235
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,686
Well, we dress up like
we were in colonial times

236
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,911
and have old colonial jobs.

237
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:42,955
I was a blacksmith

238
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,865
and Maya was my wife

239
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,801
and she milked the cows.

240
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,455
But it was stupid.

241
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,245
But she's nice.

242
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,142
She brings candy to school every day
and always gives me some.

243
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,015
I wish I had a friend like that.

244
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,940
But last week,

245
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,875
Eric went all over school
saying I'm in love with her,

246
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:05,904
but she'll never go out with me
because I'm too fat.

247
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,035
It's not fair.

248
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,335
You're right.

249
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,080
It isn't fair.

250
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,707
I'm not gonna be fat anymore.

251
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,365
What do you mean?

252
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,687
I stopped eating this week.

253
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,020
You're not eating anything at all?

254
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:26,145
Well, no.

255
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,450
I have a half a bowl
of cereal for breakfast.

256
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,225
I buy lunch at school,
but I throw it out.

257
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,730
I only eat a little
when I'm with my mom.

258
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,100
And I don't eat at all
when I'm with my dad.

259
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,825
But he doesn't notice.

260
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,415
Doesn't that make you feel weak?

261
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,484
I mean, if you don't eat anything,

262
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,702
how do you have energy
to make it through the day?

263
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:56,675
You know,

264
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,845
if you really want to lose weight,

265
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,752
you don't have to do it by yourself.

266
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,110
And you certainly do not need

267
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:08,008
to stop eating altogether.

268
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,760
You need somebody
to help you with this.

269
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,095
I don't need any help.

270
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,015
- Aren't you hungry?
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

271
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:35,891
I remember last week
you were telling me

272
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,516
that your mom and dad
were planning to adopt a baby boy.

273
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,174
But you said that
they'd stopped talking about it.

274
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,128
They explained that to me.

275
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,896
And what did they say?

276
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:50,030
Well, they were fighting
too much about the baby,

277
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,052
so they had to give him
to someone else.

278
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,262
And how did you feel about that?

279
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,638
Is there anything about the adoption

280
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,015
that you still don't understand?

281
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,775
I thought they were gonna tell me
I was adopted too.

282
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,987
Why would you think that?

283
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,315
'cause I don't look like them.

284
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,070
And that's another thing Eric said.

285
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,640
"Your mom's so skinny and pretty,
you must be adopted."

286
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:21,290
You know, I have to say, that kid Eric,
I really cannot stand him.

287
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,415
But he's right.

288
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,833
I don't look like my mom or my dad.

289
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,865
I might be adopted.

290
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:30,825
Would that be...

291
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,015
a good thing or a bad thing?

292
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,620
My parents were fighting
about my brother,

293
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,945
so they just gave him away.

294
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,075
So do you think that

295
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:45,405
if you don't behave the way
they want you to, that...

296
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:48,925
they might give you away?

297
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,490
Your mom and dad,
they might get upset sometimes

298
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,658
no matter how well you behave.

299
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,130
But I make things worse.

300
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:02,230
Sometimes it's the people
that we love the most who...

301
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:04,905
upset us the most.
Does that make sense?

302
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,705
I wish I was adopted.

303
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:18,825
You know,

304
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,525
I used to feel like that myself,

305
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,565
when I was a kid.

306
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,437
You did?

307
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:26,995
Absolutely.

308
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,635
I want them to give me away.

309
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,380
- Why would you want that?
- 'cause they fight all the time,

310
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:43,820
no matter what I do.

311
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,650
And now they're separated,
but they're still fighting.

312
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,835
And they're probably not gonna stop.

313
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:55,705
So,

314
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,275
if they did...

315
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:02,645
give you away, as you said,

316
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,325
where do you think you'd go?

317
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,740
Well, they said when they gave
my brother back,

318
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,865
there was a lot of people
who wanted him.

319
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:14,067
Maybe I could go
somewhere like that,

320
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,136
with parents who'll want me.

321
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:20,175
Do you really feel
that your mom and dad

322
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,405
don't want you?

323
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,885
My dad should be here by now.

324
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,926
I guess he's running a little late.
You want me to call him for you?

325
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,485
No, I can do it.

326
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:42,315
It's probably gonna go
to his voicemail.

327
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,425
Hey, dad.
It's me, Oliver.

328
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:57,465
I'm with Paul,

329
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:58,822
waiting for you.

330
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:00,675
Bye.

331
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,954
I can leave now if you want.

332
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:10,400
You know, actually, my next appointment
was just cancelled.

333
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,626
So you can...

334
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:15,239
- You can hang out here if you want.
- Should I go in the other room?

335
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,464
You don't have to.

336
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,717
I mean, you can stay here
if you'd like.

337
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,435
What are we gonna do?

338
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:22,929
We could talk.

339
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,855
We could play a game.

340
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:29,105
You could teach me
how to play blackjack finally.

341
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,315
I'm starving.

342
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,367
Would you like me
to make you a sandwich?

343
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,035
The kitchen is over here.

344
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,895
So...

345
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:15,435
Ham? Cheese?

346
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:19,485
Could I have a ham
and swiss cheese with mustard?

347
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,705
I think I can do that.

348
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,821
I've just got this brown bread.

349
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,998
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's fine.

350
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,004
Where does that door go?

351
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:40,506
That's where I sleep.

352
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,135
And what about that one?

353
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,705
That's just...

354
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,270
That's just another entrance.

355
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,545
- How many slices do you want?
- Just one of each.

356
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,770
One of each.

357
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:02,705
Thanks.

358
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:13,748
Did your son draw that picture?

359
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,855
Yes, he did.

360
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,219
Is that the house where he lives?

361
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,955
How is it?

362
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:39,785
It's good.

363
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,695
Are you still hungry?
