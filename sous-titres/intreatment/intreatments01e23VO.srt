00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:05,497
Charmed, I'm sure.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,044
So yesterday, I marched into the gym
and I got up on the beam.

4
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,944
When I looked back at my feet,
they were right on the beam.

5
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,473
Sophie, look at me.

6
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,552
What goes on in there?

7
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:19,064
The new guy with the Tequila.

8
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:20,472
We had sex and...

9
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:24,436
Afterwards he said that I fucked like
someone who's been sexually abused.

10
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:29,514
Prick!

11
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,758
I'm trying to kill myself.

12
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,670
Oh, god.

13
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:01,892
Do you know what
that lipstick color reminds me of?

14
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,388
Dog shit.

15
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,045
That's right, Sophie.
Keep it up.

16
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,606
That's right, Olivia.
Keep feeling sorry for yourself.

17
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:20,240
Do we have to wait until exactly 4:00?

18
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:23,005
If you and your surgical enhancements
step into that room,

19
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:25,287
I'm never coming back here... Ever.

20
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:27,159
He asked me to come.

21
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,711
You promised you wouldn't go back
to the gym unless he said it was okay.

22
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,549
You make it seem like I'm going
to contaminate the place or something.

23
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,304
- I'm sure you will.
- Oh, Sophie, back off.

24
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:43,409
Why couldn't you just call him?
They have this thing called a telephone.

25
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,924
If I would've called him
and he said you shouldn't train,

26
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:48,207
you would've said I was lying.

27
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:52,357
I just want to be in the room
with you when he answers us.

28
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:55,485
There is no us.
I'm leaving.

29
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:56,937
Sophie.

30
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:58,965
Please?

31
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,313
You promised.

1x23: Sophie-Week 5

34
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,567
Hello, Olivia.
Nice to meet you, finally.

35
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,987
- You too.
- Come on in. Sophie.

36
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,048
That's okay,
I'm just gonna be a minute.

37
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:45,869
Why don't we take
that minute inside?

38
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:49,336
- I don't want to intrude.
- You're not intruding. I called you.

39
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:50,956
I don't want to be in the way.

40
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:54,320
I promise you nothing terrible
will happen if you come inside.

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,307
Don't bet the farm on that.

42
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:06,181
She says she won't come back to therapy
if I go in. I don't know what to do.

43
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,600
I think it'll be fine.
Come on.

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,655
Sophie, can you take your bag
off the couch, please?

45
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:28,578
Thank you.

46
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,376
Please.

47
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,760
I asked you both here today...

48
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,180
Just tell her that I can keep training.

49
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,604
Otherwise I'm stuck at home with her.

50
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:51,624
She promised
she wouldn't go back to training

51
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:53,985
- unless you said it was okay.
- I never said that.

52
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,356
20 minutes ago,
you said you wouldn't go back

53
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,931
- unless Paul...
- I'll listen to what Paul has to say,

54
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,317
not do what he says.

55
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,648
God, you're like the queen
of selective hearing.

56
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:05,076
It seems crazy to me,
after all she's been through,

57
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,548
for her to just waltz back
into the gym.

58
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,929
It's not like she's injured.

59
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,674
- That's not the problem.
- You are.

60
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,488
I'm the problem.
Right. Always.

61
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,826
Yes, always.
You're one gargantuan problem.

62
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,160
Let me ask you something, Sophie.

63
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,675
Do you feel that you are
ready to go back

64
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,584
- to training?
- Yes.

65
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:28,616
But you can also understand
how your mom is...

66
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,363
a little bit concerned about that.

67
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,059
She's a crazy bitch.
Nobody understands her.

68
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,061
I think I understand her.

69
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,840
If I stay at home with her,

70
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,197
I will either slit my wrists
or I'll go postal,

71
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,991
they'll shut me in the loony bin.

72
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,826
And you won't be there
to get me out next time.

73
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:59,243
I think your mom is concerned
about whether you're ready...

74
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:03,036
mentally for the stress
you'll be under when you go back.

75
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,982
I can deal with stress.

76
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,136
If you can't, you don't belong there.
It's not for sissies.

77
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:09,929
- Why are you sighing?
- I'm not.

78
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:13,602
- I just heard you. You were sighing.
- Just breathing. Not allowed anymore?

79
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,383
If I don't try out for the olympics,

80
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,209
- I'll kill myself for real.
- Sophie, enough.

81
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,736
No more threats.

82
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:26,422
No more.

83
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,330
- Thank you, doctor.
- Shut up.

84
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,825
What are you even doing here?
Get your own life and butt out of mine?

85
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,524
That's right, because my very presence
makes any space I enter

86
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:43,354
automatically toxic to you.

87
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:45,720
- I hope my money isn't toxic too.
- I don't need it.

88
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,217
Right, you can always fall back
on your father's money.

89
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,346
So what is it, Paul?
To train or not to train?

90
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:09,149
Olivia, I understand your concerns,

91
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:12,575
and why you wouldn't want Sophie
to go back to the gym.

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,564
But, and I have given this
a great deal of thought,

93
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:24,295
I do think that Sophie should continue
her program of training.

94
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:27,692
What?

95
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,259
Are you sure?

96
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,026
Yes.

97
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,431
- I think that the gym is a place...
- Okay, but...

98
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,479
I don't know.
See, I just thought

99
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,593
- after everything...
- Are you deaf?

100
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:42,850
No, I'm not deaf.

101
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,148
- So you heard him?
- Yes, I heard him.

102
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,859
So why are you still talking?

103
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,073
Here come the waterworks.

104
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,577
- I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hallelujah!

105
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,160
- I'd prefer if you stayed.
- If she stays, I'm so out.

106
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:02,113
I can see myself out.

107
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,868
- Dr. Weston.
- Paul.

108
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,660
I never got a chance to thank you

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,510
for all the strings
that you pulled at the hospital.

110
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:17,026
If it wasn't for you, they'd have
committed her for god knows how long.

111
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:19,541
Actually,
it doesn't quite work like that.

112
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,952
She would have had
an uncomfortable night or two, but...

113
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,497
In any case, thank you.

114
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,470
Make sure she walked away.
She could still be there,

115
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,022
- listening through the door.
- She's not listening at the door.

116
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:49,964
She's gone.

117
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,689
You're pretty confident today.

118
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,520
Confident how?

119
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:06,972
Sending me back to the gym
like nothing happened.

120
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,901
Where do you think
my confidence comes from?

121
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,612
Special delivery from old people land.

122
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:19,083
I'm confident because I think
I've figured out why...

123
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:22,170
Why you took those pills
in my bathroom last week.

124
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,429
I think you were testing me, Sophie.

125
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,284
And I passed the test.

126
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:32,636
Barely...

127
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:34,504
But I did pass it.

128
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,814
So maybe you can trust me now,

129
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,120
'cause I trust you.

130
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,787
One thing that bothers me, though:

131
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,494
what if you decided
to test somebody else,

132
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,484
and they didn't know it was a test?

133
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,612
Doesn't matter to me.
I'd be dead.

134
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:57,989
I think one of the things
that we need to figure out is...

135
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,694
what you find so attractive about...

136
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,086
About dying.

137
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:05,241
What does dying mean to you?

138
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,772
- Freedom.
- Freedom from what?

139
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:11,978
You and your stupid questions.

140
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:14,775
And what else?

141
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,606
My mother.

142
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,633
So you think death is the only way
to escape your mother?

143
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:24,009
I'm pretty sure even death won't do.

144
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,388
Well, let me ask you this:
if your mom wasn't around...

145
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,260
Would you still want to die?

146
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,650
I have no idea, dipshit.

147
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh, I'm irritating you now.

148
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:53,314
See, what you're doing now
is you're shutting me out.

149
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,590
Is that what you do to your mom?

150
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,293
What else does death,

151
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:03,424
mean to you?

152
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,443
Sleeping well.

153
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,234
And what does sleeping well mean?

154
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,543
Not feeling.

155
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,534
Not feeling what?

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,565
Anything.

157
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,323
When you say "not feeling anything",

158
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:25,527
do you mean feeling...

159
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,664
Like, calm?

160
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:40,879
Is there anyplace in your life
where you feel calm?

161
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,136
Not here, that's for sure.

162
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,541
Okay, tell me what you feel
when you're here.

163
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:05,231
Would you like to talk about
what happened last week?

164
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:12,520
We went to a pretty painful place.

165
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,456
It was a place of...

166
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,219
Great feeling.

167
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,532
And then suddenly you...

168
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,689
You went to the bathroom
and you put yourself to sleep.

169
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:28,807
Go on.

170
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:33,351
I can't describe it.

171
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,909
- What can't you describe?
- What I felt, Paul.

172
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,637
God. Does everything
have to be talked about?

173
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,339
- It's too fucking hard.
- I need you to try, sophie.

174
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,365
- You try.

175
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,360
You want me to try
to express what you feel?

176
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:03,405
I tried to make myself throw up
but nothing came out.

177
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:13,874
Do you remember
after the accident, you said,

178
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,302
"I finally killed her"?

179
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,382
What did you mean by that?

180
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,655
I don't know.

181
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,480
We have these two sides
to our personalities,

182
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,878
the weak side
and the strong side

183
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,647
They're constantly
in conflict with each other.

184
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,434
Sometimes the weaker side

185
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,185
is sneaky and it's crafty,
and it wins.

186
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:43,346
For example, when you let
somebody buy you shoes

187
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:47,136
that you don't really want
or when you have sex with somebody

188
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,904
that you don't really want
to have sex with.

189
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:56,914
See, when it comes to sports,
you're completely confident on the beam.

190
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,106
You are really powerful.

191
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,927
But off the beam,
when you're not a gymnast,

192
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:04,235
when you're just a girl,
when you're a young woman,

193
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,507
that part of you is less secure.

194
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:08,691
And,

195
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:13,082
you seem more...
What's the word I'm looking for? More...

196
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:16,957
- Susceptible. do you...
- I know what susceptible means.

197
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,558
I hate that part of me.

198
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,735
But they're both you.

199
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,900
So do you really think
it's okay if I go back to training?

200
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:45,941
Yes, I do.

201
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:47,972
But here's the thing:

202
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,312
I want you to know
that I'm going to be here for you,

203
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,744
anytime.

204
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,749
All you have to do is just call me.
But on one condition:

205
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:01,793
I want you to know this
and understand it really clearly.

206
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,264
I will not treat you
under the threat of suicide.

207
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,074
Do you understand me?

208
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,887
And if I don't agree,
then I can't go back to the gym.

209
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,573
Then you cannot come back here, ever.

210
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,586
Do we have a deal?

211
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:42,036
You said before that I was testing you.

212
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,300
You said that you barely passed.

213
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,596
The fact that you were
testing me at all,

214
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,996
that's a kind of a failure for me,

215
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:52,364
that you should feel
you had to test my love for you.

216
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,804
Your love?

217
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:58,726
Yeah. I can't treat somebody
that I don't love.

218
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:05,019
I have to find something
in each of my patients that I love.

219
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,610
Otherwise I won't be able to treat them.

220
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,385
I bet you had to search me
with a magnifying glass

221
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,370
to find something to love.

222
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,692
I remember the first day
that you came here

223
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,495
and you were walking
around the office and you...

224
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:25,211
And you asked me about these boats.
You said to me,

225
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,507
"Are these here
because you don't really sail?"

226
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,007
And I said, "Yeah."

227
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:33,898
And you said,

228
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,532
"Well, maybe you should make
one of those glass windows

229
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,867
like they have on boats,
so that you can see the world."

230
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:41,519
Do you remember that?

231
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:43,961
When you said that...

232
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:49,427
I think that's when I started to...
To love who you are.

233
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:02,757
You say it like it's easy.

234
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,472
You're not used to people
saying "I love you"?

235
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:09,106
My dad.

236
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,509
- He tells you that?
- He doesn't have to.

237
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:20,432
I was surprised I didn't see him
in the hospital when I visited you.

238
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,871
You just missed him.

239
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:28,130
What does he do, do you think,

240
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,505
to earn your love?

241
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:32,706
Why?

242
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,864
Maybe I can steal his secrets
and give them to your mom.

243
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,474
Hilarious.

244
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:45,883
How do you know he does love you
if he doesn't say it?

245
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,138
I don't need to hear him say it.

246
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,483
Words are bullshit.
Everybody lies.

247
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:57,983
I feel his love.

248
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:02,265
And he feels me,
even when I'm far away.

249
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,668
Want to know a secret?

250
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,069
I have to wear glasses all the time.

251
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,532
Most of the time I walk around
half-blind. Do you know why?

252
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,105
- Why?
- 'Cause I prefer it that way.

253
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,240
With my glasses on,
everything is too sharp.

254
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,735
Without them, everyone looks...

255
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:29,918
Looks like they've got perfect skin.

256
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,421
So my mother must look
like a supermodel to you.

257
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,207
Why are you telling me this?

258
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:42,254
I think your father looks better
in the distance,

259
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,524
far away,

260
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,225
blurry. But your mother
is right up close,

261
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,851
and she's kind of painfully clear.

262
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,183
I'm really over this conversation.

263
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:00,166
Before you passed out last week,
you said something about models,

264
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,994
something about a photo shoot
not beginning on time.

265
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:07,629
I remember that you told me
that your dad was a photographer.

266
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,293
Did your dad work with...
With models?

267
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:13,420
Why are you picking on him?

268
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:16,897
My dad is the only person
in this world who really loves me.

269
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:19,551
Why is that so hard for you
to get your head around?

270
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,045
What are you doing?

271
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:26,875
I forgot to give you the money
to pay Paul.

272
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:30,396
- Are you listening through the door?
- Of course not. I was in the car.

273
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,184
I'm not gonna let her
go back to the gym.

274
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,358
That place is killing her.

275
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,612
Who are you to take the risk?
She almost died here

276
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,855
on your sofa,
and you're just

277
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,385
dusting her off
and sending her back.

278
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,488
- No.
- If you don't get away from him,

279
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,917
I'm leaving here
and I'm never coming back.

280
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,725
- I'll go to dad.
- To dad's?

281
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,890
I will.

282
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,000
- Good. Go ahead.
- I will.

283
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,582
Cry a little harder, mom.
That's great.

284
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,857
If I brought home a medal,
you'd probably drown in your own tears.

285
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,636
If you brought home a...

286
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:07,057
Stop making me look like a monster
in front of the shrink!

287
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes.

288
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,608
Yes, I think
that the competition is insane

289
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,810
and you're putting unbelievable stress
on your young body,

290
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,699
but I am so proud
of your accomplishments.

291
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,490
Isn't every mother
proud of their daughter?

292
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,957
Don't ask him! You want to go
to therapy, get your own guy.

293
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,140
Nobody wants you here.
Now get the fuck out!

294
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,032
Not until he tells me
how he can sit there

295
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,121
- and let you go back to...
- Let me?

296
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,591
You think I'm like you?

297
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:45,322
I'm some sort of child
who needs permission to do anything?

298
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,776
If I want to train, I'll train.

299
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:50,455
If I want to kill myself,
I'll kill myself.

300
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,850
If I want to fuck Cy
in my hospital room

301
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,730
while you're banging on the door,

302
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,075
then that's what I'll fucking do.

303
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,694
What did you say?

304
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,274
You heard me.

305
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,743
You are not going back to that gym.

306
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,997
Fine. Start looking
for my burial plot.

307
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:17,002
I'm going back to training next week
for the olympics,

308
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,963
and if you try to stop me,
you will never see me again.

309
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,151
Right, I heard you.
You'll go to your father's.

310
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,752
Only he's in Miami
photographing supermodels,

311
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:30,097
no one can get ahold of him. He doesn't
even know she was in the hospital.

312
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,564
- Shut up.
- He hasn't called her in over a month.

313
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,505
He doesn't even know what happened.

314
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,524
But of course she'll go to him,
to New York,

315
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,317
to Miami,
to fucking Timbuktu.

316
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:44,529
He's not here and it's my fault!

317
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,982
It's my fault because I am here.

318
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,391
Maybe I'll leave you alone
for a few months

319
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,603
and then maybe
you can love me just a little.

320
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,207
Yes, just fuck off!

321
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,879
If she came to therapy,
you'd need a tissue plant next door.

322
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,518
Did you have sex
with Cy at the hospital?

323
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:39,350
No.

324
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:42,802
You're 16 years of age.
You're a minor,

325
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:46,266
I've thought long and hard
about bringing legal action

326
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:47,804
against this guy.

327
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:51,904
You told me there was
no sexual contact between you and him

328
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,765
after the first time.
Is that true?

329
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:54,833
Yes.

330
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,103
Nothing else has happened.

331
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:07,456
- Do you want it to happen again?
- No.

332
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:12,485
- Should I be worried about you and Cy?
- No!

333
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,925
- Why is my mom so pathetic?
- You know what?

334
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:31,344
I don't think she is pathetic.
In fact, I think she's pretty strong.

335
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,647
She swallows all the crap
that you give her,

336
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:36,725
she still comes back for more.
She's making every mistake in the book,

337
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:39,628
but you know, you punish her
in a million different ways

338
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:41,702
and she's never given up on you.

339
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:43,817
I know you don't want to hear this,

340
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,629
but I don't think
you've given up on her either.

341
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,287
We're out of time, aren't we?

342
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:02,125
Why didn't you tell me that your father
didn't know you tried to kill yourself?

343
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:06,672
- Why was that such a big secret?
- It's not. I have to go.

344
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,052
What about our agreement?

345
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:17,209
- Let's talk about it next week.
- No, we won't talk about it next week.

346
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,221
What about our agreement?

347
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,276
I won't try and kill myself
as long as I'm in therapy, all right?

348
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,736
Say it again.

349
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:36,250
I won't try and kill myself
as long as I'm in therapy.
