1
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:40,863
Nice cap.

2
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:09,074
Those stairs were so hard for me.

3
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:15,408
This keeps happening, you're gonna have
to start giving me therapy at chemo.

4
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,774
Two birds with one stone.

5
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,917
- You know what I like best about you?
- What?

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,835
My morbid sense of humor?

7
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:29,639
Your eyes.

8
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,794
I remember the first time
I came here

9
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,294
and as I was leaving
I looked at you,

10
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:40,099
and you looked at me
and I lost my breath for a moment.

11
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,117
It's a compliment.

12
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:47,967
I know.

13
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:51,030
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna jump you.

14
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,946
I'm in chemo...
I can barely keep my food down.

15
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,451
You know, they have drugs
they can give you

16
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,601
- that can counteract the nausea.
- You're not even my type.

17
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,176
But your eyes are...

18
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,194
Bottomless.

19
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:12,637
I'm just saying.

20
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,093
Are you okay?

21
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:19,368
I just...
I forget I can't do that anymore

22
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,615
because of the thing
I have there now.

23
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,810
Does the port hurt all the time?

24
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,173
Only if I move a certain way.

25
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:32,378
I can't remember them
cutting me open.

26
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:34,904
I didn't faint or anything, did I?

27
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,181
No.

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,864
Do you remember them putting it in?

29
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:43,947
Did you watch it happen?

30
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,430
Not... not all of it.

31
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:52,713
'Cause you didn't want
to see my breasts?

32
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,077
Trust me,
there's nothing really to see.

33
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,873
But thank you for not looking.

34
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:08,187
And thank you for taking me.

35
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:09,987
You're welcome.

36
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,441
{\You know, }It's funny... I've had so many
conversations with you in my head

37
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,392
over these last two weeks.

38
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:23,494
I mean, literally every day
we've talked

39
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,651
for, like, hours at a time.

40
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:29,542
We've had whole arguments in my head
and then we've made up.

41
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:32,503
And what...
What have we argued about?

42
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:38,428
Whether life is just bullshit
or there's something deeper behind it.

43
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,236
And what do I say?

44
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:45,808
{\Well, }You don't say much even in my head,
which I find frustrating.

45
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,144
But when I asked you

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,979
if it was all worth it, you said,

47
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,609
"Of course it is, April,

48
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,156
if you make yourself
and others happy."

49
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:01,104
What?

50
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:02,978
I'm such an optimist

51
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,869
in your head.

52
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:08,706
- You wouldn't have said that?
- What you're essentially doing

53
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,920
is giving yourself advice
in the form of my voice.

54
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:14,652
I know.

55
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,012
And very sound advice it is.

56
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,885
You're taking very good
care of yourself.

57
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,498
Once I asked you
not to give up on me.

58
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,031
And what did I say?

59
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,100
You said, "Never.

60
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,598
I just want to haze you
for a while."

61
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:40,763
What do you think I meant by that?

62
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,198
You're testing me.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,868
And how do you pass?

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
I live.

65
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,444
Do you get extra points
for telling your parents?

66
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:03,385
Isn't it amazing
how many people have cancer?

67
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,344
And just, like,
having conversations, doing sudoku.

68
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,361
Did you see those two girls
in the corner on the computer?

69
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,401
They were shopping online...

70
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:15,731
For underwear.

71
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,823
We have catheters
coming out of our fucking hearts

72
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:20,732
and they're buying new bras.

73
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:25,768
You know, sometimes a little denial
is not a bad thing...

74
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,744
but don't tell anybody I said that.

75
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,039
I'm sorry I've been
such an asshole in here.

76
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,045
I told you... no apologies.

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,712
I mean, I didn't answer your calls.

78
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:43,794
I made you let me talk to Sienna
during a session.

79
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,595
I smashed my {\freaking }model in your office
and I left it for you to clean up.

80
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:50,299
I must be the worst patient
you've ever had.

81
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,065
Oh no, you're not.

82
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,777
Thank you for taking me.

83
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,743
And thank you for going.

84
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:02,918
No, really.

85
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,375
Thank you.

86
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,136
I heard that.

87
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:20,324
I had a bad night last week...

88
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:24,508
Just a few days after the chemo.

89
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,469
- I wanted to call you, but...
- Why didn't you call me?

90
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,224
You canceled our session.
I thought you needed a break.

91
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:36,145
- {\April, }That was nothing to do with you.
- It doesn't matter.

92
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,230
I called my best friend Leah instead.

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,070
Leah.

94
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,652
I haven't heard you
mention her name before.

95
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:45,656
What did you say to her?

96
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Well, I...

97
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,560
I had woken up from this dream

98
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,745
where I was already dead

99
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,234
or...

100
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:57,416
No, not exactly.
It was more like I knew

101
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,637
that I was about to die,
like something was coming to kill me.

102
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,318
It was horrible.

103
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,035
But...

104
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:07,384
I also kind of wanted it to happen,

105
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:09,907
just to get it over with.

106
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,383
There's another way
of looking at that dream.

107
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:18,509
Maybe it's just the part of you
that refuses help...

108
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,753
I don't want to talk about
what the dream means.

109
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:23,949
I was just, you know,
setting the stage.

110
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:26,315
Understood.

111
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,280
Anyway, I woke up

112
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,158
with this really high fever,

113
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:35,745
like so high I was shaking...
I couldn't even hold a glass of water.

114
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,691
And I totally freaked.

115
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:43,045
I mean, I really thought
it was all about to end.

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,029
That's why I called Leah.

117
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:47,986
She came right over.

118
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:52,361
And she took one look at me
and called 911.

119
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:58,741
On the way there the ambulance guys were
asking me if I was on any medication

120
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,819
that they should know about.
And I said,

121
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,606
"Well, chemo."

122
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,487
So was Leah
in the ambulance with you?

123
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,148
And her mouth just...

124
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,756
sort of hit the floor. And...

125
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:19,831
I was so out of it
I just started apologizing.

126
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:23,208
You know, "I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have called, but...

127
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm dying," and...

128
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:28,453
She took my hand and...

129
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:33,512
she said,
"April, you don't die this quickly."

130
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:37,102
She sounds like a true friend.

131
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,398
She really is.

132
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,488
Yet you hadn't told her
about the cancer till then.

133
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:48,585
I haven't seen her for a while.

134
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,974
She's in law school,
so she's been really busy.

135
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,117
Have you known each other for long?

136
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:02,093
We shared a bus stop
with a bunch of other kids.

137
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:08,049
When I was 10, Daniel came to school
with me for the first time.

138
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,504
He was trying kindergarten.

139
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,875
I was so afraid that everybody
was gonna make fun of him.

140
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,848
And that first day, I turned around

141
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,301
for just a second
and when I turned back around,

142
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,545
daniel was standing there singing

143
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,191
and holding his penis.

144
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:30,319
And I wanted to die right there.

145
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,972
I mean,
everybody was staring at him.

146
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,233
Nobody said anything

147
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,017
until...

148
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,468
Until Leah said, "Daniel,

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,277
you can sing
or you can hold your penis,

150
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:46,398
but you cannot sing
and hold your penis."

151
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,880
Everybody started laughing.

152
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,320
Then all the guys started
singing and holding their own dicks.

153
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:54,816
It was amazing.

154
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,589
So she's always looked out for you?

155
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,057
We've looked out for each other.

156
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,819
Her mom died
when we were in high school,

157
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,850
so she came to live with us
for a while.

158
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:11,995
She's really more like a sister
than a friend.

159
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:16,853
You know, her reaction when...

160
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,833
When you called her reminded me of

161
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,581
how Kyle reacted
when you called him,

162
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:27,834
when you were having trouble
with the model, remember?

163
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,159
You said that he also

164
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,347
came right over.

165
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,384
Yeah, so?

166
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,054
So it seems like the people in your life
are very committed to you.

167
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,805
I have good taste in people.

168
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:43,809
I think it's more than that.

169
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,531
I think that you demand

170
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:49,334
incredible loyalty.

171
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,798
So the only people
you allow to get close to you

172
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:56,144
are the people you feel
that can measure up,

173
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,117
people you feel
that can really go the distance.

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,740
I'm incredibly loyal
to them as well.

175
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,047
Yes, I know that.

176
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:09,167
So why are you making it
sound like it's a bad thing?

177
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:13,143
I guess I just wonder why you work
so hard to make friends who are...

178
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,096
so fiercely devoted to you and then,

179
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:22,140
when you need help,
you seem reluctant to rely upon them.

180
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,336
I called leah.

181
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,309
Yeah, that's true,

182
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:28,989
but you waited until you thought
that you were dying.

183
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:33,922
It's like a bank.

184
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,490
You keep taking money out,

185
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,150
then eventually
there'll be nothing left.

186
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:43,235
So you think that there's only
a limited amount of support

187
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,032
that one person can offer another

188
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:48,081
and when that support is used up,
it's gone forever?

189
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,402
If Leah had cancer,
would you get tired of helping her?

190
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,216
But not everyone is like me.

191
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,053
And what do you mean
everybody is not like you?

192
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,905
In the emergency room,

193
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:10,896
the doctor told me I should expect

194
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:13,315
more fevers just like this one.

195
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,986
As he said it, I saw Leah's face.

196
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,424
She just looked terrified.

197
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,978
For herself or for you?

198
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,262
Enough. I get it.
{\I mean, }I get what you're trying to say.

199
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,628
I just don't agree with you.
Is that okay?

200
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:30,881
Of course.

201
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,692
Not everyone is like me, Paul.

202
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:37,047
I mean, I know you think I'm crazy,
but I'm right.

203
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,415
I don't think you're crazy, April.

204
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,283
You canceled our session last week.

205
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,036
Yes, I'm...

206
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,246
I'm sorry about that.

207
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,697
How did you feel
when you got the message?

208
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:06,680
Well, considering we've determined
that I have a tough time

209
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:09,979
elying on people, it was a pretty
ballsy move on your part.

210
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
What happened?

211
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,947
I had a family

212
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,224
emergency.

213
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,304
So what happened?

214
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,100
You don't want to tell me?

215
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,375
Come on. I told you I have cancer.

216
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Just know that
if I could've been there for you...

217
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,067
I would have been.

218
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,230
I know that.

219
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,670
Hey, how old are you?

220
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:54,040
A bit... a bit passed 50.

221
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,623
'Cause I was thinking this week,
when...

222
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,405
When Leah's mom died she was 35...

223
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,264
We were 15 and she was 35...
And I remember

224
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:06,498
her being so old,
like middle-aged, and...

225
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,347
now she seems so young to me.

226
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,349
And I was wondering,

227
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,020
you know, if I make it to 35,

228
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:18,007
will I look back on the time
in here and think,

229
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,823
"When I was 23

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,707
and Paul was 50,
he seemed middle-aged.

231
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,592
And now he seems so young."

232
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,951
You'll have to let me know
when you get there.

233
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,112
So we'll keep in touch?

234
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,171
My hair started falling out.

235
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:45,679
They say I'll...

236
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,997
wake up one day next week
and the rest of it will just

237
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,881
be there on the pillow.

238
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:00,253
It's gonna be hard to keep it
from my parents after that happens.

239
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:06,071
I guess you and I
should start strategizing.

240
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,324
Or maybe you could just tell them.

241
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,749
I bet you and my dad
would actually get along.

242
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:16,153
You're both sort of intense
in the same way.

243
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:19,033
I think you should be part
of that conversation.

244
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:22,629
We could ask them
to come with you to therapy.

245
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,339
That might work.

246
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,093
We could schedule something
before your next chemotherapy session.

247
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,411
No, we can't.

248
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,456
It's tomorrow.

249
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:32,725
So...

250
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,843
Who's gonna take you?

251
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:40,114
You?

252
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,746
And what about Leah?

253
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:49,115
What about her?

254
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,518
Wouldn't you prefer if she took you?

255
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,140
Do you not want to take me?

256
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:03,760
It's not a question of whether
I want to take you.

257
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,482
Okay, are you refusing to take me?

258
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,425
- You still haven't told your parents.
- So?

259
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,280
So you've got a whole system of support
in place that you're not using.

260
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,658
I don't want my mother
to take me to chemo.

261
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:18,018
- Why not?
- Because I want you to take me.

262
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:21,983
I think we should talk about why you
still can't tell this to your parents.

263
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,568
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No, it's not.

264
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:29,195
I am your therapist and you need one{\a therapist},
but you also need a caregiver

265
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,323
and I cannot be both people.

266
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,836
You mean you won't.

267
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,994
- It isn't appropriate.
- Yeah, but you've already taken me.

268
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,496
I... I had to do that.

269
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,166
- Nobody forced you.
- It was the right thing to do.

270
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,336
April, you are very sick,
but I crossed a line.

271
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,105
What line?!
There's no line!

272
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,299
There needs to be a line
if I'm to continue being your therapist.

273
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,870
- You just drew the damn line!
- April, listen to me.

274
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:53,758
I knew you couldn't take it.

275
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,258
I knew as soon as you saw that...

276
00:16:56,842 --> 00:17:00,310
them put that port into my heart,
you said, "Fuck this shit.

277
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,701
This isn't my daughter.
This isn't my problem."

278
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,438
What's going on?

279
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:28,595
Tell me.

280
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,257
I can't.

281
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,057
Yes, you can.

282
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,818
I can't do this.

283
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,932
I'm gonna fail your fucking test.

284
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,598
No, you won't.

285
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,480
People die of this shit every day.

286
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,192
But not everyone is
as strong as you, remember?

287
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,653
I thought you were gonna
take care of me.

288
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:55,949
I'm trying.

289
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,322
No, you're dropping me.

290
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,912
No, I'm not dropping you.

291
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:04,290
I'm here for you, April,
as your therapist.

292
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,571
Until you're not.

293
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,184
I was so scared last week.

294
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:10,121
I dreamt I was dead.

295
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,382
I need you then.
I know.

296
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,756
I had a family

297
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:22,447
emergency.

298
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,176
What happened?
Did your dog die?

299
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,246
My father.

300
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,405
What?

301
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,074
It's okay.

302
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,246
He...

303
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,360
He'd been sick for a while.

304
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:46,736
Your father died?

305
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,998
How could you let me

306
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,418
go on blathering like this

307
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:57,093
when your... your father just died?

308
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,988
- I appreciate your concern...
- Were you close?

309
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:01,370
No, not really.

310
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:03,603
Why not?

311
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,507
He left the family when...

312
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,454
When I was young.

313
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:21,034
So was your mom at the funeral?

314
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:24,480
No, my mom has been gone
for a while.

315
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:28,917
When?

316
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:30,737
A long time ago.

317
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,325
Jesus.

318
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,253
So you've had it pretty rough,
haven't you?

319
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,886
I'm... I'm sorry.

320
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,923
We all have our fights to fight.

321
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,234
Well, look at you.

322
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,896
You deal with Daniel every day.

323
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,395
God, why do you have to do that?

324
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:56,108
- Do what?
- Turn everything around

325
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,350
so that it's about me
and my experience.

326
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,832
Can't I just feel bad for you?

327
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,427
Sure.

328
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,375
Go ahead.

329
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,049
So are you...

330
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:27,642
Feeling bad for me now?

331
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,359
Yes.

332
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,674
We're having a whole conversation
in my head.

333
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:36,847
I have expressed my sympathies
about your father, and you have

334
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,932
gratefully and graciously
accepted my condolences.

335
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:42,692
Good.

336
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,922
You know, having a fantasy life
as powerful as that...

337
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,753
The ability to play out
whole scenarios

338
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:54,959
in your head... that's...

339
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,089
That's the mark of
a highly intelligent person.

340
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:59,716
- Really?
- Yes.

341
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,342
Yes, according to some studies.

342
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:04,220
And what do the other studies
consider it a sign of?

343
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,434
Utter insanity.

344
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,174
Can we go back to talking about
your chemo session tomorrow?

345
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,322
Who can take you?

346
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:26,620
I don't know.

347
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:28,988
I understand you don't want
to talk to your mother...

348
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,025
And I appreciate
Leah can't take the stress...

349
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,499
Yeah. She's got midterms.

350
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,402
But you must have other friends
who would like to be there.

351
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:38,565
I guess so.

352
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,256
What about Kyle?

353
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,388
When you figure out who's gonna
take you, will you let me know?

354
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,209
Why?

355
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,638
I want to know
that you've found somebody.

356
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,957
I'm sorry about your dad, Paul.
