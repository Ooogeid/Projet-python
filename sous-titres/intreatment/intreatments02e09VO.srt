1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,460
It's fine...

2
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:04,006
old.

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:11,137
Actually, Mom,
Dad said he liked my hair.

4
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,543
Anyway, mom, I gotta go.
Dad's going to make breakfast.

5
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:25,900
Yes, on the stove.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,284
Okay, love you too.
Bye.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,006
Where did she think I was going to make
breakfast... in the washing machine?

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,328
She just assumed we'd go out.

9
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:41,040
Did you... did you want to go out?

10
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,949
I don't care.

11
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,368
I just don't want
a <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> moment, you know?

12
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:49,045
That happens to be
one of your mom's favorite movies.

13
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,464
And one of mine, incidentally.

14
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,462
- Well, that explains quite a bit.
- Yes, it does.

15
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,412
Sign here, please.

16
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:06,186
Sure.

17
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,359
What is it?

18
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,706
It's from a law firm.

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,930
- It's nothing.
- What is it?

20
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,600
I mean, you're not being sued,
are you?

21
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:24,625
By who?

22
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,367
Mom?

23
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:29,573
You know that's all settled.

24
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:32,831
Then who?
It's not one of your patients?

25
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,082
It is, isn't it?

26
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,456
You know I can't talk
about stuff like that.

27
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:42,014
- Then who can you talk about it with?
- I have a lawyer.

28
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,686
You can't talk to a lawyer.

29
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,655
Rosie, it's under control.

30
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,343
Right. Because you always control
everything so well.

31
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,114
Is this what you wanted?
I don't get it!

32
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:56,865
You know? It's like you're...

33
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,994
condemning yourself
to a life of loneliness.

34
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:04,234
And for what, Dad? For patients who
sue you when you try to help them?

35
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:08,150
I mean, is this really
how you wanted everything to turn out?

36
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:12,381
It's gonna be fine, Rosie, really.

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,274
Please!
You always say that.

38
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,249
You're just making shit up.

39
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,099
No no, I already told you.

40
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,351
No more hugs...
not until you come home.

41
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,728
Rosie, you know
that's not gonna happen.

42
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,202
You don't deserve it.

43
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:52,781
Nice turtle.

44
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,013
Synchro: mpm, So.

45
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,036
So I'm sure this week
you read up on me.

46
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,737
You mean about your company?

47
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,088
I won't hold it against you.

48
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,313
We've got a target on our backs.

49
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,684
Moved off that business section
you never read

50
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:38,793
into the front section,

51
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,428
any day now there's going to be
a feeding frenzy.

52
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,880
Actually I did read a few articles,
but mostly about the industry.

53
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,811
Not specifically about you.

54
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,480
Finefellow, fine.

55
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,607
Connie thinks this reporter at <i>The Times</i>
has it in for me.

56
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,032
Do you think she's right?

57
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:58,478
Well, like you said, the whole industry
is reeling from this,

58
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:02,366
but for some reason Brenda Starr
over there has decided

59
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,576
to make me the poster child
for the scandal.

60
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,276
It got so bad this week
that connie asked me

61
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,392
if I'd ever laid off
the girl's father.

62
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,212
Do you agree with her
that this reporter is out to get you?

63
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,087
Those articles...
they're not based on facts.

64
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,431
She's just listening to somebody.

65
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,722
I don't know who,

66
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:23,290
some malcontent who has just enough
information to sound knowledgeable

67
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:24,814
and do serious damage.

68
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,953
So if I follow you then,

69
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:29,884
this may not be
a reporter's vendetta,

70
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:34,096
but it could actually be the work
of somebody from inside the company.

71
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,333
Well, I didn't want to think that,

72
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,344
but the Donaldsons, that's the family
with the majority stake,

73
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,082
they're convinced of it.

74
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,095
Old man Donaldson said,
"Walter, we have a Judas in our midst".

75
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,924
That must be pretty disturbing,

76
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,275
not knowing who to trust
in the midst of a crisis.

77
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,108
Well, that's business.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,022
But what's really disturbing
is for her to imply

79
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:59,424
that I would endanger
the health of children {\just }to turn a profit.

80
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,259
I mean,
that's completely irresponsible.

81
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,439
I'm a father, for Christ's sake.

82
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,216
Got a daughter who's probably reading
about this online.

83
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,308
Are you worried
about how she might react?

84
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:15,730
She knows who her old man is.

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,703
But I am worried

86
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:20,826
that these articles might be putting
Natalie in jeopardy.

87
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,661
I'm not sure that I follow.

88
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,760
Well, God forbid
they find out she's my daughter.

89
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:29,869
For all I know they probably
already have. Maybe she's {\already }disappeared.

90
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,915
Maybe they're stalling for time
while he decides

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,683
how much ransom
he thinks he can ask for.

92
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,842
Do you think I sound crazy?

93
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,904
I think your anxiety
might be influencing your judgment.

94
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,095
Well, I'm not the only one.

95
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,620
Connie's allergies are acting up.
She's losing weight.

96
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,927
Or maybe she's worried for you.

97
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:53,839
Me?

98
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:55,233
About what?

99
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,228
My job?

100
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,274
No, that reporter from <i>The Times</i>
who's trying to get me fired,

101
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,391
she's the one who should be worried.

102
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,891
Or do I sound crazy?

103
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:08,364
Actually I think
you sound quite confident

104
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,520
for a man in the midst of a...
what did you call it?

105
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,045
A feeding frenzy?

106
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,290
Yeah, there's a reason for that...

107
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:16,873
the Donaldsons.

108
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,086
I've worked for them
for over 35 years.

109
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,338
I'm like a son to them.

110
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,266
Can I ask you
what you're thinking about now?

111
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:36,953
That's right.

112
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,553
You're the fellow who wants me to say
whatever pops into my head.

113
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,947
I was just thinking...
they had a son.

114
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
James.

115
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,836
We were in the war together...

116
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,412
army corps of engineers.

117
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,842
We tried to build
bridges over there,

118
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,584
helping people
who were taking shots at us.

119
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,850
When we got back to the States,

120
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,214
I got my degree
and he brought me into the company.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,555
If I'd looked out for him as much over
here as we did{\ for each other} over there,

122
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,679
he might still be around.

123
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,681
What happened to him?

124
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,191
He drove too fast.

125
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,318
You see a family through a loss
like that and they're not gonna...

126
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,510
this crisis'll blow over.
They always do.

127
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,758
I think I've talked enough.

128
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,497
Would you mind telling me
what you're thinking?

129
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,359
Well, just now I was struck
by the way you said that the...

130
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,267
the crisis would blow over.

131
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:50,593
It reminded me of what you said
last week as... as you were leaving.

132
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,214
What{\ did I say}?

133
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,223
I asked you if you should call
your doctor, and you said it'll go away.

134
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,392
"It always goes away."

135
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,861
Yeah, last week.

136
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,219
Look, I think I also said I was sorry
if I gave you a scare.

137
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,904
But... these things,
they look worse than they are.

138
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,067
And what are they exactly?

139
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,832
Well, whatever they are,
they're not going to kill me.

140
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,080
They're inconvenient, sure,

141
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,013
but they go away.

142
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,138
And have you ever mentioned them
to anyone?

143
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:24,237
I have a gold-plated
executive health plan.

144
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:27,424
I don't really need it,
but the company insists on it.

145
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,674
If there's{\ anything wrong}a problem,
they would have found out.

146
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,363
So you told your doctor
that you were having trouble sleeping,

147
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:34,698
but you didn't say anything
about the panic attacks.

148
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,353
They're not panic attacks.

149
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,178
What makes you so sure?

150
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,979
They don't happen
under stressful situations.

151
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,953
They happen at dinner sometimes,
or a movie.

152
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,610
Or, evidently,
during a therapy session.

153
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,654
Have you had one since then?

154
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:57,113
Actually I had one this week
in the elevator, of all places.

155
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,038
Would you care
to tell me about that?

156
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,527
What do you want me to do,
describe the elevator for you?

157
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,962
Well, did anything unusual happen
that morning?

158
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,799
Why don't you just describe then...

159
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,914
the details of that morning
as you remember?

160
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:18,361
This is like the game
my wife used to play

161
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,224
with our kids at the dinner table.

162
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,492
We'd ask them how school was,
they'd say, "fine".

163
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,763
Ask them what happened... "nothing".

164
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,777
Finally my wife made them walk
through the day step by step.

165
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,770
Is that really
what you're looking for?

166
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,368
Humor me.

167
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,931
Okay, got out of the town car,
went into the building,

168
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,807
met the new security guard,

169
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:48,354
showed him my passport,
went through the gates,

170
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,171
got on the elevator,

171
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,788
my heart started racing,

172
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,593
my throat closed up,

173
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,805
elevator doors opened,
went into my office.

174
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,572
This is about the time
that Natalie would usually say,

175
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,346
"can I be excused now?"

176
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,635
{\Are you saying that}Do you find this exercise pointless?

177
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,356
I don't mean to be
a doubting Thomas,

178
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:13,235
but I don't see anything that would have
caused a panic attack, do you?

179
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,782
You said
there was a new security guard.

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,075
Yeah, a kid.
What about him?

181
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,571
Anything unusual about... that?

182
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:26,246
Did it upset you? Maybe,
that you had to show him your I.D.?

183
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,542
You don't know me at all.

184
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,378
I knew Bob for over 30 years

185
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:34,858
and I always made a point
of showing him my I.D.

186
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,517
And what happened to Bob?

187
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:39,997
He died, according to the kid.

188
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Dropped dead of heart failure.

189
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,518
Disappeared.

190
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,270
Were you and Bob close?

191
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,439
I'd nod to him in the morning.

192
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,602
He'd say, "Hey, Mr. B,
how about those Knicks?"

193
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,778
I'd say,
"They're breaking my heart, Bob".

194
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,443
And just same conversation
for 30 years.

195
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,701
It sounds like you two
had a morning ritual.

196
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,903
Do you think that you miss him?

197
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,280
I don't miss Bob.

198
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,479
I enjoyed our banter
and I feel sorry for his family, but...

199
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,209
He meant nothing to me.

200
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:23,313
I just wonder if there might be
some connection between Bob's death

201
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:24,286
and...

202
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,948
your attack in the elevator,
that's all.

203
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:29,534
I think you're grasping for straws
there, fella.

204
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,286
Where did you go to school?

205
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:40,654
Here.

206
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:42,991
In the city.

207
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:47,871
Are you worried
I'm not qualified to treat you?

208
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,390
It was just a question.

209
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:59,794
Anyway, it doesn't matter. Like I said,
I've had these since I was a kid.

210
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,269
I'm used to them.

211
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,359
From when you were a kid?

212
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:05,549
Really?

213
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:06,724
Off and on.

214
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,855
Do you remember how old you were
when you experienced your first one?

215
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:16,938
- Four or five, I guess.
- Four or five, that seems very young.

216
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:19,074
Right...

217
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:20,869
Six.

218
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,241
I had to be six. I was already
sleeping in my brother's room.

219
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,668
Were you close...

220
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:30,414
- with your brother?
- He died when I was a boy.

221
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,212
He drowned.

222
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,130
How did it happen?

223
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,915
Well, this was
in rural Pennsylvania.

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,483
It was an old limestone quarry lake.

225
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,565
A swimming hole really.

226
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,150
40 foot cliffs.

227
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,918
It was a hot summer night.

228
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,166
And what age was he?

229
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,108
16.

230
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,036
Getting ready to go to college
in the fall... Yale.

231
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,646
He seemed kinda young
for that, but...

232
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,471
he skipped a few grades.

233
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,231
All the brightest kids
did back then.

234
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:20,005
But of all of them,
Tommy was the brightest.

235
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,671
You have no idea.

236
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,216
A real golden boy...

237
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:25,673
valedictorian,

238
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,339
full scholarship.

239
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:30,416
Tommy walked on water.

240
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,253
How was it for you when...

241
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:39,962
when he died?

242
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:42,401
Fine.

243
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,781
I don't even know if I really knew
that was going on, I was so young.

244
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,984
And your parents...

245
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:53,459
How did they...
How did they grieve?

246
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,444
They didn't.

247
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:58,871
Of course they did.
They had to, but...

248
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,296
they shielded me from that.

249
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:05,165
But you knew something was going on?

250
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:09,314
All I know is that one day
Tommy just wasn't there.

251
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:13,984
I think I stayed with the neighbors
for a few nights. And then...

252
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,209
I went home.

253
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:19,485
My dad was sitting on the porch,
drinking his lager, waiting for me.

254
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,900
He walked me up
to my brother's room.

255
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,422
All his stuff was still there.

256
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:26,852
Nothing changed.

257
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:30,413
My father said, "This is yours now.

258
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,390
"I just told your mother
now I know why we had you."

259
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,907
Then he turns around
and leaves me there.

260
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,074
Or at least
that's how I remember it.

261
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:47,343
It's a very...

262
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,542
That's a very powerful memory.

263
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,471
Well, like I said, I was young.
I might have it wrong.

264
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,033
And when you tell it now to me,

265
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,658
what emotions
does it bring up for you?

266
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,177
I just feel sorry for the old man.

267
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,734
Tommy was everything to him.

268
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,283
And your mother?
How did she react?

269
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,104
Her hair turned white.

270
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:15,753
She had this gorgeous auburn hair.

271
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,469
And then overnight...

272
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,657
she changed into an old woman.

273
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,050
I thought
she was a changeling for a while.

274
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,550
That my real mother was...
trapped somewhere

275
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
far away.

276
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,590
Walter, what...

277
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,449
What you're talking about...

278
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,907
describing, it's...

279
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,109
it's significant.

280
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,768
It must have been...

281
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,143
hard for you...

282
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,290
to cope with the loss of your brother
and your parents' grief.

283
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,615
Kids are resilient.
They survive.

284
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:59,434
But you began to have these attacks

285
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,003
after you were sleeping
in Tommy's room.

286
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,107
I did.
So what?

287
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,008
Like I said, they only occurred
while I was sleeping.

288
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:12,468
And...
what were they like back then?

289
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,986
I'd wake up sweating and shaking.

290
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,433
- Did you ever tell your parents?
- No, they had enough on their minds.

291
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,517
And these panic attacks,
just like now, they would go away.

292
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:24,856
There you go again with this panic.
Haven't you been listening?

293
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:29,253
How could they be panic attacks?
They happened when I was asleep.

294
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,472
How stressed out could I have been?

295
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:34,220
As a child whose brother
had just vanished, and whose parents

296
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:38,233
offered no explanation, I think,
you could have been very stressed out

297
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,858
even in your dreams.

298
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,581
Especially in your dreams.

299
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,626
You know,

300
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,421
it sounds to me like your parents placed
a heavy burden on you after Tommy died.

301
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:53,481
Did you ever feel that they wanted you
to fulfill his potential?

302
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:57,722
Nobody could ever fulfill
Tommy's potential. But I tried.

303
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I did try.

304
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,652
You are a very successful man.

305
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,562
I'm ROTC from Penn state.

306
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,996
Tommy had an Ivy League scholarship.

307
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,933
Tommy would have cured cancer.

308
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:15,865
Do you think about Tommy a lot?

309
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,450
But actually, I've...

310
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,129
been thinking about what
it must have been like for my folks

311
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,854
when I was in Vietnam.

312
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:30,211
They'd already lost one and their only
spare was halfway around the world.

313
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,757
I must have put them through hell.

314
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:36,177
- Did they ever say anything {\to you}about that?
- No, like I said, they...

315
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,473
They didn't talk{\a lot}
about their feelings.

316
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,184
Have you told your daughter
how worried you are for her?

317
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,145
Where's that coming from?

318
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,791
Well, Natalie is now also
halfway around the world.

319
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,613
Do you recall the word you used

320
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,338
when you were describing
Tommy's death?

321
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,118
But I'm sure you do.

322
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,538
You said he disappeared.
It's the same word

323
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:06,995
you used to talk about what you fear
may have happened to Natalie.

324
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,357
And also what happened... to Bob.

325
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,129
Don't read too far into this.

326
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,758
That's a strange thing to say
to a therapist.

327
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:17,301
Come on. I'm joking.

328
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:18,585
Were you?

329
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,409
Really?

330
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,391
It seems to me, this whole session,

331
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,264
any time I've tried to...

332
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:29,189
read into things, or suggest
another way of looking at a problem,

333
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,315
- you've shut me down.
- It's not that.

334
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:34,283
It's just that if you're wrong,
you're wrong.

335
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,988
- {\Am I supposed}I have to worry about your feelings?
- Of course not.

336
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,310
But I'm supposed
to pay attention to yours

337
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:42,272
and you've given me the strong sense,
I have to say,

338
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,629
that if I tell you something
you don't want to hear

339
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:46,914
you might very well
just walk out of the room.

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
You mean fire you.

341
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,128
Well, you're wrong about that too.

342
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,673
Look, if you think
I need to hear something just

343
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:58,103
come on out and say it.
I'm a big boy.

344
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,594
You think Bob the security guard
is my "rosebud",

345
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:02,413
tell me how.

346
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,338
Actually I think this precedes

347
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:07,816
Bob and Natalie.

348
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:10,536
Go on.

349
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,710
I don't think that you trust that...

350
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,677
people who leave you
will ever come back.

351
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,874
Your brother never returned.

352
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,876
Your mother looking like
a different person.

353
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,429
Your father was never the same.

354
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:38,100
And nobody made sense of it all
for you... as a kid.

355
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,095
Perhaps you still fear

356
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:44,663
that if someone...

357
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,252
disappears...

358
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,787
even momentarily, whether they're...

359
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:51,363
overseas or just out of touch
for a few days.

360
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:54,064
That something horrible
must have happened to them.

361
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,236
Perhaps in certain situations,
you experience

362
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,548
a disproportionately
stressful response.

363
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:10,775
So if I'm understanding you,

364
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,950
all this started
when my daughter left for Rwanda.

365
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,763
It's an overreaction,
like my wife's allergies.

366
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,050
Does that make sense to you?

367
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,263
Do you have some sort
of psychological antihistamine?

368
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,426
Do you mean a prescription?

369
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:32,690
I thought you said
you didn't want to take pills.

370
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:36,022
Maybe that was because
my doctor didn't have your diagnosis.

371
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,130
There is medication
for panic attacks.

372
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,615
But I think...

373
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,344
it's really important

374
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:48,711
that we continue the work
that we're beginning to do here.

375
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:51,758
Call my doctor.

376
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,940
Tell him what you think.

377
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,795
- I'll do that.
- Good.

378
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,348
Thanks, I appreciate it.

379
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,767
- Our time's up, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

380
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,595
You can pay me
at the end of the month, if you...

381
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:14,920
If you don't mind,
one thing I learned from my father,

382
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:16,245
pay as you go.

383
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,348
It's cleaner that way.

384
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,318
Maybe the medication will help.

385
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:23,487
Thank you.

386
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:25,637
Thank you.
