1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:02,098
So I've got her spread-eagled

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:04,795
on top of a table in the law
school library after hours

3
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:07,622
and I am terrified

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:09,392
because,

5
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:13,008
Because you're afraid that...

6
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:18,248
I swear to god, I'm reciting tort
reform in my head so I won't come.

7
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,606
So finally I get her panties off

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,937
and she's sitting there buck naked

9
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:27,532
on top of all these back
issues of "the law review."

10
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:30,071
And suddenly I just know that

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,070
it isn't going to happen.

12
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,036
- You couldn't have...
- Right,

13
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,188
And she turns to me and she says,

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,421
"it's okay, Eli, you know.
It happens to everybody sometimes."

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,138
And she is so fucking understanding

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,396
that it really
fucking pisses me off.

17
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,097
And then she starts to say
all of these really shitty things.

18
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,498
Like what?

19
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,642
"Don't get so upset, Eli.

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,891
"It isn't manly."

21
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,733
I mean, what the fuck does
that even mean? What the fuck is manly?

22
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,898
Can you just give me a second,
please?

23
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:24,749
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:26,774
That's okay.

25
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,742
You're about an hour
and a half early.

26
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:32,917
I can wait.

27
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:35,594
Is everything okay?

28
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:37,861
Shouldn't you be in school?

29
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,683
We got out early.

30
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:44,270
You came here by yourself?

31
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:46,034
Where's your mom and dad?

32
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,409
I ran away from school.

33
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,590
I can't go back to school.

34
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,382
You know what?
You can stay here.

35
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:01,829
But I'm going to have
to call your dad.

36
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,486
- Are you mad at me?
- Not at all.

37
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,777
But I am concerned about you.

38
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,624
Do you want to tell me
why you ran away from school?

39
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:37,891
Bad day.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,791
What happened?

41
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,578
- Can't I just sit here?
- I just thought...

42
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,969
you came here so early, you must have
something that you want to talk about.

43
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,167
I told you...

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,169
my mom's still away
and my dad's at work.

45
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,708
But you've got keys
to both their apartments,

46
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:54,635
and you came here.

47
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,094
Do you have any more ham?

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,930
You want me to make
you another sandwich?

49
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,221
Is that okay?

50
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,846
Sure.
I can do that.

51
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:08,566
But I hope by now you understand
that if there's something bothering you,

52
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,913
you can talk to me about it.

53
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,297
Somebody put dog shit in my locker.

54
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:31,868
That's terrible.

55
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,573
When was this?

56
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,472
I came down from the roof at recess

57
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,261
to get my gloves out of my locker.

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,550
When I opened it there was dog

59
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:47,383
dog shit everywhere,
all over my backpack and all my stuff.

60
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:50,520
And all my stuff. I went back
to the roof to tell my teacher.

61
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,398
- What did she say?
- She got a janitor to clean it up.

62
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,859
But recess was over,
so everybody knew what happened.

63
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,363
Do you have any idea
who was responsible?

64
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,448
But nobody saw him,

65
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,411
so nothing's gonna happen to him.

66
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,351
{\Yeah, well, }I remember what he did to your shoes,

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,252
so I guess this would be
his next logical step.

68
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,821
All through math
everybody laughed about it.

69
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:20,056
The teacher got upset 'cause no one
was paying attention.

70
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,178
That was my fault too.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,870
Listen,
somebody did something awful to you.

72
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:30,667
That is not your fault, okay?

73
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,331
I asked my teacher
if I could go to the bathroom.

74
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,122
But I went to the lobby instead.

75
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:42,531
While the guard was talking
to someone else, I snuck out.

76
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,326
You weren't kidding.

77
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,978
You had a hell of a day.

78
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,939
But I'm glad you came here so
that we can talk about it.

79
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,469
My dad's gonna be so mad.

80
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,258
And he's already really mad.

81
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,677
- What's he mad about?
- Everything.

82
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,680
I've been staying with him
for two weeks since mom went away.

83
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,432
And he yells at me all the time,
no matter what I do.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,644
- {\So }What do you do when he yells at you?
- Let him yell.

85
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,809
Do you ever

86
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,758
discuss the things you fight about?

87
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,130
He doesn't talk to me
unless he's yelling.

88
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,653
I think he broke up with Nina.

89
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,006
Did he tell you that?

90
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:25,717
No, but she doesn't
come over anymore.

91
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,552
That's my fault too.

92
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,877
That can't be your fault.

93
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,499
Nina told my dad
to make better rules for me.

94
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,686
And then they had this big fight.

95
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,037
Now she doesn't come over.

96
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,340
And when I see her at school
she doesn't smile at me.

97
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:43,550
- Do you miss her?
- Not really.

98
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,679
But I think my dad does.

99
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,309
He did a really bad thing
the day after the fight.

100
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:53,810
What did he do?

101
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,512
I shouldn't tell you.

102
00:05:58,732 --> 00:05:59,774
It's up to you.

103
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,053
He bought a six-pack of beer

104
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:07,160
and drank all of it
and he fell asleep on the couch.

105
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:10,618
- And what happened?
- He didn't get up in time for work.

106
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,552
He yelled at me for that too.

107
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,247
"Why didn't you wake me up?"

108
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:17,479
But I didn't know
I was supposed to do that.

109
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,634
There was no way you could've known
what you were supposed to do.

110
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,630
My mom was supposed
to be back by now.

111
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,157
But she had to stay
on her vacation an extra week.

112
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:28,178
Have you told her about the fights
you've been having with your dad?

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,875
No, she'll just get sad.

114
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:37,705
If I were in your shoes,
I'd be really upset about all that.

115
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,860
{\You know, oliver, }I keep thinking you've sunk
as low as you can go,

116
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,892
but it turns out there's no bottom.

117
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,640
Why don't we just sit down?
We can talk about

118
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,044
- what happened to oliver today.
- I get out of my meeting...

119
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,786
I have seven messages from your school.

120
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:56,549
What the hell were you thinking
to just disappear like that?

121
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,250
Eric dumped dog shit all in my locker.

122
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,484
He did what?

123
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:04,041
Apparently during recess today
some kid vandalized oliver's locker.

124
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,840
Oliver's locker.

125
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:09,196
Nobody saw who did it. But all
the kids knew that it had happened.

126
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,516
I hate that fucking place
and I'm not going back.

127
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,600
Nobody told me that.

128
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,349
Why didn't you ask me
before you started yelling?

129
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,025
Because you still shouldn't
{\just }run off from school.

130
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,995
It's dangerous and you know better.

131
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,481
I think that what your dad
is trying to say is

132
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,494
that he understands
that you've had a bad day.

133
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,562
And he's just concerned

134
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,698
that you left school and you didn't
tell anybody where you were going.

135
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:35,870
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

136
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,375
I understand.

137
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:41,276
Why don't you just go outside
and I'll talk to your dad, okay?

138
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:06,275
Where were you last week?

139
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,376
I'm sorry I couldn't be here.

140
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,657
First bess vanishes on this apparently
permanent vacation,

141
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,507
and then you go awol.

142
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,850
It's like rats deserting
a sinking ship.

143
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,538
It was an emergency, luke.

144
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,032
It's an emergency over here too.

145
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,833
Every day he comes up with a new way
to drive me up the fucking wall.

146
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,410
So you've had
a tough couple of weeks?

147
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:31,955
Bess calls every day. And we lie
and tell her everything's fine.

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,846
And she sa
she needs a little more time.

149
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,015
That must be pretty stressful
on you and oliver.

150
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,062
First he suddenly decides
he won't do his homework.

151
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,031
He says he's taking
a stand on principle...

152
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,482
the principle that school is stupid.

153
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,303
Have you talked to him about it

154
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,237
or were you hoping
I would say something?

155
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,209
I took away his tv privileges
and his computer privileges,

156
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,401
but he still won't do his homework.

1
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:01,163
{\You know, }He just sits there
and stares at the wall.

2
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,280
He certainly knows how to push
your buttons, doesn't he?

3
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,085
Next he decides to stop bathing.

4
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,270
What the hell am I supposed to do?

5
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:11,040
Climb into the shower with him
and soap him down?

6
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,850
I think Oliver feels powerless,

7
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,840
so he's refusing to follow the rules

8
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,215
because that's the only way that...

9
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,665
he can get some control.

10
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,350
Yesterday,

11
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,885
after he left for school,

12
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,650
I went into his room
and looked under his bed.

13
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,192
Past the mountain of dirty clothes,
there was all this food hidden in there.

14
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:35,259
I mean, half-empty packages of oreos
and doritos and cheetos.

15
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,699
I mean, there was...

16
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,740
Did you tell Oliver
what you'd found?

17
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,411
Yeah, and he got furious,

18
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,545
ran into his room
and slammed the door.

19
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,870
I should've gone in and talked to him,
but I was so exhausted.

20
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,310
I understand that
you'd be alarmed by all this.

21
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:53,554
But you know what?
I've worked with a lot of kids

22
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,229
in situations
similar to Oliver's and...

23
00:09:57,135 --> 00:10:00,985
overeating is a pretty
common response.

24
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,605
You know, this...

25
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,925
This thing that happened
at school today,

26
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:11,815
it isn't the first time.

27
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,105
Oliver gets bullied a lot.

28
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,407
Have you done anything about it?

29
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,951
Now that the school knows
there's a problem,

30
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:24,319
they're obligated to help you
find a solution.

31
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,765
Well, now...

32
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,084
How are they gonna stop kids
from picking on Oliver?

33
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,765
I mean, you see why
it happens, right?

34
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,595
I mean, he's fat,

35
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,593
he's shy, he doesn't have
any friends and he smells bad.

36
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:41,205
If I were his age,
I'd probably bully him too.

37
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,155
Well, the way he's been...

38
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:49,939
behaving lately, I can see how
that would make you angry.

39
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,525
Sometimes I just wanna shake him,

40
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,945
and say, "if you keep acting like this,
no one's ever gonna be your friend".

41
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:57,865
"Is that what you want?"

42
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,755
That's unforgiveable, isn't it?

43
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,864
I think you wanna try
and spare Oliver

44
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,540
from the pain that
he's going through right now.

45
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,392
But you love him so much

46
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:13,617
and that makes you
frustrated and angry.

47
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:17,257
Yeah, but what good is loving him
if I can't help him?

48
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,575
But isn't loving him helping him?

49
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,955
I don't know anything
about anything this week.

50
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,145
So what else
has been going on, Luke?

51
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,190
Looks like I'm single again.

52
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:35,818
Nina and I had a huge fight
about Oliver.

53
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,456
And the reason I asked her out
in the first place

54
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,331
is because she liked him.

55
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,658
I thought she'd be good with him.

56
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,820
But it turned out
she just isn't on my side.

57
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:48,038
And whose side
do you think she's on?

58
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:53,360
Last week Oliver dropped a carton
of ice cream on the carpet.

59
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,335
Of course I got pissed off.

60
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,800
Then Nina came over and...

61
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,259
for some stupid reason,
I expected her to back me.

62
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,385
So you wanted her to help you

63
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,515
discipline Oliver.

64
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,050
But instead, she started
screaming at me.

65
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,275
She said I wasn't spending
enough time with {\Oliver}him,

66
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,895
I wasn't setting
clear boundaries for him.

67
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:13,770
And how did you respond to that?

68
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:16,560
I told her if I wanted somebody
yelling at me all the time,

69
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,685
I would've stayed married to Bess.

70
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,781
That went over real well.

71
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:29,615
You know, at first,
Nina was a lot of fun.

72
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,575
I could come home at the end of the day
and just relax with her.

73
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,555
Then, all of a sudden, she started

74
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:40,215
scrutinizing my every move,
marshalling evidence against me.

75
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,405
I don't know, Paul.

76
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,190
Why do I keep choosing
these crazy women?

77
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:48,715
I'm not so sure, Luke,
that it's the women who are crazy.

78
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,785
I think it's the position
that you're putting them in.

79
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,130
So you're saying it's all my fault?

80
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,650
From what I've seen,
you enjoy having fun with Oliver.

81
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,545
But when it comes to making the rules,
creating a structure for him,

82
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,310
for a long time,
you let Bess do that job.

83
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,485
And then you hoped that
Nina would take her place.

84
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,445
So when he misbehaves,

85
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:12,956
you blame them.

86
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:18,135
You refuse to take responsibility
for Oliver yourself.

87
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,315
So can you see how that might...

88
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,840
how that might upset everybody?

89
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,969
Boy, now I could really use a drink.

90
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,275
Have you been drinking lately?

91
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:31,685
What did Oliver tell you?

92
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,640
Why would you ask me that?

93
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:37,065
Because the night I broke up with Nina,
I went out and got a six-pack,

94
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,150
drank the whole thing
right in front of the kid.

95
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,185
I thought, "let him tell Nina",

96
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,013
"or Bess, or you".

97
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:46,815
Why not?

98
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,625
So you wanted Oliver to tell us?

99
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,075
I don't care.

100
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:54,623
I never really had a drinking problem.
That was Bess being paranoid.

101
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,959
But the other night,
I'd just broken up with my girlfriend,

102
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,410
my kid was acting up,

103
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,239
my ex-wife skipped town,
you'd skipped town.

104
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,966
Shit, who wouldn't need a drink
after all that, right?

105
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,635
Are you saying you needed a drink?

106
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,018
You know, the week before
Bess went on vacation,

107
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,305
Oliver was on his best behavior.

108
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,425
But the second she left town,

109
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,225
he's turned into this monster.

110
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,820
Is he trying to get
some kind of reaction out of me?

111
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,698
I think that's part of it.

112
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,606
But I also think that
he was behaving so well

113
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,605
because he was trying to get
some kind of reaction from you.

114
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,140
That doesn't make any sense.

115
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,460
Well, look at it
from Oliver's point of view.

116
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,514
His family is breaking apart,

117
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,930
so he puts a lot of pressure
on himself,

118
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,905
trying to behave perfectly,

119
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,665
hoping that that
would solve the problem.

120
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,655
- So you're saying he was faking it.
- In a way, yeah.

121
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:56,227
{\I mean, }He even tried to stop eating so that you
wouldn't be concerned about his weight.

122
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,125
He told you that?

123
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,785
But it didn't work.

124
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,445
He did everything right,
but it didn't solve any of the problems.

125
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,470
So now, maybe he's behaving badly

126
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,725
to try and make you feel
as badly as he feels.

127
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:13,621
{\Well, }I tell you, I liked him {\a hell of }a lot better
when he was pretending to be happy.

128
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,896
Well, Oliver couldn't keep up
that behavior forever.

129
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,431
He had me fooled.

130
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,460
{\*Bess and I }We talked to him about the adoption,
and that seemed to make him feel better.

131
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,670
I honestly believed
he was doing well.

132
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,695
Which is what I think
he wanted you to believe.

133
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:32,285
I've talked to him
about the adoption too, and...

134
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,975
The way he sees it,
Bess and you were fighting...

135
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:40,345
too much, and you gave
his brother away.

136
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,690
And things are so difficult
for him right now that...

137
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:48,215
I think that sometimes he wishes
you'd give him away too.

138
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,695
Does he even love me?

139
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,195
Why would you say that?

140
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,285
I didn't love my dad.

141
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,126
Not even when you were Oliver's age?

142
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,195
Sure.

143
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:10,300
I did love him back then,
but it was unrequited love.

144
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,927
You'll have to explain that
to me, Luke.

145
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:17,307
My father was the dean of students and
basketball coach at my middle school.

146
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:21,019
He was in charge of every breath
my brother and I took.

147
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,565
When we did well,

148
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,975
that's just what he expected of us.

149
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,625
And when we screwed up,

150
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:33,531
well, let's just say
he was a man of limited sympathy.

151
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,455
That's quite a lot to live up to.

152
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,175
You'd think that.

153
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,540
The year I was in the seventh grade,

154
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:45,065
he started taking long drives
on the weekends by himself.

155
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,860
My brother and I got on our bikes
and we rode around the neighborhood,

156
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,485
looking for his car.

157
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:54,335
And we found it in the driveway
of this little house.

158
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,285
My brother made me ring the buzzer.

159
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:02,065
The door opened,
and there was my father's secretary,

160
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,438
this nice lady who'd give us candy.

161
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:11,265
Then my dad came out of her bathroom
and started screaming at us.

162
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,810
What did you guys do?

163
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:17,235
What could we do?
We got on our bikes and we rode home.

164
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:21,115
And then I was lying awake
that night in the bed

165
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,111
and I realized my father's
secretary's living room

166
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,136
looked exactly like our living room.

167
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,345
Every piece of furniture
was exactly the same as ours.

168
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,605
He must've bought it all for her.

169
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,725
My brother told my mother
and shit hit the fan.

170
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,805
She packed us up and we left town.

171
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:50,855
We only ever heard from him
when he sent his check every month.

172
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:54,165
He was good about the money,
I'll give him that.

173
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,645
But we didn't wanna see him.

174
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,079
I mean, he sure didn't wanna see us.

175
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:07,195
He never met Bess or Oliver.

176
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,088
And when he died,
it was like a formality.

177
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,425
But lately...

178
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:23,025
It's like he's laughing at me.

179
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,535
I did everything right.

180
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:30,414
I proposed to Bess
when I got her pregnant.

181
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,089
I worked like a dog
to make a good home.

182
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,815
I never raised a hand to Oliver.

183
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,575
And now I feel like I'm standing
right where my father stood.

184
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,770
You know, just because you're getting
a divorce, that doesn't...

185
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,251
that doesn't mean
you're turning into your father.

186
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,825
And it doesn't mean that
you're gonna lose your son.

187
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,365
But that's exactly
what it feels like I'm doing.

188
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:06,225
It's inevitable that sometimes
you'll remind yourself of your father.

189
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:10,585
You see how you wound
your own children so...

190
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,255
so badly without even trying.

191
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:17,305
Suddenly, you almost
understand how he...

192
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,105
he could hurt you the way he did.

193
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:26,266
But you don't have
to become like him.

194
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,747
You're not doomed
to live your father's life.

195
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:30,645
You have a choice.

196
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,345
I think our session is almost over.

197
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:51,668
Would you like to say anything
to Oliver before you go?

198
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,695
Yeah, if we still have time.

199
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,535
Oliver, do you want
to come in for a minute?

200
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:12,835
I'm sorry you had
a bad day at school.

201
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,525
It's okay.

202
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,235
What do you say
we go get some pizza?

203
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,865
Maybe check out a movie
if there's something good playing?

204
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:24,815
On a school night?

205
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:29,808
You've been through enough {\already }today.
You deserve a break.

206
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:40,205
See you both next week.
