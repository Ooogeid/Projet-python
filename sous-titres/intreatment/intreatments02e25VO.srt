1
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,090
This is Rosie's bag

2
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:27,507
and I got her this small thing.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,711
That's sweet. Thanks, Paul.

4
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:32,843
Well, I have to get back.

5
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:36,628
I don't feel comfortable leaving those
kids alone. They never stop fighting.

6
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,788
Wonder where they learned that from.

7
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:43,593
- All right then.
- No, let me get it.

8
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,672
- Where's the car?
- It's just over here.

9
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:49,872
Listen, Paul,

10
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:52,992
I'm really so sorry
about your father.

11
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:55,179
I know I've already said that,
but...

12
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:59,017
I really appreciate
that you came to the funeral.

13
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,262
I really do.

14
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:04,337
And that you let the kids
come for that weekend.

15
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:06,296
It was great.

16
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,026
They didn't drive you crazy?

17
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:14,406
No, it felt good to be with them,?
Like things are supposed to be.

18
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:18,285
They wanted to be there.
They're good kids, you know?

19
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,653
And you were good to me too, Kate.

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,429
We felt like a family.

21
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:25,768
I felt it too.

22
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,964
It's just unfortunate
that it took such a sad situation...

23
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,842
That's what I wanted to say, Kate.

24
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,961
I want us to try it again.

25
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:40,572
You know, being a family.

26
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,118
I miss you, Kate.

27
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:46,823
I want to come home.

28
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,699
I love you, Kate.

29
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,261
I think we should give ourselves
another chance.

30
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,536
I know the kids want us to do it.

31
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:00,160
So do I.

32
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,553
I'm seeing somebody.

33
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,766
I might be in love with him.
I don't know.

34
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:14,466
I can't do this again. I just can't.

35
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,567
And I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,929


37
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:01,903
How are you?

38
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,216
I'm okay, thanks.

39
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,760
Would you like some tea
or some water?

40
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,957
Water'll be fine. Thanks.

41
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:23,804
Thanks for the orchid that you sent.
It was beautiful.

42
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,529
I'm glad you liked it.

43
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,183
I've been thinking about you.

44
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:30,461
It's a pity you weren't there.

45
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,744
I didn't think
it was my place to be there.

46
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,854
Yeah, well, it was a nice service...

47
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,345
Except for the priest's cell phone
going off.

48
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:43,641
My kids spoke.

49
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:45,962
They each had...

50
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,245
a memory to tell.

51
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:51,216
And some people
from the nursing home came.

52
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,566
They talked about his card
playing and his singing.

53
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,136
- Did he sing when you were a boy?
- Not that I remember.

54
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,961
But one of the surgical nurses
said that,

55
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:05,036
you know,
he used to sing in the operating room.

56
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,621
"A fine Irish tenor,"
she said he was.

57
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:12,000
Of course, there was a lot of women
at the funeral.

58
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,693
Women really liked my dad,
as you know.

59
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,568
Then too, women live longer than men

60
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,259
so when you get to a certain age,

61
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:24,582
there are always going to be
more women at funerals.

62
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:28,157
You know what I've decided?
Women are really good at loss.

63
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,436
Men don't really...
They haven't got a fucking clue.

64
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,981
Did you get to speak
to your father before he died?

65
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:39,903
You know, for men loss is...
It's a defeat.

66
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,381
In a game or a fight,

67
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,147
losing makes you mad.
You want to get even with the guy.

68
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,481
Like this man who's suing me,
Alex's father.

69
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,165
This guy is so angry

70
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,657
that all he can think of
is coming after me.

71
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,026
Like that's gonna help.

72
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,132
Are you trying to understand
how to grieve for your father?

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,969
Among other things.

74
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,695
What other things?

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,676
One of the things
I'm trying to understand

76
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,347
is how I can help my patients
with death and dying

77
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:14,396
when I myself have been so stupid

78
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:15,968
and so wrong about it.

79
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:18,402
You know, Paul,
it hasn't even been two weeks.

80
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,232
You won't always feel this raw.

81
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,357
We'll see.

82
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,008
Can you tell me more
about the funeral?

83
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,022
I don't wanna talk
about your patients now

84
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,854
when you've just been through this.

85
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:31,329
Do you not think it's important
for me to talk about my patients?

86
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:36,001
How am I going to help my patients
if my own life is in a mess?

87
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,586
Would you use
a plumber if you found out

88
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,675
all the drains in his house
were blocked?

89
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
It's not the same thing.

90
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,176
You're a trained psychotherapist.

91
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,254
But not a trained husband,
father or son.

92
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,629
No, you're not.

93
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,292
As a man,
you're like an animal in the wild.

94
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,073
You're living day to day,

95
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:58,215
you're trying to protect your territory
and provide for your family.

96
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,275
As a therapist,

97
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,194
you're observing certain members
of the herd through binoculars.

98
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:08,227
These are two very different ways
of experiencing life.

99
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:12,167
But you can't observe yourself
through your own binoculars.

100
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,705
But that's why I'm here.

101
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:14,944
Right.

102
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,150
Can you tell me more
about the funeral?

103
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,898
Not this week, please.
I feel like...

104
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,162
- I feel pretty wiped out.
- We don't have to talk about it.

105
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,488
But I'm interested.

106
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,294
You said you were glad
that your children were there.

107
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,069
Yeah, I was glad
that the boys were there.

108
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:39,648
Maybe they won't be as stupid
as I was about it all.

109
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:40,974
Stupid?

110
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,708
I learned more about
my father at his funeral

111
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,033
than I ever did when he was alive.

112
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,925
- Doesn't that sound stupid to you?
- What did you learn about him?

113
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,451
Well, for one thing,

114
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:55,584
I found out that he did a lot
of free surgery in Bolivia.

115
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,563
- You didn't know that about him?
- No, of course didn't.

116
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,839
And he made me executor
of his estate.

117
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,377
Does that surprise you?

118
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,548
And he gave me his half
of a little brewery in Minnesota.

119
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,218
He owned a brewery in Minnesota?

120
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,886
With one of his doctor friends.
I guess he loaned some guy

121
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,311
some start-up money 40 years ago.

122
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:17,196
So if the lawsuit ends up
costing me my license,

123
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,521
I guess I can always go make beer.

124
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:23,778
You see what I'm talking about?

125
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,262
Who was this man?

126
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,814
All I knew was this old story
that I've told you.

127
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,788
That he left us for a patient, my mother
killed herself and I grew up alone.

128
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:41,334
- All these things are still true?
- How the fuck would I know?

129
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,602
If my father was this great guy,

130
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:46,845
why didn't I know it?

131
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,196
Are you beginning to think
he was a great guy?

132
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,012
Even if he wasn't great,
at least he was interesting.

133
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,519
But what was I? Was I blind?

134
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:59,255
People often can be very successful
in the outside world

135
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,467
and remain a complete mystery
to their families.

136
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:03,790
Mystery is putting it mildly, Gina.

137
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,651
I don't think he was
a complete mystery to you, Paul.

138
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,904
I think as a boy, even though
you didn't have all the facts,

139
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,343
you knew he was an interesting man.

140
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,462
That's why you were mad
that he was never home.

141
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:19,370
Maybe you wanted to live
with him instead of your mother.

142
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,149
- Well, who wouldn't?
- It wasn't your choice.

143
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:25,992
Paul, he was the only one
with a choice in your family.

144
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,397
He chose his work, his investments,

145
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:30,826
his women.

146
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:32,908
That hurt you.

147
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:35,773
I wasn't hurt.
I just hated the son of a bitch.

148
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,849
I think the hatred grew

149
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,686
so you could protect yourself
from his rejection.

150
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,645
I don't think you always hated him.

151
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,004
You think I loved him?

152
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,528
I'm saying it wasn't stupid of you

153
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,971
not to know about these things.

154
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:01,288
I mean, maybe he didn't want
to call attention to his charity work.

155
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,509
Or maybe he thought his singing
was silly or the brewery was frivolous.

156
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,167
Or maybe he wasn't home enough
to have any conversation about anything

157
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:12,912
or maybe by the time he got
ready to talk, I didn't give a shit.

158
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,037
All these things are possible.

159
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,015
Death leaves
a lot of unanswered questions.

160
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,203
You know, not everybody
has what it takes to be a good parent.

161
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,299
And sometimes,
as in your father's case,

162
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:31,624
the choices can be very difficult.

163
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:35,489
Do you give yourself over
to your sick wife and angry children

164
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,281
and fight a losing battle?

165
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,798
Or do you give yourself

166
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:43,965
to your talent and hope
that someday they'll understand?

167
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,371
So you're saying his home life
was a losing battle for him?

168
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm saying
that he looked at his options

169
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,570
and he fought the battle
he thought he could win.

170
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:59,011
A less charitable view would be that
he won the battle he chose to fight.

171
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,129
That's true.

172
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:05,215
So it wasn't stupid of me to not know
who my father was when I was a boy.

173
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,535
It was stupid that I got

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,474
to be this old and still didn't know
who he was.

175
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,284
Even sitting there at the bedside
in the nursing home...

176
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,648
He had maybe five minutes to live.

177
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:28,503
And for the first time
it was just me and him together.

178
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,718
Sickness until death, and all that.

179
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,069
The only person

180
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:42,556
I learned anything about was me.

181
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,087
I'm glad you saw him before he died.

182
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,606
It was the strangest thing,
you know?

183
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,263
Everybody left and...

184
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:58,447
I went downstairs
and said goodbye to them...

185
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,640
Got a coffee and I came back
and he was...

186
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:04,898
He was asleep.

187
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:10,472
Well, he had a pulse anyway.

188
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:15,535
And I sat down
and I started talking to him and...

189
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:23,828
And he didn't have a pulse anymore.

190
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,848
- You were talking to him when he died?
- I was talking at him, Gina.

191
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,444
I said...

192
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,647
I'm sorry and...

193
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,958
I said I was sorry
that I hadn't seen more of him.

194
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,950
I asked him if I could get him
anything and...

195
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,818
Then I just started
complaining about my life...

196
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:00,426
Like I always do.

197
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,352
I looked up and he was...

198
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,955
He was gone.

199
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:17,849
Did it feel to you like he'd been
waiting for you to come back

200
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:20,279
to see him before he died?

201
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,139
No.
That's what the nurses say, but...

202
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,491
They say it happens a lot,
but I don't believe it.

203
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,160
- I think it's crazy.
- No, not really.

204
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:32,061
On some unconscious level
he might have known it was you.

205
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:33,522
Or sensed it.

206
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:36,891
No, he didn't.

207
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,309
Didn't you ever become
suddenly aware

208
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,874
of your children
without them having said anything?

209
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,430
With Max, I remember when he used
to wake up in the middle of the night,

210
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,399
he would come into my room
and I would just wake up.

211
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,449
And there he would be standing
at the end of the bed, just...

212
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,269
staring silently at me.

213
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:58,695
So even though Max hadn't said a thing,
you woke up.

214
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:00,618
Yeah, great.

215
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,139
So my father becomes aware of me
on some level

216
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:06,932
and he really doesn't want to listen
to me complain so he just dies.

217
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,588
Or he becomes aware of you
on some level,

218
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,677
and he's finally able to let go.

219
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:20,136
I'd like to believe your version.

220
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,257
Do you believe it?

221
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,406
Or are you just saying it
to make me feel better?

222
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,390
Do I believe that there's
some non-scientific connection

223
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,268
between a parent and child?

224
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,273
Absolutely.

225
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,954
Does that mean that a parent
knows what a child needs?

226
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,029
No, it just means
there's a connection.

227
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,154
No, we're more than connected.

228
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:47,359
There's obligations
between parents and children.

229
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,318
There are things that they owe us
and there are things that we owe them.

230
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:55,750
Yes, but, you know, I think obligation
is maybe a subject for another day.

231
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,582
No, I want to talk
about obligation today.

232
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,842
My father owed me things...

233
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,598
And he didn't come through for me.

234
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:08,961
And I owed him things
and I didn't come through for him.

235
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,542
If I'm not gonna do any better
by my kids

236
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,142
and they're not gonna come
and see me till I'm about to die,

237
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,034
then we are all hopelessly screwed.

238
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,603
Is that your father's watch?

239
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:25,478
- You don't want to talk about this?
- No.

240
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,778
I don't want to talk
about anything in general.

241
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:31,056
I don't want to talk
about obligations or family duty.

242
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,781
I want to talk
about you and your father.

243
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,360
This is his watch.

244
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,992
I'm gonna wear it for a bit.

245
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,200
I don't usually wear watches.

246
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,623
But I'll wear this for a while.

247
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,139
Because
it's a pathetic excuse for...

248
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,084
For grieving.

249
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,052
There it is.

250
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,842
What did you mean when you said

251
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,517
the only person you learned
anything about that day was you?

252
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,779
I felt like I was in a movie
I was watching.

253
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:11,416
Self-centered guy goes to the hospital
to see his dying father,

254
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,957
sits down, can't think
of anything to say to his dad.

255
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,957
Then he starts whining
about his own little problems.

256
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,894
A divorce, the fear of losing touch
with his children,

257
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:27,447
a move to a new city, the threat
to the man's work from a lawsuit.

258
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,052
They don't sound so little
when you actually say them.

259
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,428
These are big problems
to somebody in the middle of their life.

260
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,144
But to someone confronting death,
like the father,

261
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,924
it might seem that the son
could work these problems out.

262
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:47,336
The dying father doesn't have the time,
but the son does.

263
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,678
No marriage, no children,

264
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,833
no practice, just time.

265
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,174
Without the time,
you don't have any of the other things.

266
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,502
I guess.

267
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,856
No, it's not a guess.
It's true.

268
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,748
Time's the precious thing.
You already know that.

269
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:05,628
That's why you're wearing his watch.

270
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,757
Maybe you were telling him
your problems

271
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:13,447
because you were hoping
he'd say something meaningful to you.

272
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:17,307
- Or finally be a father to you.
- I don't know.

273
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,730
But after he was gone I wished
the whining guy in the movie

274
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,263
could have been some kind
of comfort to his father.

275
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:29,847
I wished I had...

276
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:33,975
done or said something more
than just take the man's watch.

277
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:42,915
Is there anything you wished
you had asked him before he was gone?

278
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,542
I wanted to ask him if...

279
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:49,011
- If he was proud of me.
- But you know he was.

280
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,556
- Do I?
- You're a good doctor to your patients.

281
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,846
You're a good father
to your children.

282
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,741
And you love singing.

283
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,966
- I'm a terrible singer, Gina.
- I didn't say you were a good singer.

284
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,338
I said you liked singing.

285
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,709
I should have gone earlier.

286
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,667
I know that.

287
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,069
Guess I was afraid.

288
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,920
Once I was there I thought,
"What the hell was I afraid of?

289
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:30,006
"My father is dying.
What can he possibly do to me?"

290
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,239
Do you know what you were afraid of?

291
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:38,027
I was afraid that after a lifetime
of hating him...

292
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,689
He was gonna love me anyway.

293
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:44,665
And I think

294
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:49,204
I waited till he couldn't talk anymore
because...

295
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,996
I just didn't want
to hear him say it.

296
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:57,649
- Why would that have been so bad?
- Because if he could love me

297
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,201
and not give me
one minute of his time...

298
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:05,591
Then love doesn't mean a thing
and I don't want it.

299
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,909
You can't intellectualize it.

300
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,861
It's something we feel,

301
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,825
sometimes with good reason,
sometimes not.

302
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,232
You know, I was a pallbearer

303
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,408
and... so was Ian.

304
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,401
And as we came out of the church

305
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,596
and carried the coffin
to the churchyard,

306
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,971
I looked over at him and I thought,

307
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,590
"One day he's gonna carry me...

308
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,888
"If I'm lucky enough
not to mess it up."

309
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,538
You won't mess it up.

310
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,526
How can you be so sure?

311
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,750
Because you already know

312
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,898
that love is the only thing
that has a chance against death.

313
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,591
It causes us a lot of pain,
but without it,

314
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,012
we feel isolated, untethered,
lost in space.

315
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:05,655
So...

316
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:08,905
My father...

317
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:11,606
loved me.

318
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,164
And he did what he could.

319
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:19,241
No. Your father loved you
and he did what he did.

320
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:26,113
And you loved him and you hated him
because he ignored you.

321
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,621
It's not pretty.

322
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:33,993
Is it?

323
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:37,156
I wish you could have had
the father you deserved.

324
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,094
But maybe you can be
a father to yourself now

325
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:43,769
and do for yourself
what you do for your boys.

326
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,906
Did you have the father
that you needed?

327
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:02,356
I'm a therapist! What do you think?

328
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,751
I gotta go.

329
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,356
I've got to meet

330
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,042
Alex's father.

331
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,787
Maybe there's some way I can help.

332
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:24,720
Thank you, Gina.

333
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,905
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.

334
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,427
I'm sorry I have to see you at all,
so we're even.

335
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:01,030
Well, I wouldn't think
that makes us even.

336
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:02,305
Neither do I.

337
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,388
Are you having coffee?

338
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:08,881
With you?

339
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:11,796
No coffee.

340
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,878
- Can you give us a minute?
- I'm only meeting you here

341
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,272
because I didn't wanna stand
when I talked to you.

342
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,984
- You could have called.
- And I didn't come for you to be cute.

343
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:26,204
So just shut up and listen,
then I'll go and this'll be over.

344
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:29,576
I looked at the evidence.
I read the documents.

345
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,950
My lawyer tells me

346
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:36,280
it could take two years watching you
fight this and try to get away with it.

347
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:40,248
Why should I do that,
waste two years fighting with you?

348
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,085
I'm gonna drop the case.

349
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,872
You're gonna drop the case?

350
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:55,977
I'll take the settlement money

351
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:58,961
that your insurance company
is offering.

352
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,536
I'll drop the case.

353
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,640
Providing...

354
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:04,015
Providing what?

355
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:07,420
You write a letter of apology
accepting full responsibility

356
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,157
for the death of my son.

357
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:12,942
- What would you do with this letter?
- That's none of your business.

358
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,817
If you can use it to keep me
from practicing, it is my business.

359
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,392
I'm not responsible

360
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,653
for what other lives you destroy.

361
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,362
But I need something, proof,

362
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,010
a piece of paper

363
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:30,478
that tells me you know what you did.

364
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,194
So you want me to write a letter.

365
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:37,132
From you,
accepting full responsibility.

366
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:42,579
You took away my son's ability
to distance himself from his job,

367
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:45,204
and thus destroyed
his ability to do it.

368
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:47,623
You killed him.

369
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:51,523
That's all I want.

370
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,177
It's just for me. I'm not gonna show it
to anybody else. That's all I want.

371
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,841
You won't institute
a malpractice proceeding?

372
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:00,417
I can't get a picture out of my head

373
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,335
of my son in your office.

374
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,351
I need something...

375
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,270
That lets me know

376
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,863
that you know
you got blood on your hands.

377
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,393
Then you'll never hear
from me again.

378
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:22,679
You talk to your lawyers
and you let them know what you decide.
