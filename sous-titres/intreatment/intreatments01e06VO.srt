00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:03,180
Previously on male vo "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,441
Andrew gave me an ultimatum.

3
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:07,775
Either we get married or we split.

4
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:11,346
Do you have any idea why Andrew chose
this particular time?

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:14,286
We were having dinner and he said,
"i don't know what I want.

6
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:16,365
I just know I n't want this

7
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:19,565
on-and-off thing. " So I said to him,
"sure," and then, "let's just decide."

8
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:21,297
So you were the one who came up with it?

9
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:25,227
No no no, he had this thing with
this on-and-off. The ultim.

10
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:30,108
I love you.

11
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,308
How long have you felt like this?

12
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:33,305
A year.

13
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:35,599
You've become the center of my life.

14
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:38,089
Laura, i'm your therapist.

15
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,431
I'm not an option.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,429
Kate?

17
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:51,955
Kate?

18
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:57,664
Kate?

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
What?

20
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,743
Can you come here a minute?

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,149
This thing is. This is clogged up again.

22
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,401
Can you do me a favor?
Can you call the.

23
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:14,629
The plumber, tell him to come over here,
get it fixed?

24
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,678
I got a session starting
in about a minute.

25
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:21,624
Okay, but you realize he
won't be able to come today, right?

26
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,631
Just have your patients
go to the downstairs bathroom.

27
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,047
Christ.
You can't be bloody seous.

28
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,241
Why not? What is the problem?

29
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,741
- It doesn't matter, it's okay.
- What is the big deal?

30
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,959
There's no big deal. I'll do it myself.
Never mind.

31
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,764
I'll get Dennis that handyman
guy to come over and do it.

32
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,462
Yeah, good. Dennis will fix it.

33
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,235
It'll just get clogged
up again next week.

34
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:41,735
It'll be fine, I promise you.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,526
- What is the matter with you?
- There is nothing the matter with me.

36
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,130
I've got a session starting in a minute.
Please.

37
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,003
You're finished with me now?  Okay.

38
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,835
I forgot.
I should go.

42
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,415
Okay, so I said yes.

43
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:12,948
To Andrew.

44
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:17,020
We already set a date.
It's gonna be the third weekend in June.

45
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,246
You know,
everybody gets married in June.

46
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:20,577
So.

47
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:23,316
So you'll be a

48
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,660
summer bride.

49
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:26,736
Evidently so.

50
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,176
Well,

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,847
congratulations.

52
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,138
Thank you.

53
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,019
So are you happy for us?

54
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,886
Is that important to you?

55
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:48,231
Well, if you're gonna be a guest at our
wedding, you'd better be happy for us.

56
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,752
Andrew and I wanted to invite you.

57
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:53,257
Your wife too.

58
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:57,185
But you wouldn't come, right? Would you?
No, of course you wouldn't.

59
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,863
But we did actually
talk about it yesterday. Right after

60
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,504
I said yes
we started making a guest list and

61
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:04,561
for a few minutes there you were on it.

62
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,829
Wait a minute, you said yes

63
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,778
just
yesterday?

64
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,151
Yeah.

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,229
I couldn't make up my mind.

66
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:17,071
It took me a few days to get over
the other night and our session.

67
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,121
I wanted to calm down first.

68
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,530
Andrew was cool with that. He said

69
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:26,425
a day here or there wouldn't matter as
long as I was moving toward a decision.

70
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,337
You know, he's very happy
that you're helping me.

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,853
For a while there he thought he'd made
a mistake

72
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,503
recommending that I come see you.
He said that.

73
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,246
But he think you're an amazing therapist

74
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,226
and that his instincts were just right

75
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,430
and that you're on our side.

76
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:54,111
What?

77
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,228
I guess I'm.

78
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,215
I'm just trying to get used to

79
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:04,398
To the change in tone.

80
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,497
You're speaking in the

81
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:07,717
plural.

82
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,488
Well, I'm gonna be a "we,"

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,649
an "us,"

84
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,819
aren't i?

85
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:15,729
You say that like you're not so sure.

86
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:16,924
No, I'm sure.

87
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:21,685
You know, Paul, i'm, I'm generally
open to your interpretations, but

88
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,426
right now it just seems like
you're trying to be a bit of a...

89
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,430
Killjoy?

90
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,858
Killjoy, yes,
something like that. So don't.

91
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,673
Especially since Joy is a very
rare thing when it comes to me.

92
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:37,674
What?

93
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:40,666
I'm.

94
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,245
I'm just wondering if you came
here today determined to,

95
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:52,377
demonstrate that Joy,
especially after last week's events.

96
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,365
I'm asking myself

97
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,388
if this isn't a bit too fast,

98
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,781
if you haven't perhaps taken a shortcut.

99
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,108
You think that i'm faking this?

100
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:02,813
That I'm actually totally depressed?

101
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,676
Well, maybe it's you that's faking it?

102
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,743
I mean, that congratulations
was a bit labored, don't you think?

103
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,343
I. I don't know if you ow anything about

104
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:26,944
Scuba diving?

105
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,956
They have this thing
that's called the bends.

106
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:36,163
It's something that happens when
the divers

107
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:39,239
come up to the surface too quickly.
It's really dangerous. It,

108
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,064
can explode your lungs
from the sudden changes in pressure.

109
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:47,342
Anyway it.
It seems like there's.

110
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,262
There's a huge gap between

111
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,906
the depths

112
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,491
that you reached last week and the

113
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:56,887
heights

114
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,901
at which you are today.
I'm just trying to

115
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,019
I'm just trying to adjust myself
so that I don't,

116
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,150
I guess,

117
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,337
come to the surface too quickly.

118
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,709
Do you dive, Paul?

119
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:19,585
Yes.

120
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:23,974
I well,

121
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,084
we used to.

122
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,437
Who's speaking in the plural now?

123
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,374
I can't imagine you diving.

124
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,838
Where'd you go?

125
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,460
Mexico?

126
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,571
The Caribbean?

127
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,659
Are you interested in

128
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:45,994
Scuba diving?

129
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,097
I'm a certified diver.

130
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,314
I know what the bends are.

131
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:53,464
Sorry.

132
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,998
No, seriously,
I dov a lot before I met Andrew.

133
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:56,935
He.

134
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,493
He hates it. It's claustrophobic.

135
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:05,127
It's nice to find we have
something in common, you and me.

136
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:06,106
Isn't it?

137
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,461
Where are you now, Laura?

138
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,891
I just had a scary thought. I just

139
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,830
I know it's Silly, but...

140
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,693
Beforehand when you said your

141
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,131
Your lungs could explode,

142
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:37,793
I don't know, it's just the thought that
something might happen to you.

143
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,418
Yet you're the one who ascended so fast.

144
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,273
You know what, Paul?
I don't want a depressing session.

145
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,869
I want a happy session. I came with
good news, so show a little support.

146
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,157
Okay.

147
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,073
Okay, yesterday
I was at Natalie's.

148
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,823
You know, Andrew's ex.

149
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:07,061
And Gary the husband, the ones who
had a baby a few months ago.

150
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:11,317
And they keep calling, you know, to
invite us over and I keep avoiding them.

151
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,164
But yesterday when they called
to invite us over for brunch,

152
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,932
Well, anyway, Gary Makesdim sum.

153
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:19,273
I swear, Paul, he has those Bamboo
Steamers and everything.

154
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,368
So I said to Andrew, "okay, let's go."

155
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,369
I mean,
he's being so sweet to me all week,

156
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,041
I thought this is the least I could do.

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,109
So his agreeing to postpone
the ultimatum, that

158
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:30,965
dis. Disarmed you?

159
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,517
All right.
Go ahead.

160
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,352
They have a baby,

161
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:43,417
these Huge eyes. I mean, the baby is.

162
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,648
The baby's all eyes. So beautiful.

163
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,165
And the way he breastfeeds.

164
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,910
All morning he was attached
to Natalie's nipple.

165
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,529
This, this Huge dark nipple.

166
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:54,572
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

167
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:58,078
And at one point she took her boob
out of the baby's mouth

168
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,952
and squeezed it and some milk

169
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,576
squirted out.

170
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:05,141
Ani look over at Andrew and
he has this admiring smile on his face.

171
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,650
You know, like he was

172
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,412
loing at some masterpiece in a Museum,

173
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,673
like "the Madonna."

174
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,280
What do you think he saw?

175
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:22,248
Maybe an image of you and
he together in the future, maybe?

176
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:28,358
Or maybe he just misses her tits.

177
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,839
No,
not really. They're not that nice.

178
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,230
She's changed a lot
since she had the baby.

179
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:43,359
In what way?

180
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,583
I don't know.
I didn't really know her before, but

181
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:47,869
Andrew told me a lot about her.

182
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:50,616
He said she was this wild type,
you know,

183
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,352
who had a lot of guys chasing her.

184
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,174
She put him through hell.

185
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,853
He said they'd go to bed
and she'd be one person and then

186
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,793
they'd wake up and
she'd be someone totally new.

187
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,685
A free radical,
that's what he used to call her.

188
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,238
He says I remind him of her.

189
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,410
That's scary.

190
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:13,943
Like this is what's left of her.

191
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,046
The front of her t-shirt soaking wet

192
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,404
and nipples, nipples.
That's all that's left.

193
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:22,054
She's like a wild animal that's
somehow been.

194
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,624
Shit, what's the word?

195
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,120
- Domesticated?
- Yeah, domesticated.

196
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,181
She looked domesticated. Housebroken.

197
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,144
She said her wildest sexual fantasy
was to sleep four hours straight.

198
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,351
Does that scare you a little?

199
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,604
Oh my god.

200
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,659
I'd die if I turned into a Lousy Lay.

201
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,996
You know, someone who gets fucked
in her sleep and can't even remember.

202
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,017
Do you think that's what happens
to people after they get married?

203
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,625
I don't now.
Does it?

204
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:54,624
Is sex something you forget how to do,
or is it like riding a bike?

205
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,968
I think that depends on the.

206
00:11:58,439 --> 00:11:59,600
On the couple.

207
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,659
Of course, sex

208
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,678
Can be,

209
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:07,776
A subterfuge, It can...
- Paul.

210
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,050
Okay.

211
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,540
Okay.

212
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,242
So anyway, when I go to the kitchen
to help out with something.

213
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,876
And when I come back
Andrew and Gary are engrossed

214
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:27,479
in this deep conversation about
you won't believe this upholsterers.

215
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:30,505
There's this upholsterer
who redid their entire living room.

216
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,682
Andrew's taking down the guy's number
and I'm like, "what are you doing?"

217
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,381
And he said, "you know,
you and I discussed, you know recovering

218
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,120
those armchairs your dad gave you."

219
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,439
I'm telling you Paul,
we never discussed this.

220
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:44,323
And all of a sudden Andrew's
reupholstering armchairs?

221
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,800
I mean, we're talking metrosexual.

222
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:51,653
That doesn't sound very much like the
Andrew that you've been talking about.

223
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:52,791
Exactly.

224
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,023
I mean, this was beyond metrosexual.

225
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Do you ever watch <i>The Animal Planet</i>?

226
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,035
Well it was about this type of bird.

227
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:06,435
I can't remember the name of it,
but anyway,

228
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:10,216
the male bird builds a nest
for the female...

229
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,121
These amazingly...

230
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:16,015
intricate structures.
They're incredible.

231
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,399
Anyway,
the female goes from nest to nest,

232
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:23,788
you know, checking out
all her various mating options,

233
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:25,963
trying to make up her mind,

234
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,912
while the male bird
is desperately flapping about,

235
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:32,481
and trying to attract the female
with his architecture.

236
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:37,867
You know, the nests look like cages.

237
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:43,214
Anyway...

238
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,008
The whole way home, I thought I wouldn't
be able to fight this anymore.

239
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,166
So when we got near the house,

240
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,916
we were about to park,
Andrew said to me,

241
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,336
"Do you want to go to
the movies or stay home?"

242
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:57,671
And I said...

243
00:13:58,636 --> 00:13:59,735
I said, "Yes."

244
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:04,175
- And he says, "Yes, the movies?"
- And I said, "Yes, I'll...

245
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,930
"I'll marry you.

246
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,351
"I mean, fuck it.

247
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:13,729
"Fuck, I'll marry you. Yes."

248
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,241
So where do you think this...

249
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,695
"Fuck it, yes,"

250
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,893
came from when...

251
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,246
everything you've been saying to Andrew,
everything you've been doing

252
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:31,731
for that past few weeks
has actually been one big no?

253
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:37,666
Meaning what? You think Andrew took me
there as some sort of object lesson?

254
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:41,341
To show me how good it could be for us?
'Cause I don't think so.

255
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,333
Andrew's a pretty
mediocre psychologist.

256
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:47,000
Would you listen to me.

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,957
I just said yes and I'm already
bad-mouthing my future husband.

258
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,063
You didn't answer my question, Laura.

259
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,937
Where did this yes come from?

260
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:06,251
You really don't understand
why I said yes to him?

261
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:12,132
It was because you said no to me.

262
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,321
Because...

263
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,254
Because I said no to you?

264
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,344
I mean, the whole situation
is just one big...

265
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,935
fucking no. I'm not blaming you.
I'm not accusing you. I'm just...

266
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,267
Did you expect a different reaction?

267
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,316
In your...

268
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:34,554
fantasy...

269
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:38,529
How would I respond to you saying...

270
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,796
that you are...
Let's say,

271
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:43,706
"in love with me"?

272
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:47,764
First of all, take the quotation marks
off the "in love with me."

273
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,642
It's insulting.

274
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:54,507
And stop with the fantasy talk, because
fantasies are for silly little girls.

275
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:59,870
You know, we're talking about reality,
which is that I'm in love with you.

276
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,695
- But I still...
- That's reality.

277
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,015
I still want to talk
about fantasies

278
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,387
for a minute.

279
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,150
Not the fantasy
of a silly little girl,

280
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,163
but the fantasy
of a grown smart woman.

281
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:14,080
Please, let's not do that.
That's beneath my dignity.

282
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,625
Well, I don't think there's anything
beneath our dignity

283
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,675
if it takes us someplace
our dignity refuses to go.

284
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,600
You remember that story you told me

285
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,150
that summer when you were 15 years olds
in San Diego?

286
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:47,389
That couple you lived with, the ones
who had no children, David and Celia?

287
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:49,884
You said that summer was...

288
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,540
Was very significant to you.

289
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:54,793
My God.

290
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,743
My mother had just died, Paul.

291
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,089
Of course it was significant.
What's the point in rehashing all this?

292
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:03,812
My mother died, I was very lucky to have
somebody taking me in for a few months.

293
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:04,972
I mean, so?

294
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,507
I just wanna go back to that period
for a little bit if you don't mind.

295
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,809
Your mother was gone.

296
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,968
Your mother was
your last wall of protection

297
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,578
against your father...
From your father's...

298
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,051
How did you put it?

299
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,231
- Toxic fumes.
- Toxic fumes, yes.

300
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,086
His loneliness,

301
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,287
his fears,
his dependency on you.

302
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,601
You said that he'd call you
up in California and say

303
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:34,442
how unhappy he was
and how much he missed your mother,

304
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,383
begging you to cut your vacation short
and come back home.

305
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,149
What's this got to do with anything?

306
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,662
You took a liking to these people
who were

307
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,763
athletic, healthy,

308
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,599
the exact opposite
of your parents in every way.

309
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,667
And you described David very vividly.

310
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,869
And you said he was very kind to you.

311
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,066
Yeah, you know,
he used to take me camping.

312
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,668
We'd go surfing,

313
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,730
used to just...

314
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:08,174
talk about stuff, you know?
Teenage bullshit.

315
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,951
You were very attracted to him.

316
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,082
He was a hunk, yeah.

317
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,210
He looked like Nick Nolte.

318
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:25,569
They smoked a lot of grass.

319
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,064
A lot of grass. I smoked with them.
It was my first time.

320
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:33,448
And...

321
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,422
When that summer was over,

322
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,686
they said it was a shame
they couldn't adopt you.

323
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,964
They said,
"We want a daughter just like you."

324
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,678
Yeah, I actually asked them
to see if it was possible.

325
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:53,048
If there was some legal way to...
Aanyway, they just laughed at me.

326
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:56,562
They didn't take me seriously.
They said I was so cute.

327
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,381
Actually, I wanted him to adopt me.

328
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:05,057
She was great... Celia.
But, you know, I was 15.

329
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,822
I wanted him all to myself.

330
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,298
Makes a lot of sense
when you think about it.

331
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:21,086
You were 15 years old,
your father was...

332
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,776
grieving,
completely dependent on you.

333
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:27,188
David must have seemed like a life raft.

334
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:32,135
Just as just perhaps I am now...

335
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,275
from Andrew.

336
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,557
Perhaps I'm an alternative to everything
that Andrew represents...

337
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,547
Dependency, anxiety.

338
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,874
But I am not a realistic option for you.

339
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,787
This is a safe place
where you can come,

340
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,752
like David at the beach.

341
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:58,574
Yes, but with one big difference.

342
00:19:58,853 --> 00:19:59,895
What's that?

343
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,580
I don't want you to adopt me,
I want you to fuck me.

344
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:17,277
I need to pee.

345
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:26,181
There's a problem with the...

346
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,576
With the thing...
It's...

347
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:31,315
It's blocked up.

348
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,636
I just called...
I'm gonna call the handyman.

349
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,558
- Well then, may I?
- Well...

350
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,926
We're almost out of time, so...

351
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,048
What are we, camping?
I need to pee.

352
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:48,109
What's the big deal? I'm very clean.
I won't messy your bathroom.

353
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,426
I prefer my patients to use the...

354
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,493
But you said that the toilet overflowed.

355
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,414
Why don't we just finish up for today?

356
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,578
I can owe you the 10 minutes
when you come back next week.

357
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,431
What, you're afraid
your wife will see me?

358
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,784
Or that I'll see her?

359
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,286
Is she even home now?

360
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:22,773
I mean, what is she sitting on the couch
with rollers in her hair drinking beer?

361
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:26,355
- This has nothing to do with my wife.
- Fine, forget it,

362
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,272
if it freaks you out that much.

363
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:34,409
Well...

364
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:38,059
I bet that didn't come
up in med school, did it?

365
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,386
"What to do in the following situation.

366
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:46,086
"A patient in love with the therapist
asks to use the bathroom.

367
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:47,803
"The bathroom is out of order.

368
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,829
"The patient then asks
to enter the therapist's home.

369
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,918
- "What should the therapist do?"
- I'm sorry if...

370
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,785
The correct answer is it depends

371
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,429
on what the therapist
feels towards his patient.

372
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:03,911
- I can see you might interpret this...
- Don't interpret, Paul.

373
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:07,188
I've had it up to here
with your fucking interpretations.

374
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:13,355
You know what kills me?

375
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,591
No matter what I say or do,

376
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,652
you see everything as more proof
that nothing is going on here.

377
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:21,892
You turn me into a 15-year-old
who isn't taken seriously,

378
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:26,317
a silly little girl who people just pat
on the head and say, "Isn't she cute?"

379
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:29,322
You know, the...
- Stop patronizing me, Paul.

380
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,719
Look, I know when I turn somebody on.

381
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,072
You know what thought of you
the first time I saw you?

382
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,764
- What?
- I thought you looked like a dead man.

383
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,228
I thought...

384
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:04,629
beneath that professional exterior
is a man who stopped living.

385
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,714
I wanted to take your heart
in my hands

386
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:11,782
and just pump life into it.

387
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:20,035
Maybe that's your sense of...

388
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:25,536
Of what happens to married people,
that they just stop living.

389
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:30,047
Maybe you're afraid that's
what'll happen if you marry Andrew.

390
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:34,631
Just my being here
has brought you back to life.

391
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,135
- Laura, let's...
- Yeah.

392
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:42,987
I knew you'd deny it.

393
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,828
I mean, how could something
like this happen to you, huh?

394
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:48,106
But it did happen.

395
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:50,195
I know it happened
and you know it happened.

396
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:53,373
- What happened, Laura?
- Me and you, Paul. We happened.

397
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,711
The thoughts you have before you fall
asleep next to your wife happened.

398
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,449
I think we're out of time for today.

399
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,359
Why don't we talk about this
next week when you...

400
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:08,867
When you come back?

401
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,833
Just tell me.

402
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,142
I think you owe it to me.

403
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,896
Do you want me?

404
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:48,744
Just a simple yes or no.

405
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:53,777
No.
