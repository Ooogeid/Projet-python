1
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:02,783
Previously on "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:05,624
i really don't remember what happened.

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,809
I was on my bicycle

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,611
And a car ran into me and--

5
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,199
What did they tell you afterwards?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,467
That i flew my bike right into the street.

7
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,522
They told me that i needed

8
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,073
the opinion of a psychiatrist

9
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:15,703
Because

10
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,464
the insurance company of the car that hit me

11
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:18,735
Has a problem with my injuries.

12
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,283
How do you get on with your dad?

13
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,127
|| He's the only person in this world

14
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,560
Who truly loves me.

15
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:25,826
The only one except Cy.

16
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,000
Who's Cy?

17
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,196
This is Cy.

18
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,702
He's my coach.

19
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:46,457
Hello?

20
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:48,610
Sophie

21
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,229
Stop the car.
Calm down.

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,762
I wanna get out!

23
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:53,254
- Did you hear what i said?

24
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,511
- Just calm down.

25
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,317
I wanna walk. - It's pouring.

26
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:57,682
I don't care if it's raining.

27
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,763
I wanna walk!
No,

28
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:00,923
it's too far to walk. - Fine!

29
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:01,997
Sophie.

30
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,506
Sophie.

31
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:43,629
Aare you-- - I'm fine.

32
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,048
I'm fine.

33
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:53,862
Cy says you have to experience the rain, so,

34
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,469
Ii've experienced it.

35
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,369
I'll get you some dry clothes.

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,556
I'm fine.

37
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:00,559
Really?

38
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,778
Are you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable if--

39
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:05,426
Wait a second.

40
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,123
Here we go.

41
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,219
- Are they your daughter's?

42
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,176
Did you ask her if it was okay?

43
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:38,138
No, but i'm sure she won't mind.

44
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,028
I'll put yours in the dryer

45
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,054
And they'll be ready by the end of the session.

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,461
Well, you'll have to help me.

47
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:48,895
I haven't got dressed on my own

48
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:50,457
since my accident.

49
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,351
Are you gonna help me here or not?

50
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:00,836
Did you ever hear of an umbrella,

51
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,326
kiddo? My goodness.

52
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:08,517
Sweetheart, look at you.

53
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:11,008
You're just all skin and bones, aren't you?

54
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:14,203
Okay, i will have these dry for you

55
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:16,021
Before you leave.

56
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,472
How on earth do you manage

57
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:22,150
with two broken arms?
I don't.

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,055
What, one arm wasn't enough for you, huh?

59
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,141
Okay.

60
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,293
You know, i broke my arm

61
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,149
when i was 12 and i was roller-Skating.

62
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,626
And the best thing about it

63
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,353
was that i got to whack my little brother

64
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:39,218
In theead with my cast when he was bugging me,

65
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,341
Which was pretty much all the time.

66
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,094
All right, let's do your shoes.

67
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,313
|| She's cool.

68
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:00,477
- Kate? - Yeah.

69
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,782
She's awesome.

70
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,426
True.

71
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,887
You could learn a lot from your wife

72
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,718
About how to talk to people.

73
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:21,448
Wish i could take her with me to the gym.

74
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,750
She could tell everyone the truth to their faces.

75
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:26,167
Who do you want her to tell the truth to?

76
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,318
Did you write my evaluation?

77
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,269
No.

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,970
Did you?
What the fuck?!

79
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:35,578
Why didn't you?

80
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,985
That's why i'm here.

81
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,618
That's all i need from you,

82
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,695
That stupid evaluation.

83
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,198
Actually, i don't think i know you

84
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,785
quite well enough

85
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,716
Yet, Sophie.

86
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,760
So why didn't you write yours?

87
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,443
Well, i tried

88
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,526
With my dad, but,

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,455
But he's too busy with his exhibition.

90
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:06,067
He's an artist? - A photographer.

91
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,838
He hates the word "artist."

92
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,726
He always has his exhibitions at home

93
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,836
Because he's against galleries.

94
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,563
Anyway,

95
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,266
he said it was totally unprofessional

96
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,231
For me to write my own evaluation

97
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,043
And that you sound like a quack.

98
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,580
Are you a quack?

99
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,629
No, i am not a quack.

100
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,085
I promise.

101
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,012
And then i tried to write it with my mom.

102
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,570
That didn't work--

103
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,268
Obviously.

104
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,967
Why do you say obviously?

105
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:48,051
Because she's a total tool

106
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:49,694
and a retard.

107
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,012
A tool and a retard?

108
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,414
Yeah.

109
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,057
We got in a fight.
And i was like,

110
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,313
"i so do not need this right now."

111
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,047
So i left.

112
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,834
I went to this apartment near the gym

113
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,599
Where the foreign girls stay.

114
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,614
I told them my parents were going out of town, so,

115
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,204
they let me crash there.

116
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:20,743
And then i tried to get Cy

117
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:21,988
to help me write it,

118
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:23,481
But he's too busy getting everyone

119
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,018
ready to leave for training camp, so,

120
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:27,760
So i didn't do it.

121
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,383
So why did you and your mom get into a fight

122
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:35,192
Trying to write the evaluation together?

123
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:38,377
She actually wanted to write it for me.

124
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,857
And i was like, "no, mom, i can do it myself."

125
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,842
And she was like, "we'll be here

126
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,487
until the next olympics."

127
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,332
And i was like, "bite me."

128
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,069
- So i left.

129
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,348
So you didn't want her to write it.

130
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,420
You just

131
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,363
wanted her to help you,

132
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:53,150
- What, phrase it? - It doesn't matter.

133
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,174
We got in a fight, for a change.

134
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,459
But this time, Sophie,

135
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,346
You left home.

136
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,116
So?
- Have you done that before?

137
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:07,253
- No.
So something was different

138
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:09,462
about this particular fight.

139
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,514
What do yothink it was that was different?

140
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,832
Did you-- Did you come from home

141
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,984
Or did you come from the gym today?

142
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,590
- The gym. - Gym-- Is that far away?

143
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,170
That's why i was late.

144
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,429
Sophie,

145
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,299
Before you arrived, i, uh--

146
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:38,665
I got a phone call, and, um,

147
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,825
i heard you asking somebody

148
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,645
To let you out of the car.

149
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,799
well, i--
I tried to call you

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,785
to tell you i was on my way,

151
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,392
But, um, then i figured

152
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,814
That we were like five minutes away, so...

153
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,392
i thought i hung up

154
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,895
before the call went through.

155
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,201
Was that your father?

156
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:01,833
You could've hung up, you know?

157
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,436
Or do you always eavesdrop

158
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,140
on other people's conversations?

159
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,346
Sophie, if you were my patient,

160
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,392
i'd ask if you thought

161
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:08,636
It was a coincidence that i

162
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,117
overheard that conversation.

163
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,545
But i'm not your patient.

164
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:12,825
I wouldn't see a therapist

165
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,548
Who i thought was an eavesdropper.

166
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,051
I'd be out of here.

167
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,637
So did your dad bring you in?

168
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:21,317
I told you, i had a fight with him!

169
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,403
I thought you said the fight was with your mom.

170
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,005
It's really none of your business

171
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:27,497
who i came here with.

172
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:38,239
Earlier on you said that you'd like

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,382
Kate to go to the gym with you.

174
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:42,875
What would you like Kate to,

175
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,837
to tell the girls at the gym?

176
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,768
Your daughter's clothes are gross.

177
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:55,132
- Why is that funny?

178
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,775
Well, why are they gross?
They're hideous.

179
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,249
Okay.

180
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:07,423
I'm really not getting my

181
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,326
evaluation today, am i?

182
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:13,887
This is stupid.

183
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,440
I should go. Are my clothes dry yet?

184
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:20,063
I wouldn't think so.
Well, can you check?

185
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:23,852
And call Kate, because i need her

186
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,709
to help me put them back on.

187
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,187
You people are such tools.

188
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,537
I can't believe you get paid for this.

189
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:38,684
Why didn't you tell me before

190
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:40,588
that you heard my conversation?

191
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,953
I was waiting for you to tell me.

192
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,105
So now i'm a liar too?

193
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,255
I di't say you were a liar, Sophie.

194
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,172
It's what you're thinking.

195
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:01,052
Why do you need Kate to go to the gym with you?

196
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,610
I don't need her to.

197
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,783
Can i ask you something?

198
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,584
How do you get along with the girls at the

199
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,167
at the gym?
They're assholes, okay?

200
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:12,764
All of them.

201
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:15,712
The whole place, it reeks of hypocrisy.

202
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:17,895
Did you know, like, every girl there is

203
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,044
a Mia or an Anna except me?

204
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,283
They know it.

205
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,232
They just don't do anything about it.

206
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,629
- They encourage it.

207
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:27,437
These girls, Anna and Mia,

208
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:28,998
Are they friends of yours?

209
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,156
You don't know these girls?

210
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:34,767
They're fun girls, especially Anna.

211
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,033
Rexic?

212
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,826
Anorexic.

213
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,138
Okay. And Mia, bulimia?

214
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,949
You're sharp as a tack.

215
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,670
Thank you.

216
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,613
So the girls at the gym
Are anorexic or bulimic

217
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:52,647
except for you?

218
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:54,830
You can't keep your weight down otherwise.

219
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,767
And if you're not skinny you can't compete, so,

220
00:10:57,873 --> 00:10:59,435
So you have no choice, you have to.

221
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:01,045
But who says you can't compete?

222
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,544
Cy and Regina.

223
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,316
Regina is our physical trainer.

224
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,522
All the girls follow Cy around

225
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,742
like little groupie sluts.

226
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,242
"Cy, was that okay?"

227
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:16,685
"Cy, can you show me how to do that move?"

228
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,644
"Cy, i'm about to fall. Quick,

229
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,829
put your hands between my legs."

230
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,638
But not Regina
'Cause she's russian.

231
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,621
So her bullshit detector is like nuclear.

232
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,817
And at the end of the day

233
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,957
Cy and Regina decide everhing--

234
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,164
Who competes,

235
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,277
who's gained weight and can't compete.

236
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,688
After my accident,

237
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,342
Karen Scott and Audrey England

238
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:43,799
came to visit me.

239
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:47,232
They had these pathetic looks on their faces, like,

240
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,052
Like they felt my pain.

241
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,213
But i knew they were happy.

242
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,582
I would have been happy if something

243
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,757
had happened to one of them

244
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,330
Right before the olympic tryouts.

245
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,405
Honestly,

246
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,654
If it was me,

247
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:03,028
I would have done what Shirley did.

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,003
She didn't even come.

249
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,154
Me and her, we're like the best

250
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,752
ones there by far.

251
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,218
It was like she was saying,

252
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,014
"drop dead for all i care.

253
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:13,987
Just get out of my face."

254
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,556
At least that's honest.

255
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:27,309
So they're leaving tomorrow

256
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,657
For training camp in California

257
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,498
And i have nowhere to go.

258
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:32,671
They won't let me stay

259
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,504
at the apartment by myself.

260
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,332
They promised Cy i could go,

261
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:37,740
Even though i can't train.

262
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,528
And now he says they've changed their minds.

263
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,149
- Who's they? - The sponsors--

264
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,633
The money people.

265
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,609
Anyway,

266
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,444
I picked a fight with him.

267
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:53,092
That's what you heard on the phone.

268
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:54,764
It wasn't his fault.

269
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,450
Why is it so important for you

270
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,860
to go with them?

271
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,633
To the camp?

272
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:10,977
Everyone will be there.

273
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:15,219
You mean, Karen, Audrey and Shirley?

274
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,272
But-- But you said you can't stand them.

275
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:19,800
You said you don't even like them.

276
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,802
And you can't train anyway, so,

277
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:22,753
i don't understand why

278
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:25,396
it's so important to you.
It's not important.

279
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,840
But i was looking forward to it.

280
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,549
Sounds like, um...

281
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,956
you and Cy are, uh--

282
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,514
- You're very close. - No.

283
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,487
Why? Can you tell that over the phone?

284
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,736
You said he wanted to take you to camp

285
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,756
Despite the fact that you had an injury, and,

286
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,496
didn't he-- Didn't he drive you here?

287
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,977
It was on his way.

288
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:54,865
He wants me to come to the camp

289
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,874
to at least watch the training

290
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,710
So i don't lose focus.

291
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,559
But no.

292
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,133
He couldn't make them pay for Darlene either.

293
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,247
- Darlene? - Cy's wife.

294
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:08,359
She has to pay her own way and Dana's too.

295
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,017
Dana is the little girl you used to babysit?

296
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,843
Why did you stop?

297
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,427
Who told you i stopped?

298
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:19,897
Did i tell you that last week?

299
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,066
You have good memory for an old fart.

300
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,091
Thank you.

301
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,790
So why did you stop?

302
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,945
They didn't need me anymore.

303
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,254
Dana used to have all these

304
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:37,228
breathing problems, but,

305
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,669
then she had this surgery

306
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,196
and they got better, and,

307
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,075
And darlene came back from Wisconsin

308
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,359
Where she was like

309
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,691
learning to process her own

310
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:46,688
cheese or something, so,

311
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,201
So they didn't need me.

312
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,226
Did you work there for a long time?

313
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:53,269
No.

314
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:55,864
Sort of.

315
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:58,048
And Dana must have become very fond of you.

316
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,787
Did she become attached to you?

317
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,942
Yeah.

318
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,371
She's the cutest.

319
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:05,385
She hasn't stopped talking

320
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,159
about me since i left.

321
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,852
She said she doesn't want to go to California

322
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:11,813
If i'm not going to be there.

323
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:16,559
They told her that i wouldn't

324
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,474
be able to babysit her anymore

325
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,655
'Cause i'd had this accident.

326
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,562
But see, i'd already told her before

327
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,628
That i couldn't keep living with them

328
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,320
once her mom came home.

329
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:30,163
- I waed to prepare her, you know?

330
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,324
But they didn't tell me

331
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,039
what they were telling her, so,

332
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:35,458
the whole lie became mixed up in her head.

333
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,039
- What?

334
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:43,022
- What?
You look scared all of a sudden.

335
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:45,708
I look scared?

336
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,694
Like you're looking at a psycho
or something.

337
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:48,832
I was just remembering that

338
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,853
the last time you were here you put your--

339
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:53,360
Your casts together. Do you you remember?

340
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,462
And you said,

341
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,376
"this is Cy."

342
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:00,326
Yeah, the mermaid that he drew.

343
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,699
You said that when Darlene came home

344
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,919
You knew you couldn't keep on living there.

345
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:10,040
I never said i lived there.

346
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,330
But you told dana you wouldn't

347
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:13,210
be able to go on living there.

348
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,818
Yeah, because she's a child

349
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,782
But, so it felt to her like i lived there.

350
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:20,948
It was just,

351
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,273
'Cause she'd go to school and,

352
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,299
come back and i'd be there, and,

353
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,046
you know, she got used to me being around.

354
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,116
So

355
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,887
even when he was home she'd nt me to stay--

356
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,966
Cook them dinner, do her homework with her.

357
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,106
Sometimes she'd wake up screaming

358
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:40,261
Because she stopped breathing in her sleep.

359
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,354
Cy told me that.

360
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,631
What the hell is going on here?

361
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:52,406
What do you mean,

362
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,628
what the hell is going on here?

363
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:55,258
My dad was right. I'll go to therapy

364
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,109
And i'll end up a psycho

365
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,413
Just like your daughter.

366
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,249
Everyone thinks she's a freak.

367
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,344
Are you trying to hurt me, Sophie? No.

368
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,390
But you should know what people say about her.

369
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,476
She had this thing with this guy

370
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:09,813
And afterwards

371
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,516
everyone says she'd turned out psycho

372
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,455
'Cause her dad is a shrink.

373
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:16,429
Shrinks' kids are psycho. Everyone knows that.

374
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,156
Well, maybe that's because--

375
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,975
Because some people are afraid of therapy.

376
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:27,347
They're afraid of what they might find out.

377
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,865
They're afraid that it might

378
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,934
touch those wounds

379
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,070
That are deep inside them.

380
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:36,967
I think there are things that...

381
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,753
perhaps...

382
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,366
you feel deep inside,

383
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,092
Sophie, that you'd like to talk about.

384
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,344
I'm fine.

385
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:46,316
You wanna worry about a little girl?

386
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,844
Worry about your own kid.

387
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:48,948
Does it bother you that people

388
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,523
talk about my daughter?

389
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,369
Why would it bother me?

390
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,261
Because maybe you know what it feels like.

391
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,899
- Maybe i don't. - We were talking

392
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,391
about your coach
And then suddenly

393
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,012
you brought up the story of my daughter.

394
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,009
Yeah, because i thought you should know.

395
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:03,885
Are there people who say things

396
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,472
about you, Sophie?

397
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,751
At the gym maybe?

398
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,214
You know, Sophie, sometimes

399
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,824
when people are jealous

400
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,241
They say things to hurt us

401
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,773
Because they envy us.

402
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:18,542
Do you think that some

403
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:21,120
of the girls at the gym might be

404
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,017
jealous of you, and,

405
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:27,604
how close your relationship is with Cy?

406
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,895
Don't talk to me like i'm a child, please.

407
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,046
Fair enough.

408
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:38,559
Sophie, i get the feeling that you're afraid

409
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,992
To tell me something that

410
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,414
other people say about you.

411
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:43,086
Are my clothes dry yet?

412
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,519
Can you go check?

413
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,375
If i won't be getting an evaluation today

414
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,468
I'd at least like dry clothes.

415
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:53,451
Okay.
Well, i have started to write it.

416
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,436
Can i see what you've got?

417
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:58,445
I'm, uh-- I'm not quite finished yet.

418
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll bet you haven't written a word.

419
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:25,563
"Sophie's evaluation:

420
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,836
16 years old, a gymnast.

421
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,888
She is an olympic hopeful.

422
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:33,708
She came in for evaluation

423
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,037
After a near-fatal accident.

424
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,442
During first session appears to be

425
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,801
Very impressive,

426
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,253
sensitive,

427
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,683
Mature for her age,

428
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,756
Very intelligent

429
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,870
And a highly-Independent personality."

430
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,709
I tried to write it...

431
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,556
with my mom but--

432
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,848
We didn't fight. I just said "never mind."

433
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,150
Do you really think those things you wrote?

434
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:33,471
Absolutely.

435
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,456
They're just generalities at the moment.

436
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,500
It's not enough for a real evaluation.

437
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,234
You know,

438
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,379
This morning i tried to brush
my teeth

439
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:55,882
like you.

440
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,411
- Like me?

441
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,186
Like--

442
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,403
- How'd it go?

443
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:05,908
- I couldn't do it.

444
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,337
I just stick it in there.

445
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,200
Why'd you try that?

446
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:18,868
'Cause i wanted to know how it feels.

447
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,981
How did it feel?

448
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:22,809
I felt useless,

449
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,236
Like demeaned or something.

450
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,305
I'm homeless.

451
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:37,565
I have nowhere to go.

452
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,005
What about your dad?

453
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:42,378
I told you, i had a fight with him.

454
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:45,769
Not a real fight, but he pissed me off.

455
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,833
He knows how much i wanted

456
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,278
to go to that training camp with them

457
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:51,394
And he didn't even offer to pay.

458
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,585
I wouldn't have taken his money anyway.

459
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:58,646
Obviously, the exhibitions are expensive, but--

460
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,182
Why is it so important for you

461
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:01,921
to go to this camp, Sophie?

462
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,545
It's not important...

463
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,719
anymore.

464
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,557
How do you get along with Cy's wife?

465
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,618
Fine.

466
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,344
I don't wanna talk about t em.

467
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:24,859
Okay.

468
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:27,700
When you're ready, we will.

469
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:31,788
You know, when you walked in here

470
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:33,818
I thought to myself

471
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,219
Somebody in your life has broken the rules.

472
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:41,365
And i felt that,

473
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:42,702
That if i had helped you

474
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:44,030
change your clothes,

475
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,768
That i would have been doing the same thing.

476
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,110
I felt like you were

477
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:51,259
testing me.

478
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,384
I felt like you wanted to make sure

479
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,311
That this was a safe place,

480
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:57,765
That the same things that happen out there

481
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:00,038
Don't happen in here.

482
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:18,481
Right when the accident happened...

483
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,017
i don't remember anything, but,

484
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:24,976
But right afterwards

485
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,642
I remember the whole world was silent.

486
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,209
Not just silent, soundless.

487
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:34,760
You know, like there had never been

488
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,440
any noise ever,

489
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,122
Not even that hum that you hear

490
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:39,778
when you're in an empty room.

491
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,916
Nothing.

492
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,821
Even inside the ambulance,

493
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,210
People were talking and it was like--

494
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:50,452
It was like i'd gone deaf.

495
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:53,366
I felt relieved.

496
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,436
I thought that i would never have to listen

497
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,115
To anybody ever again.

498
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,691
Sound came back though,

499
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:05,063
At first from r away.

500
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,686
The E.M.T., she kept saying,

501
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:08,995
"I have to hear your voice.

502
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:11,062
I have to hear your voice, sweetheart."

503
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:14,010
She wanted my parents' phone numbers.

504
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,956
She wanted them to come meet me

505
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,730
when i got to the hospital.

506
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,674
There was no way.

507
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,390
They can't even sit in the

508
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,410
same section at my meets.

509
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,884
I have to wave to two different

510
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:29,727
spots after my routine.
I look schizo.

511
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,989
I tried to sit up.

512
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,111
I told the emt that i wanted

513
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:39,355
to see the outside. Why ?

514
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,460
You know, when you see an ambulance

515
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:44,371
Tearing down the street, you turn and look.

516
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,125
Well, i wanted to see what it was like

517
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:49,222
Being on the inside looking out.

518
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:52,073
You know, seeing people's faces

519
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,906
on the sidewalk
Wondering,

520
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,099
"who's in there?
Is she going to be okay?"

521
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,327
I couldn't sit up.

522
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,533
The E.M.T.,
She had this mirror

523
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,696
that she tried to angle

524
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,423
So that i could see out,

525
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,984
But all i could see was myself.

526
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,787
And i remember thinking,

527
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,818
"both arms, Sophie?

528
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:16,016
Did it have to be both arms, you idiot?"

529
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,874
Our time is up.

530
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,153
Okay.

531
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,508
We'll, um--

532
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:41,279
We'll take it up there

533
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:43,749
When you come back next week.

534
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,460
You're n going to training camp

535
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,210
with everyone else in the universe?

536
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,223
I'll go get your clothes

537
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,384
And call Kate.

538
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:05,374
He didn't offer you a cup of tea even?

539
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:10,749
Are you su that doesn't hurt?

540
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:15,998
All right, you,

541
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,470
Arms way up.

542
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,439
Okay.
