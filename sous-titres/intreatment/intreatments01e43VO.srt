1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:02,423
Previously on In Treatment...

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:06,114
You've been fighting me
for two months,

3
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:08,712
saying Laura, Laura, Laura.

4
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:11,909
And you've been waiting
for this imaginary Gina of yours

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,383
to give you her blessing.

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,804
I'm not what's stopping you.

7
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:19,890
You're fighting yourself.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,366
Maybe you can only be
the Paul you want to be

9
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:24,394
with her.

10
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:26,516
So, go to her...

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:28,885
find out.

12
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:50,161
Hey, it's Laura.
I'm not in right now...

13
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,407
Hey, it's Laura.
I'm not in right now,

14
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:09,272
but if you leave your name and number,
I'll call you back.

15
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,548
Laura, it's...

16
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:13,873
It's Paul. Are you there?

17
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,236
I guess you're not.

18
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:22,535
I'd really like to talk to you.

19
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,152
<i>I know that you're upset, and...</i>

20
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,042
<i>I understand that I've hurt you.</i>

21
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,754
And believe me when I say
that was the last thingI wanted to do.

22
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,180
<i>And I suppose I should hear what</i>

23
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:38,855
<i>you're saying to me
with your silence...</i>

24
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,101
You're there.

25
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,080
Yes, I'm here.

26
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,100
Are you okay?

27
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,580
Yes, I'm okay.

28
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,303
<i>- I've been leaving messages and...</i>
- Yeah, I know you have.

29
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,561
I'd really like to see you.

30
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,662
I think we should talk.

31
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,829
Where do you wanna meet?

32
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,640
Come to my house.
You have the address?

33
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,133
Yes, I do.

34
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,713
What are you doing?
You're watching me sleep.

35
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,219
Are you going out?

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,243
I'm gonna see Laura.

37
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,894
It's weird to beopening a door for you.
I'm used to the other way around.

38
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,776
- You sound sick.
- It's just a cold.

39
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,815
I'm over the worst of it.

40
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:47,692
- Probably look like shit.
- You look great.

41
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,282
You're such a liar. Come in.

42
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,217
Can I take your coat?

43
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,375
You cut your hair?

44
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,973
I guess I remember it longer.

45
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:19,835
- It's quite a place you have here.
- Andrew did the decorating.

46
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,280
It was a mess when we met
and then it became this.

47
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,838
- Because of your influence.
- Oh yeah, right.

48
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,260
He was always cleaning up after me.

49
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,164
Well, it's

50
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:36,288
- quite a place.
- Don't look in any of the closets.

51
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:42,548
Those are the chairs
that Andrew reupholstered, remember?

52
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,747
I think I told you about those.

53
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,417
- Weird being in a patient's house?
- You're not a patient.

54
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,368
Is this how you imagined it?

55
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,980
I don't know whatI imagined, really.

56
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,120
Smaller, perhaps.

57
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,718
More bright colors.

58
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:11,366
Did you see this exhibition?

59
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:15,713
No, I tried but the lines were insane,
so I just bought the poster.

60
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,290
- Did you see it?
- Yeah. It was amazing.

61
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,846
It was a bit of a zoo.

62
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,765
Not the optimal way to look at art.

63
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,171
Anyway, we...

64
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,487
We tackled our way through it.

65
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:36,421
Do you want something to drink?

66
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,209
Water would be great.

67
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,414
Do you need me to give you a hand?

68
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,819
For a glass of water?
I think I can manage.

69
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:21,184
Are you sure just water? A friend of
mine came by and stocked my fridge.

70
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:25,280
I got juice, mineral water,
some amazing chicken soup.

71
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,817
No thanks. It's okay.

72
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,445
Rack of lamb, maybe?

73
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,617
So, have you seen Andrew?

74
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,981
Are you on speaking terms?

75
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,792
Yeah. Actually he's the one
who came by with the soup.

76
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,903
You know how things are,
one thing led to another

77
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,134
and the next thing you know
we were...

78
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,404
My friend Jeremy

79
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,835
came over and brought the food.

80
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,717
Orthopedic surgeon.

81
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:02,810
He's gay.

82
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,243
No, he seems fine.

83
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,847
Resigned...

84
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:14,965
Or is it relieved?

85
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,286
I was kidding before

86
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,827
- about Andrew. I'm sorry.
- I know that.

87
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,913
Have you been upset with me?

88
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:24,827
Not upset...

89
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,336
Frustrated.

90
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,515
I just don't know what I am to you.

91
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,931
I'm not your lover.

92
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:43,308
I'm not your girlfriend.

93
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,977
I'm not your patient.

94
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,917
The truth is that I don't really know
who we are to each other.

95
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:54,573
Let's decide,

96
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,898
once and for all.

97
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:03,899
I know what I want.

98
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,951
Is this a test, Paul?

99
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,967
Like the last one?

100
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:13,631
Because I don't think I can survive
two of those in one lifetime.

101
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,500
I love you, Laura.

102
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:23,166
You were right
about wanting to talk in person.

103
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,003
It's not something you leave
on an answering machine.

104
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:33,234
Of course, I've done that.
I actually broke into a guy's apartment

105
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,203
- and tried to erase it...
- I'm not going to take it back.

106
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,564
You can't really know that, can you?

107
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,373
You don't believe me.

108
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,784
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,662
Is it because I haven't left home?

110
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,847
Home. Well...

111
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:51,984
That's not really something
you should do on my account.

112
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,759
I understand that you

113
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,897
would be viewing this with...

114
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,348
- With caution.
- Don't explain to me what I'm doing.

115
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,735
So what changed?

116
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,619
I guess I just realized what...

117
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,038
What I was gonna lose.

118
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,001
I haven't seen you for two weeks...

119
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:35,037
I haven't spoken to you or seen you,
heard from you.

120
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,739
- No, that'll pass.
- No, it won't.

121
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:40,048
With time... yes it will.
You'll get over me, Paul. Trust me.

122
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:41,551
You don't understand, Laura.

123
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,281
I don't want to get over you.

124
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,714
I know
that you took my indecision...

125
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:03,097
I'm done with therapy. I'm done.

126
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,914
Don't tell me where my head is at,

127
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:09,247
or claim that everything you're saying
to me is for my protection.

128
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,461
And what happened about that anyway?
You were so worried that I was

129
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,178
repeating old patterns with you,
that I was...

130
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,280
using sex
to bail out of my relationships.

131
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,719
- You're not worried about that anymore?
- No.

132
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,418
You haven't been calling me back.

133
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:32,747
You're setting limits for
the first time. You're taking a stand.

134
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,063
You're thinking things through.

135
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,649
This is all you.

136
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:41,147
So by walking away from you
is proof that I'm ready to be with you?

137
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,906
How should I prove that I'm over you,
give you the key to my house?

138
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,668
Are you?

139
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,584
Are you over me?

140
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:02,925
No, I'm not.

141
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,250
But I don't wanna be happy in
the moment anymore, I want it to last.

142
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,647
I don't wanna be the fantasy that...

143
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,993
The cure to a marriage
that ran out of steam,

144
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:22,290
or a job that became routine. It's...

145
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,114
- It's just too much pressure.
- Maybe you're afraid that...

146
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:32,322
I know this is what you thrive on,
all this back-and-forth stuff, but...

147
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,086
Let's not talk.

148
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:40,966
What happens if you just don't talk?

149
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,679
You don't really want this, Paul.

150
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,399
Do you?

151
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:09,866
I do.

152
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,514
- What's the matter?- Sorry for...

153
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:03,014
- I'm sorry for barging in like this...
- No no. Come in.

154
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,315
- Are you sure?
- Oh, sure. Come in.

155
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,732
What happened?

156
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,681
I saw Laura today.

157
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:22,714
I've been trying to reach her
since Alex's funeral.

158
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:26,771
She hasn't been returning my calls.
Do you mind if I sit down?

159
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,981
You saw each otherat Alex's funeral?

160
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:32,814
Yeah. So I've been calling her

161
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,094
and finally she picked up

162
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,247
and she said...

163
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,977
"Why don't you don't you come over?"

164
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,604
So I went over there to tell her that

165
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,480
I was through

166
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,247
with driving us both crazy,

167
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,581
and that I loved her and that...

168
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,058
I was ready to be...

169
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:02,902
To be with her.

170
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,293
Your worst fear realized, Gina.

171
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,713
This isn't about me, Paul.

172
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:12,499
What happened?

173
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,180
She didn't believe me.

174
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,226
Anyway, we... We ended up...

175
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,391
in the bedroom.

176
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:32,194
Wait, she said she didn't believe you
and you ended up in the bedroom?

177
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,147
Anyway, I...

178
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,480
I didn't do anything.

179
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:44,375
I couldn't.

180
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,714
You couldn't?

181
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,335
You mean, you couldn't respond?

182
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:52,214
I had a fucking
a fucking anxiety attack.

183
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,636
Like a teenage kid...
A fucking anxiety attack.

184
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,399
Unbelievable.

185
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,181
What was that like?

186
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,600
Like I was

187
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,491
suffocating, heart pounding,
drenched in sweat.

188
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:09,297
It was that classic textbook
panic attack.

189
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,918
Did you talk to her about it?
What was happening to you?

190
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,115
It was sex, Gina. It wasn't...

191
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,617
It wasn't like it was a session.
I got out of there

192
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,265
as fast as I could.

193
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,480
But it was too late.
By the time it took...

194
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,491
for me to make up my mind
about both of us,

195
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,046
she'd changed hers.

196
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:35,514
She changed her mind
but you're the one that ran out.

197
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,386
No, she said
she didn't want it anymore.

198
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,259
I'm confused about...

199
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:45,080
Just take a breath
and start at the beginning.

200
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,684
Yeah. You know what?

201
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,724
It doesn't matter anyway.

202
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,781
It's not like
we're gonna be together.

203
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,399
I couldn't...

204
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,957
I couldn't even bring myself to...

205
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,652
to touch her.

206
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:04,881
She was this close to me.
I could feel the heat from her body.

207
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,781
You know how many times
I thought about that, Gina?

208
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,791
How many times I've imagined that?

209
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:13,128
Next thing I know
I'm doubled over the hood of my car

210
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,414
gasping for air.
What the fuck is wrong with me, Gina?

211
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,749
Nothing's wrong with you.

212
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,847
You see this as a betrayal

213
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,881
as though you sabotaged yourself.
I don't see it that way.

214
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:27,147
Of course not.
For you, it's good news.

215
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,245
You've been telling me
for the last 2 months

216
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:31,247
what a horrible mistake I'm making...

217
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,614
Ruining my life.

218
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:36,262
You should be ready
to open a bottle of champagne.

219
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,976
The last time we met
I said this had to be your decision.

220
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,847
When it came down to it in the end,

221
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:45,414
it didn't have anything
to do with moral questions,

222
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,414
or integrity,
or my marriage, or you.

223
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,668
- What was it then?
- I had this feeling that...

224
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,817
I was going to be swallowed...

225
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:00,339
Swallowed up by all of it.

226
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,680
And that I was gonna lose...

227
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,307
Control.

228
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,517
Anyways, I ran out the door.
I thought of you... All the times that

229
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,175
I said that you were a coward.
Well, who's the coward now?

230
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:28,514
You know, Paul,
that anxiety attack was yours.

231
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,276
It wasn't external. It was you.

232
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:38,718
What restrained you
was the very best of you...

233
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,355
Your deepest standards,

234
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,926
personal and professional and moral.

235
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,314
Moral decisions
don't come from the unconscious.

236
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,881
I'm not gonna let myself
off the hook that easily.

237
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,700
You steered yourself away
from doing something

238
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,581
that you knew you would regret.

239
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,914
You saved yourself from being hurt

240
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,405
and from hurting a woman
that you cared about.

241
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:10,347
What, do you think that moral decisions

242
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:13,829
are always made
in the absence of temptation,

243
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:17,252
that they're made easily,
that they're made gracefully?

244
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,614
Give yourself some credit.

245
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:22,757
If you were able
to make this decision easily,

246
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,695
it would have been a sign

247
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:27,123
that you didn't want her that badly.

248
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,207
But you did.

249
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:32,581
You wanted her so very badly...

250
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,480
So badly that you had
an anxiety attack

251
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,984
in order to stop yourself.

252
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,981
So in the end you won.

253
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,151
You prevailed.

254
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:50,614
Well, thank you for trying
to console me, Gina.

255
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,834
I'm not consoling you.

256
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,447
I just want you to take the credit

257
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:57,547
and the responsibility

258
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,503
for what you did.

259
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,547
You know what she said?

260
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:13,114
She said that she's come to understand
that what she's been doing,

261
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:16,303
using sexual relationships

262
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,856
to free herself from emotional...

263
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:22,526
entanglements, that she doesn't want
to do that anymore.

264
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,081
It's ironic.

265
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:33,280
Her therapy with you
has been a success.

266
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:39,247
She said hat what I was doing

267
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,814
was that I was using her
to bail myself out of my own life...

268
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,847
That actually I was having

269
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,645
a midlife crisis.

270
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,662
Hilarious description.

271
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,515
That's your theory, isn't it?

272
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,747
No, but that doesn't matter now.

273
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,581
It doesn't matter.

274
00:21:58,115 --> 00:22:01,600
You know, what matters,
is that you did the right thing for you

275
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,859
and for your patient.

276
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:08,679
She could be the last...

277
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,544
love of my life.

278
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,276
And I let her go.

279
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,715
What's left for me now, Gina?

280
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,551
We'll have to talk about that.
