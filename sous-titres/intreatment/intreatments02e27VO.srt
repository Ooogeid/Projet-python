1
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,724
So, how was your week?

2
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,216
Fine. How was yours?

3
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,426
It was okay.

4
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:17,729
How you're feeling about your dad?

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,200
- April...
- What?

6
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,701
I'd rather talk about you.

7
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,976
Surprise, sur-fucking-prise.

8
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:27,405
I'm just worried about
what happened last weekend...

9
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:31,021
may have changed our relationship.

10
00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:34,357
We have no relationship.

11
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:41,001
In Treatment, S02E27
April: Week Six

12
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,226
I've dumped people for less than
what you did to me.

13
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,366
Are you thinking of dumping me?

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,880
I don't know what I'm doing here.

15
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:11,322
Maybe you wanted to convey
your anger toward me in person.

16
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:15,658
Maybe I just wanted to get out
of the hospital for a few hours.

17
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,619
Does anybody know that you've left?

18
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,868
Do you think I just hopped
a fence or something?

19
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:26,557
Call the doctors if you like.
You're all such good friends now.

20
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,468
I'm doing fine, so they let me out
for a few hours. I have to...

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,305
check back in tonight.

22
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:39,641
I had to tell her.

23
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:43,645
- Why?
- She's your mother and you were delirious.

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,792
You could have waited until I came out of it.

25
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,686
- And what if you never came out of it?
- Then someone would have called her eventually.

26
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,438
You put me down as your
emergency contact number.

27
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:54,200
- So?
- So you empowered me to make a decision

28
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,116
on your behalf if anything happened to you.

29
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,202
I had a bad fever. It wasn't like
I was in heart f--

30
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,498
You had 105° F. They were packing ice
onto you when I arrived.

31
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,680
I talked to the doctors, Paul.
I know what happened.

32
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:07,981
Really?

33
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,381
I understand that you're angry with me.

34
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,633
I didn't make this decision lightly.

35
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,283
And if I had to do it again,
I would do exactly the same thing.

36
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,201
Wow.

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,943
Has my insurance covered everything?

38
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,500
You don't have to worry about that.

39
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:36,393
Well, I'm leaving and I'm not coming back,

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,533
so if I owe you anything speak now.

41
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,868
April, please, don't go.

42
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:46,457
How could you? It was the one thing,
the one thing that I asked you not to do.

43
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,465
I didn't think it was right
to let you lie there alone

44
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,174
on the brink of death.

45
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,469
You really don't understand, do you?

46
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:59,220
You, you don't understand what you were to me.

47
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:22,410
What did she say... when you called?

48
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,481
At first she...

49
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,774
she just, she just didn't understand, she...

50
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,945
she even didn't know
you were seeing a therapist.

51
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,675
I asked her to meet me at a coffee shop,

52
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,810
so we could discuss it in person, but...

53
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:43,020
she... she refused.

54
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,751
She's paranoid.

55
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,728
I offered her to go to her house.
She hung up and

56
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,278
I called her back and

57
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:53,900
I asked her if she'd meet me
at the hospital in an hour.

58
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:55,568
She showed up?

59
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,613
Are you surprised?

60
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,572
Did you meet her in my room?

61
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,110
No, in the lobby.

62
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:08,706
How did you recognize each other?

63
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:11,013
She looks just like you.

64
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,531
You just...

65
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,939
walked up to her and said,
"Hi, I'm Paul Weston.

66
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,746
"Your daughter has stage-three
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,

67
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,225
"and she's dying on the fourth floor."

68
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:32,819
I explained that you'd come to see me several
weeks ago with the diagnosis of lymphoma

69
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,772
and that you'd begun chemo therapy.

70
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:40,537
What did she say when you said "cancer"?

71
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,220
She seemed...

72
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:45,992
stunned.

73
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,161
Did she cry?

74
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,701
No.

75
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,584
Is she angry -- at me?

76
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,200
Definitely not. No.

77
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:02,587
She hates being the last person
to find something out.

78
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,568
She did have a hard time believing

79
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:09,024
you would keep something like this from her.

80
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,201
What did you say to that?

81
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:13,374
I told her she'd have to speak to you.

82
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:19,027
- How long was this conversation?
- A couple of minutes.

83
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,470
It wasn't me she wanted to see.

84
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,068
She wanted to see you.

85
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,683
I woke up and she was sitting there.

86
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:32,469
I thought...

87
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,933
I thought for a moment that...

88
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,571
I was at home...

89
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,811
and it all had been a bad dream, like...

90
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,534
I was still a child, and...

91
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,009
I was sick, and...

92
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:50,985
my mom was taking care of me...

93
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,511
and I've never grown up, and...

94
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,148
I've never gone to school, and...

95
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:02,067
I've never gotten cancer.

96
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:06,900
I closed my eyes, and...

97
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:10,707
I guess I fell asleep.

98
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,944
When I woke up she was still sitting there...

99
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:20,630
glaring at me, like I had gotten
sick deliberately.

100
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,400
You broke my heart.

101
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,266
Worse than Kyle.

102
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,541
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,308
That was never my intention.

104
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,028
Kyle set me up for coffee last week.

105
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:45,805
He's been harassing me so I finally went
just to shut him up, like,

106
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,438
"I'm still alive, I'm in chemo."

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,471
"Just leave me alone."

108
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,122
He just seemed so young to me.

109
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,254
Like a baby.

110
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,195
I was thinking,

111
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:06,084
"I don't want a boy like you,
I want someone like Paul... a man."

112
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,345
What was it like to see him again?

113
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,053
I don't wanna talk about Kyle.
I brought him up, bec--

114
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:15,810
Fuck it, never mind.

115
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,845
I thought you were a man.

116
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:24,861
So, today, I'm... your betrayer?

117
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,164
But last week you were equally certain
that I was generous and good.

118
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,480
Can you see how dramatically
your opinion of me has changed?

119
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,373
- Yes.
- And can you make sense of that for me?

120
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,376
I guess I never really knew you.

121
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,826
Maybe you're so angry at me you're,

122
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,800
you're having a hard time seeing
this situation from my perspective.

123
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:52,011
- Don't lecture me on empathy.
- I am not talking about empathy,

124
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,307
I'm talking about perspective.

125
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,810
You feel deeply for people
whom you believe are on your team,

126
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,440
because they are, in your mind,
basically extensions of, of yourself.

127
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,300
You feel their pain as if it's your own pain,

128
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,200
but you do have a hard time
understanding someone

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,698
who's approaching from
a different perspective.

130
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,953
You were using your "perspective"
to fuck me over.

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,455
I thought you were in serious trouble,
and your mother deserved to know.

132
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,875
Why? You have no allegiance to her.
You've never met her.

133
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,152
- As a father myself --
- I'll tell you what happened: you got scared.

134
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,613
- You didn't wanna be my emergency contact.
- April, that --

135
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,907
- You didn't want that responsibility.
- April, that is --

136
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:31,530
If I had a patient who asked me
not to call her mother,

137
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,139
- I would never have called her mother!
- You don't have children!

138
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,259
It's so easy to betray you,

139
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,486
it's so easy to let you down.

140
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,071
I make one mistake, not even a mistake,

141
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,203
one decision that you don't agree with,

142
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:54,873
and that's it for you.

143
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,870
I'm worthless because I'm weak.

144
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,101
And that's a quality
you can't accept in others because

145
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:04,919
you can't accept it in yourself.

146
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,077
But you know that nobody can
live up to your standards,

147
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,551
because you can't even live up to them.

148
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,287
This is life, April.

149
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,329
There are days that are just...

150
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,225
classless and cruel.

151
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:22,178
But it is the only life that you've got.

152
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,585
Leah lets me down...

153
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,691
all the time.

154
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,779
How?

155
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,226
Little things...

156
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,421
And she's a flake.

157
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,078
She will show up an hour late or...

158
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,137
forget we made a plan at all.

159
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,337
But that doesn't bother you?

160
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,401
No.

161
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:56,184
And what's special about your
relationship with Leah?

162
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,184
I know she loves me.

163
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,580
She's known me since I was six.

164
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,985
Before I had done anything.

165
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:15,051
So, she loved you when you were a child.

166
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:19,855
She let inside before you'd closed the gates?

167
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,124
- That's so depressing.
- Is it?

168
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,244
To have one person who really
knows who you are?

169
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,307
I used to be really different.

170
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,105
In what way?

171
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,477
I was a total mess,
this really emotional kid.

172
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,982
I would cry at the drop of a hat.

173
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,330
I used to write my parents hate mail

174
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,704
and leave it on their pillows at night.

175
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,460
"Dear mom and dad,

176
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:01,257
"these are all the things
you did today that upset me.

177
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:02,778
"Please respond."

178
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,997
And -- did they respond?

179
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,905
My mother would tell me that I

180
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:12,046
had to get tough...

181
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,618
I couldn't let my emotions show on my face.

182
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:19,701
Yeah.

183
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,519
You know, when I was in...

184
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,463
when I was in grad school,
I had a professor who,

185
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,096
who said something I still remember.

186
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,377
He used to say that,

187
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,477
for better or for worse,

188
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,686
that maturity in modern
American society had become

189
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:43,578
synonymous with a lack of emotions

190
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:46,965
and not feel anything too deeply.

191
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:48,592
That's true.

192
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,301
But some people naturally have

193
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:53,879
more heightened emotional
responses than others.

194
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,304
I think that you're one of those people.

195
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:02,149
So, you've been working hard
to change your nature.

196
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,142
Just... it's probably a futile enterprise.

197
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:09,760
But the continual effort to do that

198
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:15,069
could make you very angry or insecure.

199
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,779
You think I'm insecure?

200
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,231
Do you?

201
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:25,203
There's no good way for me
to answer that question.

202
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,136
If I say no, I'm a narcissist.
And if I say yes, I'm a loser.

203
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,568
Well, the way I see it: if you say no...

204
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:33,942
you're perfect.

205
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,349
If you say yes...

206
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,282
then you're human.

207
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,138
Why do you think your mother told you to

208
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,132
keep your feelings to, to yourself?

209
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,678
She wanted to keep me from getting hurt.

210
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:55,086
Is it possible that it had something
to do with, with Daniel?

211
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,892
What do you mean?

212
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,013
Daniel couldn't control his emotions,

213
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,380
and he became, he became violent
when, when he was upset, you know.

214
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,656
So, maybe a heightened emotional
response from you,

215
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,700
even though it was an appropriate reaction
to a given circumstance,

216
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,375
maybe it reminded your mother of Daniel,

217
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,758
and in some way it scared her.

218
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,767
The world is a messed-up place.

219
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:27,214
She'd -- just try and
teach me to protect myself.

220
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,768
But maybe she didn't give you time

221
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,017
to get to know yourself first,

222
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:37,149
to know who it is that you are protecting.

223
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,362
You think I don't know myself?

224
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:46,075
I think that you've been operating
for a long time in reaction to your mother.

225
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:55,811
At the hospital she was so mad,
she wouldn't even look at me.

226
00:13:56,457 --> 00:14:00,290
She just kept coming in and out of the room,
bossing the doctors around, I just...

227
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,016
I just wanted her to leave.

228
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:05,339
Maybe she wasn't actually angry.

229
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:08,055
Maybe she was scared.

230
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,845
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't?

231
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:14,916
No, Paul, not when I'm hooked up to three IVs.

232
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,133
The only thing that matters in that moment

233
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,546
is that my mother is there
and I can't deal with her.

234
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,781
My dad came by later and...

235
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,629
He was perfect.

236
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,712
Me, I was freezing, so...

237
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,414
he went out and bought me
a down blanket. And...

238
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:41,381
Now whenever he comes
he brings me... something special.

239
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,249
There's this dark chocolate that I love.

240
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,159
Like, weighs a ton.
I never get it for myself.

241
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,090
He brought me some.

242
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:57,696
Then he sat by my bed and held my hand, and...

243
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:03,527
he said, "April, you're a strong girl.
You'll beat this."

244
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:07,804
That's all I need.

245
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:12,232
She's my mother. Why doesn't she know that?

246
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,798
He sounds very calm, your dad.

247
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,002
He can be, under certain circumstances.

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,307
Like -- hospitals?

249
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,869
What are you saying?

250
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:27,927
Well, that's what he does for a living.

251
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,265
It might be easier for your father to give you

252
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:33,513
what you need at the moment
because he's had some practice.

253
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,684
But your mother...

254
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,479
was out of her element.

255
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,153
I don't understand. Are you
for this woman or against her?

256
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,059
April, everything doesn't
have to be black and white.

257
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,669
You're so over me.

258
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:53,968
Sorry?

259
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,652
You're -- so tired of this,

260
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:59,414
you just... want this to be done.

261
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,881
You wanna figure me out, fix my head,

262
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,201
so you can check me off your ledger.

263
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,175
What, what about my behavior
gave you that idea?

264
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,508
- You turned on me.
- How?

265
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:12,263
By calling my mother.

266
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:16,934
Ah, we're back to that again. So, what I did
still doesn't make sense to you?

267
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,233
What are you talking about?

268
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:23,570
For five sessions all I've talked about
is why I can't call my mother.

269
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,569
I was walking down Flatbush Avenue,

270
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,526
burning with fever with a
non-existent immune system,

271
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,156
trying to hail a cab to take me
to the emergency room,

272
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,215
and I still didn't call her.

273
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,454
You pulled rank on me, Paul.

274
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:41,529
You're like, "I've humored
this chick for too long,

275
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,350
"I'm the adult, I'm gonna call the other adult

276
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,216
"so we can figure out how to...

277
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,635
"how to... fuck up the world together."

278
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,755
You don't think of yourself as an adult?

279
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,634
I guess I am.

280
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:01,460
But do you want to be?

281
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,273
Not really.

282
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:11,071
Maybe that's because
you barely had time to be a child.

283
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,746
Your work here is done.

284
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,124
No. Our work here is only beginning.

285
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,785
Well, you're wrong.

286
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:28,043
You can check me off now. I'm in chemo,

287
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,883
my mother knows... whatever.

288
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,461
You keep using the term "check me off".

289
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,628
Does that mean anything to you?

290
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,128
My mother...

291
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,396
used to write a check on the back of my hand

292
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,480
whenever I did a good deed
or aced a test or something.

293
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,841
She said I loved it when I was little.

294
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,663
But something changed as you got older?

295
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,766
I just... felt like she was...

296
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,098
you know, checking me off, like,

297
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:07,236
"April's fine. She's got a check.
Don't need to worry about April."

298
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,383
Got so tired of those goddam checks
I stopped telling her things.

299
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,093
Like what?

300
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,334
I don't know, I'd...

301
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:21,900
I'd raise money for autism research
by running a 10 km.

302
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:23,268
But you wouldn't tell her?

303
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:29,088
She'd find out later from
a teacher or school newspaper.

304
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:31,819
Can you give me another example?

305
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,495
When Leah's mom was dying,
Leah couldn't handle it.

306
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,593
Neither could her dad, so...

307
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,960
I was over at their house
three times a week, helping out, just...

308
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,582
buying groceries, making dinner.

309
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,003
But, again, your mother
didn't know about this.

310
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:53,048
She found out at the funeral.
Leah's dad came up to her.

311
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:57,625
It seems like you wanted your mother
to know these things,

312
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,712
but you didn't wanna tell her.

313
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:03,684
Maybe.

314
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:06,061
And what would happen if she found out?

315
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,358
I always her little hero, her saving grace.

316
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,320
Her perfect child.

317
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,953
April, is it possible that I've become
part of that pattern?

318
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:24,769
- What?
- You got cancer.

319
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:29,494
You decided to fight it alone,
just as you've always done.

320
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:32,389
You didn't tell your mother,
but you came to see me.

321
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:34,077
You told me,

322
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,969
because maybe you knew on some level
that I would eventually tell your mother...

323
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,057
and you would become her hero...

324
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,069
again.

325
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,055
That is so fucked up.

326
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,641
I don't think it is, April.

327
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,987
I think you saved yourself

328
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:54,048
the only way you know how.

329
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,745
I thought that the cancer would
clean me out of all this bullshit.

330
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,264
I thought I would finally stop obsessing

331
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:12,934
over how to be the best at everything, and...

332
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,628
all the reasons I should
hate myself and everyone else.

333
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:19,109
I thought I would...

334
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,344
finally start to think about
the big picture, but...

335
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,981
it's just gotten darker inside my head.

336
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,469
I don't believe in anything any more.

337
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:40,647
I don't believe in love, nor...

338
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:43,622
my mother...

339
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:46,435
nor my body...

340
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:50,590
or you.

341
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,361
Because of all this stupid therapy, I don't...

342
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,140
even believe in myself any more.

343
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:05,789
I literally have no idea why I should
get out of bed in the morning.

344
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,608
That's not a bad place... to begin, April.

345
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,910
Do you remember the dream
that we talked about last week?

346
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,625
The one where I was dying?

347
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,056
Yeah, except that I think that dream
could actually have been about...

348
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:30,406
rebirth...

349
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:33,765
about saying goodbye to the, to the old self

350
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,544
to make room for the new.

351
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:38,080
It could just be dying.

352
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,381
When will you get
the results of the blood test?

353
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:47,817
I told you, end of the week.

354
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,851
Then you'll know for sure
if the chemo is working.

355
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,001
Yeah.

356
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,731
Will you let me know the results
as soon as you get them?

357
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,255
Sure.

358
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,501
Thank you.

359
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:05,762
Are we done here?

360
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:09,912
If you wanna keep on talking...

361
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:13,976
Not really.

362
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,310
Can you help me up?

363
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,347
Sure.
