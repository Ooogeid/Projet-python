<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment.

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:04,874
I ruined their family.

3
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:08,919
Darlene told me before she left
for Wisconsin that she was only going

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,338
because she knew I would be there
to take care of Dana.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,757
She said she didn't trust Cy
but she trusted me.

6
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,095
She trusted me and I ruined it.
One night...

7
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:22,077
It happened.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,811
We almost had sex again
but he said that we had to stop.

9
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:29,295
He said it would ruin both
of our careers if this got out.

10
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:30,441
Just say it.

11
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,403
She tried to kill herself or not.

12
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:33,952
There's a difference

13
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,821
between not being careful

14
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,160
<i>and wanting to commit suicide.</i>

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,542
Hello.

16
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:51,282
Charmed, I'm sure.

17
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,700
It's the middle of the night for me.

18
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,690
I'm utterly exhausted.

19
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:04,457
I was at this amazing party last night.

20
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:06,936
It went on and on.

21
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,849
I stayed awake all night
and then I walked here.

22
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,451
No food, no sleep,

23
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,544
I'm running on empty.

24
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,650
I've never had so much
to drink in my whole life.

25
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,469
There was this guy,
this new guy--

26
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,450
Total eye candy.

27
00:01:28,682 --> 00:01:30,567
He kept walking around
with tequila shots.

28
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,329
He kept making me drink them.

29
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,754
I must've had...

30
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:37,581
I don't know.

31
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,586
I've never been so wrecked
in my whole life.

34
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,639
I have to take them off.
Do you mind?

35
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:09,790
Sure.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,519
You've grown hands.

37
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:15,243
It's crazy how quickly a person
gets used to things.

38
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,904
When I had the casts,
it was like

39
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:20,825
they'd always been a part of me,
you know?

40
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:23,439
Like I'd been born a monster.

41
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:26,807
Now, two days after they're gone,

42
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,050
it's like, "casts?
What casts?"

43
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,339
Can't believe I bought them.

44
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:37,121
I buy shoes basically never,
and when I do...

45
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,864
They make you want to vomit,
don't they?

46
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:52,667
It's your fault I bought them.

47
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,073
Why?

48
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,448
My mom took me shopping last week.

49
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,444
I thought she was trying to be
maternal or something.

50
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,694
Turns out we were only there
because you called her and told her

51
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:08,182
I was gonna off myself.

52
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,643
That's not what I said, Sophie.

53
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:14,314
- Yeah, whatever.
- No, honestly, I never said that.

54
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,126
I said whatever.

55
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,672
Okay.

56
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,779
Anyway, I picked out this jacket,

57
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,333
this army thing that she,
of course, hated.

58
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:29,269
Then as punishment she said
that I had to buy something feminine.

59
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,538
She picked out those barbie shoes

60
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,000
while I pretended
to retch on the makeup counter.

61
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,301
If I had known you'd called her,
I never would've gone shopping.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,609
And then she wonders
why I run off to the gym to be with her.

63
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:48,987
I mean, to be without her.

64
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,145
To get the hell away from her.

65
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:54,817
For my last birthday she gave me a bra.

66
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,700
A bra for my birthday?

67
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,113
It's like getting coal.

68
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,071
It's worse than getting coal.
At least you can burn coal.

69
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:09,737
It was one of those pushy-uppy
wonder things with the clicky wheel.

70
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:10,949
You know?

71
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,337
Half-bra, half-machine.

72
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:18,169
She wants me to be some sort
of a fucking cheerleader.

73
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,196
You want to know why she really hates
that I'm a gymnast?

74
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,916
Because of my boobs.

75
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,388
She thinks it will stunt my development.

76
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,699
"Your boobs won't grow.
You'll hate your body.

77
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:34,727
"You'll be deformed."
That's all she cares about,

78
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,226
whether or not I grow a rack.

79
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,537
So I won't have big boobs,
who gives a flying fuck?

80
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:44,194
Must be pretty hard for you,

81
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,446
trying to avoid your mom all the time.

82
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,309
Just the opposite.

83
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,099
I enjoy it.

84
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,162
Really? Why?

85
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:58,800
A few minutes ago you said
you had to run off to the gym

86
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,335
in order to be with her.

87
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,635
How extraordinary, Dr. Freud.
Whatever do you think I meant?

88
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:13,798
Maybe it means that...

89
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:18,494
no matter what I do,
I can't get rid of her.

90
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,975
Maybe it means that,

91
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,844
in order to keep
her interested in you...

92
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,728
You feel you have to,

93
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,756
run away.

94
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,009
That doesn't even make sense.

95
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,204
You sound like a fortune cookie.

96
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,839
Have you ever worn
shoes like that before?

97
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,217
Oh yeah, all the time.
I mean, don't you?

98
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:53,832
This type of heel raises your butt
and shapes your calf.

99
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,420
And that's essential.

100
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:58,095
I highly recommend
you pick up a pair, Paul.

101
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,132
Must remember to do that.

102
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,150
So why did you wear them last night?

103
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,846
I don't know.

104
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,320
Really?
No idea?

105
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,685
No?

106
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:20,615
They remind me of Dorothy's shoes.

107
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,582
- Who's Dorothy?
- From <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.

108
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,965
You said Dorothy
like she was a friend of yours.

109
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,749
They're nothing like Dorothy's shoes.

110
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,453
Dorothy was cool.
Her shoes were retro.

111
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:39,310
- Oh, no.
- What?

112
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,860
Please don't say,
"there's no place like home."

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,008
'cause if you do, I might have
to puke all over your sofa.

114
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,312
No, at the end, I was going to say
that Dorothy discovers

115
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,948
that she can go home
anytime she wants

116
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,203
with or without her shoes.

117
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,436
Why are you infantilizing me?

118
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,270
I apologize if--

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,353
If that's how it sounded, Sophie.

120
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,438
I really didn't intend that.

121
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,356
So, have you taken your S.A.T.s yet?

122
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:14,624
Not yet.

123
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,015
I have a feeling that you're
going to do really well.

124
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:19,799
I expect to.

125
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,186
So,

126
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:27,271
your mother bought you these shoes,
you hate them and you still wore them.

127
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,874
Why?

128
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,408
I'm at a total loss.

129
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,507
But, hey,

130
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:35,365
why don't you call up my mother
and say, "Hi, Sophie's mom,

131
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,919
"Sophie wore those Barbie shoes
you bought her,

132
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,796
"went out to a bar, screwed
half the U.S. olympic team

133
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,007
"and now she's gonna kill herself."

134
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,297
Why'd you do it anyway?

135
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,969
- Why'd you call her?
- Because I was worried about you.

136
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,864
Suddenly everyone's so worried about me.

137
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,710
Did you call Cy too?

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,706
He's turned into my grandmother.
He won't let me train.

139
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,981
He's making me do classes
with the 10-year-olds.

140
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,823
It's ridiculous.

141
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,411
Now I remember what
I wanted to tell you.

142
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,199
The most amazing thing happened
at the gym the other day.

143
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,191
Even though I haven't been training,

144
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,956
I've been absorbing
stuff just by watching.

145
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,157
'Cause I have this chronic problem

146
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,459
with my toes going off the edge
of the beam when I land a hard element.

147
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,462
It's because I'm naturally knock-kneed.

148
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,547
My knees, they face inwards.

149
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:33,995
So in order to get them facing straight

150
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,801
my feet have to point out,

151
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:39,266
which is good for ballet but
bad for gymnastics.

152
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,884
Just a toe in the wrong position
can lose you the event.

153
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,072
I'm talking about medals here.

154
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:49,207
So anyway, i'm on the beam, right?

155
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,321
And I've been training at nighttime,

156
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,858
even though my body doesn't want to yet.

157
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,039
It was like...

158
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:00,033
When I was little and
I used to starve myself

159
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,592
and there would be this period,

160
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,253
usually in the morning, where

161
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,705
I was really really hungry.

162
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,581
You know, so hungry that I thought
that my stomach might just start

163
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,408
eating the rest of me.

164
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,800
And then it would go away--

165
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:20,473
Suddenly-- like turning
off a light switch.

166
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,334
And I felt like I
was floating on clouds.

167
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:26,461
It was the same with the pain this time.

168
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,260
I pushed through
it until it just let up,

169
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,800
all of a sudden.

170
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,373
And then I felt like I didn't have a
body at all.

171
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:37,747
Like I was just a
pair of somersaulting eyes.

172
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,411
So yesterday I marched into the gym

173
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,331
and I got up on the beam.

174
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,858
Everyone was in shock and I felt this
silence all around me.

175
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,719
- Sophie, be careful, please.
- Then something inside of me,

176
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,755
some little voice said, "prove it."

177
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:58,300
So I started the first element.

178
00:09:58,571 --> 00:10:01,009
- Here, I'll show you.
- Sophie, please be careful.

179
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,681
- This is dangerous.
- Don't have a cow, Paul. I'm fine.

180
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,755
So anyway, I begin the first element.

181
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,820
When I look back at my feet,
they were right on the beam.

182
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,449
It's nothing major, but I took
it as a sort of sign.

183
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:25,161
Afterwards, everyone told me Cy was
so shocked that he couldn't breathe.

184
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,580
- Well, I bet he was.
- I did a backflip.

185
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,736
- I landed perfectly.
- That was incredible.

186
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,982
I just walked back to the bench
like it was no big deal.

187
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:43,645
I could feel everybody's eyes on my back

188
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,784
I wanted to turn around and just...

189
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,015
And what?

190
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:48,344
Nothing.

191
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,145
No, come on, tell me.

192
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,027
I wanted to flip them the bird
with both hands

193
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,571
like "Fuck all of you
and the fish you swam in on."

194
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:04,725
I thought it was the...

195
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,007
The horse that you rode in on.

196
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,389
Not in my book.

197
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:11,039
In my book it's a fish.

198
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,586
What is it, Sophie?

199
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:25,848
What's wrong?

200
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,530
I don't feel well.

201
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,075
Do you want some water?

202
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,883
Do you feel a pain?

203
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:34,771
Wait a second.

204
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,083
Just wait, it'll go away.

205
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:52,599
Stop it, Sophie.

206
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,224
- Stop it.
- What is it?

207
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,816
Sophie, look at me.

208
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:05,717
Please.

209
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:13,564
What is it?

210
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:19,639
What goes on in there?

211
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:22,685
Tell me.

212
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,774
Around 2:00 a.m.,
he took me to his room.

213
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:32,948
Who did?

214
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,583
The new guy with the Tequila.

215
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,520
He's from Minnesota or Michigan
or somewhere,

216
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,577
he's a brilliant gymnast.

217
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:44,955
He wanted to have sex,

218
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,237
he couldn't get it up.

219
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,337
He was pretty wasted too.

220
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:54,101
And then he did and then we had
sex and,

221
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,363
I didn't feel anything.

222
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:58,877
As usual.

223
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,397
Absolutely nothing.

224
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:07,864
Afterwards he said that I fucked

225
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,200
like someone who's been sexually abused.

226
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,077
Prick.

227
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:21,236
I'm sorry, go on.

228
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,420
We went to the girls' house,

229
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,928
to the room that I sometimes stay in.

230
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,596
I tried to go to sleep but I couldn't
stop thinking about what he'd said.

231
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:32,977
I was afraid that if I fell asleep

232
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,638
I wouldn't get up in time
to come here so...

233
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:39,621
And when I closed my eyes
I saw these horrible images.

234
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,046
- What?
- Like,

235
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,567
everything around me was falling apart,

236
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,768
you know, disintegrating,

237
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,577
turning into ash right in front of me.

238
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:53,514
I forced myself to think
of something pretty and nice like

239
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:56,672
a pasture in the sunlight
and to hold it there--

240
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,074
That image.

241
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,014
But as soon as I started to fall asleep

242
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:02,893
the pasture would turn to rot.

243
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,462
It was terrible.

244
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,612
That reminded me of the accident
for some reason. I don't know why.

245
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,391
I was scared that if I slept
I'd dream about the accident,

246
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:19,505
So I got up
and I walked to the bus stop

247
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:20,877
very slowly,

248
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,622
backwards actually,

249
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,773
just to slow myself down.

250
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,947
The buses weren't running yet, so,

251
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:30,947
I sat on the bench.

252
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,450
Yeah?

253
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:34,813
And what?

254
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,247
What were you thinking about
when you sat on the bench?

255
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:43,316
I was thinking about Dana.

256
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,365
I couldn't breathe.

257
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,016
The night of the accident,

258
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,771
when I left Darlene's house and
got on the bike,

259
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:58,979
all of a sudden I couldn't breathe.

260
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,704
My throat closed up.

261
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:06,305
There's this blind turn at the end
of their hill, and when I,

262
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,987
I went around it a
white car almost hit me.

263
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,597
- I don't remember.
- Go on, Sophie.

264
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,118
- What happened with the car?
- I don't remember.

265
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:17,897
Go on, please.
It's really important.

266
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,867
- I don't remember anything else.
- You don't have to do this alone.

267
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,385
I don't want to.

268
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:34,946
Go on.

269
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,925
The seat was hurting me.

270
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,891
It was Cy's bike, a man's bike,
so it had a narrow seat.

271
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,068
That's why it was hurting me.

272
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,362
When I reached the blind turn

273
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,564
a white car came around and
almost hit me.

274
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,513
It had the brights on so it blinded me.

275
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,450
It swerved away from
me and then honked and--

276
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,197
It was so weird.

277
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,337
The road just sort
of started coming at me,

278
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:14,478
sort of attacking me really fast,

279
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:18,123
like I was falling
from somewhere very high,

280
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:23,430
And I wanted it.

281
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,440
I wanted to hear a huge boom

282
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,486
and then I wanted to hear nothing.

283
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:43,441
I'm trying to kill myself.

284
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,766
I'm a fucking freak.

285
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:02,984
You're not a freak.

286
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:16,557
What happened then?

287
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,157
It was as if it had already happened.

288
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,226
As soon as the white car passed

289
00:17:28,396 --> 00:17:30,750
I knew I was going to have an accident.

290
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,697
And I just felt calm.

291
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,886
I turned the handlebars just
the smallest little bit to the left.

292
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,998
I remember thinking,

293
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,731
"just this tiny little
movement is enough."

294
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,261
Then I rode into the street.

295
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,724
It was impossible for another car
not to hit me.

296
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,750
And I felt just free--

297
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,732
Free and strong.

298
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,932
I had this adrenaline rush like
nothing could touch me.

299
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:05,266
What is that about?

300
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,400
Maybe you felt like you were in control.

301
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,277
- Yes.
- Yeah?

302
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:23,526
And then I was in the middle of the road

303
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:27,387
there was this terrible
screeching sound and then a boom.

304
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:29,978
I remember I said to myself, "oh."

305
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:32,395
Just "oh."

306
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,338
And I flew into the air.

307
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,816
I could suddenly breathe again.
I had all this air in my lungs.

308
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,162
And then you were on the ground

309
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:48,328
you were lying there.
Do you rember what--

310
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,745
What was going through your head?

311
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,264
That I finally killed her.

312
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,218
Killed who, Sophie?

313
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:05,041
That's what I thought when I landed.

314
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:11,002
Who did you kill, Sophie?
I don't know.

315
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,363
Sophie, are you okay?

316
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:58,758
I'll be right out.

317
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,386
You feel better?

318
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,589
I think I'll go home.

319
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:44,192
We have a little time left.

320
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,186
Yeah, but I'm really tired.

321
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,595
You can stay for a little bit longer
if you'd like.

322
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,344
I think I'll go home.

323
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:54,041
But wait,

324
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,594
I have the magic slippers

325
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,541
that clearly I can click three times

326
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,867
and suddenly everybody I love
will be right by my side.

327
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:05,768
And you're like The Wizard of Oz.

328
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:09,425
You think you know everything but
you don't know shit.

329
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:13,887
Plus, you're always behind that curtain.

330
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:15,174
What curtain?

331
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,719
Let's see you do some magic.

332
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,003
What am I thinking right now?

333
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:23,823
I don't know.

334
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,566
Sophie, I can't read your mind.

335
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:28,402
Try.

336
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:34,795
Please try, mr. Magic man.

337
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:40,311
Are you angry that I made you
remember the accident? Is that it?

338
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:42,958
That's not what I was thinking.

339
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,162
You lose.

340
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:47,427
- Are you okay?
- You must have someone else coming.

341
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,488
- I don't.
- I can't see anyone like this.

342
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,304
I'm a little worried about you, please.

343
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:53,785
Sophie, please.

344
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,042
I thought the shooting times
were always fixed.

345
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:57,954
What shooting?
What are you talking about?

346
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,666
- I thought they always came at...
- Who?

347
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:01,969
The models.

348
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,210
Sophie.

349
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:06,079
Oh, god.
