00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,966
<i>Lenny, it's your dad.</i>
<i>pick up.</i>

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:07,934
Hey, what's going
on there, little man?

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:10,347
In a couple hours.

4
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,243
Listen, has mommy
left already?

5
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,143
<i>She wasn't home?</i>

6
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,027
No, she's not
picking up her cell.

7
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:19,793
What?

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,572
What are you eating?

9
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:26,006
That doesn't sound like an apple.
It sounds like a frito.

10
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:27,573
Are you eating fritos?

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,908
Okay, Lenny, I don't have
the time for this right now.

12
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,280
We'll talk about it
when I get back, okay? Bye.

13
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:37,579
The way she stuffs him
with junk food drives me crazy.

14
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,409
<i>Hi, this is Amy.</i>
<i>leave me a message.</i>

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,607
It's me, I'm at Paul's.
Where the hell are you?

16
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,025
<i>what's going on?</i>

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,607
Transcript: FRM.
Synchro VO: michvanilly.

18
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,496
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>sit down, Jake?</i>

19
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:19,248
I'm sure she'll be
here in a moment.

20
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,395
This time slot sucks.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,046
<i>Hi, This is Amy.</i>
<i>leave me a message.</i>

22
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,783
Don't fucking tell me
you forgot we're due at Paul's.

23
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:30,108
Call me back. Bye.

24
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,309
She knows we have an appointment.
We talked about it this morning.

25
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:41,738
Sarah, what's up?
Hi, it's Jake.

26
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:42,697
Jake.

27
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,274
Did she leave
already?

28
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,058
When?

29
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,396
What do you mean?

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,072
20 minutes
or three hours?

31
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,053
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where she was going?</i>

32
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,120
Did she leave alone?

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,869
Alone... that means
without anyone else.

34
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,711
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,347
Good, good girl.
See, that was easy, right?

36
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,534
Fine fine.
All right, thanks. Bye.

37
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:11,968
Fuck her!

38
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:16,681
Was that somebody
from Amy's office?

39
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,269
Yeah, they're all so full of themselves.
I can't stand them.

40
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:23,730
I'm sorry, what exactly
does Amy do?

41
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,701
She's Deputy VP
<i>something, whatever.</i>

42
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,904
She's all about work now.
Lenny barely sees her.

43
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:39,043
Are you comfortable being here

44
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:41,221
with me without amy?

45
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,044
I'm comfortable.

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,895
But you said we shouldn't start until
we're both here, right? <i>so we wait.</i>

47
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:52,799
We can start at
anytime you want.

48
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:57,167
It's just... If you don't mind
that Amy has to hear it all again.

49
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,849
No, it's okay.
We'll wait.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,648
I'm just getting
the sense,

51
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,510
jake, that this is
difficult for you

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,100
to be here
without her.

53
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,300
No, it's not difficult.

54
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,948
<i>Hi, Molly.</i>
<i>everything's fine.</i>

55
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,172
Can you hear me now?

56
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,133
Great.
Listen, do you know where Amy is?

57
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,660
If I knew,
I wouldn't be calling.

58
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,767
She's not picking up.

59
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,049
Do you or don't you
know where she is?

60
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,310
Molly, I'm in the middle
of something, okay?

61
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,714
All right, I'll let her know.
Okay, bye.

62
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,767
Her mother.  Jesus.

63
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:47,564
What do you mean?

64
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:50,812
The way they talk?
You can tell they're loaded.

65
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,236
They got money coming
out of their asses.

66
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,334
- Amy too?
- What do you think?

67
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:59,158
She's lucky I keep things
in perspective for her.

68
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,620
<i>Her mother.</i>

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,434
Yes, Molly,
what is it?

70
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,901
An attack?

71
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,005
An attack of what?

72
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,299
Why do you always rush
to the worst-case scenario?

73
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:17,614
Well, fine, go on worrying.
I'm not.

74
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:18,799
Because.

75
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,020
I'm not worried, molly.
What are you gonna do about it?

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,434
That's the way it is.

77
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,234
<i>okay, Molly, I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of something, okay?</i>

78
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,880
bye. Bye.

79
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:31,501
Now I'm in trouble with
her mother the hysteric.

80
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:34,277
- She sounds anxious.
- She's a wreck.

81
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,634
Maybe she's skipping
through the stages of...

82
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,949
Anxiety.

83
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,874
What?

84
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,247
Well, it's like,

85
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,473
let's say you arranged
to meet somebody,

86
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,450
a particular time
at a particular place.

87
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,801
<i>and you arrive and they're not there.</i>
<i>and you think to yourself, "oh,</i>

88
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,289
maybe I got the time
or the place wrong.

89
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,612
And then you get to the stage
where you get angry

90
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,614
and you say,
"where the hell are they?

91
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,097
They're supposed
to be here."

92
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:06,559
<i>and then you get</i>
<i>to the stage of anxiety</i>

93
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,980
where you're worried
if something has

94
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,631
happened to them.

95
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,880
Okay, I'm outta here.
I don't think--

96
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,410
I think you should stay
a few more minutes.

97
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,617
She was late
last week, remember?

98
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,161
Maybe I left
my ringer off.

99
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,767
No, you idiot,
her mother just called you.

100
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:32,210
Okay.

101
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:33,913
Are you leaving?

102
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,923
I'm gonna step outside.
Maybe I can see something.

103
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,801
Jake, why are youso worried?

104
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,651
You mean what act
of anxiety am I in?

105
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:48,267
That's interesting.
That you say act of anxiety.

106
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,920
Because it's an act,
not a stage.

107
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:54,524
It's from that
pretentious fag.

108
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,202
So you're familiar with
the works of Roland Barthes*?

109
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,534
Surprise surprise.

110
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,534
Her mother?

111
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,032
Her mother.

112
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,434
I'm late, sorry.

113
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,951
Hi.
Who's calling?

114
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,481
- Why don't you answer the phone?
- Where were you?

115
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,350
I'm right here.
What, were you worried?

116
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,309
- You weren't picking up.
- Really?

117
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,499
I'm such an idiot.
I switched it off during the meeting.

118
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:38,860
<i>I forgot to turn it</i>
<i>back on again.</i>

119
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,033
Where were you?

120
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,133
At work, where else?

121
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,096
What were you doing in
the meantime, mud wrestling?

122
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,495
Wrestling.

123
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,207
That's what it looks like.
It's just a really bad time slot.

124
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,132
What?

125
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,467
Sarah said you left
a long time ago.

126
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,860
So?  traffic.

127
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:02,359
You were wearing a different
outfit this morning.

128
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,100
He noticed.
I just bought it.

129
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,345
You just went and bought
yourself a suit?

130
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,767
Yeah, I spilled coffee over
myself during the meeting.

131
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:12,310
- <I>what meeting?</i>
- Are you gonna sit or what?

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,976
There was traffic.
That's it.

133
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,525
- 2:00.
- What?

134
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,452
Sarah said you left
the office at 2:00.

135
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:28,618
That's right.
I told you I had a meeting.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,844
- A meeting with whom?
- What is with the interrogation?

137
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,665
With reeves.
What difference does it make?

138
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,210
Who's Reeves, Amy?

139
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:39,731
My boss.

140
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,267
So where was it,
this meeting?

141
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,200
At a cafe.

142
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,092
Why are you wasting our time here
with Paul on this bullshit?

143
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, you should've
thought of that before you came in late.

144
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,447
Is it usual

145
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,000
for you to be late, Amy.

146
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,190
Sometimes
I'm fashionably late.

147
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,734
Well, you've been late for

148
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,694
all of our
three sessions so far.

149
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,031
I apologize.

150
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:11,285
<i>is your being late an indicator</i>
of not wanting to be here, perhaps?

151
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,880
Don't flatter yourself.

152
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,101
So, you're
usually late, Amy,

153
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:22,190
and this is usually
your reaction, Jake.

154
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,968
Is this his
usual response?

155
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,011
Yes.
He's suspicious.

156
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:32,348
Do you think perhaps Amy
has something to hide, Jake?

157
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,171
Is that why you were
nervous earlier on?

158
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,385
I wasn't nervous.

159
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:41,056
Maybe it was you

160
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,349
who was nervous
to be alone with me.

161
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,007
He's a bundle of nerves.

162
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,655
- Well, perhaps if--
- Where'd you get the outfit?

163
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,521
- Paul's talking.
- Where'd you get the outfit?

164
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,381
I told you, I spilled
coffee on myself

165
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:55,837
- so I went and bought it.
- Which cafe did you go to?

166
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,561
Do you see what
I have to deal with here?

167
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:05,298
The bakery
next to the office.

168
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,964
I had an espresso.
He had a mint tea.

169
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,501
I had an almond croissant.
He had toast.

170
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,995
- There's no shopping in that area.
- So?

171
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,879
So what, you drove to a mall?
Where to?

172
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,419
So what if I did?

173
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,204
- All the way to a mall.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:29,442
How much do
we owe you, Paul?

175
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,735
- <I>what is the matter with you?</i>
- <i>how much do we owe you?</i>

176
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:32,730
why?

177
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,399
Because we're wasting
our time, that's why.

178
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,906
- She went to finalize the abortion.
- I didn't finalize anything.

179
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:39,850
While we've been sitting here
waiting to talk about whether or not

180
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,200
we should have an abortion, she'meeting
with Kornreich to work out details.

181
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,236
- I didn't work out any details.
- You're lying.

182
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,538
I bought a suit.

183
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,567
Did you or did you not
see Kornreich?

184
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,868
I did see him.

185
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,400
But I didn't
work out anything.

186
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>so what were</i>
<i>you doing there?</i>

187
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,616
he told both of us that
he couldn't do anything

188
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:11,529
till he ran some tests.
So he took some blood from me.

189
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,587
- And you call me suspicious.
- Do you see why I hide things from you?

190
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,483
Because you react
like a madman.

191
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:19,247
It isn't an abortion. It's in case
we decide to have an abortion.

192
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,312
Did Kornreich ask what
I thought about all this

193
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,923
- or is your opinion and his enough?
- Oh, god, here we go.

194
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,084
The man's been giving me
fertility treatments for five years.

195
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,481
Can I talk to him?

196
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,459
If you were wearing this outfit
I'm sure he was happy to talk to you.

197
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,969
Did he look under it?

198
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,234
Did he check you
before taking your blood?

199
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,204
- You're such a shithead.
- When she curses, Paul,

200
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,300
you know she's lying.

201
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,897
I think, Jake,
what Amy

202
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,798
might be trying
to say is that

203
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,801
she can't talk to you
about this abortion

204
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,738
because you suspect
anything that she says.

205
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,629
I'm the one
at fault here?

206
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,077
<i>I'm the one at fault?</i>

207
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,549
She arranges a meeting
with her OB behind my back

208
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,601
and I'm the one
at fault here?

209
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,706
Tell me something, is she paying you
behind my back too?

210
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,973
Oh, right. I bribed him
so I can have an abortion.

211
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,119
And on the other hand,

212
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,845
Amy, you may
be responsible

213
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,042
for Jake's suspicions
because you behave

214
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,067
<i>like somebody who's</i>
<i>got something to hide.</i>

215
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,514
Because you lie.

216
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,986
Because you won't allow me
to have any doubt.

217
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,868
What do you
mean by that?

218
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,871
<i>well, you can see it</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

219
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,471
He won't even consider
an abortion as an option.

220
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:41,400
And look at him.
Do you hear how he talks to me?

221
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,297
Well, perhaps his, uh--

222
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:47,297
His aggressive
attitude reflects his need to be

223
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,324
<i>more aware of what's</i>
<i>happening to you,</i>

224
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,959
<i>to be part</i>
<i>of your decision,</i>

225
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,445
to understand
your thought processes.

226
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:56,802
Maybe it's a...

227
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,056
It's an expression
of his love for you.

228
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,726
Love?

229
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,801
God.

230
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:12,033
- Cursing me out's all about love?
- I didn't curse.

231
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:13,532
And you're a liar.

232
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,087
I'll go and see
Dr. Kornreich tomorrow

233
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,866
and I'll discuss it with him
and I will make a decision.

234
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,706
Amy, can you
tell us what...

235
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,913
What the most important issues
for you are?

236
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,763
We've been through
that here, Paul.

237
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,878
I don't know if I want
to be pregnant again.

238
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:34,632
She doesn't want to have the baby.
I don't know if I want another baby.

239
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:38,010
I'm not sure.
I told you, I'm tired.

240
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,658
Are you capable of thinking
of anything but yourself?

241
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,559
- It's my pregnancy.
- <I>Our pregnancy. It's ours.</i>

242
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,911
- Oh, really?
- That's right.

243
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,714
And the hemorrhoids,
are those yours too?

244
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:49,020
And the nine months of morning
sickness, whose are those?

245
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,594
And the extra 50 lbs,
are those yours too?

246
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:54,235
Have you spoken
to Dr. Kornreich about

247
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:58,067
terminating this pregnancy
that you've wanted for so long?

248
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:01,614
Yes.

249
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,576
I don't think,

250
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,251
I'll be able
to love another baby.

251
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,004
<i>I'm angry at him already.</i>

252
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,934
<i>I feel like it's forcing itself</i>
<i>into the middle of things.</i>

253
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>ever since I became pregnant,</i>
<i>I've felt the hormones raging,</i>

254
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,075
driving me insane.
And I know I'll have postpartum

255
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,814
because that's what happened
last time. I see it coming

256
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,423
and it paralyzes me.

257
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:37,736
I won't be able
to take care of this child.

258
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,018
I won't love him.

259
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:54,126
I don't know what I'm capable of,
you know? I scare myself.

260
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,200
I scare myself to death.

261
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,022
So, was that
convincing enough?

262
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:21,822
You're insane.

263
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,013
Why, because I want to be able
to make my own decision?

264
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,959
- Deranged.
- <I>really?</i>

265
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,314
<I>well, if that's the case,</i>

266
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,023
<i>and assuming you're</i>
<i>mentally healthy,</i>

267
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,417
why are you in such a hurry
to have another child with me?

268
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:42,633
Maybe you could
explain it to her, Paul.

269
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,924
Maybe you could explain
that it's abnormal for a woman

270
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:48,361
to make up such a crazy speech
about being depressed.

271
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,786
I want to get you and Kornreich
and everybody off my back

272
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,736
so I can make my own decision.
And you know what? If playing the part

273
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:56,501
of the depressed wife
will do it, great. There.

274
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,159
I'm sorry
I made all that up.

275
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:09,127
Really?

276
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:12,848
What?

277
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,458
Did you make it up?

278
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,225
I told you,
she's a born liar.

279
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:18,909
I lied
and I apologize.

280
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,703
What? I'll go kneel in the corner
and pray for forgiveness.

281
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:25,000
Isn't it possible
that something in this...

282
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,347
Fake narrative of yours

283
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:31,850
<i>has more than
a grain of truth?</i>

284
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,061
Those fears sounded
very real to me.

285
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,614
All of a sudden,
he's a therapist.

286
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:39,701
Maybe I'm hearing what she's
trying to tell you, Jake.

287
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:41,944
What am I trying
to say to him?

288
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:44,363
That you're terrified.

289
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:47,267
<i>You're terrified</i>
<i>of having this child.</i>

290
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:51,125
Can't you hear that?

291
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,541
<i>she's exaggerating her fears</i>
<i>so that you will hear her,</i>

292
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,876
so that you will listen to her.

293
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:03,567
What do you mean?

294
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,601
He means that it's
abnormal for a woman

295
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:09,123
who's spent five years
in fertilization treatments

296
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:13,038
to want to get rid of the baby
because she's afraid of hemorrhoids.

297
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:20,465
It...

298
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,191
It seems to me that

299
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,416
both of you have a wide
range of emotions

300
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,069
in respect
to this pregnancy.

301
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,529
Perhaps, Jake,

302
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,100
<i>you're not confronting</i>
<i>your fears</i>

303
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,627
<i>about not wanting</i>
<i>another baby.</i>

304
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:42,219
And you, Amy,
on the other hand,

305
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,048
if you weren't so busy
fending him off,

306
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:49,260
you might find within yourself
arguments for wanting another child.

307
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,832
Why is it so hard
for the two of you

308
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,498
to understand that a woman may choose
to put her career or her body

309
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,606
or whatever ahead
of having a child?

310
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,192
<i>I think what</i>
<i>I'm trying to say</i>

311
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:07,280
is that I don't think
the issue is as clear-cut

312
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,100
- as both of you want to admit.
- <i>Bullshit!</i>

313
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,595
total bullshit.
You're talking to two people

314
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:15,851
who spent five years
in fertility treatments.

315
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,041
Do you know what it's like?
Five years?

316
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,229
For five years they've injected me
and hurt me

317
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,250
and drawn things out of me and told me
when to eat and when to sleep

318
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,250
and when to breathe
and when to fuck.

319
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,441
Do you know how many hands
went in and out of my body during

320
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,221
during the last five years?

321
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,251
For nothing.

322
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,282
And when we stopped the treatments,
and not because I wanted to,

323
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,437
because the doctor told us to,
the whole world, including him,

324
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:43,565
<i>comforted me and said,
"oh, you know, maybe it's for the best."</i>

325
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,467
and you know what?

326
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,949
They actually managed
to convince me.

327
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:50,926
So here I am
and it's a year later and

328
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,746
I feel happier
and I've lost the weight.

329
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,305
And for the first time
I can actually see myself

330
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,180
as someone who...
Someone who...

331
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,715
Someone who'd never have
a baby with a shithead.

332
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,764
You are so primitive.

333
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:05,902
Primitive?

334
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:13,347
Back when she was cheating
with me on her first husband, Paul,

335
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,264
I was sexy.

336
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,481
But now I'm primitive.

337
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,937
I still find you sexy.
Not as sexy as Reeve right?

338
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,536
You're wrong,
believe me.

339
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,328
You know,
for a pathological liar,

340
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:30,147
you sure say
"believe me" a lot.

341
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:34,217
I'm a liar and deranged
and egotistical. Anything else?

342
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:37,364
Just admit that you don't
want to have my child.

343
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,751
We already have
a child, remember?

344
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,114
Yes, I do.

345
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,667
He's at home having
ding dongs for dinner.

346
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:56,547
you know what?
It seems to me that

347
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,989
you're not really talking
about a child.

348
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,669
You're really talking about
your inability to accept

349
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,167
each other
for who you are.

350
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,375
You know, I don't understand
what you're doing.

351
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,734
Excuse me, but I just
don't get it.

352
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:12,285
<i>we came here a couple of weeks ago</i>
<i>because we couldn't make a decision.</i>

353
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,647
And as time goes by,
you try to convince us

354
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,547
that we're not indecisive
but that we have problems.

355
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,675
You haven't helped us to decide
whether to have the baby or not

356
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,808
but you've done a great job
of getting us to fight.

357
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,906
- I think what's com...
- We didn't come here in order

358
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,209
to bring things out.

359
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,030
We came here to decide whether to keep
the baby or not keep it, that's all.

360
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,547
But it's not
a yes or no answer.

361
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:32,664
Tell me, how do you
sleep at night?

362
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:34,781
What, do you think I should
have problems sleeping at night?

363
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,687
If we're talking about a separation here
then you should lose some sleep.

364
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:39,497
But I wasn't talking
about a separation.

365
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:43,257
- Why are we talking about a separation?
- we came here to talk about a pregnancy

366
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:46,035
and we end up talking about all
these other things. Relationship yes,

367
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:49,467
relationship no... I'm sick of it.
Yes to the pregnancy or no.

368
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:50,988
<i>to have an abortion</i>
<i>or not have it.</i>

369
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,437
Just fucking
say it already.

370
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,966
To keep the child or don't keep it.
Tell us what you think.

371
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,879
You want me to give you
an answer right now?

372
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,634
I want
a yes or a no.

373
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,804
I think you should
have an abortion.

374
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,158
Really?

375
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,825
Go ahead,
have an abortion.

376
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,397
Is that what you think?

377
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,792
Do you see
what's happened here?

378
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,059
Do you see how you shoved me
into a corner?

379
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,210
Do you see how I had
to give you the answer

380
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,911
that you didn't want
to hear?

381
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:31,316
This is exactly
what you do with Amy.

382
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:36,154
I can't tell you whether
or not to have an abortion.

383
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,158
Yes, you can.
You just did.

384
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,064
I don't have an answer.

385
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,147
You just gave us an answer.
You said to get an abortion.

386
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:46,801
You could've said many things but
you told us to have an abortion, right?

387
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:49,321
You did. You had an opinion
and you let it slip out.

388
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,769
- You're murdering our child.
- Stop. Leave him alone.

389
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,829
Let's go.
You got what you came here for, right?

390
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,809
There's nothing else to do here.
Let's stop wasting...

391
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,551
You know why I can't tell you whether
or not you should have an abortion?

392
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:01,358
It has nothing to do with whether I'm
a psychotherapist or not,

393
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,244
whether I'm allowed
or whether I'm not allowed.

394
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,223
This is a personal
decision for you both.

395
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:09,412
It is a personal
and moral decision

396
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,364
that you must take
yourselves.

397
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:15,353
All I can do is help you
to confront your feelings

398
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:18,067
so that you come
to a correct decision

399
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,472
for you both.

400
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,634
That's all I can do.

401
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,992
That's it.

402
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,881
Goodbye, Amy.

403
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:20,118
<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the office of Dr. Gina Toll.</i>

404
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:23,701
<i>Please leave me a message and
I will get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

405
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,667
Gina, it's Paul.

406
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,133
Paul Weston.

407
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,834
I know it's been
quite a while.

408
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:33,714
I'll...

409
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,467
I'll try again later.
