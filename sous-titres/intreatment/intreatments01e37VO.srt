00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:06,244
If there's someone who does not know
the meaning of guilt, it's my father.

3
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:08,900
Mid-'50s, right?
Jim Crow, Oklahoma.

4
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:11,985
This mob with hoods
attacked his house.

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,718
So my father takes the family,
they run downstairs to the...

6
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:16,738
The boiler room, to the basement.

7
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:18,632
My grandfather, his father,

8
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,541
was very sick,
dying of lung cancer.

9
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,203
He had this hacking cough.

10
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:26,204
My father puts his hand over
his father's mouth and nose

11
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,974
and he kept it there
while they searched the basement.

12
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:30,730
Kept it clamped tight.

13
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,057
And then when
they finally cleared out...

14
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,551
my grandfather was dead.

15
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,686
I'd love to see him on this couch.

16
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:38,893
Doc, you'd have a field day with him.

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,017
I'm Paul Weston.
I was a friend of Alex's.

18
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,289
My deepest deepest condolences.

19
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,694
Thank you.
I... I don't remember...

20
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,090
You played racquetball with him.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,417
Hello, excuse me.

22
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:21,518
I'm sorry. I didn't know which one
of these doors was the right one.

23
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:24,369
That's okay.
It's a terrible day.

24
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,758
Didn't want to knock on your residence.

25
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:30,716
No problem. This door is
usually for people who come in.

26
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:32,362
That's usually the exit door.

27
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,830
But it doesn't...
It doesn't really matter.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,272
You have an entry door
and an exit door?

29
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:41,053
It's for people's privacy.
Some people don't like to...

30
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:43,147
They don't like to run into each other.

31
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:44,499
Are they ashamed?

32
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:49,980
No. It's just...
It's protocol really.

33
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,580
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I'm a tea man.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,288
But no, nothing, thank you.

35
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,369
- I'm fine.
- Please, sit down.

36
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,583
I got a lot of questions.

37
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,482
I'm sure you have. And I hope
that I can answer some of them.

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,768
One thing I do have
to stress from the outset

39
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,243
is that anything that is said

40
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,023
between myself and a patient
in this room...

41
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:18,627
is private.

42
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,867
- Even if the patient is dead?
- Yes, even then.

43
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:27,066
Well, I'm sure
we'll find something to talk about...

44
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,081
Something to help me understand
what happened to my son.

Sync: Benj!

46
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,912
You weren't very forthcoming
about who you were

47
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:00,744
when we met at the services.

48
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,746
A friend, you said?

49
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,191
That's hardly the case.

50
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,713
Well, I didn't want
to betray Alex's confidence.

51
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:10,096
Daniel didn't hesitate in explaining

52
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:12,998
exactly what your relationship
to Alex was.

53
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:16,099
He's very direct... Daniel.

54
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,508
I like that about him.

55
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,606
Were you surprised to hear
that Alex was in therapy?

56
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:23,643
That he didn't tell me surprised me.

57
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:27,101
- I mean, what's the big deal?
- Why do you think he didn't?

58
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,543
We'll never know the answer
to that, will we?

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,104
Or I won't.

60
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,663
Maybe that's something
you discussed here.

61
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,813
You know, it always puzzled me,

62
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,848
the whole process here, you know?

63
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:50,804
I mean, that...
That a person is in therapy at all

64
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,862
often is never discussed...

65
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,356
Who the doctor is,

66
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,275
what he's there for,
how much it cost.

67
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:02,965
Funny thing is that it's secrecy

68
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:06,098
or misunderstandings,
things never spoken that...

69
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,643
usually land people
in therapy in the first place.

70
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,574
- Isn't at ironic?
- I don't think it's about secrecy.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,710
I think it's about creating
an environment

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,453
where people
can come and feel safe

73
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,839
to talk about anything.

74
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,630
Safer than with their loved ones?

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,741
Sometimes
it's easier to talk to somebody

76
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:25,760
who's totally uninvolved
in your life... 

77
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,396
Somebody objective.
Somebody who has no stake in it.

78
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,997
You mean like a prostitute, hmm?

79
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:34,831
Someone who's paid for their
intimacy and their discretion.

80
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,018
A man should have
someone to talk to

81
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,735
who cares about him,

82
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:45,186
Not someone
who charges by the hour.

83
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,508
I really did care for Alex.

84
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,063
And if I hadn't,

85
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,133
I'd actually be a pretty poor therapist.

86
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,917
Do you think Alex spoke about things
in this room that he never...

87
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,045
spoke to anyone else about?

88
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,740
That is usually
the case with patients.

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,877
So you probably know
as much about him as anyone did.

90
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,364
Do you feel
that you knew your son well?

91
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:19,772
I knew Alex when he was...

92
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,074
a little boy.

93
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:23,817
- And what was he like then?
- Well, he was...

94
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,133
quiet.

95
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:27,583
Introspective.

96
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,325
Daydreamer.

97
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,060
Inventor.

98
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,782
Did he ever mention that to you?

99
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:36,951
He never did, no.

100
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,572
He invented this thing
for his mother...

101
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:47,504
A pan that made flipping
an omelet over very easy.

102
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:49,208
He worked very hard on that thing.

103
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:50,716
It was really good.

104
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,863
So where did he get that from?
Were you an inventor?

105
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,756
Oh, no.
No, man. I was a knucklehead.

106
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,712
My father was an inventor.

107
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,082
He invented
this knife-sharpening machine.

108
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,143
It didn't make very much money.
He was proud of it.

109
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,407
Alex reminded me of him.

110
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:11,809
In what way?

111
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,187
You trying to shrink me, doctor?

112
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,543
I'm just curious.

113
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:18,676
Or perhaps you can't help yourself.

114
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,164
That's probably true too.

115
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,112
My father and Alex...

116
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,828
had the same mannerisms,
the same sense of humor.

117
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,424
It was unsettling.

118
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,584
When Alex was a little boy

119
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,646
and my father
had been dead almost 20 years...

120
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,317
There he was...

121
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,969
Sitting across the dinner
table looking at me...

122
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:50,977
Through me
with those eyes of his

123
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,941
on Alex's face.

124
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,725
Is your father still living, Mr. Weston?

125
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:00,988
Yes.

126
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:05,645
Yes, his body is in good health,

127
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:06,913
But his...

128
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,078
His mind is gone.

129
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:12,806
Were you close?

130
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,212
We had our differences, of course.

131
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,104
But we were close.

132
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,010
We are close, I mean.

133
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,004
How often do you see him?

134
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,548
About once a month.

135
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,567
Does he know you're there?

136
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,673
No. I don't think so.

137
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,977
But the visit is more for my sake.

138
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,129
What do you get out of it?

139
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,324
Connection,

140
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,212
a sense of...

141
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,216
belonging.

142
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you ever have conversations
with him in your head?

143
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,780
Both sides of the conversation?

144
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:57,805
Yes.

145
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:01,513
When I was younger everything he said
went in one ear, out the other.

146
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:04,128
Now I hear his voice in my head

147
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,495
Loud and clear every day.

148
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,369
That's the sense of connection
that you mentioned. That's... 

149
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,876
That's what I feel slipping away

150
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:15,145
with each passing day
since Alex's death.

151
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,662
That sense of...

152
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,095
I'm trying to find his voice,

153
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:23,701
you know, but...

154
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,767
He won't talk to me.

155
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:33,503
If you don't mind me saying so,
Mr. Prince, I think

156
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:37,204
that it's still too soon.

157
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,355
You're probably still
in a state of shock.

158
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,109
But his voice...

159
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:47,443
will come back to you.

160
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:59,747
I apologize
for comparing what you do

161
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:03,344
to, uh, prostitution.

162
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,484
I don't believe
they're the same at all.

163
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,192
Apology accepted.

164
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,151
How would you describe

165
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:20,949
my son Alex?

166
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,756
I'm not asking you
for a diagnosis.

167
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,784
You don't have to tell me
what he thought,

168
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:28,972
just what you thought
of him personally.

169
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,219
I thought that Alex was...

170
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,357
an extremely...

171
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,291
capable man.

172
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,379
Strong sense of mission.

173
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:53,586
A very strong sense of
what was expected of him.

174
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:55,664
Uh, mission or purpose?

175
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,564
- What do you mean?
- Well, Alex was a military man.

176
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,663
Military men have missions.

177
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,142
To have a purpose,
a sense of purpose,

178
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,416
that's something...

179
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,515
Something you do on your own,
something you want for yourself.

180
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,350
Did he have that?

181
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,332
I think that Alex
was struggling to find out

182
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:19,173
what he wanted for himself.

183
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,474
- Did he say that?
- No, sir, he didn't.

184
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,110
I'm just giving you
some of my impressions

185
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,352
without betraying
what he confided in me.

186
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,225
Frankly, it's more
than I'm allowed to do.

187
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,320
Were you in the service yourself,
Mr. Prince?

188
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,893
Eight months, you know,
after they drafted me.

189
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,737
Had an asthma attack
and they discharged me.

190
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,334
probably saved my life.

191
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:50,771
Funny, a breathing problem was...

192
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,530
my salvation,

193
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,060
and my father's death knell.

194
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:02,731
Alex told you about
what happened to my father?

195
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:11,076
These are facts about my life,

196
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,357
not Alex's treatment.

197
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,123
Do you happen to know

198
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,687
how my father died?

199
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:22,917
Yes or no? Simple question.

200
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,376
Yes. Yes, I do.

201
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,223
Anyway, I wasn't a war hero

202
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,012
like my son,
if that's what you were wondering.

203
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,657
How did you feel about Alex's...

204
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:49,798
service in the Navy?

205
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,910
I was proud of it, of course,
like any father would be.

206
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:57,544
- Was he, do you think?
- Do you suspect that he wasn't?

207
00:11:57,714 --> 00:11:59,793
I want to understand my son...

208
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:02,909
mr. Weston.
And instead of helping me,

209
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,352
You answer questions with questions.

210
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:10,950
I think your son

211
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:14,724
found it increasingly difficult to

212
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,315
compartmentalize,

213
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,596
to keep his feelings

214
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,310
apart from his obligations

215
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:26,549
and to live up to
the expectations of others.

216
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:28,912
The expectations of the Navy?

217
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,566
Expectations to excel

218
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,829
like he had always excelled.

219
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,084
And at the expense
of his own needs

220
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:39,982
and his real desires.

221
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,460
Are you saying that Alex
was ill-equipped emotionally

222
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,353
To handle the pressure?

223
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:48,588
- Mr. Prince, you're asking me to...
- I'm asking your opinion.

224
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,325
Alex's emotional state
is not something...

225
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,313
You're playing a little fast and loose
here, aren't you, mr. Weston?

226
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,698
I can know my son was troubled,
just not how troubled?

227
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,877
I want to know
what his therapist believed

228
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,845
he was capable of,
how far he would go.

229
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:06,357
How far he'd go to what, Mr. Prince?

230
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,286
I've spoken to
a couple of Alex's fellow pilots.

231
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,991
It was a training flight.

232
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,127
They simulate a battle,
one plane against another.

233
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,347
The other pilot
made a snap decision,

234
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,026
Tried to get away,
apparently flying low.

235
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:42,526
They say Alex
didn't have time to straighten out.

236
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,293
There's also a rumor

237
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,861
going around 
that Alex killed himself.

238
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,313
He was a superb pilot.

239
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:56,083
It wasn't combat,
it was a training exercise.

240
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,023
It was a training exercise.

241
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,304
There hasn't been any...

242
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:05,985
official...

243
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:08,567
finding,

244
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,401
Mr. Prince.
You said that yourself.

245
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,204
There's an ejection seat.

246
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,176
Why didn't he jump?

247
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,777
Maybe he...

248
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,690
didn't think
he needed to use it.

249
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:30,927
Well...

250
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,123
Michaela's been in church,

251
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,465
you know, on her knees,

252
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:46,044
praying, looking for answers.
My wife also.

253
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,781
And I told 'em, you know...

254
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,116
That's the wrong place to look.

255
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:56,170
God and me,
we've been over for a while.

256
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,161
My faith died...

257
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,620
when my father died.

258
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:10,478
A boy once beat Alex up.

259
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,836
He was about 10 or 11.

260
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,658
He took his shoes.

261
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,593
Little shit punk, you know?

262
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,512
Alex did nothing to fight back.

263
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:25,543
He didn't defend himself.
He wasn't a fighter. He was a...

264
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:28,914
He was a frail kid.

265
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,887
You know? Thin-skinned.

266
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,736
And that scared the hell out of me.

267
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:37,976
Where I come from,
thin black skin could get you killed.

268
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,772
And that was
the kind of world that...

269
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:42,435
That Alex was born into?

270
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:44,085
What are you implying?

271
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:47,927
- I'm simply asking if he...
- No. Let me tell you something.

272
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,602
I saw more injustices

273
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:51,927
As a child.

274
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,645
Horrors.

275
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:56,844
Did they...

276
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,707
Did they affect
my view of the world?

277
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:03,956
Of course.

278
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,264
Did they shape the manner
in which I raised my boy?

279
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,189
How could they not?

280
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,078
Strength.

281
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:19,741
Strength was essential to survival.

282
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,430
Vulnerability

283
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,579
was often a death sentence.

284
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,828
I wanted him to be safe.

285
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,767
I envy the time you spent
talking with him.

286
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:49,979
I admit...

287
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,369
Those kind of talks
embarrass the hell out of me.

288
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:56,744
This where he sat?

289
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:58,389
Yes.

290
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,584
Alex could talk.

291
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,343
He and his boy,
they'd talk for hours.

292
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:33,401
He even once told Roy
that he loved him.

293
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,115
Boy, I tell you...

294
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:38,056
Did I give him hell for that.

295
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,368
"You're trying to make
the kid a sissy or something?"

296
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,090
It was bad enough that
he didn't want to best Alex at anything.

297
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,420
He'd rather throw a chess game

298
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,878
just so's he wouldn't have
to beat his father.

299
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:54,712
Oh now, come on. That's no way
to raise a boy to be a man.

300
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:57,350
I mean, you have to challenge him,
make him compete,

301
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,363
Teach him how to fight,
take care of himself.

302
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,566
It's interesting
that you regret not being

303
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:06,068
more gentle yourself with Alex,
and yet at the same time,

304
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:09,359
You seem to justify being...
being harsh.

305
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:12,864
I hear you saying that you're a little
conflicted about the notion...

306
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,575
Mister,
I'm not in conflict about anything.

307
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,131
Is that how you tried to help Alex?

308
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:27,424
Second-guessing every word
that comes out of his mouth?

309
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:29,868
A stranger,

310
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:33,417
completely unfamiliar
with his background.

311
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:36,205
You go explaining
his world to him.

312
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,829
Actually,
our sessions were mostly

313
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:42,398
about me listening to what...
To what he had to say.

314
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:44,966
Yeah, well, there we go again
with the listening, huh?

315
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:48,175
He has his own personal
professional listener.

316
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,925
Listen,
when I smothered my father

317
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,524
do you think I paid someone
to listen to me, hmm?

318
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,383
You can't stop and dwell
on every ache and pain.

319
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,484
Maybe it's because
of what my dad did

320
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,574
or maybe it's because
of what my mother did.

321
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:03,593
Come on, you've got
to keep moving, man.

322
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,710
You know?
What good does all the talk do?

323
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,265
It's not gonna bring my father back.
You know what?

324
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,877
People like you...
You never stop to think

325
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,178
that we have a subconscious
for a reason.

326
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,598
Because there are things about
ourselves that we cannot face.

327
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,864
That we should not face.

328
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:25,533
Or else how in the world do
we get up out of bed in the morning?

329
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:28,923
I'll tell you,
World War III comes...

330
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,468
All those people who've been through

331
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,774
all of this psychoanalysis,

332
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,564
spend hundreds...
Thousands of dollars,

333
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,732
are gonna be the first ones
to lose their heads.

334
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:44,089
Darwin had a theory.
He called it survival of the fittest.

335
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,697
The fittest,
not the most self-reflective.

336
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,069
With all due respect,
I think that

337
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,244
Alex started coming here

338
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:54,294
because he felt that he needed to.

339
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,915
And you had to take him apart,
didn't you?

340
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:01,261
You had to pick at the scab.

341
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:05,241
Do you think
that Alex's therapy here

342
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:08,735
had something to do with his death?

343
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,260
You're the one who told him

344
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:14,504
he had to go look inside.

345
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,905
To reflect,

346
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,764
examine, feel.

347
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:22,900
Oh yeah, he felt.

348
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:27,648
And what did that get him?
Now he's a human pancake.

349
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,561
You're a hell
of a miracle worker, doctor.

350
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,950
Do you have a son, Mr. Weston?

351
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,016
Yes, I do.

352
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,859
And if another man,

353
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,688
someone from a different culture,

354
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,976
started giving him advice...

355
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:10,988
Every week...

356
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,340
Advice that you were pretty sure

357
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,688
would be harmful to your son...

358
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,137
What would you do?

359
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,371
Your son was a mature man

360
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,178
who decided to come here
of his own...

361
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:28,906
What would you do?

362
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,354
What would you do?

363
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,494
I would try to stop him,

364
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,478
If I could.

365
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,381
I can't get over the feeling...

366
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,374
That I was torn apart
in this room.

367
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:14,999
People have...

368
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,936
a misunderstanding
About what happens in...

369
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,115
In rooms like this.

370
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:24,819
It really isn't about...

371
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:29,277
blaming or looking
for scapegoats.

372
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,089
He was an outstanding person.

373
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,977
He was kind,

374
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:49,014
devoted,

375
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:51,465
loyal...

376
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:55,612
Too loyal.

377
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,621
Often, I wished that he...

378
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,077
would've just pleased himself, not me.

379
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:07,632
But we want to please,
don't we, Mr. Weston?

380
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:13,085
He did a lifetime
of trying to please me.

381
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,409
All that...

382
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,016
That tough...

383
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,015
That tough schooling...

384
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,991
And the training and...

385
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,400
the achievements...

386
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:37,582
That was for me.

387
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,005
I'm the one who needed it.

388
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:44,821
To feel...

389
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:47,725
that he was safe.

390
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,324
You know?

391
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,349
You son loved you.

392
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:02,349
And he had huge admiration for you.

393
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,594
He told me that.

394
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:12,103
Don't tell me that, man.

395
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:17,044
You think that comfort...

396
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:19,654
You think that comforts me?

397
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,240
No. I would have rathered...

398
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:29,395
that he hated me.

399
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,276
I would have rathered

400
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:41,848
That this was his "fuck you" to me.

401
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,391
Why do you say that?

402
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,349
For pushing him so hard...

403
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:59,728
To be tougher...

404
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:04,445
than the rest of the world.

405
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,510
I was so stupid.

406
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:22,987
Did I kill my son?

407
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:32,683
I killed my father
with my own two hands.

408
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,141
Did I kill my son too?

409
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:40,900
No, whatever happened
up there was not your fault.

410
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:42,862
You're not responsible.

411
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,380
We'll never know, will we?

412
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,547
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

413
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:15,349
I'd appreciate it very much
if you'd call me a taxi, please.

414
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:17,763
Sure.
