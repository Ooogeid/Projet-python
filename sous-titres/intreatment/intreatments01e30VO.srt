1
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:12,705
- How are you?
- Okay.

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,725
I made us some tea.

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,745
Give me your cell.

4
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,513
- Leave... Leave the ringer on.
- That's kind of the point.

5
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:30,068
We've been waiting for Rosie
to check in all day.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,614
She slept over
at a friend's house and...

7
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,236
She hasn't checked in yet.

8
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,697
At least that's what she said.

9
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,395
But Lord knows
it's not the first time in History

10
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,642
that a teenager say
she's gonna stay at a friend's

11
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,748
and then she ends up somewhere else.

12
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,127
So where is she?

13
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:48,704
Do you think
I'm withholding information?

14
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:49,874
Are you?

15
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:01,232
Season 1, Episode 30

16
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:05,349
Subtitles: Anyone, Coffee, Tagne

17
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:15,369
Anyway...

18
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,418
Sarah's parents are away and...

19
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:22,234
and Rosie's not answering her phone,
so it's a little convenient.

20
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,654
Didn't this happen a few weeks ago?

21
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:27,866
But this time
she's been gone for 24 hours.

22
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,862
I mean, she is at that age,
isn't she?

23
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:33,380
- That makes it okay?
- No, I didn't say that.

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,253
Kate doesn't trust her when she says
she's staying with a friend,

25
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:37,883
that's the cause for concern.

26
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,010
I'm pretty concerned.

27
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,205
Hence, the two phones laid out.

28
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,482
When did you last talk to her?

29
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:48,268
Yesterday, when I was at work.

30
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,312
I don't know if Paul told you,
but I run a shelter for battered women

31
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,018
and it's also a center
for youths at risk.

32
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,402
And Rosie volunteers there
about 4 times a week.

33
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:59,296
She told me she'd be there
and then go to Sarah's,

34
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,449
but she did say it in her responsible
voice, which should've tipped me off.

35
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:07,018
Anyway, Sarah's parents
are in Mexico and...

36
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,874
I don't know, maybe the girls drove off
somewhere after school.

37
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:12,301
Sarah's got a car.

38
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:14,531
And Rosie was probably
afraid to tell us

39
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,185
- because you might flip out and...
- I'd flip out?

40
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:20,993
Who knows? I don't know.

41
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,807
What kind of work does Rosie do
at the center?

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,170
Whatever's needed, basically,

43
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,862
from writing up schedules
to running errands.

44
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,738
She sits in on interviews sometimes

45
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:37,859
just so she can get a sense
of how we evaluate people,

46
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:41,155
how much trouble they may be in
and how much help they may need.

47
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,036
Four times a week...

48
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,908
It's a commitment
for a 16-year-old kid.

49
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,536
17-year-old next month.

50
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:51,165
It's interesting,
because when Rosie's volunteering,

51
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,382
- all of a sudden she's an adult.
- She's a born social worker.

52
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:57,129
Always has been,
ever since she was a kid.

53
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,861
How did she show that
when she was younger?

54
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:05,230
She was always the mediator
with her friends on the playground.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,057
You know, organizing,
making it peace, that kind of thing.

56
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:10,487
Even her teachers remarked on it.

57
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,581
And you heard this where? I don't...

58
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,522
I don't really recall you at too many
parent-teacher conferences...

59
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:18,246
I was on the PTA board at Arlington,
remember?

60
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,610
Paul,
I mean, come on, you went twice.

61
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:26,899
Did you ever see Rosie
take on this mediator role at home?

62
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:34,302
What she means is
was Rosie our social worker?

63
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:36,627
See, Gina can't conceive of
a child being born

64
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,463
with an intrinsic desire to help
other people

65
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:43,275
without it being a coping
mechanism for... For something else.

66
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:44,911
Right?

67
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,229
Rosie's always been interested
in being of service,

68
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,740
and that's something we encouraged.

69
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:59,038
- Did we?
- I encouraged it.

70
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,986
I think it's great. I think
it's incredible that she volunteers.

71
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,410
I talk to her about everything
she sees down at the center,

72
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,532
and it's certainly
not her responsibility

73
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:17,514
to deal with any of the hardcore cases
or anything like that.

74
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:19,728
I make sure that she's not
in over her head.

75
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:22,748
I tell her who's who
and what's going on and...

76
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:34,560
I do, I agree with you. I think
four times a week is a little too much.

77
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,604
You know, there might be a little more
to it for Rosie

78
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,273
than a desire to help.

79
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,361
What Gina is saying
is that Rosie might be working around

80
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:47,641
at-risk youths
because she's distressed herself.

81
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,557
Paul, do you really think
Kate and I need an interpreter?

82
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,146
Sorry.

83
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,999
When did she start volunteering?

84
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,685
It was... What?
About six months ago.

85
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,380
And I was thrilled at first because

86
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,361
it meant she was spending less time
at the mall with her friends, but...

87
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:10,054
I'm thinking
she may need more of that.

88
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:13,729
- What, more time at the mall?
- No, you know what I mean.

89
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,049
Just doing stupid teenager stuff.

90
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:20,223
Why should she be so concerned
with the world's problems at her age?

91
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,540
I don't think
that's what Gina's saying.

92
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,915
She's saying that Rosie
is drawn to the place

93
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,109
because she's trying
to say something to us,

94
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,240
- but that we're oblivious...
- Can I speak for myself?

95
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:34,501
- It's not what you're trying to get at?
- It's not for you to say that.

96
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,415
Sorry.

97
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,965
You know, even if Rosie
has a desire or a vocation

98
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,959
to help other people, I'm wondering:

99
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,852
How much of that do you think
a 17-year-old kid needs?

100
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,472
16. She's still 16.

101
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:53,211
16.

102
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,017
So, yes, Paul, she may be trying
to shine a light on something.

103
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,977
Okay, that's it.
I'm gonna try her again,

104
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:06,602
since apparently her volunteering
is a cry for help.

105
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,322
Thank god. It's ringing.

106
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,251
I'm gonna kill you.
Where the hell have you...

107
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,794
- No, because we have...
- Let me talk to her.

108
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,222
Since when does that happen?

109
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,830
Let me talk to her, please.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,727
When you sleep away, you're supposed
to call first thing in the morning.

111
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:37,447
That was the agreement
and you know it.

112
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,363
No, we will discuss this at home.

113
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,561
No, because we're out.
We're talking to someone.

114
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,483
An... an accountant.

115
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,654
No, you don't know him... her.

116
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,307
No, he's sitting right here,

117
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:56,493
and he is looking none too pleased
about any of this.

118
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:00,372
We'll talk at home, Rosie.

119
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,083
All right.

120
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,513
So I'm not allowed to speak to her?

121
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,755
She claimed she got to Sarah's
late last night,

122
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,341
they were late for school
this morning and get this:

123
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,518
she didn't realize
her phone was off,

124
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:15,480
which is a little like me not realizing
my head's on fire, but...

125
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,755
She is not staying there again.

126
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,058
Okay, well, you tell her that.

127
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,897
If I were Gina, I'd ask, "Why now?"

128
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,728
- "Why now" what?
- Well, if a couple came to me

129
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:31,194
with this problem, I'd say
"Why is she choosing to act out now?"

130
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,406
That's what you'd ask? Really?

131
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,315
Maybe you should call that couple,
ask them and then get back to me.

132
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:40,417
She's doing this on purpose.
It's obvious.

133
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,145
She senses a conflict between us
and she's turning it around,

134
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:46,043
so that she's given us a taste
of what it's like to worry about her.

135
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,037
She's a teenager. There's not
some master plan involved here.

136
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,226
This is just how teenage girls are,
right?

137
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:54,067
I mean, it's just how they think
or don't think, in this case.

138
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,803
No, Kate, it's not conscious,

139
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:58,354
but it's working.

140
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:02,226
Rosie vanishes and you become
functioning parents.

141
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,422
You're united
in your concern for her.

142
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:15,093
Do you think that Rosie senses
the conflict between you?

143
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,249
I think we've been pretty good
about pretending.

144
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,965
We've actually gotten pretty skilled
at that.

145
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,582
So, why now?

146
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,982
As Paul asked, why now?

147
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,802
Did something happen?
What do you think she's reacting to?

148
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,274
I'd say it's more tense actually.

149
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:39,647
More tense?

150
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,141
Kate ran into Laura.

151
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:45,936
I didn't run into her, I saw her
as she was leaving the house.

152
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,752
- The house?
- My office.

153
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:50,024
His office, the house, my home,

154
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:52,275
whatever.
It's a little blurred, isn't it?

155
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:55,375
- Didn't you say she stopped therapy?
- He did say that, didn't he?

156
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:58,503
Her father was hospitalized
and she asked me if she could come by.

157
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:02,311
- She was pretty upset.
- Please... please don't do that.

158
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,427
- What?
- Describing her

159
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:08,154
like she's this fragile little thing,
like she's some poor lost soul.

160
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:09,850
She's not.

161
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:11,456
I saw her.

162
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,298
How did she seem to you?

163
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,436
She's Tammy Kent.

164
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,436
- What?
- Who's Tammy Kent?

165
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,387
How is she Tammy Kent?

166
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:26,477
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

167
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,127
May I ask who this is?

168
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,038
This was a girl that Paul was
in love with when we first met.

169
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,887
- A long time ago.
- Whatever.

170
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,429
- They're exactly the same type...
- No, they're not.

171
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,917
Yes, they are...
And he made Laura out to be

172
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:47,437
this fragile little girl,
and I am telling you, what I saw

173
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,003
was this highly-sexual woman
wearing stilettos at ten in the morning.

174
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,727
I did not describe her like that.
If you formed an image...

175
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:57,842
No... but you let me think

176
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:00,165
she was one of your fatherless
walking wounded.

177
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,304
No, you rushed
to that conclusion yourself.

178
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:06,040
And what he also forgot to mention
is that she's stunningly beautiful.

179
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,683
And very young,
but that's no surprise, is it?

180
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,611
Jesus Christ,
it's the goddamn history of the world,

181
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,425
leaving your middle-aged wife and...

182
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:16,818
God.
Isn't it a little embarrassing for you

183
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,197
that you've turned out
to be like every third man?

184
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,126
I mean, you've spent your entire life
studying the human condition

185
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:26,411
and now you're just following
your dick around like a caveman.

186
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,020
This woman, Laura, she's got this...

187
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,634
This spoiled, aloof

188
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,173
and calculated look.

189
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,108
And she has this, uh...

190
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,940
This air of self-confidence

191
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,867
that is quite obviously bullshit,

192
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:57,151
because if anything real
ever happened to her,

193
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,963
she wouldn't know what to do.

194
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,466
She was so fake.

195
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:03,068
And all this you saw
while you were taking out the trash.

196
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,599
Yes, that's right,
just by looking at her.

197
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,163
Like it or not,
everything's communicated.

198
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,746
Another one of your lines.

199
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:12,669
And you just happened to be there
as she was...

200
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,334
Don't keep doing that.

201
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:18,170
You're making me out to look like
I'm some loose-cannon, demented wife.

202
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,549
If she is all that, spoiled and a fake,
why are you so threatened by her?

203
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,261
Because my husband
is in love with her.

204
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:35,855
And because she's the kind
of woman who always gets her man.

205
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,626
A woman like that
has always been his fantasy...

206
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,376
Gorgeous, self-centered,
unattainable.

207
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:54,728
That's what I want?
It's... It's good to know that.

208
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,879
You don't see yourself that way?

209
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:06,845
So, you're not Paul's fantasy?

210
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:09,886
No, I'm not.

211
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,220
Yet he married you.

212
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:20,679
I guess he got a raw deal,
didn't he?

213
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,530
He wanted the trophy wife
and he got stuck with a homemaker.

214
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,196
I'm just a good mom.

215
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:30,868
Pretty boring.

216
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,795
Come on, Kate, listen to yourself.
You're completely invalidating your...

217
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:36,531
Your sexuality for a start.

218
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,858
I think we both know that you could've
done better if you'd wanted to.

219
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:43,136
I fell in love with you, not just
because you're beautiful and sexy,

220
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:44,525
but because...

221
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,126
Because of your strength.

222
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:50,498
Her strength?

223
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:56,872
She was... she was grounded
and honest and dependable.

224
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:02,379
I needed that.
I think we both needed that.

225
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:10,742
Not anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

226
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,100
I need you.

227
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,351
I've always loved you,
wanted you and needed you.

228
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:39,196
But not like Laura.
You never ever wanted me like that.

229
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:40,993
How can you say that?

230
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:44,680
You keep jumping
to these conclusions that make no...

231
00:13:56,964 --> 00:14:00,068
Kate, you said
you didn't need Paul anymore.

232
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,998
Can you talk about that a little?

233
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,475
I don't need him like I used to...

234
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:15,456
Not like I thought I needed him.

235
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:20,905
I don't know, maybe I don't even need
a partner at all.

236
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:25,862
I mean, would I like one?
Yeah, of course.

237
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,421
But it would be awfully nice
if that person were

238
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,741
a bit more present and available.

239
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,396
But do I need it?

240
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,040
If that's the question...

241
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,679
No, I think I've learned to live
without it.

242
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:51,593
What kind of partner
could you see yourself with?

243
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't know.

244
00:14:57,255 --> 00:15:00,485
I mean, you know, my frame
of reference for two and a half decades

245
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,105
has been Paul, so...

246
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:07,937
Our friends, their husbands,
what the hell do I know

247
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,031
about what they're really like?

248
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,406
What goes on behind closed doors?
I mean, do we know...

249
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,218
Any couple, really?

250
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,586
It's not like I sit around
daydreaming about it

251
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:24,126
or I have some fantastic flight of fancy
about some perfect man or...

252
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,758
I could be with a serial killer as long
as he told me about his damn day.

253
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,763
And it's not just about
being wanted.

254
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,039
I know that's what I said last week.

255
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:51,215
And wanted is good. I mean, of course,
everybody wants that, but...

256
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:59,544
I just want to be
a part of something.

257
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,375
It doesn't have to be big...

258
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:05,096
And it doesn't have to be grand.

259
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:16,156
But I'll tell you something
about women like Laura.

260
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:17,531
It...

261
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:23,309
They're just all about sex.
You know, that's their currency.

262
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,938
That's... Not the actual sex itself,
that's not what I'm saying.

263
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:30,148
It's... sex as this thing
that controls,

264
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,580
that determines the distance
between her and someone else,

265
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,079
and I cannot compete with that.

266
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:50,720
Laura isn't a sexual object
for Paul.

267
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,257
Their relationship
isn't based on that.

268
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,361
It's more...

269
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,564
chaste.

270
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:02,318
She's not his sexual fantasy.
It's not about lust.

271
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,141
The real threat is...

272
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,874
That he may actually
have fallen in love with her.

273
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:20,106
You know,
you said you were drawn to him.

274
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,826
You married him
because you admired him...

275
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:26,025
Because he paid
such deep attention to you.

276
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:27,946
You were grateful

277
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:30,370
that you felt you were interesting.

278
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,847
That dynamic of

279
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:37,991
patient-therapist was satisfying
to both of you at that point...

280
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,758
- But I think...
- Jesus...

281
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,373
Please let me do my job here.

282
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,269
Your job of what,
rushing to conclusions?

283
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:50,580
Eventually, Kate, you felt
that it wasn't satisfying for you.

284
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,561
You've outgrown that dependency.

285
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:57,993
You've outgrown
that part of your marriage.

286
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,854
You said
you don't need Paul anymore,

287
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,796
you don't need to be taken care of

288
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,057
and Paul may have sensed this.

289
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,041
You're drifting away
from under his wing,

290
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:13,289
and suddenly
he finds himself confused

291
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,723
about his feelings for a patient.

292
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,122
Laura is dependent on Paul.

293
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,947
He's her therapist,
her elder, her guide.

294
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,185
Dependency defines
that relationship.

295
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,740
I see, so she's not
my groupie anymore,

296
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,525
so I found somebody to...

297
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:37,757
To replace her. Is that your theory?
Nice one, Gina.

298
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,985
See, your problem is
you think it's impossible

299
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,450
to fall in love with a patient
without some kind of...

300
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,062
pathology surrounding
the whole thing.

301
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,983
You're trying to redefine yourself
in your marriage,

302
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:58,744
to see yourself not as a dependant
but as an equal.

303
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:02,234
Do you think you can do that
and stay with Paul?

304
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,304
Gina, for fuck's sake. If I'm...

305
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,486
this narcissistic monster
that you're talking about

306
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,673
who has to be admired
and worshipped and needed,

307
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:16,111
how does that fit with me sitting here
trying to address the problem

308
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,674
- that we've brought to you?
- I'm not saying you're a monster.

309
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,594
In fact, if you'll listen,

310
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,335
I'm not even saying it's all you.

311
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,091
Paul may not see you as an equal,

312
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,915
but perhaps
you've contributed to that.

313
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,952
Maybe it's how you wanted
to be seen.

314
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:39,111
It's what was comfortable for you.

315
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,397
Yeah, 25 years, I always felt
he could walk out at any minute.

316
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:46,596
Was that part of the attraction?

317
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,432
Would you stop it? Would you stop

318
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:52,628
putting these poisonous
fucking words into her mouth?

319
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,773
You've ignored me
in this conversation.

320
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:59,817
You see what she's doing: instructing
you on what you should be feeling.

321
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,986
It's fucking reckless.
Why are you speeding this up, Gina?

322
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:06,008
Do you want to meddle, is that it?
To see how fast you can do this?

323
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:09,807
Pushing Kate to a place
that usually takes months if not years?

324
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,109
- That's not what I'm doing.
- What takes months?

325
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,798
What she's saying is that you have
a predisposition to be rejected,

326
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:19,361
to not be my equal,
that you're reacting to your childhood.

327
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,407
That is rushing the process, Gina.

328
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:26,739
Here's the way I think it works: you're
supposed to focus on the couple first,

329
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,388
then talk to them about their parents
and their childhood.

330
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,576
Do it the other way,
they blame each other:

331
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,527
"I knew it. Your mother fucked you up
and you take it out on me."

332
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:36,771
Do see you see
how destructive that is?

333
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,174
Maybe you don't want
to talk about childhoods

334
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:41,692
because we'd end up talking
about your childhood.

335
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:44,615
So we're back to where we started.
You saw me after 10 years

336
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,824
and right away you decided
I'm my father.

337
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,109
And like him,
I'm in love with my patient

338
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,300
and I'm pushing Kate
to have an affair

339
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,611
so that I can have an excuse
to leave the house.

340
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:56,177
And now, of course, Kate...
an hour and a half with her

341
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:57,822
and everything fits perfectly.

342
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,298
- Game, set and match to you, Gina.
- You know what?

343
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,421
I can't really do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:06,033
I know this was my idea, but...
I knew, deep down, that if I came here

345
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:09,053
it would turn into this history
between you two. And I'm sorry,

346
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:11,261
it's really not helpful to me.

347
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:14,031
- I apologize...
- I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry.

348
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:33,095
- I'll see you next week, okay?
- Good night.
