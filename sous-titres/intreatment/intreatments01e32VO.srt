2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,694
- I don't think I can do this.
- Do what?

3
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:12,004
This therapy. I...

4
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:15,259
I don't think
it's leading anywhere, that's all.

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,081
Where do you want it to lead, Alex?

6
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:21,114
Someplace where I feel
less shitty about myself.

7
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,260
I got a call from my wing commander,
he's trying to figure out if i'm ready

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,828
for active duty.

9
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,040
What do you think?

10
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,313
I don't think you're ready.

11
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:44,715
Well, I feel like
I should salute you.

12
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,594
At ease, doc.

13
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,288
This is gonna be my last time,

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,884
for a while anyway.

15
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:55,663
I'm here to settle up.
And I need something from you.

16
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,846
Would you like some coffee?

17
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,030
Sure.

Transcript: FRM Team
Sync: Benj!

19
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,624
I know I'm not giving you any notice.
You want me to pay

20
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,283
- for the next session too?
- No, that's fine.

21
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,392
Sorry the gravy train
is ending here, doc.

22
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:33,580
That's okay.
So why are you leaving?

23
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,701
I got you curious, huh?

24
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:38,884
Remember I told you
my squadron commander called me?

25
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,832
Well, last week
they finally brought me in.

26
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,302
Now I thought they wanted
to ease me back in, but no.

27
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,330
They need me to train the next wave
of pilots for their deployment,

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,162
Get them ready to fly asap.

29
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,493
Always playing catch-up in this war.

30
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,853
- So what did you say to them?
- I said, "Fuck you!

31
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,993
"I'm 39 years old,
in the prime of my life

32
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:57,406
"and one of the most decorated
fighter pilots in the Navy.

33
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,423
"No, you're not
gonna put me out to pasture,

34
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:02,222
"not in the middle of a war.
Get yourself another boy."

35
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:06,348
- That's what you said to them?
- Well, not really, but I thought it.

36
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:08,798
Actually what I said was,

37
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:11,605
"Yes, sir. However I can be
of service to you, sir." And...

38
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,869
I reported for duty the next day.
You think I'm crazy?

39
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,916
I can only get away
with that bullshit with you.

40
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,371
Well, at least we know
why you come here.

41
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,497
So what's it like
being back at base?

42
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,041
It's been a real trip.

43
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,793
Most of these guys are right
out of topgun, cocky as hell.

44
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,621
When they look in my eyes,
they know i've been places

45
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,972
they couldn't conjure up
in their worst nightmares.

46
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,306
Makes them think twice
before fucking with me.

47
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,249
So, training young pilots...

48
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,851
Is that something you can
see yourself doing?

49
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,662
I don't know,
maybe in another context.

50
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,362
But this is set up to fail.

51
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,986
There's no way these kids are gonna be
ready for combat missions in a month.

52
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,283
I mean, it's crazy.

53
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,559
I'm taking them through
tactical situations.

54
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,462
Some of them are doing
better than others,

55
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,669
but when you're up in the air,
it's read and react.

56
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:02,373
Read, react, like a machine.
No thinking. It's like split-second

57
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:05,426
decisions that can cost thousands
of lives, including their own.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,532
Most of these kids, they look at me on
the simulators and they're like, "whoa!"

59
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,420
Well, they're blown away.

60
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,101
That must feel really great.

61
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,634
I overheard a couple of these kids
talking shit about me,

62
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:20,812
Saying that I might be good
on the simulators

63
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,876
but they'd kick my ass
on the obstacle course.

64
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,544
Called me old man,
all that bullshit. Well, hey...

65
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,034
I called their bluff.
Check this out: now the drill

66
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,358
is called the gauntlet.
It's a five-mile run through dense woods

67
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:36,781
and sand traps, and rope-and-barrier
hurdles, balance beams

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,480
and a maze. Now after all that,

69
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,825
there's the helo-dunker.

70
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:45,217
Nothe helo-Dunker
is like this giant...

71
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:46,982
It looks like a beer can.

72
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,644
It's basically a crash simulator.

73
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:52,281
We hit the water hard,
upside down, strapped in tight.

74
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,216
And we have to get out

75
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:58,094
with almost no oxygen.
We're in full gear: helmet, spacesuit,

76
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,308
G-suit, gloves, the whole nine yards.

77
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,984
Now there are four immersions.

78
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,960
The last two, the water's dark.

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,762
It's like a night landing.

80
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,696
A lot of these kids,
they get disoriented

81
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,329
and start flipping the fuck out.

82
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,424
So we have to rescue them.

83
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,777
It's tough.

84
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,554
It separates the men from the boys,
let me tell you.

85
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,127
So, doc...

86
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,345
how do you think I did?

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,378
Do I really have to guess, Alex?

88
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,102
Touche.

89
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:30,149
I never panic.

90
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,670
I'm at home down there
in the dark,

91
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,549
swimming for my life.

92
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,942
And not only did I beat
all their asses,

93
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,888
I came within two seconds
of a base record.

94
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,312
Not bad for a broken-down
old pilot, huh?

95
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:49,964
Come on, Paul.

96
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,110
Okay, so my squadron commander
calls me back up to his office.

97
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,532
This time all the brass
were there

98
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,773
and they want to know if i'm interested
in going back to active duty.

99
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:02,160
If I am, I have to go through
a modified basic training

100
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,756
at Pensacola, a battery of tests...
Physical, psychological...

101
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,964
Just to make sure
I've recovered.

102
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:08,547
So I said,

103
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,335
"bring it on, baby!
I'm ready for anything!"

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,793
Are you surprised?

105
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,982
Well, a little, I guess.

106
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,226
I shouldn't be, but I suppose
it was always a possibility.

107
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:23,911
But you think it's too fast, right?

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,855
Do you think it's too fast?

109
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,912
Doc, you have no idea

110
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,176
how good
it feels to be useful again.

111
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,478
To tell you the truth, I think
that's been the real problem.

112
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:39,931
I've been sitting around
feeling sorry for myself.

113
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,553
I'm a doer, not a talker,

114
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,357
so all of this... That's over.

115
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,202
Those days are over.
So here's what I need from you:

116
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,814
You're gonna get a call
from one of your compatriots.

117
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:51,959
He's a Navy doctor named Connell.
He's gonna be checking up on me.

118
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:55,632
You told the Navy you were seeing me?
I thought that was professional suicide.

119
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,338
Yeah, they caught wind
that I had left the house.

120
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:01,536
They wanted to know if it had anything
to do wit the bombing and the aftermath.

121
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,930
So I told them i'd been doing
some counseling with you...

122
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,801
You know, my marriage...
And that I was fit as a fiddle.

123
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,204
- Do you feel fit as a fiddle?
- Paul, don't fuck with me on this.

124
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,327
You're talking about
my career now.

125
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,012
Just tell him all good things.
Plus, the Navy needs me.

126
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:19,281
You think they can afford to have
someone like me just pissing around?

127
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,915
Just tell him i'm ready.

128
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:23,286
Let's just talk about
whether you are ready or not.

129
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,901
Hey, cut the crap! I need this.

130
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:29,196
You're putting me in a very
difficult position, Alex.

131
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,797
We talked about a lot more
than michaela.

132
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,009
You don't expect me to lie, do you?

133
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,460
Okay, physically i'm fine.

134
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,973
I had the heart attack
almost four months ago.

135
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,302
All the cardiologists say that...

136
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,105
They're amazed by my recovery.
I can handle it.

137
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,767
But what about emotionally, Alex?

138
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,757
Can you imagine yourself
back in an airplane

139
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,702
flying a mission
after what happened?

140
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:52,287
You're talking about the madrasa thing?

141
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:55,980
The madrasa thing is the crisis that
brought you here in the first place.

142
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:58,079
Are you sure that you're ready

143
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,669
to put yourself in that kind
of situation again?

144
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,289
No, listen.
Terrorists hide among civilians.

145
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,503
It's a common tactic.
It's their fault

146
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:08,071
if there's collateral damage,
not ours.

147
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,549
They're the ones putting their
women and children at risk.

148
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,172
Let's put aside the question
of who's at fault or who isn't.

149
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,018
Could you live with yourself

150
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,803
if you were responsible
for more civilian casualties?

151
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,099
That's bullshit.

152
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,208
Alex, you gave yourself
a heart attack a few months ago.

153
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,462
Can you honestly tell me
that you're not worried,

154
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,928
that you're not scared
that your guilt will lead to...

155
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,196
Guilt is not an issue
for a pilot in a time of war.

156
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:35,744
- We're not trained to think that way.
- I'm not asking what you think.

157
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,655
I'm asking you to
tell me what you feel.

158
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:40,902
And i'm telling you it doesn't matter.

159
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,453
Let me just see who this is.
Sorry.

160
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,761
It went fine.

161
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,967
Yeah, they did ask me.

162
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,658
No, I can't talk about that right now.
Can I call you back?

163
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,872
Michaela, let me go, all right?
I'm with somebody right now.

164
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:10,689
Yeah, I will.

165
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:12,468
Yeah, bye.

166
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:15,378
Sorry.

167
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,999
She wanted to know how the meeting
with the brass went.

168
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:22,350
You know, she's totally obsessed
with me flying again. You know that.

169
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:25,073
Why do you think she's so
anxious for you to fly again?

170
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,905
Well, my little sabbatical

171
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:28,941
upset her sense of order.

172
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,175
If it was a couple of weeks,
it would be all right.

173
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,044
I was taking a break, whatever.

174
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,789
I told you we were having dinner
to discuss me coming back home.

175
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,038
Yeah, well, the heat is on.

176
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,497
I don't think
I can fight it any longer.

177
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,718
- Plus it's what everybody wants.
- Everyone?

178
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,118
Everybody... My father included.

179
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:48,363
Well, he and michaela,
they're united in everything.

180
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:51,128
Why is you father so anxious
for you to fly again?

181
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:55,112
Well, there's nothing
deep behind it, Paul.

182
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,910
He thinks I need to get back to my job.
It's what a man does.

183
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,525
And he's right.

184
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,901
Can you tell me how you got
to that conclusion?

185
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,283
Are you sure you have time for that?
'Cause I...

186
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,807
We've got plenty of time.
I think this is something important

187
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:13,570
we need to talk about especially if you
are trying to push me for an assessment.

188
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,125
It's hot as hell in here.

189
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,973
We had a party for my son,

190
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,589
A birthday party...

191
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:40,667
And everything became clear.

192
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,632
I told you my son roy
is a special kid.

193
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:48,118
Have I told you that?

194
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:49,881
He doesn't seem to need friends.

195
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:53,177
So, when we asked him what kind of
party he wanted, he said only family.

196
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:54,520
I supported that.

197
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:57,374
I didn't want to force him
to be anything he isn't.

198
00:09:57,624 --> 00:09:59,563
So all the uncles and aunts
came and the cousins,

199
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,573
and everybody was
in a good mood.

200
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,238
My dad, he got there early.

201
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,168
He's establishing
and setting up everything

202
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,988
and acting like he owns the place,

203
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,702
ordering my wife around.

204
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,773
I could tell he had been
there a lot since I left.

205
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:14,030
And the bitch he married,
she was there too,

206
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,876
in the kitchen cooking
as if my mother never existed.

207
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,849
It made me feel like shit,

208
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:20,967
Like a...

209
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,127
A stranger in my own home.

210
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:26,818
My father sees me and he gives me
one of those cold smiles.

211
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,696
"Alex, nice of you to make it."

212
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,217
I could tell he had

213
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,511
a wild hair up his ass
about something.

214
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:38,780
But I didn't ask.

215
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,679
'Cause when he wants
to share, he shares.

216
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,401
And then he's all over me,

217
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,571
And i'm in no rush to get there.

218
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,788
But he is great with roy, though.
They connect.

219
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,414
Somehow it's easy for them.

220
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:54,902
Did you feel like you weren't
connecting with roy?

221
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:01,279
There were a lot of people there.
We didn't have much time alone.

222
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,991
Have you seen a lot of him
since you left home?

223
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:08,039
Once, twice. I don't know
what you consider a lot.

224
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:12,526
Did he ever ask why you weren't
living at home anymore?

225
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:15,478
Yeah. I told him his dad

226
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,196
was on a special mission.

227
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,555
I mean, i'm gone half the time.
He's used to it.

228
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,009
To tell you the truth,
i think it's been a relief for him.

229
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,721
Why would it be a relief
for his dad to be away?

230
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,007
Well...

231
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,014
He was loose as hell
at the party.

232
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,511
He's running around,
he's playing with his cousins,

233
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,972
he's talking to everybody.

234
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,245
You should have seen him.
He was a different person.

235
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,310
He was open, he was outgoing.

236
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,338
It's like he bloomed
in my absence.

237
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,717
Well, not bloomed.

238
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,941
Jeez, he's not a fucking flower.
It's like he spread his wings.

239
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,567
Yeah, that's what it was like.

240
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,734
Maybe he was happy
because you were there,

241
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,575
Maybe because he was
just glad to see you.

242
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,101
It's interesting
when you talk about flying, Alex,

243
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,740
because you make no bones
whatsoever about the fact

244
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,010
that the Navy really needs you,

245
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,414
that they can't do it without you.

246
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,850
Yet when it comes to talking
about your son...

247
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,970
Paul, Paul, slow the fuck down.

248
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,995
The boy was having a great day
before I ever got there.

249
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:17,338
Is it possible
that you're projecting

250
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:20,224
your own feelings about
your father onto your son?

251
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,946
How do you mean?

252
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,067
Well, that you might be
doing better yourself||

253
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,493
spreading your wings too
if he wasn't there,

254
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,799
If he wasn't...

255
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,593
in your way, so to speak.

256
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,985
No, doc, my being there

257
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,864
didn't make the kid happy that day.

258
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:36,653
Just the opposite in fact.

259
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,335
How? What happened?

260
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,445
I told you roy was
obsessed with chess, right?

261
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,004
I got him this magnificent set.

262
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,502
It was all ivory,
imported from Nairobi,

263
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,235
Just a real work of art.

264
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,225
And he just looked at the pieces,
mesmerized.

265
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:56,311
But the board, that was only
half of the gift. The other half...

266
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:58,631
was that I had been working
on my own chess game

267
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,195
And I was gonna play my boy.

268
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,605
So we sat down at the chessboard.
Everybody's watching.

269
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:08,171
I thought
i'd open with something simple...

270
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,885
The king's indian, which is
where you establish your pawns

271
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,472
in the center of the board.

272
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,788
Then he moved, and I countered.

273
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,880
And he moved again.
I countered again.

274
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,909
And we're moving along
at this real nice clip

275
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,900
and I think I'm holding my own.

276
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:22,824
And then...

277
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,566
I'll never forget it.
He looked up suddenly

278
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,300
and it was like a shadow
fell over his face.

279
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:35,181
And he stood up from
the table and he said,

280
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,974
"I'm not feeling well.
I don't want to play."

281
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,363
He goes up to his bedroom.

282
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,814
I follow him up the stairs.
I knock on the door.

283
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,813
He doesn't answer. I crack
the door open and I see him.

284
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,734
He's sitting at his desk.
He's got his back to me.

285
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,563
I don't know if he heard me.

286
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:56,391
I was about to say something,
but I didn't.

287
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,753
I just stood there and I stared
at the back of his head.

288
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,145
Something about him...
I don't know what it was...

289
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:09,150
It broke my heart.

290
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:15,127
Then I heard these footsteps coming up
behind me, I turn around

291
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:18,662
and it's my father. And he says,
"you know why he quit, don't you?"

292
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,840
I shook my head.

293
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,762
And he gives me that look,
that look that sees right through you.

294
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:27,483
He says,
"He knew in three moves, Alex,

295
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,343
"You were gonna lose.

296
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:33,030
"He didn't want to beat his father
in front of the whole family.

297
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,871
"He felt sorry for you."

298
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:37,788
Do you think he was right?

299
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,891
Yeah, I know he was right.
That's my son to a tee.

300
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:46,460
Then my father, he pulls me into
a room and he just ripped into me.

301
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,320
He says, "You are pathetic.

302
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,068
"One thing goes wrong
in your little cushy life

303
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,197
"and you turn soft as butter."

304
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,924
He didn't understand why
I wasn't eager to fly again

305
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:00,056
or why I was away from home
doing god knows what

306
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,064
With god knows who
like a fucking teenager.

307
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,234
He says, "You disappoint me, boy.

308
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:07,328
"I raised you to be stronger than that.
I raised you to be a man."

309
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,644
And he wanted to know who put
all these ideas in my head.

310
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,245
Who turned me into a...
What did he...

311
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,364
Who turned me into a selfish,
whining little bitch.

312
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:18,274
Was it the fags
I was hanging around with?

313
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:21,445
Or was it... And this one he really
seized on... Was it the shrink?

314
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,479
How would he know
you were seeing a shrink?

315
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,611
- Michaela told him.
- You told her?

316
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,835
Yeah, I had to.

317
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,266
You know i've been paying you cash,

318
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,248
'cause I was trying
to avoid a paper trail.

319
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,461
But that means i've been withdrawing
from atms all the time.

320
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,424
Michaela looks at
the bank statements

321
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,377
and she saw
there wasn't money there,

322
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,167
she wanted to know
where it was going.

323
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:45,884
Anyway, look, I told her
I've been consulting with someone

324
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:49,119
about my thoughts...
And that was the word, "thoughts"...

325
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,514
My thoughts about me and her.

326
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:53,724
And did you get into that,

327
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,691
your thoughts about
the two of you?

328
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,138
No, she shut down.

329
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,448
So anyway, listen. My father...

330
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,680
Yeah, my father...
He gives me this whole earful.

331
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,170
He goes downstairs, and, man...

332
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,984
I felt like I had been
hit by a freight train.

333
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,381
I locked myself
in the bathroom and I sat there

334
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,865
so I could just catch my breath.

335
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:32,717
And when I finally got my shit together
I went back downstairs, and...

336
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:37,754
And everybody was around
the chessboard again

337
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:39,982
watching another match,
including Michaela.

338
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:41,060
And...

339
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,422
You know what it was?
It was my father

340
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,628
and my son
and they are locked in this epic battle,

341
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,290
Matching each other move for move.

342
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,990
Totally out of my league.

343
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,036
And everyone's oohing and ahhing

344
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,301
Aand they didn't even
notice that I was there.

345
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,469
What was it about Roy
that broke your heart

346
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,404
when you were watching him
in his room?

347
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,147
He seemed so...

348
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,526
Vulnerable, somehow.

349
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,996
Vulnerable to what?

350
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,376
I don't know, really.

351
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:27,467
Everything...

352
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,461
Forces, expectations,

353
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:35,543
Stuff coming at him
that he can't control,

354
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,421
I can't control.

355
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,145
So I slipped out of the house

356
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,036
without anyone knowing.

357
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,819
It was for the better.

358
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,154
For whom?

359
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,684
For my boy.

360
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,154
Do you really think that your son

361
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,981
is better off
without his father on his birthday?

362
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,304
Yeah, I do.

363
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:07,097
After that
I got in my car and I drove,

364
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,196
And drove and drove, fast.

365
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,950
And when I finally ran out of gas
it was after dark.

366
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,365
I wound up at this bar

367
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:18,987
that Sean and Daniel had taken me to.

368
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:22,114
And I started to drink hard,

369
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,870
looking at all the faggots
prancing around.

370
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,466
I felt like knocking somebody's
teeth down their fucking throat.

371
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:36,681
But nobody came near me.
They didn't even look at me.

372
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:41,257
It was kind of like they knew like I had
this invisible force field around me.

373
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,759
You said before that

374
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,888
when you started
telling me about the party,

375
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,774
that everything
became clear that day.

376
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,839
What was it that became clear?

377
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,002
That I needed to go.

378
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,714
I needed to get back to the Navy...

379
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,408
Discipline, order,
"Yes, sir, no, sir."

380
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,404
Knowing when to go to sleep,
when to wake up,

381
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,417
what to wear, what to eat,
what to do.

382
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:06,145
To get out of my own head.

383
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,947
This is not for everyone, you know,
this self-Examination.

384
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,225
Some of us...

385
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,202
we just need to live our lives, man.

386
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,093
Why do you think you went
to that particular bar?

387
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,599
I don't know.

388
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,193
I wanted anyone
to so much as breathe

389
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,564
so I could beat the living hell
out of them, that's why.

390
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:34,997
But nobody did.

391
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:46,074
Could it be, Alex, that you were there
for exactly the opposite reason?

392
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,351
'Cause no one would question you

393
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,944
or ask you to be anything
other than yourself?

394
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,131
You see, these issues with your father,
with your own identity,

395
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:01,944
with what you really want for yourself,

396
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,041
these things,
they have to be looked at.

397
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,605
Don't you think it would be better
to deal with them here on the ground

398
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:13,807
than have them follow you
20,000 feet into the air?

399
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,896
Wait, are you actually
expressing an opinion here?

400
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,870
Are you telling me not to fly?

401
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,217
I can't answer that.

402
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:25,953
It makes me feel
like you're asking me

403
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,596
to share responsibility for another
major decision in your life.

404
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:32,208
You know, go back to baghdad,
leave michaela.

405
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,673
I think we're way past that.

406
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:39,575
I'm not asking you to decide, Paul.
I can decide.

407
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,658
I have decided.

408
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,714
No, i'm asking you,
man to man...

409
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,820
Tell me, what would you do

410
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:51,902
if you were me?

411
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:03,746
Alex, if I was you,

412
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,047
I would stay in therapy.

413
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,285
I would continue
to deal with the complex,

414
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:11,341
difficult issues
that we've been talking about,

415
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,909
not sweep them under the carpet

416
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,882
like you've been doing
in your life.

417
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,239
I can tell you one thing:

418
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,472
They will creep up on you again.

419
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,515
But you won't tell me not to fly.

420
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:36,608
You know, you're wrong.

421
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,312
I don't make mistakes.

422
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:42,256
When i'm up in the sky,
that's when i'm in control.

423
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:48,778
You don't get it yet.

424
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:51,905
I am the best.

425
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,908
Now, Paul, listen to me.

426
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,129
Don't fuck me up
with this Navy shrink. Please.

427
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,649
Don't take my world
away from me.

428
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,801
Well...

429
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,840
I think we're done.

430
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,210
What is it, doc?

431
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:47,401
Here's my cell phone.

432
00:22:48,982 --> 00:22:50,713
I want you to call me any time,

433
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,074
day or night,

434
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,814
if you need to talk
about anything.

435
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,295
I just had a thought.

436
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,021
Soon i'm going to be
flying over the armpit

437
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,628
of the fucking world,

438
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:15,900
and i'll be thinking about you

439
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:17,233
in your...

440
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:19,468
In your chair.

441
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:23,446
You know, Alex,

442
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,728
I just wanted to say that...

443
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,495
I think you've done
great work here...

444
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:31,964
Brave.

445
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,232
Really.

446
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:38,273
I want us to continue that.

447
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,069
Okay?

448
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,357
- Bye, doc.
- Take care, Alex.
