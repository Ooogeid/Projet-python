1
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,400
<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment.

2
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:11,046
I feel sorry for the books up there.

3
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:16,706
I'm going back to training
next week for the Olympics,

4
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,655
and if you try to stop me,
you will never see me again.

5
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:21,811
Right, you'll go to your father's.

6
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:25,145
Only he's in Miami
photographing supermodels,

7
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:28,481
no one can get a hold of him.
He doesn't know she was in the hospital.

8
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:32,273
- Shut up!
- He hasn't called her in over a month.

9
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:35,822
Why didn't you tell me that your father
didn't know you tried to kill yourself?

10
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,591
I have to go.

11
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:43,153
- What about our agreement?
- Let's talk about it next week.

12
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,124
We won't talk about it next week.
What about our agreement?

13
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,502
I won't try and kill myself
as long as I'm in therapy.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,349
- Yes?
- Afternoon.

15
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,787
$12 please.

16
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,730
- For what?
- Pizza.

17
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,409
A pizza? I didn't order a pizza.

18
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:15,986
- There's another entrance to the house?
- I'm sure nobody ordered a pizza.

19
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,497
Okay, buddy. Just give me a second.

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,785
Candy? Can you check the street number
on the Robinson street order?

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,032
<i>Yeah, it's... 848 Robinson.</i>

22
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,410
Yeah, but the John
claims he didn't order a pie.

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,249
You know what? Let me take it.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,238
I think I know who it's for.

25
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:35,925
- You know what? He's gonna take it.
- <i>What? Suddenly he did order it?</i>

26
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,967
- <i>Ask him what's on it.</i>
- You gotta tell me what's on it first.

27
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:41,261
I can't just hand over
another man's pizza.

28
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,167
It's...

29
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,144
- Cheese.
- And...?

30
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:50,866
And...

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,149
And it's deep-dish.

32
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,004
- Yeah, it's deep-dish, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,224
- How much is that? - It's $12.

34
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,877
Thanks.

35
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,110
- And... here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,661
- For you.
- Thanks a lot. Take care. Bye.

37
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:26,765
Want some?

38
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,455
No, I'm okay, thanks.

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,347
I was on the bus and I realized
I haven't had anything to eat.

40
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:38,845
So I sent a text message to Google
from my phone,

41
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:41,156
they sent me back the number
of this place near you.

42
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,944
Google can do that?

43
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,963
Google can do anything.

44
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,949
You sure you don't want some?
I think this place is totally organic.

45
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,708
No. Honestly, I'm sure.

46
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,553
I had lunch already.

47
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,462
- How is it?
- It's all right.

48
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,712
Not the best, but I have to eat.

49
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,524
I need the calories.

50
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,154
How was your week?

51
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,777
Good, thanks.

52
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,017
So you're in a good mood?

53
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,334
I think so.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,399
Do my moods worry you?

55
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:20,109
You were a little grumpy last week.

56
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:22,905
You sort of ate me alive.

57
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,748
There were a couple of points
that I really wanted to make clear.

58
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:31,896
And if I came across
as impatient or abrupt,

59
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,296
I apologize.

60
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:39,023
Apology accepted.
Were you having a bad week?

61
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:41,788
Yeah.

62
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:43,481
And...

63
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:47,735
Maybe some of that
spilled over into this room.

64
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:50,182
It happens sometimes. I wish it didn't.

65
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,851
Relax, I can take it.

66
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:55,855
Plus I like that side of you.

67
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:56,981
Which side?

68
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,827
The no-bullshit side.

69
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:04,544
What did you mean when you said
"I need the calories"?

70
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,304
I've lost some weight.

71
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:11,105
When you go back into training
with weights and stuff,

72
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:13,623
As you build up muscle,
you're supposed to gain weight

73
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,198
because muscle weighs more than fat.

74
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:17,627
I didn't know.

75
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:21,005
When I'm not here, do you just bury
your head under a rock or something?

76
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:25,969
So these pounds that I've put on,
they could be muscle, really.

77
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,687
Do you go to the gym?

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,264
Occasionally.

79
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:33,350
You have to do it consistently
if you wanna see results.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,573
Every day. Weights and cardio.

81
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,381
No pain, no gain, guy.

82
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:40,342
- You're right.
- You can't see muscle

83
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,986
if it's buried under fat, so you have
to reduce your sugar and carb intake.

84
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,947
Okay, coach.

85
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,891
- Sorry.
- No, I appreciate the tip, thanks.

86
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,107
Anyway,

87
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,331
If you build muscle,
you'll gain weight,

88
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,297
Unless of course
you're a physiological freak like me.

89
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,959
Since I've started lifting weights
I've lost two pounds,

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,789
Which is like anatomically
impossible.

91
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:04,173
Now Cy won't let me lift
until I gain it back.

92
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:06,892
It's bullshit, really.

93
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,931
He was like, "you have to make sure
that you eat protein

94
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,904
"after every session, and you have
to make sure that your fat-carb ratio,"

95
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:15,502
blah blah blah...

96
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,756
He weighed me two days ago.

97
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,576
I don't know how,
but I lost another pound.

98
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:28,697
Can I eat here?

99
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:29,948
Sorry?

100
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,453
I never asked if it was okay for me
to eat here.

101
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:38,291
- Sure, of course it is.
- I know you've all these rules.

102
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:40,375
I wasn't sure
if there was one about food.

103
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,519
What are my rules?

104
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:46,184
Well...

105
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,366
We made a no-suicide rule last week.

106
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,883
I think that was more of a pact, but...

107
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,098
If it was a pact, we'd be drinking
poisoned Kool-Aid together.

108
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,272
And when I had the cast, you had
that rule about not undressing me.

109
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:04,131
I don't know that's so much a rule.

110
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,610
I felt that was inappropriate.

111
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,321
So there are no rules.

112
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:12,908
I can do whatever I want?

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,130
No, that's not what I said,

114
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,528
But you can definitely eat.

115
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,075
It makes me happy to see you eat,

116
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,211
with <i>gusto</i>.

117
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,930
A lot of <i>gusto</i>, actually.

118
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:42,818
- What happened?
- I'm done.

119
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:46,099
I don't want anymore.
It's a bit disgusting.

120
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,819
- I thought you said it was good.
- I said it was okay.

121
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,016
I'm not hungry anymore.

122
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,074
I had half a slice.
What do you want me to do?

123
00:06:57,244 --> 00:07:00,553
Finish the whole thing?
Who could finish a whole slice of pizza?

124
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:02,332
Lots of people who could finish.

125
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:03,978
Fat people.

126
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,050
Do you know what <i>gusto</i> means?

127
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,141
Of course, it means...

128
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,555
It means it's how fat people eat.

129
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,404
With <i>gusto</i>.

130
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,869
Did you know
a fat person who ate with <i>gusto</i>?

131
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:28,984
Not exactly.

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,230
Why are you smiling?

133
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,908
My father had this girlfriend...

134
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,384
A model.

135
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,688
She hardly spoke English

136
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,456
and he didn't speak Italian.
It was ridiculous.

137
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:45,348
She used to turn up at his apartment
with bags of chocolate.

138
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:47,169
She kept trying to force-feed me.

139
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,423
When I wouldn't do it,
she told my dad I was anorexic.

140
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:56,148
She went around the house
pointing to me and saying,

141
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,681
"I am so worried for her.

142
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,558
"She has no <i>gusto</i> for eating."

143
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,695
Meanwhile she's stuffing her bony ass
like a pig and never gaining any weight.

144
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,049
She was a total Mia.
My dad never saw it.

145
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:16,572
What?

146
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,313
You can say it.

147
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,081
I've heard it
a thousand times before.

148
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,861
You think I have an eating disorder.

149
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:30,671
Why can't anybody understand?

150
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,273
This is just the way I'm built.

151
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:34,716
I don't get hungry.

152
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,346
I can go a whole day
and never get hungry.

153
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,466
It doesn't mean I'm anorexic.

154
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,431
I'm an Olympic hopeful,
for God's sakes.

155
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,017
I know what my body is
and isn't capable of.

156
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,488
I know my body better at 16

157
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,396
than regular people ever will.

158
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,280
Never saw her again.

159
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,105
She starved to death hopefully.

160
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,460
I don't know.

161
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:06,764
He never stayed
with any of them for very long.

162
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,371
And when she told him
that she thought

163
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,921
that you had an eating disorder,
did he take her seriously?

164
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:17,017
- I don't know.
- Did he try to get you to eat more?

165
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,023
He likes me for myself,

166
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,118
And he loves how I look.

167
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,026
He said if the whole gymnastics
thing doesn't work out,

168
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,179
He can get me a job as a model...

169
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:28,911
Like that.

170
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,110
So how do you feel about your weight?

171
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,157
I love it.

172
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,557
I like being light and thin.

173
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:44,673
I like feeling I could just slip away
through a crack in the door if I had to.

174
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:48,727
Can you think of a time
when you used your...

175
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:52,566
lightness, as you call it,
to slip away?

176
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:56,257
I'm describing a feeling.
Don't be so literal.

177
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:57,966
Okay. Fair enough.

178
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,971
Can you think of a time then
when you thought,

179
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,139
"I wish I could just slip away"?

180
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,183
How about right now?

181
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:12,303
That party where the boy
took you into the...

182
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:15,400
Into the bedroom.
Didn't you want to slip away then?

183
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,728
I was trashed.

184
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,992
- You don't get it.
- What don't I get?

185
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:26,710
The slipping away thing.

186
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:30,913
It's a girl thing,

187
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,910
The wanting to be liked.

188
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:37,526
To be there, but not to be there.
It's like...

189
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,842
- Can we talk about something else?
- Finish the thought.

190
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,384
I wanna talk about something else.

191
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:49,562
What would you like
to talk about then?

192
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,231
How's your daughter?

193
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,354
Rosie? She's...

194
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:59,027
She's fine, thank you.

195
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,363
Is she still
with that fucked-up guy?

196
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,488
Do you really want to talk
about my daughter

197
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:06,608
or are you just trying
to make me uncomfortable?

198
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,040
I don't wanna talk about her
if you don't.

199
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:13,751
Why wouldn't I?

200
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,855
You never mention her.

201
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,677
After you left last week,
I couldn't help thinking,

202
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:29,099
about how you didn't tell me
that your dad was in Miami.

203
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:30,976
We're back to that?

204
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:34,229
So he still doesn't know
about your attempted suicide?

205
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,160
I don't wanna talk about this.

206
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,413
Is it something you wanna
keep a secret from him?

207
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,277
It's not a fucking secret!

208
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,177
How can it be a secret
if that's all you and my mom

209
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:45,282
and everyone else can talk about?

210
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,040
What are you thinking about?

211
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,222
Nothing.

212
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,351
I've a test tomorrow
I have to study for and I missed

213
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:07,012
my dentist appointment today,
so I have to reschedule that.

214
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,347
I think you're running away.

215
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,511
What?

216
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,409
In your mind,
you're planning your schedule.

217
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:15,475
We get close to something

218
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,786
that feels dangerous to you,

219
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,484
And what do you do? You retreat.

220
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,420
I'm not retreating.

221
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,127
I'm stressed about the exam,
I think I have a cavity,

222
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,983
and I have a stomachache
from that fucking pizza.

223
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,452
What a mistake that was.

224
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:33,441
I have a theory about that pizza.

225
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:34,998
Surprise, surprise.

226
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,375
Would you like to hear it?

227
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,005
- Do I have a choice?
- Yeah. You always have a choice.

228
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,602
What's your theory?

229
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:49,054
I think that you were
enjoying that pizza.

230
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,962
Until I said something
that reminded you

231
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:55,477
of something your father's girlfriend
used to say to you.

232
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,067
I used the word <i>gusto.</i>

233
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,821
Are you saying
I'm fucked up about food

234
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,225
because of something
my father's girlfriend said?

235
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,204
Are you fucked up about food?

236
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:07,739
Isn't everybody?

237
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,120
What does food mean to you?

238
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,541
- What do you mean?
- Is it nutrition, is it enjoyment?

239
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,042
What?

240
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:20,919
It's the enemy.

241
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,508
It's just what happens to gymnasts.

242
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,793
Why didn't you tell me
your father was in Miami?

243
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:34,077
- Why was it a secret?
- It's not a fucking secret.

244
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:38,270
I just don't think I need to bother him
with every boring detail of my life.

245
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,606
Your attempted suicide
is a boring detail?

246
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,609
It's not a suicide attempt.
I was just testing. Remember?

247
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:47,530
Somebody around here
had that theory, I think.

248
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,280
Yeah, that rings a bell.

249
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,575
He'd put it together
and decide that it's all your fault.

250
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,395
He already thinks you're a quack,
remember?

251
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,879
It's better for you if he doesn't know.
He'll never let me come back here.

252
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,463
Better for you or for me?

253
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:08,633
Which of us would have to stay away
from therapy, do you think?

254
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,314
If he knew, he'd be devastated.

255
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:16,040
He is the most important person to me
in this whole world.

256
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,274
I don't ever wanna hurt him.

257
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:20,699
Why can't you just let it go?

258
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,324
Forget it.

259
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,484
This is such a waste of time.

260
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,667
You tried to kill yourself.

261
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:32,282
And you don't want to tell
the most important person in your world?

262
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,744
He has a life!

263
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,686
Somebody has to.

264
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:38,015
We can't all go around
like walking corpses.

265
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,206
It's not his fault
that I took those pills!

266
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,149
I'm not saying it is his fault,
I'm just trying to figure out

267
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,212
why you were so ready
to leave the planet and not tell him.

268
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:47,756
What's up your ass?

269
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,967
- Are you angry at him for something?
- I'm not angry at him.

270
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:54,430
- Are you hiding something from me?
- Get off my back!

271
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,564
Are we done?

272
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:08,085
We have a little time left.

273
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:17,771
What?

274
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:22,248
You've never wanted
to end a session early before.

275
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:05,249
In our first session
you mentioned those books up there.

276
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,060
I thought it was because you identified
with them. You said they were...

277
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,945
cold and lonely on the top shelf.

278
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,761
And then I looked at them
more closely and I realized that

279
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:18,350
one of them has...

280
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,591
some of your father's photographs
in it.

281
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,498
You said that your dad

282
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,078
loves the way that you look.

283
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:30,864
And that...

284
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:35,071
if you weren't a gymnast,
that you could be a model.

285
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:40,931
I guess models
are the people that he...

286
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,258
That he chooses
to surround himself with,

287
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:45,225
the people he likes.

288
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:58,469
They're the people he fucks.
I wouldn't say he likes them.

289
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,949
I know that in our culture
thin models...

290
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:09,169
are sexualized, but I've always
found that really strange,

291
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,643
because in classical art
and literature,

292
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,966
eating is often used
as a metaphor for sex.

293
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,409
They both conjure up

294
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,137
desire, hunger,

295
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,237
cravings inside us.

296
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,291
Where are you going, Sophie?

297
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,643
Sophie, try to stay here, please.

298
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,294
Try not to disappear.

299
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:33,880
Eat shit, Paul.

300
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,202
Why are you doing this?

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,014
I thought you were trying to help.

302
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:46,071
Why does the book provoke
such a strong reaction in you?

303
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,995
What you're doing is sick.

304
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,374
It's fucking sick! It's perverted.

305
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,516
- I'll never forgive you for this.
- Why?

306
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,233
Because I'm making you
uncomfortable?

307
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,907
I'm asking you to think about things
that you don't want to talk about.

308
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:03,196
If I wanted to talk
about my father's book,

309
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,610
I would have told you,
it was right there.

310
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,874
What about all that crap about a patient
deciding what we talk about?

311
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:10,959
That you take things at my speed,

312
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,045
that I control the wheels and all that?
You're so full of shit.

313
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,881
But you have been driving
what we talk about here.

314
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,175
You may not realize it,
but you have.

315
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:22,679
The very first thing that you wanted
to talk about were those books up there.

316
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:26,768
What are you saying? That you jerk off
to my father's photographs?

317
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:30,497
That you open up that book
and jerk off all over those sluts?

318
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,591
You keep suggesting somebody
is abusing me. You're abusing me!

319
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:39,143
That's what you people love
most of all, isn't it? A good mindfuck.

320
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,440
To take the one good thing
in somebody's life

321
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,101
and somehow fuck it up!

322
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,233
Just like my father said.

323
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:52,086
Shut the fuck up about him!

324
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,277
How could you?

325
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:03,261
How could you?
You're just like everybody else!

326
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,680
Like who, Sophie?

327
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,851
Please, don't go.

328
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,433
Why did you do that?

329
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:56,083
You mean
why did I take the book down?

330
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,026
Because I had to.

331
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,849
I had to put the book on the table.

332
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:08,275
And there was really
no graceful way of doing it.

333
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,614
I think this book
is connected to your wound.

334
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,864
And opening a wound, Sophie...

335
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,413
is frightening.

336
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,927
It's painful.

337
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,942
And it's ugly.

338
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,456
You implied
that I'd been sexually abused.

339
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,230
Is that what you heard?

340
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:41,579
I never said anything like that.

341
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,710
This book with the...

342
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,372
with the naked models.

343
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:53,013
You wanted me to see that.

344
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what I think?

345
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,673
I think you're angry.

346
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:09,596
I think you've got great anger
towards your father.

347
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,847
You said earlier on
that you wished that

348
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,387
you could slip through
the cracks when you wanted to,

349
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:20,731
but you don't do that
when you're in trouble. Not really.

350
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,145
Your mind tries to, but your body,

351
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:25,366
your body stays here.

352
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,391
You let others do things to you,

353
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,454
because you've
convinced yourself that...

354
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,658
That you're not really there.

355
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,892
That it's not happening to you.

356
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,212
That it's not hurting you.

357
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,154
I'm sure this week
you'll exercise like a fiend.

358
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:49,178
And not because you're
an Olympic hopeful.

359
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:55,920
But because I know that
after this session, you're gonna want

360
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,643
to regain control.

361
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,582
But I want you
to remember something, Sophie.

362
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,863
When you go up onto that beam,

363
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:10,107
that's the place where you detach.

364
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:12,784
That's where you go to feel safe.

365
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:18,286
All I want you to know
is you don't have to go there.

366
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:21,952
There are other places
where you can feel safe.

367
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,966
In here, in this room.

368
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:28,741
It's one of those places.
