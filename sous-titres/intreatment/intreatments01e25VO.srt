<i>Previously, on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:07,044
Teachers marry students.
It's not a big deal.

3
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:09,087
I mean, is it really wrong?

4
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:11,387
Let's say I stopped Laura's therapy.

5
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:14,341
Surely in a year, 18 months,
when it's cooled off...

6
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,176
There's no cooling-off period.

7
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:18,596
That's some bullshit
some lawyer came up with.

8
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:21,933
No, it's not a law.
It's beyond a code of ethics.

9
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:24,268
It's something you carry inside you.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,593
A lot of people
would disagree with this.

11
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:28,019
Then go to them.

12
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:31,673
It's really tough
when I'm alone with her, you know,

13
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,736
and she's asking me:

14
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:37,676
"Please, just be honest.
Please, tell me how you feel."

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,049
And I can't.

16
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:45,889
You need to say it.

17
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:47,565
I love her.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,401
Season 1, episode 25

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,533
Subtitles: Anyone, Coffee, Tagne

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,549
Come in, come in.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,810
- Hi, Gina.
- Kate, hello.

22
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,576
- It's good to see you.
- And you.

23
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:53,796
You've been here before, right?

24
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,537
It was years ago.

25
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:56,874
Actually,

26
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,321
it was the Argentineans, I think.

27
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,584
An institute conference.

28
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,110
Yes, that's right, that's right.

29
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,914
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

30
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:15,203
- This room's lovely.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:19,223
I did some rearranging, but I'm not sure
how comfortable I am in it.

32
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,825
I told myself I would write
a few hours a day.

33
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,513
Did Paul tell you I retired?

34
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:28,334
No, Paul didn't tell me.

35
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,233
- Writing... That's fantastic.
- We'll see.

36
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:40,888
Yeah, I mean, I've often thought
that I might try my hand, but...

37
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,608
I wouldn't ever dare.

38
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:47,808
So...

39
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:53,185
It's a little unusual
to have ongoing sessions with Paul

40
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,450
and then to see the both of you.

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,214
I thought it might be helpful
if we all decided how to approach this.

42
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,463
I think I told you when I called

43
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,709
that this was Kate's suggestion.

44
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,102
You said that.

45
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:08,557
If I were you,
I wouldn't be so sure I'd agree to it.

46
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:09,934
Why not?

47
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,353
Well, we've blurred some lines here,
you and I.

48
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,272
That's true, we have.

49
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,782
But I think we'll be okay
if we set down some guidelines.

50
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,516
I was thinking
we could meet three times,

51
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,136
re-evaluate and then decide
where we want to go from there.

52
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,347
Now what made you decide
to come here?

53
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,871
Paul, you said
that it was Kate's suggestion,

54
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,171
but you're going along with it.

55
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,560
I think I told you
about Kate going to Rome...

56
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,518
And who she went with.

57
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,671
She got back and...

58
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,027
she said that it was over
with that guy.

59
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,829
I guess we both had the sense of:
"So, what do we do now?"

60
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,013
Kate did offer to talk about it
and I couldn't.

61
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:09,285
I was too...

62
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,345
angry.

63
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,621
I know in couples therapy

64
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:17,700
you try not to blame each other
and I'm always telling my patients that,

65
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,520
you know, like it's the simplest thing.
Now here I am and...

66
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,609
I can't stop blaming.

67
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,331
Intellectually, I get it,
that I'm half of the equation, but...

68
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,014
You said you couldn't talk to Kate,

69
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,478
so she hasn't heard any of this,
how you feel.

70
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:39,423
Well, I think she knows
that she hurt me.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Deeply...

72
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:43,713
And that...

73
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:45,849
That I hated her.

74
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,931
Could you go into that?

75
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,392
I hated you for thinking
you were entitled to this,

76
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,539
for implying
that I brought it on myself.

77
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:56,997
I couldn't shake it.

78
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,174
Every minute,
I'd get a wave of rage and loss.

79
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,162
Why? Why loss?

80
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,883
Because I really don't know
if I can forgive her.

81
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,451
I've seen couples
come back from this,

82
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,729
but right now, I'll be damned
if I know how they did it.

83
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:15,829
Anyway, she got back Tuesday
and I said: "Well, should I move out?"

84
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:19,552
She said that wasn't
what she wanted and...

85
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,904
You tell her.

86
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,983
I just asked him why he couldn't
talk to me about all of this,

87
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,988
about, you know,
everything we're going through.

88
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,041
Can you answer that, Paul?

89
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,372
I just said I couldn't.

90
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:46,348
I tell patients that having someone
is like mourning a death.

91
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,844
Who you were as a couple,
the image that you have of yourself...

92
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,252
It is like losing a loved one.

93
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,780
You keep telling us
what you tell patients,

94
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,761
but you're talking
about your mourning,

95
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,673
your rage, your loss.

96
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,764
You're sounding very controlled.

97
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,386
What, you want me to throw something?
Try to strangle her?

98
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:16,498
I can barely look at her.

99
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:17,749
I'm so...

100
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,199
I feel like I'm falling apart.

101
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,727
I should tell you this,
and Kate already knows...

102
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,227
I attacked a patient in therapy.

103
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,266
The pilot.

104
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,355
In the middle of therapy,
I jumped him. I lost it.

105
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,942
Suddenly, I was on top of him.
I grabbed him. I almost...

106
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,440
I almost hit him.

107
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,525
Scared the hell out of me.

108
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,116
Or both of us, I guess.

109
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:58,955
Anyway, my first thought afterwards
was that I was reacting...

110
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,155
to Kate.

111
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,947
She came home during the session,

112
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,689
she knocked at the door,
back from Rome.

113
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:12,504
I heard her outside the office
and then...

114
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,523
What is it?

115
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,895
I shouldn't discuss a patient
with Kate here.

116
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,252
You can't discuss a patient
who's spying on me?

117
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:32,881
He did all this...

118
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,705
research about Kate and about...

119
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,215
About my father.

120
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,903
He knew that Kate was in Italy with...

121
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,553
With another man and he...

122
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:48,795
- He threw it in my face.
- How did he know that?

123
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,541
He made calls.
People that had recommended me to him.

124
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,461
I don't know who they are.

125
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,730
Anyway, that's not the point.

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,950
Instead of handling it properly,
I jumped in and...

127
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:05,453
I lay in bed that night thinking:
"Do I take a month off?

128
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:08,355
"Do I take three months off?
Maybe I should take a year off.

129
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:09,675
"Maybe I'm...

130
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,163
"Maybe I'm... Maybe I'm all done."

131
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,804
- And that's my fault?
- What?

132
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,114
Your creepy patient,
he's my fault as well?

133
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,939
Actually, it made me think
how much I need you.

134
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,961
- Do you?
- Yeah, you, the kids, the house...

135
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:33,102
I need that.
I need that other place where I can...

136
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,573
What? Hang on.
That other place?

137
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:43,291
I'm pretty sure we're supposed
to be the place.

138
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,650
Sorry. How does this work?
Do we take turns?

139
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:55,096
- Is that how...
- Whatever you're comfortable with.

140
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:02,167
It's always been
very difficult for me,

141
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,587
trying to describe what I'm feeling.

142
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,527
When you're having a baby,

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,563
Yeah? You're lying there

144
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,439
in that hospital bed and...

145
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,793
And you don't need... you don't want

146
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:24,339
everything understood and shared

147
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,441
and analyzed and discussed.

148
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,567
All you want to know
is that you're not alone

149
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,443
and that your husband's hand
is right there.

150
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,303
But try describing to your husband

151
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,953
exactly what it feels like
to have a child, it's just impossible.

152
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,689
A friend of mine once said,

153
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:51,627
"Take an umbrella,
shove it up his ass, open it and pull.

154
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,530
"Then he'll know."

155
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,591
So someone sticking an umbrella
up your ass is...

156
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,261
What's the umbrella?

157
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,365
Please don't analyze me.

158
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,445
Well, it's quite an analogy.

159
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,477
I'm not your patient.

160
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:11,646
He doesn't get to interpret
everything I say in here, does he?

161
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:17,238
It's the same as when Paul's at home.
He's not a psychotherapist here.

162
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:20,726
He's a man
dealing with a crisis in his marriage.

163
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:24,354
He's not a therapist at home?

164
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:33,970
Can you go on, Kate?

165
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:38,835
When you told me
about attacking your patient

166
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,678
I felt like that was for my benefit,

167
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,044
that you just wanted to show me
what I'd done to you

168
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:49,164
by seeing Edward
and how I'd ruined your life and,

169
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,976
- well, your work.
- You haven't ruined my life.

170
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,688
You're the best thing in it.

171
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,603
I felt like you were putting on a show.

172
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,431
Christ.

173
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:08,995
You know, I believed you

174
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:12,905
when you told me that you wanted me
to stop seeing Edward. I did.

175
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,543
But when you sit here right now

176
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:18,778
and you tell me
that I'm the best thing in your life...

177
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,651
I don't believe that.

178
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,354
And that makes me so sad.

179
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,044
And the way you talk to me sometimes,

180
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:36,468
I mean I will ask you outright:
"Do you love me?"

181
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:41,319
And you've said to me...
You've looked at me and you've said,

182
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,990
"Yes... for now."

183
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,016
It's... It's a joke.

184
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:49,051
Well, what the hell kind of a joke
is that?

185
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:52,872
Someone asks you if you love them,

186
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,667
you don't think
that they're feeling vulnerable?

187
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:59,357
A little insecure, maybe?
They need some reassurance?

188
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,718
Everything we say has meaning.
That's your line.

189
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,050
But we don't mean
everything that we say.

190
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,012
Which is it? That's pretty convenient
for you, isn't it?

191
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,890
We don't mean what we say, fine,

192
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,802
'cause I don't believe
a lot of what you say.

193
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,608
I mean, Gina just pointed it out.
You said, "I'm hurt,"

194
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:23,194
but it sounded like you were reading
something out of a psychology book.

195
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:27,625
How do you need me? You don't need me.

196
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,964
I just don't believe that.

197
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:37,125
You know, when Paul and I
were first seeing each other...

198
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:43,025
I couldn't get over
how seriously he took me.

199
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,252
I'd never had that from anyone.

200
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:52,916
Up until then,
I'd always pretty much felt...

201
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,524
invisible.

202
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,285
And there was also... There was this...

203
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,108
This exciting new idea

204
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,795
that under everything people say
there's another intention

205
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,982
and that there's this hidden meaning,

206
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:11,667
which just meant
that everything had to be analyzed.

207
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:14,969
So, everything I said
took on this importance

208
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:18,583
because he was working so hard
to figure me out.

209
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,410
And he was really the first person

210
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,682
who tried to understand me. And I...

211
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,712
Thank you.

212
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,724
And I just remember feeling...

213
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:47,201
very grateful to him for that.

214
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,410
So it was quite a shock for me
to realize that

215
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,986
it wasn't about me. It had...

216
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:58,217
fuck all to do with me, really.

217
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,083
I mean, it was about him.

218
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:04,201
Because you don't actually
understand me.

219
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:08,007
Understanding me is not about subtext.
It's not about the subconscious.

220
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,677
It's not about reading
some kind of an X-ray.

221
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,637
It's just so clinical.

222
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:18,486
Actually, it's worse
because you use it against me.

223
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:21,336
You think you know what I mean
before I know what I mean,

224
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,399
and how am I supposed
to argue with that?

225
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,067
This is what I've gotten
out of our marriage.

226
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:28,362
I gotta think over things
10 different ways.

227
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,889
I can't take anything at face value.

228
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,199
Nothing is simple.
Nothing is ever simple.

229
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,379
I hate it.
I hate that that's what I've become.

230
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,039
Just the patient
married to the doctor.

231
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:47,398
For someone who is asking
how this whole thing works,

232
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:51,325
you're doing a blue-ribbon job.
I gotta give you that.

233
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,829
I didn't come here
for you to grade my performance.

234
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:03,893
Kate, can you explain to Paul
why you were seeing Edward?

235
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,692
I don't want to explain.

236
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,612
No, this is exactly what I'm saying.

237
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:14,246
Why does everything
have to be explained?

238
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,685
Sometimes I just don't know
and sometimes I don't want to know.

239
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,244
Fine. Initially, it was just

240
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,051
excitement and adrenaline.

241
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:35,500
And there was this possibility
when I woke up in the morning

242
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,361
that I may do something
that I hadn't planned

243
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,850
or that I didn't even know
I was capable of.

244
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,452
And that's who I was
before I met Paul.

245
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,039
And, somewhere along the way,
that part of me just...

246
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,741
died or... I don't know...
It was smothered.

247
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,523
The point I'm trying to make

248
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,996
is why can I not just trust myself

249
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,857
to be who I am
and to just get on with it?

250
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,371
Well, just because you don't look,

251
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,695
it doesn't mean
there's nothing underneath.

252
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:10,274
That's very profound, I'm sure.

253
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:13,925
- There's still a reason why you...
- Would you please stop it?

254
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:17,952
I do not want your intellectual
interpretation of everything I say.

255
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:27,753
I did it because I felt something.

256
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,326
What did you feel?

257
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,226
Wanted.

258
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,935
I mean, do you want me to say
that I want you?

259
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:46,809
I do. I want you. That's why I'm here,
so that you'll believe it.

260
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:52,280
Paul, do you feel that you need
a witness to verify your love for Kate?

261
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:54,667
Thank you.

262
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:59,001
Thank you. I'm sorry,
but I just keep getting this...

263
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,568
That image of Bill Clinton,
that footage of him,

264
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:05,516
standing in front
of all those cameras

265
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:08,057
and wagging his finger
so adamantly, you know.

266
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,586
"I did not have sexual relations
with that woman."

267
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,552
Jeez, that's some comparison.

268
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,055
You know, I can't assert anything
strongly enough, because

269
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,775
that would be a clear indication
of my...

270
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,372
insincerity but, on the other hand,
if I don't state my feelings,

271
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,808
- then that's something else.
- Fair enough.

272
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,428
Maybe there's nothing
you can say to me.

273
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,432
All I know is I have
to feel it in my gut to believe it.

274
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,509
- And you don't.
- No, I don't.

275
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,031
Do you remember?

276
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,894
Do you remember what it feels like
to be wanted?

277
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:51,005
To be truly desired and pursued?

278
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,492
It's not something you experience
as a debate.

279
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:57,412
It's not an argument you need
to be convinced of. It's just this...

280
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,631
This force that has to be...

281
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,284
That has to be reckoned with.

282
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:08,346
What is it? Did I...

283
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,163
What?

284
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:21,473
What did I say? What's going on?

285
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,480
Do you know what transference is?

286
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,574
When a patient has feelings
for their therapist which are,

287
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,990
in fact, drawn from their relationships
with their parents.

288
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:47,092
They project qualities onto
the therapist that don't really exist

289
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,040
or they can be just exaggerated.

290
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,736
And then when they find
the courage, the patient...

291
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,617
they reach a level of trust,

292
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,759
and they feel safe enough
to express their desire for the...

293
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:02,675
And...

294
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,582
And so for a time,

295
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:10,815
the patient may experience feelings
as if they're truly intended for the...

296
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,114
For the... therapist.

297
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,742
Did you fuck her?

298
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,331
What?

299
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,347
Is that what you're telling me?
I'm not sure.

300
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,833
Are you telling me
that you slept with a patient?

301
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,668
No, that's not what I'm...

302
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:41,410
You asked me if I felt someone's desire
for me. And I'm saying yes.

303
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,346
I have patients
who've indicated feelings for me,

304
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,554
only I'm not flying off to Rome
to fuck them.

305
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,891
It happens in therapy all the time.

306
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,272
Has this happened to you?

307
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:58,475
Yes, it has.

308
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,039
I've spoken to Gina about it.

309
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:05,268
It's really valuable for me to explore
my own feelings with another therapist,

310
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,407
so that they don't get in the way
so that I can work through my feelings

311
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:12,406
because then I don't let them
get the best of me and ruin my marriage.

312
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,576
That's...

313
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,119
All right,
so exactly what kind of feelings

314
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,420
has this woman provoked in you?

315
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,222
What has he said to you?

316
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,069
Kate, only Paul can answer that.

317
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,343
It's okay, he doesn't have to.

318
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,304
This is why he needed
to make some sort of a...

319
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,135
declaration of commitment to me.

320
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,547
This is his wagging finger,

321
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:59,368
his "I did not have sexual relations
with that woman."

322
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:02,853
- But I didn't.
- Doesn't matter. This is not nothing.

323
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,342
If this were nothing,
you wouldn't have brought it up here.

324
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,186
If this were just some patient
with a silly crush...

325
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:18,757
Are you telling me you've fallen in love
with some patient

326
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,879
that you're treating?

327
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,721
You have your insurance guy.

328
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:30,735
You don't get to play
the outraged wife here.

329
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,786
He's not an insurance guy
and you know it.

330
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:36,409
Thank you for another one
of your stupid, painful jokes.

331
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,208
And I don't get to play outraged?

332
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:42,131
Why don't you explain
the last few weeks to me,

333
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,125
while you've been running around
like a goddamn martyr, the whole time

334
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:48,035
you're chasing some patient.
Jesus Christ. Actually, let me guess.

335
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:51,616
What is she?
Some girl with no father figure?

336
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:54,285
He died?
Abandoned her when she was 12?

337
00:21:54,455 --> 00:21:56,605
He loves that type. I'll tell you.

338
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:00,213
- How old is she?
- What type, Kate?

339
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,358
Girls with that particular brand
of dysfunction...

340
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:07,445
A tasty little daddy complex
so he can sweep them off their feet.

341
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,572
It's daydreaming, that's all.

342
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,419
Maybe it's a little more
than daydreaming.

343
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,990
Look, I wanted to come clean here.

344
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,917
Now you know.

345
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:23,295
The reason I'm telling you
is because I want it to stop.

346
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,755
You want to stop what?

347
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:31,819
You wanna stop wanting to fuck patients?
How do you stop that?

348
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:34,193
I don't know, but we might try
acting like a couple

349
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,832
who actually might want
to be together.

350
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:46,570
Maybe you can describe to Kate what
you're experiencing with this patient,

351
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,490
like Kate did with Edward.

352
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,511
Look, you can't...

353
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:53,032
You can't compare the...

354
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:58,257
She slept with somebody.
I allowed myself a fantasy. That's all.

355
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,195
I never admitted it to this woman.

356
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:03,715
- I certainly never acted on it.
- But you were dying to.

357
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,140
Yes, I was dying to, but I didn't.

358
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,056
Anyway, she quit therapy.

359
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:14,504
I forgot to tell you,
she quit therapy on Monday.

360
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,735
Well, good. Now you can fuck her
without worrying...

361
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,758
- Or losing your license.
- Or maybe now,

362
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:22,510
I can try to save our marriage
or what's left of it, which,

363
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,830
- apparently, isn't very much.
- Did you say Monday?

364
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,241
Monday?

365
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:29,601
Monday, yes.

366
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,630
That's why you wouldn't go with Max

367
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:38,690
on a Monday? Because you didn't want
to miss your session with this girl?

368
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,300
Are you serious?

369
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:46,357
Max...
He's having a lot of problems at school.

370
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:49,384
There was this conference
with his teachers

371
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,004
and Paul wanted
to reschedule because...

372
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,404
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

373
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,991
And all your speechifying,
all your fucking sanctimony,

374
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:08,176
walking around like the mortally wounded
and the whole time... Jesus.

375
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:12,057
Makes total sense now, doesn't it?
A million little things.

376
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,940
When did this start?

377
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:20,197
- How long has this been going on?
- How long has what been going on?

378
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,504
- I told you nothing happened.
- I'll tell you when this started.

379
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:25,906
It started a year ago, didn't it?
Am I right?

380
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,250
Jesus. What happened to us?

381
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,382
What happened to us?
What happened to you?

382
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,467
What happened to you, Paul?

383
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,885
Edward, he was nothing.

384
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:38,345
- Nothing?
- Can you say it's nothing?

385
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,817
Can you say it's nothing with this...

386
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:43,979
- What is her name?
- I can't tell you. I'm not allowed to.

387
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,631
I wanna know
and you'd better tell me, Paul.

388
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,451
I am not fucking around.

389
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:57,367
Why don't you tell me
it's nothing with Laura?

390
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:05,981
My God.

391
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,610
I made a mistake. I made a...

392
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:14,324
With someone I couldn't even be in...

393
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:21,154
- God damn you.
- What do you want?

394
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:24,929
Do you want me to say it's nothing?
Because it isn't nothing.

395
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,520
That's why we're here.
That's why I'm here.

396
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,430
Fuck you.

397
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:42,894
Paul, you can understand
how she's feeling.

398
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:45,694
She came here wanting
to leave her affair behind

399
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,614
and work on your marriage.

400
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,129
Then she finds out that
you have feelings for another woman.

401
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,255
It's not the same thing, Gina.

402
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:56,493
Still...

403
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,268
You've both been pulling away
from the relationship.

404
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,963
Now what's left is to fight over
who's been hurt the most.

405
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,230
Why?

406
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,326
Why is anyone cheating?

407
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,417
Looking to someone else
for a connection?

408
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,616
How did the marriage end up
feeling this empty?

409
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:31,903
Okay, this is a first step.

410
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,221
We'll keep looking at these reactions
and what they mean,

411
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:38,440
where they started.

412
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:40,885
As I said in the beginning,

413
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:42,995
we should meet a few times

414
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:46,962
and then decide to go on
with couples therapy or...

415
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,393
Or some other solution.

416
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:54,958
I'd like to pay you for my sessions
so far and for this one as well.

417
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:57,304
No, we don't have to do that now.

418
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,128
Five sessions. How much...

419
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:04,446
Paul, as you said in the beginning,
some lines have been blurred here.

420
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:06,660
So, I haven't even thought
about this.

421
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,602
Let me figure it out
and I'll send you a bill.

422
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:16,129
What exactly am I going home with?

423
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:22,102
What the hell am I supposed to do
with this before...

424
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,180
For our next installment?

425
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,107
Kate, you can call me anytime.

426
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:32,883
Paul, you know that.

427
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,072
And if you wanna meet
before next Friday, it's fine.

428
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:37,242
I'm here.

429
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,084
Thanks, Gina.

430
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,369
Take care.
