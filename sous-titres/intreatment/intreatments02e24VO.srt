1
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:03,765
Dr. Weston?

2
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:06,843
I'm Walter's daughter,

3
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:09,392
- Natalie.
- Very nice to meet you, Natalie.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,357
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course, of course.

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:13,763
How is...

6
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:16,182
How is your father doing?

7
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,267
Physically he's okay.

8
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:23,105
My mother says to tell everyone
he has food poisoning.

9
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:27,443
That's... That's what she told me.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,945
And you believed her?

11
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:42,769
Synchro: So., mpm

12
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,417
I'm not hungry.
I don't need any pills. Leave me alone.

13
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:30,525
It's Paul.

14
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:37,028
For Christ's sake.
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,903
You missed your session.
I called your home.

16
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,991
Connie told me that you'd...

17
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,853
You'd been admitted last night.

18
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,109
- And she asked you to check in on me?
- I'd have come anyway.

19
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:53,904
I was worried about having to cancel
my session last week, so...

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,533
Well, you can tell Connie you saw me
and I sent you home.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,504
They're gonna be discharging me
tomorrow.

22
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,246
We'll have a session next week.

23
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:06,132
I'm not so sure
they're gonna discharge you, Walter.

24
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,258
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,335
You... You may not be ready
to go home.

26
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,279
Of course I am.
I had a little food poisoning.

27
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,554
I'm fine.

28
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,158
Food poisoning?

29
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,590
I'm glad to hear it.

30
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,593
Well, since you're fine,

31
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:35,154
and I'm here, maybe we can...
maybe we can talk.

32
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,439
- Will it help get me out of here?
- It could.

33
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,972
Well, then tell me
what you want to know.

34
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:41,231
First off,

35
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,501
are they treating you well here?

36
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,386
Yeah, it's...

37
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:49,565
It's a little showy for a hospital,

38
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:53,185
but the staff's good.
They're in and out all the time,

39
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:56,008
but no, I have no complaints.

40
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,648
So I'll bet you'll be glad
to get home.

41
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,317
I really miss my privacy,
knowing where my things are.

42
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,005
Actually, I spoke with Connie.

43
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,730
She told me that Natalie was leaving
to fly back to Rwanda.

44
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:12,915
You had an early dinner
with both of them, she told me.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,565
Yeah, we ate in.

46
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,677
I don't go out.
People gawk.

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,597
And they both ate
the same meal as you did?

48
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,242
Right.
Chinese.

49
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,646
But they didn't get food poisoning.

50
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,004
So maybe I got a bug.

51
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,024
I also talked
to your attending physician.

52
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,862
- He said that you were lucky.
- Lucky?

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,990
That Natalie's flight was canceled.

54
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:47,142
I don't follow you.

55
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:50,103
She got a call from the airline
while your wife was driving her.

56
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,939
They turned around
before they even got to the airport.

57
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,876
So that's what happened.

58
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,927
Another half hour,
you wouldn't have made it.

59
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,852
I guess it wasn't my time.

60
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,947
Not now, please.

61
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,795
Do you want to tell me
what really happened?

62
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,492
What's to tell?

63
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:20,367
I kissed Natalie goodbye.

64
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:24,831
I caught a chill after she left
so I got back into bed.

65
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,180
When I woke up,

66
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,389
I was here.

67
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,708
Had you been spending
a lot of time in bed?

68
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,821
I don't have anywhere else to be,
do I?

69
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,795
And your daughter Natalie,
how long has she been in New York?

70
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,403
A week, 10 days.

71
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:56,465
I told you
Connie overreacted to my...

72
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,271
My forced retirement,
sent out an S.O.S.

73
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,164
sent out an S.O.S.

74
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:06,072
The boys came in first
from California.

75
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,721
And how was that?

76
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,587
Awkward as hell.

77
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,520
I didn't know how to talk to them,
they didn't know how to talk to me.

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
We watched basketball,

79
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,493
reruns.

80
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,931
My older one ate my food.

81
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:24,281
The younger one was upset
that there was no booze in the house,

82
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,914
so he went out
and got a bottle of single malt.

83
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,889
After that I never saw him
with an empty glass.

84
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,237
Then

85
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,226
Natalie came.

86
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,001
And the second she got in,
they beat it the hell out of there.

87
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,337
And she came all the way
from Rwanda.

88
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:43,350
Paul, I know where she was living.

89
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,111
Yes, but it's just that you'd said
before that you felt that she was...

90
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,763
done with you.

91
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,164
Yeah, well, Connie must have really laid
a guilt trip on her.

92
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,089
And how was it seeing her?

93
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,428
Uncomfortable.

94
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,791
She wanted to talk about what happened
over there, what happened here.

95
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,194
I told her I wasn't in the mood
for small talk,

96
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,665
she made me get out of bed
and shower, shave,

97
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,199
get dressed.

98
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,717
Made me go out on walks in the park.

99
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,881
She even took me to the zoo.

100
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,168
She used to love going there
when she was a little girl.

101
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,503
So your mood improved
when she was here.

102
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,615
Did you find it

103
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,840
upsetting when she had to leave?

104
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:32,783
Well, of course I was upset,
but I wanted her to go.

105
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,106
So whether or not
you really were feeling better,

106
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,529
you made sure
that they both thought you were.

107
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,235
I told you, I was better.

108
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,718
So you had your last meal with Natalie,
you kissed her goodbye,

109
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:48,943
they left and you finally had...

110
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:52,057
Your privacy.

111
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:55,079
What I had was the chills.

112
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,083
- And what did you take for the chills?
- Aspirin.

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,220
Antacid.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,467
- What difference does it make?
- They pumped your stomach, Walter.

115
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,180
You were pretty far gone.

116
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,807
And it wasn't from antacids.

117
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:18,985
So what?

118
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:21,671
Probably what happened
was I drifted off, woke up,

119
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,484
reached out
for the wrong pills in my sleep.

120
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,153
- I don't believe you.
- What the fuck would you know?

121
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,947
Because it's my job to know.

122
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,908
And I am obligated to express

123
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,475
my concern to Dr. Wells
and the rest of the team here.

124
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,209
You don't have
to be concerned, Paul.

125
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:44,574
My family isn't going to sue you.

126
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:49,055
They're not like
that pilot's family.

127
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,468
What?

128
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,991
That's all you're worried about,
isn't it?

129
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,065
I should have vetted you sooner.

130
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,207
But someone on your school...

131
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,369
I'm on the board,
by the way, or was...

132
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,594
recommended you and, like I say,

133
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,199
I've been dropping my guard lately.

134
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:17,662
I think you can still pack
a pretty mean punch if you want to.

135
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,583
You seem like a smart fellow.

136
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,334
And I know you wouldn't know
anyone who could hurt me.

137
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,459
But still,

138
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:28,271
when the leaks started
to really hit the papers,

139
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:31,742
I told Marie to have HR run
a background check on you.

140
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,447
What did you think about it?

141
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:36,931
You mean aside from wondering
if you were in over your head with me?

142
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,169
I had other things going.

143
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:42,500
I didn't even look at it
until last week.

144
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,839
Last week...

145
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,632
- after I had to cancel.
- Probably around there.

146
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,933
Did you feel I let you down
by canceling?

147
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,107
No, actually I was relieved.

148
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:56,028
I didn't want to come in
and go through the motions.

149
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,787
- Is that what coming feels like?
- That's what everything feels like.

150
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:02,872
I wasn't upset.

151
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,876
But I was surprised.

152
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:08,564
You convinced me

153
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,748
that you were angry
about what had happened to me

154
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:14,014
and that you were on my side.

155
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,095
And when I missed a session?

156
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:19,682
Boy, you really have a high opinion
of yourself, don't you?

157
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,060
I can't help but notice

158
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,602
that's when you decided
to read the background check.

159
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,421
I had time on my hands.

160
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:26,929
And blood.

161
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:28,607
Just like you.

162
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,105
Is that

163
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,245
also what you thought

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,681
- when you read about the lawsuit?
- What difference does it make?

165
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,329
You keep saying "what difference
does it make", but I think it does.

166
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:47,018
With all due respect, Paul,
don't flatter yourself.

167
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,243
If you'd been there or not
it wouldn't have mattered one bit.

168
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,016
So you're saying
your mind was made up,

169
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,328
you would have done it anyway
one way or the other.

170
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:55,342
Done what?

171
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,005
I went to sleep.

172
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:01,644
I went to sleep.

173
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,284
What was it, a handful of pills?

174
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:17,287
A couple of shots
of your son's scotch?

175
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,084
It must have been everything
you could do...

176
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:22,988
What?

177
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:25,114
To hold on

178
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:26,999
until Natalie was gone.

179
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,626
What was she supposed to do,
take care of me for the rest of my life?

180
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,389
Both of them,

181
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,825
opening the blinds,
fluffing the fucking pillows,

182
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,724
making sure I'm dressed.

183
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,809
They were worrying themselves
sick about me.

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,728
And you didn't want that?

185
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:50,719
So I...

186
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,783
I forced myself to start eating again.
I stopped taking the pills.

187
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:56,608
I squirreled those away.

188
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,429
I pretended to sleep through the night
just so they'd...

189
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,661
finally leave me alone
for a few hours.

190
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,080
A few hours,
that's all you needed then?

191
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:11,669
I told Connie she couldn't let Natalie
take a car service to the airport.

192
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,768
You figured
she wouldn't just drop her off.

193
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:15,893
She'd wait at the airport
for a while.

194
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:18,915
So you would have enough time.

195
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,944
I wanted Natalie up in the air,

196
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,989
as far away from this as possible.

197
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,928
Connie was just supposed
to come home and find me asleep.

198
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,061
A millionaire's death.

199
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,147
You know what that means?

200
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,266
I think I heard my father
use that expression.

201
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,641
Yeah, mine too.

202
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,966
You go to bed one night

203
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:38,487
and you don't wake up.

204
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,506
Just close your eyes.

205
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,869
I took the pills,

206
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,238
chased them down,

207
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,717
took a few more.

208
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,070
I don't even remember
the girls coming back.

209
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:59,062
I must have vomited
all over the bed.

210
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:03,280
I just wanted it to be over,
that's all.

211
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:06,923
It's okay, Walter.

212
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:08,952
It's okay.

213
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,895
I can't even do that.

214
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:14,764
What do you mean?

215
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,478
Just leave it on the table.
Thank you.

216
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,793
Does everyone in the hospital know?

217
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:39,530
You have a very good team
of doctors.

218
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,519
They assessed the situation
the night that...

219
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,384
you came in.

220
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,258
Is it in the papers?

221
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,131
For how long?

222
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,825
I didn't leave a note.

223
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:00,805
I left the TV on,

224
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:02,704
left the lights on.

225
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,032
Nobody was supposed to know.

226
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,816
Just an old man...

227
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,543
asleep under the covers.

228
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,272
The doorman would have helped.

229
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,722
Short term,

230
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,449
Connie would have mourned, but...

231
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,916
she has a support system.

232
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,597
Long term, she'd be a helluva
lot better off

233
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:31,183
as my widow than my wife.

234
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,642
I'm sure she would not agree
with that, Walter.

235
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,108
She didn't sign on for this.

236
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:37,874
For what?

237
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,182
To have a disgraced basket case
as a husband.

238
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,154
Do you know what it's like for her?

239
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,617
She's been a C.E.O's wife
and now she has to sneak out

240
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,244
through the service entrance
of the building next door like...

241
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,512
Like you do.

242
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,040
It's not the same.
It's different for me.

243
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,133
- And why is that?
- Because she didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,211
And you did?

245
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,671
Everything that's happened to you,

246
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,378
you feel that you've deserved it?
Is that the way you think?

247
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,057
People died...

248
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,847
on my watch, Paul.
Let's not pretend otherwise.

249
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,640
And anyone who's worried about you
would be better off if you...

250
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,000
weren't around?

251
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,797
It's just... the objective truth.

252
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:20,519
You met my daughter?

253
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,938
She's got her whole life
ahead of her.

254
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,740
Now what? She's supposed
to just put it on hold and...

255
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,103
and worry about whether her old man

256
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,451
got out of bed that morning
or took a shave?

257
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,911
I've met Natalie.

258
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:37,255
And she's in a terrifying place
right now.

259
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,160
But as hard as it is for her
to worry about you,

260
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,707
I'm absolutely certain
that if you'd managed to kill yourself,

261
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:45,173
she would never
have forgiven herself.

262
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,212
The same way...

263
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:00,165
that you've never forgiven yourself.

264
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,632
- It's not the same.
- Isn't it?

265
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,262
You blamed yourself
for Tommy's death

266
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,404
even though
he was the one who jumped.

267
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,755
You blamed yourself for James

268
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,287
even though
he was hell-bent on destruction.

269
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,787
And you blamed yourself
for this crisis

270
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:19,544
even though you did everything possible
to avert it.

271
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,076
It wasn't enough, Paul.

272
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,914
Of course it wasn't.
I mean, how could it be?

273
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,730
You've had...

274
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,988
blood on your hands,
as you say, your whole life.

275
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,413
And it's shaped everything.

276
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,978
That's why this time when kids died,

277
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:39,493
it wasn't punishment enough to sacrifice
your life to your parents,

278
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:40,668
as you did.

279
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:44,482
This time you had to impose
the death penalty on yourself.

280
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,467
- I see what you're doing.
- And what am I doing?

281
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,131
Is this how you deal
with your guilt?

282
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,196
You tell yourself
that what you feel isn't real?

283
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:04,720
That...

284
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,880
you did the best you could?

285
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,942
It's always there.

286
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:14,049
I always wonder what else
I should have done,

287
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:18,089
what the limits truly are
of responsibility to another person.

288
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,322
And you can live with that?

289
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,004
- It doesn't affect you?
- Of course it does.

290
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,787
All I can really do is try to...

291
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,277
understand what happened and...

292
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,662
why I made the choices I made.

293
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,674
To... learn from the loss and to...

294
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,451
Well, it's different for you.

295
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:38,277
You're a young man.

296
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,165
You can recover from your mistake,

297
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,890
move to another state,

298
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,723
- start over.
- And you don't feel that you can?

299
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:47,086
It's too late for me.

300
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,782
We both know that.

301
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,299
Look at you...

302
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,304
One eye on the door,

303
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:59,806
wondering when you can get out of here
and cut your losses.

304
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,846
That's not what I was doing.

305
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,146
Natalie is outside.

306
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:10,396
What is she still doing here?
I told her to go home to her mother.

307
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:14,799
- She doesn't listen to me anymore.
- She's on watch, Walter.

308
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,223
She doesn't trust that somebody
is going to look in on you

309
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,998
every 15 minutes or so.

310
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,874
Every 15 minutes?

311
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:24,888
Is that what that is?

312
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:27,434
You're at risk.

313
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,898
- Did you tell her that?
- She told me.

314
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:34,278
So?

315
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,377
Tell her I'm fine.

316
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,347
"Tell her I'm fine."

317
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,851
"You're safe to fly."

318
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,314
- Whatever.
- I can't really do that, Walter.

319
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,611
I think you're gonna have to stay here
for a little longer.

320
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:52,886
But I'm fine.

321
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,364
I'm eating. I'm sleeping.

322
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,664
I just got a little dehydrated.

323
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,329
Just tell them you're my therapist
and that there's nothing wrong with me.

324
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,664
I can't do that.

325
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:07,365
In my opinion...

326
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,843
you need to be kept
under observation.

327
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:13,706
And you've made it clear that you don't
want your family standing guard duty.

328
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,843
Are you trying to have me committed?

329
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:21,182
What I'm saying is that I think
it would be a very good idea for you

330
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,207
to stay here for a few days.

331
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:30,424
- This hospital is one of the best.
- I'll call my lawyer.

332
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,192
He'll bounce you on your ass so fast
you won't know what hit you.

333
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,211
You want to sue me, Walter,

334
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:38,989
get in line. But it's not gonna
get you out of here any sooner.

335
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:49,078
How long?

336
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:52,937
Until it's safe for you to leave.

337
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,582
And if the doctors haven't released you
within two weeks,

338
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:59,656
then you have the right
to make your case before a judge.

339
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:00,781
A judge?

340
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,867
- Are you kidding me?
- I wish I were.

341
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,643
I don't want anything
to happen to you, Walter.

342
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,216
Too late.

343
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,494
Walter, it's not too late.

344
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,397
- There's a lot...
- Get out of here, will you?

345
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,869
- Are you sure...
- Just get out of here.

346
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,042
Can I go in to see him?

347
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,515
I'd give him a few minutes.

348
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,916
He's not coming home tomorrow,
is he?

349
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,661
It's up to the doctors, but...

350
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:19,215
I'm going to tell them
that he's still at risk to himself.

351
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,340
He doesn't agree, of course,

352
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,330
but...

353
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:28,975
- I can't take the chance.
- I know.

354
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:30,994
Thank you.

355
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,296
- Are you all right?
- Me?

356
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:40,418
I'm fine.

357
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:47,701
I'm just thinking about
what I'm going to tell my mother.

358
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,188
I'm sorry this is...

359
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,619
so much...

360
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:52,964
on you.

361
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,928
Actually I'm surprised
that she's not here tonight.

362
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,990
It's for the best.
She is not great in these situations

363
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:03,550
as you can imagine.

364
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,004
Why is that?

365
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,104
He didn't tell you.

366
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:27,241
She's been in rehab,
I don't know, three, four times.

367
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,288
Pills, booze.

368
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,038
She's gonna go to pieces.
