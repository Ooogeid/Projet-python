00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:03,050
<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:07,418
We just argue nonstop.
It's beginning to affect my work.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,367
If they were to diagnose therapists
whose marriages fell apart,

4
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:14,643
how many cases of erotic transference
would they find?

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:18,213
I don't think my marriage to Kate
is falling apart.

6
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:22,235
Yes, I had a row with Laura...
I mean with Kate.

7
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:25,288
- Who's Laura?
- The girl with the issue of...

8
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,327
erotic transference.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,075
I didn't come here
to talk about a patient.

10
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:33,330
Did you come here
to ask for my guidance?

11
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,164
Or to talk to me as a friend?

12
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,458
Are you seeking advice from a colleague?

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,501
What role have you assigned me?

14
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:42,566
I'm trying to figure it out,
but I'm failing!

15
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,861
No, he's not here.
Please don't call back.

16
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,476
Because he's dead. He died a year ago.

17
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:38,911

18
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:50,965
Thank you for getting back to me,
Amy. I...

19
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,756
I appreciate it.

20
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,792
So I'll see you next week then.

21
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,999
Same time.

22
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,374
Thank you. Bye.

23
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,013
It's...

24
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,501
It's true.

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,525
Kate's been...

26
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,448
She's been seeing...

27
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,905
this guy.

28
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,047
Supermarket manager,
employment agency guy...

29
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:49,557
I forget what he does, but anyway,

30
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:52,038
he's divorced,

31
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,850
got a kid.

32
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,989
She made sure to tell me
all the details.

33
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:10,487
- Did she say how long?
- Everything's gone to hell...

34
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,284
Patients, family.

35
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,376
If I was...

36
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,111
If I was into astrology,
I'd say there was something

37
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:22,179
cosmic going on,
planets colliding somewhere.

38
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,714
First, one of my patients...
The pilot I was telling you about...

39
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,722
He's leaving his wife.

40
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,395
Just like that.

41
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,613
She grinds her teeth in her sleep,
so marriage over.

42
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,690
And the 16-year-old, the gymnast?
She's having an affair

43
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,313
with this guy in his mid-40s,
married guy...

44
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,341
Her coach. At least I think
that's what she's hinting at.

45
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,443
And she also goes
to the same school as my daughter

46
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,708
so I had the pleasure
of finding out that...

47
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,462
Rosie was having a... A thing...

48
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:01,810
with this boy at school.

49
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,713
I don't even know what a thing is.
I don't even know if it's true.

50
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,723
I asked her. I got nowhere.

51
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:10,888
She wouldn't tell me anything.

52
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,575
And then finally...

53
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:25,999
Is it me?

54
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,089
Kate says it is.

55
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,807
She says it's my fault.

56
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,100
I don't see her, that's she's invisible.

57
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:38,998
She says I don't see the kids either,
they're invisible too.

58
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,858
As far as I know, Rosie could be
having sex with a drug addict.

59
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:46,840
Everybody talks about her at school...
at least that's what she said.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
Who said? Kate said that?

61
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,999
- I'm lost, Paul.
- The girl, Sophie... the gymnast.

62
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:57,153
- You talk about 10 things at once.
- No, she's in the same grade as Rosie.

63
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:59,179
Let's focus on Kate.

64
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,740
What am I supposed to do, Gina?

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,991
I mean, what...

66
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,888
what am I supposed to do...

67
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:19,293
now?

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,589
Did she say
what she thinks will happen now

69
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,399
between the two of you?

70
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:31,455
I don't know. She said it's...
She said it's up to me.

71
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,278
- What do you think that means?
- You tell me.

72
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:37,664
She's banging some insurance
salesman and it's up to me?

73
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:39,664
She gave me all the details.

74
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,084
She blows him, she screws him...

75
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,432
It's like a porno film.

76
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,776
- She told you that?
- Absolutely.

77
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:49,186
- Why?
- You know, my conception...

78
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,222
maybe I should say

79
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,375
my misconception of Kate
is that everything...

80
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:59,401
Everything about sex
was always connected to

81
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,812
intimacy for her.

82
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,842
There was never anything weird
or dirty about sex.

83
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,952
It was always about intimacy.

84
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,905
Now I feel if someone
throws the word intimacy at me,

85
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,255
I want to punch her in the mouth.

86
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,504
Punch "her" in the mouth?

87
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,552
- What?
- You said punch "her."

88
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,862
You know,
all that bullshit that I thought meant

89
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,627
intimacy to her...

90
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,894
The candles, the backrubs, feeling safe.

91
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,563
Meanwhile she's in her own porno film,

92
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,294
fucking this...

93
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:38,439
This guy.

94
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:45,201
I'm trying to figure out
why she would tell you graphic details.

95
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,538
- Because she wanted to hurt me.
- Did you ask for details?

96
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,037
I just wanted to...

97
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,552
I wanted to get a grasp
of the situation, you know?

98
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,218
She made sure you wouldn't ignore
what she was saying.

99
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,473
I think you knew what was going on.

100
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,259
Last week when we spoke,
I think you knew.

101
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,675
I'm sure Kate sensed that as well...
your suspicion.

102
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,440
Maybe I'm wrong.

103
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,689
I knew.

104
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
I did know.

105
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,477
You'd think that would make it easier,
you know?

106
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,902
Almost threw her out of the house.

107
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:40,063
It was like, "You hurt me,

108
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,417
"I'm gonna hurt you.
Now just get the fuck out of here."

109
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,293
I mean, there are a thousand ways

110
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,516
that people can deal
with these things.

111
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,215
We could have gone to therapy,
for example.

112
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:57,095
I mean, not everybody
has to fuck around.

113
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:04,987
What's that?

114
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,755
Coldex Night.

115
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,974
They're supposed to be stronger
than Coldex Day.

116
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,781
I've had two of them already.
They kind of make you a bit stoned.

117
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,619
Do you want some tea?

118
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,674
- Water would be good, thanks.
- Sure.

119
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,008
I had a session yesterday with that...

120
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:38,594
Thanks.

121
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,213
With that couple who called me a...

122
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,854
Who called me a murderer.

123
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:49,335
In the middle of the session,

124
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,014
she runs to the bathroom
and she starts to bleed.

125
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,674
- What happened?
- Miscarriage.

126
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,864
- My God.
- It was pretty scary.

127
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,961
- How is she?
- I think she's fine.

128
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,906
I just spoke to her at the hospital.
They're running some tests,

129
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,631
but she seems to be okay.

130
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,509
At least I'm not a murderer.

131
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,504
Though I wouldn't be surprised
if the husband blamed me for everything.

132
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:14,419
You know, stress as a result of therapy.

133
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:17,091
It's possible.

134
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:20,779
Ironically,

135
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:25,089
they'd both just kind of worked out
their problem.

136
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,032
They weren't arguing, which for them,
is a major accomplishment.

137
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,407
And he said to me:

138
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,965
"This is our last session."

139
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,063
And then...

140
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,121
Then it happened.

141
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,152
Anyway, I was trying
to get the blood out of the couch,

142
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,862
'cause when she got up,
she left a stain,

143
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,265
and Kate walks into the room.

144
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,307
And she looks around and she says...

145
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:57,751
"What goes on in this office?"

146
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,221
Anyway...

147
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,157
Quite a week.

148
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,153
Quite a week.

149
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:12,083
Ultimatums from two women.

150
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:14,911
Kate and Laura.

151
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:17,538
- Laura?
- She tells you she's in love with you.

152
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:21,575
What's... What are we going back
to that for?

153
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,326
I was talking about something
completely different.

154
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:27,840
You don't think it's relevant?
You describe two women attacking you.

155
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,968
Two women? What about three women?

156
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:34,461
Does it feel like I'm attacking?

157
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:39,753
Maybe that's why you're taking pills
to protect yourself against me.

158
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,646
I have a cold, see?

159
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,319
Last week you called me
a sleepy spider,

160
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,691
in wait.

161
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:49,987
Were you...

162
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,145
Were you insulted by that?

163
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,001
I take it back.

164
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,665
You're not sleepy.

165
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:08,464
Would you agree that your relationship
with Kate has been...

166
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:13,232
a wall between you and your patients
so that you're safe,

167
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,055
you're not attracted to them?

168
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,857
Attraction's... It's not a problem.

169
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:28,568
Freud, Messer, Davies, all the big guys,

170
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,143
they all talk about how attraction
is inevitable, it's part of therapy.

171
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,380
But if you brush it under the rug,
the message you're giving to the patient

172
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,799
is that their feelings are perverse,
are dangerous.

173
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,313
Their feelings?
I'm talking about your feelings.

174
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm not worried that Laura will try
and break down the wall on her own.

175
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,979
I'm worried that you want her to.

176
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,236
The wall?

177
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,903
What is this metaphor?

178
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,365
- My wife is a wall?
- You don't agree?

179
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,090
I'm not hiding from my patients.

180
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,479
- That essay that Bolas wrote about...
- Forget about Bolas.

181
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,201
Every time we go deeper,
you reach for some theory...

182
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,438
These male therapists tormented
by lust for their patients. Right?

183
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:20,482
I mention Laura
and that's who you start quoting.

184
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,895
But why are we even talking about Laura?

185
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,249
Because I want you to hear
what you're saying.

186
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,875
That you're surrounded
by women who demand

187
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,412
that you respond and love and

188
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,965
be angry and feel,

189
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,256
that you face your feelings.

190
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,292
Did I mention that Laura is...

191
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,816
Is getting married in June?

192
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:58,156
So Laura's over.

193
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:01,339
That's finished.

194
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,664
If anyone wants
to pull down a wall, it's Kate.

195
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,770
- Why?
- Secrecy. She...

196
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,776
She hates it.
She hates that I can't share it.

197
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:18,969
- You mean work?
- She resents my office.

198
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,468
It's like enemy territory to her.
She's always trying to make it

199
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,025
her space... a piece of it.

200
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:27,322
Like "Let's get a new sofa."

201
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:30,460
- Or new blinds or a rug or something.
- Do you let her?

202
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,322
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

203
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:35,350
Because I agree with her.
It's not her space.

204
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:47,392
There was a time when I used to talk
about my patients, when Ian was a kid.

205
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,460
I would share... share details.

206
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,935
- With Kate. You don't mean Ian.
- Both of them at the dinner table.

207
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,970
I see that look of horror on your face.

208
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,502
No, I was pretty discreet actually.
I never mentioned any names.

209
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:07,086
If someone mentioned rats, I'd say,

210
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,833
"I had a patient with a fear of rats,

211
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,346
"dreamed about rats every night."
You know, stuff like that.

212
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,561
- You don't do that now?
- No.

213
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,101
But I remember when Ian was about 10,

214
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:21,411
he asked me, "Dad, what's an alcoholic?"

215
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,517
And I told him about
this patient of mine

216
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,761
who needed a drink actually
to get out of bed in the morning.

217
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,609
One day this man came up to the office
and he was...

218
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:37,973
kind of staggering and Ian said,
"Dad, is that the alcoholic?"

219
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,842
You were careless.

220
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:48,688
This situation now, I think...

221
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:51,891
There's more at stake.

222
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,679
- Do you agree?
- Because we're talking about a woman?

223
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,467
Sexual attraction.

224
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,539
Can I ask you a question?

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,288
You're in the middle of a session
and a patient needed to use the bathroom

226
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,665
and your bathroom is blocked up.

227
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,035
Would you let them use
the bathroom in your house?

228
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:20,731
- Did that happen?
- Laura said that she had to pee.

229
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:24,587
And I told her,
"Well, the toilet's blocked up."

230
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,640
So she headed for the door
of the house and...

231
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,435
I freaked out.
I jumped up and I stopped her.

232
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,838
I'm keeping your metaphor going here.
I hope you appreciate that about the...

233
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,069
She tried to scale the wall.

234
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,530
There's always a patient
who wants to know about you...

235
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,533
More about your private self.

236
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,847
Anyway...

237
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:55,073
- What did you do?
- I jumped up. I panicked.

238
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,660
- What made you panic?
- She was doing it on purpose, I felt.

239
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:02,929
I thought, "Why can't she hold it
for another 10 minutes?"

240
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,944
Why did I panic?

241
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know really.

242
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:20,923
Has that ever happened
with another patient?

243
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:23,509
Sophie, the gymnast...

244
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,937
She came in last week and...

245
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:29,287
it had been raining
and she was completely soaked.

246
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:33,150
So I let her change
into my daughter's clothes.

247
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,962
That didn't make you uncomfortable?

248
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:39,676
It's a lot more intimate
than using the bathroom...

249
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,470
Rosie's clothes.

250
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,336
She had casts on both her arms
from the accident.

251
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:51,271
And she held up her hands like this
and she said,

252
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,392
"Undress me."

253
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,290
So, I got Kate to come in and help her.

254
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,874
- How old did you say she was?
- 16.

255
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,514
She's the girl who's sleeping
with her adult coach?

256
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,850
She <i>might</i> be sleeping
with her coach.

257
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,483
It's a loaded situation,
her asking you to undress her.

258
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,220
She was messing with me.

259
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,831
You had no problem handling that?

260
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:15,549
You had Kate help her, undress her,
give her your daughter's clothes.

261
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,169
But when Laura needs to use
the bathroom, you freak out.

262
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,431
- Why is that?
- Laura is a woman.

263
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:22,660
Sophie's just a... she's just a child.

264
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,229
Shouldn't that make it easier?

265
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:37,015
You know, there was...
There was a part of me

266
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:40,179
that really wanted Laura
to go through the door,

267
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,118
to see where I live.

268
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,101
- Maybe to... to see Kate.
- You wanted that?

269
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,151
Was that what scared you?

270
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,192
Did you discuss
what Laura told you last week?

271
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,793
She said that the reason
that she was going to marry this guy,

272
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,930
this boyfriend Andrew, was because
I told her I wasn't interested.

273
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,121
I know what you're thinking,
but I made it really clear.

274
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:08,745
I said nothing

275
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,428
is going to happen between us.

276
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,898
- Good.
- I'm... I'm just...

277
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,858
I'm not going to play along.
This is not going to happen.

278
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,423
In your mind,

279
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,805
is there any possibility that the affair
could become a reality?

280
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:27,481
No, in your mind.

281
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:31,831
Look, I have to admit sometimes,
it's... It's flattering.

282
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,640
I can't help but enjoy the feeling.

283
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,168
But I told her no.

284
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,457
I said, "This cannot happen.

285
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,502
"You cannot go through that door.
There are limits."

286
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,994
Is that what upset you,
that she was testing you?

287
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:50,374
It's not that abstract.

288
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,839
She's a beautiful woman.

289
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:59,043
She says she wants to have sex with me.

290
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,005
I know what's in her head,

291
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,648
so I don't want her going through
the door and maybe bumping into Kate.

292
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,848
But you said you did want that.

293
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,654
Some part of you wanted that.

294
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,952
The point I'm making is that

295
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:19,762
I want Laura to understand
that we can survive this,

296
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,030
that any attraction
that comes up between us I can handle.

297
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,824
I am not going to let this
derail the therapy.

298
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,838
Her wanting to sleep with you?

299
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,590
How did she put it exactly?

300
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,960
That she knows that...

301
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:34,698
I want her.

302
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,689
She said that she wants to...

303
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,254
to fuck me and that she knows
that I want to fuck her too.

304
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,921
That's a lot to stave off,

305
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,447
- that kind of intensity.
- She can be very direct... Laura.

306
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:54,393
Maybe that's why I panicked.

307
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,747
Here's what I think, Paul,

308
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:05,784
and you can accept this or tell me
I'm interfering again, but

309
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,532
given the situation with Kate,

310
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:14,158
I think we...
we might explore the option

311
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,844
of transferring Laura
to another therapist.

312
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,201
- What?
- Just hear me out on this.

313
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:23,312
Because Laura thinks
she wants to sleep with me?

314
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:26,548
Last week you thought
we were already having sex.

315
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,399
I thought you had an affair
and you were trying to justify it.

316
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,474
- Thanks, Gina.
- I was wrong. I'm sorry.

317
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,564
I jumped to conclusions.

318
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,846
You've reassured me.

319
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:39,325
But now this situation with Kate...

320
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,890
How emotional you are
and the pressure you're under.

321
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,387
Listen to yourself.

322
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,738
You're injured. You're vulnerable.
You're angry.

323
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,074
This isn't me being stubborn, Paul.

324
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:54,035
I think we should just discuss
the possibility

325
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:56,874
that Laura's better off
with a different therapist.

326
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,225
- A female therapist, you mean.
- Yeah, preferably.

327
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,922
- You, for instance?
- No, I'm retired, remember?

328
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,767
This is so typical of you.

329
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:08,933
You always begin by saying
"I hate to say this, but...

330
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,052
"But..."

331
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,700
And you lay some pronouncement on me
that you've already been thinking about

332
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,114
before you've come into the session.
This isn't a debate club, you know?

333
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:21,517
It's not like we take a position
and we hunt for ways to support it.

334
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:24,410
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm listening.

335
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:28,406
You have Kate on one side
and you have Laura on the other.

336
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,817
But they're two
totally different situations, Gina.

337
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:40,639
Are you saying that I pushed Kate
into this situation?

338
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,249
That I created this environment at home

339
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,341
so that Kate could go fuck
an insurance agent

340
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:50,139
because really I'm in love with Laura?

341
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,139
Isn't that your theory?
Your notes somewhere?

342
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,652
- Look at how you're reacting.
- How am I reacting?

343
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:03,274
I am not sending Laura
to another therapist.

344
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:04,922
End of story.

345
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,875
I can handle
whatever comes up in the sessions.

346
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,631
That's why I'm here... Because
I want you to help me to handle it.

347
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,993
We just need to discuss this, Paul.

348
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,340
I don't want to pawn her off
on somebody else.

349
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,254
But what's best for Laura?

350
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:21,229
Honestly,
if it wasn't for Kate cheating...

351
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,139
I wouldn't be here, Gina.

352
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,452
And we haven't talked
about your comment the last time.

353
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:37,451
- I was pretty pissed off about that.
- About what?

354
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:41,387
You made a crack about my father
leaving my mother for a patient.

355
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,036
What was that supposed to mean?

356
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,816
That I can't treat Laura because of
what my father did years ago?

357
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:49,706
I'm not my father, for Christ's sake.

358
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:53,074
No, you're not your father.
I'm suggesting a pattern

359
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,791
- that might be threatening to you.
- Are you

360
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:59,324
or are you not, Gina,
saying that because of my father,

361
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,934
that I'm in danger of having an affair?

362
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
My gut...

363
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,559
You can't answer it, can you?

364
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,470
No, I can't.

365
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:26,315
If I remember correctly, you were faced
with the same scenario yourself.

366
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,448
So maybe this really isn't
about my father.

367
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,458
Maybe it's about you, Gina.

368
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,360
Don't forget I was the one
who referred Charlie to you.

369
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,470
I remember he called me
after one of your sessions.

370
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,995
And he confessed to me that...

371
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:46,405
that he was in love with you.
No, actually he went further.

372
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,878
He said that you were in love
with each other.

373
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:53,134
Maybe he was wrong, I don't know.

374
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,760
Either way, you needed to face that,
and you didn't.

375
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,770
You just ran off to England.

376
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,757
You know what?
I could not believe when that happened.

377
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,970
That was a wake-up call for me,

378
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:09,625
watching you behave like that.

379
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:13,361
- I didn't run away.
- Come on,

380
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,753
a sabbatical with David? At that moment?

381
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,927
By the way,
is that what your novel is about?

382
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,049
I figured.

383
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:33,322
You failed the same test yourself, Gina,

384
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,332
but you abandoned a patient.

385
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,134
He tried to get hold of you
over the years, didn't he?

386
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,070
A few letters.

387
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,485
I didn't answer.

388
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,786
You do know
that he died a few months ago?

389
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,570
Prostate cancer.

390
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:04,431
It was right after David
and I couldn't go to another funeral.

391
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,870
I just couldn't... I couldn't face it.

392
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,260
It's funny, you know? I was talking
about Charlie the other day

393
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:19,856
to a patient of mine.

394
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:23,968
I was saying that I... I'd been
to his funeral and that I was...

395
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,196
I couldn't feel sadness.

396
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:32,023
And I was, you know,
beating myself up about it.

397
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,347
The truth is, I was...

398
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,076
I was so disillusioned with you, Gina,

399
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,434
for keeping you on as a supervisor.

400
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:49,673
After what you pulled with Charlie,
I should have just walked out then.

401
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:54,688
You know that he never ever got
over you?

402
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,546
Since we're digging for the truth...

403
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,871
May I ask
how you really feel about Laura?

404
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:21,310
I haven't heard a clear answer.
Not what you're going to do about her,

405
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,711
but how you feel.

406
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:26,506
Do you mean, am I attracted to her?

407
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,257
- Are you?
- Come on, Gina.

408
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:31,259
If I transferred every patient
I was attracted to at some point,

409
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:33,574
I wouldn't have any patients left.

410
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,219
And it's not your place
to say I should transfer a patient.

411
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,202
It's like me telling that couple
they should have an abortion.

412
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,212
It's not what therapists do.

413
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,840
We don't tell people
how to run their lives.

414
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:53,376
I'm suggesting that we talk about
stopping Laura's therapy

415
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:54,910
and look at your reaction.

416
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,287
Paul, do you really need another pill?

417
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:03,861
I know. Tomorrow's Saturday.
I can sleep all day Sunday.

418
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:08,020
I don't really care
if they knock me out or not, really.

419
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:15,753
What you're going through with Kate
is so complicated.
