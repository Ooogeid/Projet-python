1
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:05,626
Excuse me.

2
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:16,503
Let's see...

3
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,227
I think this...

4
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,548
Is that free?

5
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:24,940
- That there, is that free?
- Sure.

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,541
Thanks.

7
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,013
Do you mind?

8
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,212
That's great.

9
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,105
Thank you.

10
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:36,875
There we go.

11
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:39,528
Oh, boy.

12
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,704
Oh boy, I'll tell you,

13
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,385
what a day.

14
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,743
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

15
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,178
How's it going?

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,270
Good. Good, thanks.

17
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:58,058
You know,

18
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,383
I thought the afternoon trains
would be less crowded.

19
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,761
- Friday, it's bad all day.
- Sure.

20
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,488
And it gets more crowded
the longer you stay on.

21
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,047
Sure.

22
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,172
And by the time we get to D.C.

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,472
I'll be sitting in your lap.

24
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:18,381
I'm just joking.

25
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,753
Just joking. No offense.

26
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:24,250
My stupid shrink says
I should say shit like that.

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,924
But what does he know?

28
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,800
Last year he tells me
I should leave my wife.

29
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,075
Now who do I got left to talk to?

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,051
Strangers on trains.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,740
So what do you do?

32
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:41,938
I'm in sales.

33
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:57,358

34
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:24,176
- You've done a nice job on the place.
- I tried to warm it up a bit.

35
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,558
- Sit down.
- Listen, thanks for taking the time out

36
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,933
to see me.
I know you're really...

37
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,333
I know you're really busy.

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,240
I'd always see you.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,446
So I've been worried about you.
I haven't heard from you for a while.

40
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,721
Yeah, I know.

41
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:49,168
I'm not so great
at keeping in touch.

42
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,253
No, I know you had your reasons.

43
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,781
A lot's happened, you know?

44
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,178
Did my lawyer call you?

45
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,446
Yes, he did.

46
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,953
I'm so sorry, Paul.

47
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,867
To have a patient die is terrible.

48
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:07,352
But then
to have the family sue you is...

49
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:10,594
Did he say
that he wants you to testify?

50
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,608
He did. I'm going to be deposed.

51
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:15,319
Although I'm not sure
how much help I can be.

52
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,308
That's what they want me to kind of

53
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:22,075
suss out from you.

54
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,579
You didn't really talk much
about Alex until after he died.

55
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,600
I told them you weren't in the room.

56
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,751
You couldn't possibly know whether
or not I gave him the proper care.

57
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:33,804
You didn't keep any notes, did you?

58
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:36,089
I don't need notes.
You don't need notes.

59
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,342
Was it my not taking notes
that killed him?

60
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,080
I haven't taken notes
in 15 years, Gina.

61
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,890
Should we put all the rest
of my patients on suicide watch?

62
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,893
- Why do you call it a suicide?
- Isn't that what everybody thinks?

63
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,896
No, Paul, he died.
That's all anybody can know.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,464
He either killed himself
or I killed him. Take your pick.

65
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:59,665
Whatever happened
between you and Alex in treatment,

66
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,290
you didn't kill him.

67
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,994
You were trying to help him.
He left therapy.

68
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,969
His plane crashed. He died.

69
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,669
Those things occurred in a sequence,

70
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:12,072
- but they are not causally related.
- I know that.

71
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:14,565
I know you do.
I'm just saying it so you can hear it.

72
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,740
You know what? I knew that too.

73
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,086
When someone dies,

74
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:25,676
you want an explanation.

75
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,433
But it doesn't mean there is one.

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
I don't know who that could be.
Sorry.

77
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,208
I'm sorry, Gina. I left my glasses.

78
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,283
Oh, come in.
I didn't see them, but take a look.

79
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,359
Paul.

80
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,646
Tammy.

81
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,297
How are you?

82
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,865
Good.

83
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:56,316
And you?

84
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:00,142
I barge right in. That's me.
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,545
No, Paul is a friend.
He's not a patient.

86
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,470
I left my glasses,
or at least I hope I left them here.

87
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,204
There they are.

88
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,062
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

89
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:16,760
- Imagine, after all these years.
- Yes, it's been a long time.

90
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,066
- You look great.
- You too.

91
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,191
I'm sorry. I should've called.

92
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,437
Bye.

93
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:26,462
- Bye.
- See you next week.

94
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:32,789
It's nice to see you smile.

95
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,915
I keep forgetting
how small this town is.

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,794
That's Tammy Kent, right?

97
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,973
She's Tammy Meswick now.

98
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,103
We grew up on the same street,
10 minutes from here.

99
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:48,378
She's your...

100
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,498
- Are you seeing patients again?
- I am.

101
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,239
I thought you were a writer now.

102
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:59,941
Just the one book.
But people seemed to like it.

103
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,778
I saw the reviews.
They more than liked it.

104
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,780
You didn't get a chance to read it?

105
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,913
To tell you the truth, Gina,

106
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,455
I don't think
I'm ready to read it yet.

107
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,249
- You know what I mean?
- I do.

108
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:18,831
I enjoyed writing,

109
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:21,838
but I feel like
I've had enough time alone for now.

110
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,049
Have you ever lived by yourself?

111
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,964
This is the first time

112
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,852
in for...

113
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:35,098
forever that I've lived alone.

114
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:40,122
Can you believe it? I'm 53 years of age
and I've never lived by myself.

115
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,569
It takes some getting used to.
But there are good things about it.

116
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:55,226
Gina, about this lawsuit...

117
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,602
What I'm going to tell them is

118
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:01,306
that you did everything you could
to help this patient in treatment,

119
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,966
and that if you had felt
he was in any danger,

120
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,648
you would've tried anything
to keep him from flying again.

121
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,176
You think that'll help?

122
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,660
I don't think
it matters what you say.

123
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,059
They're gonna have their experts.
And they won't know

124
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:20,006
- what they're talking about either.
- What?

125
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,390
The whole case
is gonna be decided by people

126
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,651
who have no idea
what went on in the room.

127
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,189
Then the ethics board
are gonna take away my license

128
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,364
because it's the cheapest way
to settle the thing.

129
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,733
I don't have the money to fight it.

130
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,404
If the jury awards them any more than
the $3 million the insurance will cover,

131
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,170
I'm gonna have o declare bankruptcy.
I'll lose the apartment in Brooklyn

132
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,963
and anything I have left
after child support and alimony.

133
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:48,028
Brooklyn? You moved to Brooklyn?

134
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,734
And Kate and the kids
are still here?

135
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,195
You know what?
The way I look at it is,

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,354
they can have my license.
They can have my practice.

137
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,979
I'm an educated man.

138
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:01,729
I can do something

139
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,198
respectable, or not.

140
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:07,803
I just don't care.
I don't care anymore.

141
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:11,539
The truth is, I'm just fucking sick
of sitting in a chair

142
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:15,492
day after day after day
listening to people's problems.

143
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,034
Oh, boy.

144
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:26,648
Sorry.

145
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,913
Kate and the kids are still here.

146
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,821
Ian is in college.

147
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,155
I've become one of those...

148
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,589
Amtrak dads.
I see the kids on weekends.

149
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,484
That must be hard.

150
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:55,690
But my alma mater have offered me
a teaching position. I hoped that...

151
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,746
- that might mean a fresh start.
- Some new problems to listen to.

152
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,364
- There are no new problems.
- I know.

153
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,386
Why do we do this, Gina?

154
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,259
Don't you get tired
of sitting in the chair?

155
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,943
That's why I took two years off.

156
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,130
My office is in my living room,

157
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:27,481
so I actually
never get away from them.

158
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,229
They leave things in the sofa.
I'll be reading or dozing off,

159
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:33,779
and somebody's earring or a date book
will fall out on the floor.

160
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,197
You're sleeping in the living room?

161
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:39,056
It's a good sleeping couch.

162
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,543
I made sure of that,

163
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:45,807
in case Rosie or Max comes to visit.

164
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,962
Did I tell you Rosie
is looking at colleges now?

165
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:51,467
And Max...

166
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,135
Max likes the Mets, which could be
an early sign of masochism.

167
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:00,116
I promised to take him to a game

168
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,305
if he ever comes to see me.

169
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,523
- Do you think it will work?
- I'm sure it will work.

170
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,943
You just need to take a little time,

171
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,894
find some good restaurants
for you and the kids to eat at,

172
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,669
find some new routines.

173
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,037
I don't think
you'll be alone for long, Paul.

174
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,280
But I want to be alone.

175
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,615
I had my chance

176
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,173
at love last year and I blew it.
I'm not taking that risk again.

177
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,233
That risk?

178
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,340
The risk of seeing
how happy I could be.

179
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:42,569
The risk of having somebody want me.
The risk of being happy.

180
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:43,744
No, thanks.

181
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,061
The truth is,
I'm still fucking angry.

182
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,521
After all these years

183
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:58,948
I thought I was coming to find out
about your deposition.

184
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,125
Why did you come here?

185
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,019
I need some clarity

186
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:13,278
in my life, Gina.

187
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,692
I need you to explain
how I let this...

188
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:18,926
whatever you call it...

189
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:22,497
love for Laura,
blind me to the needs of my patient.

190
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,796
Alex used Laura to get me.

191
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:28,421
By the time he was finished in therapy,
I really hated him.

192
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,854
- I let my feelings for this...
- Your love.

193
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,417
All right, my love

194
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,776
for Laura, which, by the way,

195
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,528
I never got
to express physically or...

196
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,351
- My love for this...
- Beautiful.

197
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,461
Yes, she was beautiful.

198
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,161
- Stop putting words in my mouth.
- I'm sorry.

199
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,418
When you called, you asked
if we could talk.

200
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,915
This is how friends talk.

201
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,084
I don't think I have any friends.

202
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,920
It's too bad you don't have a dog.
You could mess that up too.

203
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,559
God. Would you stop?

204
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,723
What do you want me to do, Paul?

205
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,331
I want you to tell me what to do.

206
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:11,992
I want to know

207
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,720
what to feel

208
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:17,363
about all this.

209
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,871
- About all what?
- Everything.

210
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,934
Everything in my life.

211
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,774
You don't know how you feel?

212
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,379
- I don't know how I feel.
- And that's why you're here?

213
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,665
I need your help, Gina.

214
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:53,459
- So when you stopped Alex's therapy...
- No, he stopped it.

215
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:58,150
He showed up at my door in a uniform.
He'd already made a decision.

216
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,631
Okay, when he stopped therapy,

217
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:04,531
did you feel
that the therapy had failed?

218
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,141
- No.
- Good.

219
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:09,482
He came to me
because he was afraid to fly.

220
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,656
And he stopped therapy

221
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:14,291
because he felt
that he was ready go back.

222
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,299
So you met his goals
for the treatment.

223
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,629
And did you have different goals
for his treatment?

224
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,424
- Yes, I did.
- And what were your goals?

225
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,199
You know, I hoped that...

226
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:29,097
I hoped that he'd be able
to forgive himself for...

227
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,299
- For what?
- For what he did.

228
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:34,024
- He dropped a bomb on a school.
- Right.

229
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:36,563
Was he able to forgive himself?

230
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,424
I don't know. Do people
ever forgive themselves really?

231
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,403
I know we talk about it all the time,
but do people ever really do it?

232
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,213
Sometimes.

233
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:46,997
Sometimes, yeah.

234
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:50,869
How long does it take?

235
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,248
Are you...

236
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:59,321
talking about something you're not able
to forgive yourself for?

237
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:02,281
What, like breaking up my marriage,
destroying my kids' lives,

238
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,871
wrecking my career,
not being able to save my mother

239
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,512
and not paying attention
to my father?

240
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,222
That would about cover it.

241
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:11,848
Are you laughing at me?

242
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,518
Why not? We should both laugh.

243
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:18,131
But I can't.

244
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,503
So you go ahead,

245
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:24,410
laugh at my mess of a life.

246
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,118
Would you like a drink?

247
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,321
Sure. Why not?

248
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,636
It's fun not having therapy,
isn't it?

249
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,048
- Is vodka okay?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

250
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,652
- I only have soda.
- That's fine.

251
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,392
Okay, to...

252
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,989
To old friends.

253
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,238
And to Tammy Kent.

254
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
To Tammy Kent.

255
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,115
Tell me about Tammy.

256
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:17,356
I think I can sayI would never
have survived my adolescence

257
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,318
if it hadn't been for her.
She was...

258
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:24,615
- She was my first love.
- Was she?

259
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,229
And even before that,

260
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:30,820
she was the only one who knew...

261
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,023
- Who knew?
- Her family

262
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,198
lived down the hallway from us.

263
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,157
And the night my mother was...

264
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,963
She went to the hospital...

265
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,073
Anyway.

266
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,166
Let's not talk about Tammy Kent.

267
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,674
Besides, she is...

268
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,249
She's your patient.

269
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:52,847
So,

270
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:55,723
can we go back to the lawsuit?

271
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,497
After Alex's funeral,
nothing more happened

272
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,396
- between you and Laura?
- No, I couldn't even...

273
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:05,995
I couldn't even think about Laura
without blaming myself for his death.

274
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,117
If I hadn't been in love with her,
if I hadn't been jealous of him,

275
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,010
if I hadn't been competing with him
for her love...

276
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,582
you might have saved him.
Is that what you think?

277
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,183
- Yeah, I guess so.
- You guess so?

278
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,733
Isn't that what we all want to do,
save our patients?

279
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,563
Is that what you want?

280
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,618
This is beginning to seem
like therapy.

281
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,239
We're friends talking about work.

282
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,371
Then let's...

283
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,842
Let's talk about... the work.

284
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:44,305
I have a new patient.

285
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,830
Her name is April.

286
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:49,141
She's just learned
that she's got lymphoma.

287
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,177
She's terrified

288
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,102
and she's in denial.
She hasn't told anybody.

289
00:16:57,245 --> 00:17:00,295
Not her family, not her friends,
nobody except me.

290
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Why not?

291
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,437
She says she doesn't want
to have the chemo.

292
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,173
I think she probably
has an unconscious fantasy

293
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:11,298
that if she doesn't have the treatment,
she doesn't have the cancer.

294
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:15,820
- You haven't said that to her yet?
- She's notready to hear it yet.

295
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,218
And I don't have

296
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,065
the time to get her there.

297
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:25,875
I mean, with the particular cancer
she has, if she starts treatment now,

298
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,234
her chances of recovery
are pretty good, but if she doesn't...

299
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:36,997
Look, if it was my daughter,
I would just take her by the arm

300
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,573
and I would drag her
to the hospital.

301
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:42,495
Of course you would.
That's what you do for your family.

302
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,143
But not for your patients?

303
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,961
This is the question.

304
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:52,336
What does the good therapist do
when the patient needs

305
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,730
more than just...

306
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,405
talk?

307
00:17:56,573 --> 00:18:00,173
Do you just sit there and listen
until she dies on the couch?

308
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:02,146
You can only be responsible

309
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,539
for what happens in treatment.
You know that.

310
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:07,375
So are you saying
that you wouldn't take her to chemo?

311
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,726
I'd do everything I could
to get her to go.

312
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,365
And if she still refused?

313
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,230
I'm just afraid
that this girl is going to die.

314
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:21,430
And I can't get involved
because I'm afraid of another lawsuit.

315
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:24,061
Then stop being her therapist
and become her nurse.

316
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,931
It's not that simple.
Don't simplify it.

317
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:32,525
I mean, are you saying
that you wouldn't help her?

318
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:36,779
I thought that's what we were
on the earth for, to help each other

319
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:40,153
and step up to the plate
when somebody needs us.

320
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,628
How long have you been treating her?

321
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:46,947
A week.

322
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,626
You've seen her only once
and she's made you feel this...

323
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,686
I'm just afraid
that she's going to die

324
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:56,059
and I'm angry
that she won't let me help her.

325
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:00,043
Isn't this the same anger
that you felt towards Alex

326
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:03,499
- because he wouldn't let you save him?
- This isn't about Alex.

327
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:04,932
This is about April.

328
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:07,689
I don't think
this is about your patients at all.

329
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,164
I know you don't.

330
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,510
You had this anger before these patients
walked into your office.

331
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,774
You're not gonna drag me
down that path again.

332
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,877
- I'm not dragging you down any path.
- You think this is about my mother.

333
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,985
Yes, I think this is about
your mother.

334
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,177
I don't want to go into therapy.

335
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,521
How did you leave things with her?

336
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,494
I made her promise to call me.

337
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,878
And I called her twice yesterday
and 3 times today.

338
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,703
She still hasn't called back.

339
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,114
I just...

340
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,940
You know, I have to help this girl.

341
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,815
Paul, we're not gods.
We can't save anybody.

342
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,738
You really care about your patients.

343
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,950
But I have to say
you're no good to anybody

344
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,702
as long as you are living
with all this fear and anger.

345
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:05,924
Fear that I can't save them,
fear that they're all gonna die?

346
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,689
- They won't all die.
- Yeah, but my mother died.

347
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,861
You can say it.
Go on. Go ahead.

348
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,060
In spite of everything you could do,

349
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,303
your mother died.

350
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,034
And if your mother could die,

351
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,441
the one who promised you
she'd always be there...

352
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,056
She didn't promise me that.

353
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:28,933
- But you thought she did.
- I did

354
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:32,504
because she brought me into the world,
she was gonna stay with me. As a kid

355
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,879
I thought that.

356
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,600
She was sick, Paul.

357
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,518
She was too sick for you
to save her.

358
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:43,193
I wish you could tell that
to my unconscious.

359
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,644
It was devastating.

360
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,262
If you could have saved her,
you would have.

361
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,943
- Do you know what you're feeling now?
- Look...

362
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,617
What if I wanted
to come back to you...

363
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:12,076
for therapy?
No supervision, no blurred lines,

364
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,654
just plain old therapy?

365
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:20,648
You think you can trust me?

366
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,447
You're the only one I can trust.

367
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,537
Besides, I'd feel really stupid
if I had to start all over again,

368
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:35,155
lying to somebody for a year.
I don't want to feel stupid.

369
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,337
What do you wanna feel?

370
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,772
I just wanna feel...

371
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:51,135
Of course I'll see you.

372
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:54,615
Are you sure?

373
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:58,652
I'm sure.

374
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,421
Is this time good?

375
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:21,942
Yes, it is.
