2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:05,289
He threatened to kill me.

3
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:08,989
- You're smiling.
- I've had patients over the years

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,725
whose lives were threatened.
You brought this up like it was nothing.

5
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,934
- Did you mean that literally?
- Of course not!

6
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:19,139
I'm not gonna fucking kill her.

7
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,068
I want a divorce.

8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,554
I haven't slept in like a week.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

9
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:31,952
I don't know what to do.

10
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,205
I really...

11
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,803
I don't want you to leave me.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,067
Got it.

13
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:46,377
Great.

14
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:49,544
Great.

15
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:51,556
Right. Got it, thanks.

16
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:58,964
- I'm a little early. I hope it's okay.
- That's okay.

17
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:01,065
Can you just give me a few minutes?

18
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,065
- Sure.
- Thanks.

In Treatment 129 - Week 6

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,039
Transcript: FRM.

21
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:29,202
Synchro VO: michvanilly, Anyone.

22
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:42,691
I'm just gonna close the curtains.

23
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,821
How are you, Amy?

24
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,354
Good.

25
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,109
You seem a little...

26
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:09,006
restless.

27
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,970
I wanted to get here early.
I just... I rushed a little.

28
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,616
Why would you rush
to be here early?

29
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,142
Well, one of us
is often late, so...

30
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,457
I don't know.

31
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,522
Jake's not coming.

32
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,646
Don't worry, we're together.
Everything's fine.

33
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,865
We're seemingly in love,
and he knows that I'm here

34
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:35,656
and it's fine for him to know
everything that we talk about.

35
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,813
I have to tell you,
I was offended...

36
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,124
Outside, just now.

37
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,920
I know I'm an adult and you have things
that I don't need to see or hear

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,596
but I felt like a scolded child.

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,710
It... never mind. It's crazy.
It's not you, it's me.

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,703
I don't know what's gotten into me,
but I felt a little embarrassed

41
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,099
because I'd already stood up
and you suddenly stopped me.

42
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:01,104
- I certainly apologize...
- I wondered if there are patients

43
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,979
that you would've let in
even if they arrived early.

44
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,763
Patients you have
a different relationship with.

45
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:08,718
I know Jake and I aren't easy,

46
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,086
and I just think you must have...

47
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,847
Easier patients,
more interesting patients,

48
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,201
patients that are more fun,
that you like more.

49
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,387
Is my enjoyment of our sessions
important to you?

50
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:21,772
Maybe.

51
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,034
And so it would bother you
if I didn't enjoy them?

52
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,240
Maybe not.

53
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,532
Forget it.

54
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,076
You said that Jake and you...

55
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,250
Weren't easy as patients.

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,891
How would you define
yourself as a patient?

57
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,301
Bad.

58
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,012
Just kidding.

59
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,157
I wouldn't trade places
with anyone. It just...

60
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,040
I don't know.

61
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:55,739
Have you ever thought about
changing places with anybody?

62
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,994
- Perhaps.
- Who would you like to trade with?

63
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,849
What kind of a patient
would you like to be?

64
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:08,452
Maybe I want you to be different.

65
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:09,816
Me? Different how?

66
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,072
I don't know.

67
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:12,507
Harrison Ford.

68
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,888
That's a bit of a stretch for me,
but...

69
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:26,954
So how would Dr. Harrison Ford behave

70
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,148
if you were early for a session?

71
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:32,242
Who says I'd be seeing him
for therapy?

72
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:38,448
He certainly wouldn't make me wait
outside like a naughty schoolgirl.

73
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,243
So you felt that was like
some kind of rejection?

74
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,307
OK. So...

75
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,236
Why don't you tell me
what's been happening

76
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,320
since I saw you last week.

77
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,954
Everything's fine, like I told you.

78
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:16,286
You said that you and Jake
were "seemingly in love."

79
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,864
What does that mean?

80
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,125
"Seemingly in love"...
I said that, didn't I?

81
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,456
Typical. Everything's fine.

82
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,052
Why is that typical?

83
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,144
Today, he's meeting a guy

84
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,979
that might commission
some music from him.

85
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,790
You make it sound like you don't think
that's going to happen.

86
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,109
And he said to me
that I should come here on my own,

87
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,598
that talking does me good. It's not like
Jake to send me here alone, is it?

88
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,806
You've turned him into
the new and improved Jake,

89
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,603
the new sensitive Jake.

90
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,808
You could cut the mutual support
this week with a knife.

91
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,023
"You look great.
Your makeup looks good."

92
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,761
"You'll be working late?
That's fine. Good luck."

93
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,002
The other day,

94
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:02,115
before a meeting,
he actually said to me: "Go get 'em!"

95
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:04,817
isn't that funny?

96
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,205
Why is it funny?

97
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,135
It is so...

98
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,617
sweet.

99
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,461
And sweet isn't good?

100
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,412
Sweet's fattening.

101
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,070
And then two days ago he said to me:
"Would you like to have sex with me?"

102
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,457
Would I like to have sex with him?
Can you believe it?

103
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:28,058
It's like he was offering
me a canapé.

104
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,288
And then he kept wanting
to kiss me and touch me

105
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,512
and be all loving and affectionate.
He kept saying,

106
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:37,711
"do you like this? Does this feel good?"
It actually got very tiresome.

107
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,824
And at the end, when he was through,

108
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:43,115
I found myself patting him on the back
like I was burping a baby,

109
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,168
and kept whispering my name, "Amy, Amy."

110
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:47,160
It was such a turnoff.

111
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:49,744
And why was that such a turnoff?

112
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,676
It was just so...

113
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,467
So...

114
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,103
So what, Amy?

115
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,055
Is it worse than whispering "I'm gonna
kill you" in your ear?

116
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:09,828
Much worse.

117
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,172
God, all that tenderness.

118
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,656
Not your cup of tea.

119
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:29,087
Why not?

120
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,303
You know what?
Sex like that is terrible.

121
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:35,330
What we need is angry sex.

122
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,354
That's what we had,
it held us together.

123
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,590
Even when we wanted to kill
each other, we had that,

124
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,651
maybe because
we wanted to kill each other.

125
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:44,955
This touchy-feely sex
wasn't the deal.

126
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:48,974
You know, the kind of sex
we used to have,

127
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,933
I couldn't even tell my girlfriends.
They wouldn't have believed me,

128
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:55,879
or else they'd call social services
and have Jake arrested.

129
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,425
Now it's like he's had a lobotomy
or like he's brain-dead.

130
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,082
Only he's not brain-dead,
he's just a terrible fuck.

131
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:03,549
It's your fault.

132
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:08,242
- It's my fault?
- The man in touch with himself.

133
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:12,689
God, might be better
if he knocked me around a bit.

134
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,126
You really think that'd be better?

135
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,184
I don't know.

136
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,902
Maybe I deserve it.

137
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,263
How do you like my necklace, by the way?

138
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,683
I think it's...

139
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,964
It's very nice.

140
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,563
It's a gift.

141
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,144
- From Jake?
- A Bulgari from Jake?

142
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,072
It's from Ben.
Do you remember Ben, my boss?

143
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:51,172
I told Jake that I'd be going back
to the office tonight

144
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,921
because I have a conference call
with some clients in Bali.

145
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,455
I also told him that Ben was traveling,
but the truth is

146
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:01,325
Ben is picking me up from here and we're
not going back to the office.

147
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,296
Where are you going?

148
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,402
Wherever the evening takes us.

149
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,347
What do you think of that?

150
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,644
- What, dinner with your boss?
- It won't be dinner.

151
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:21,872
It might include dinner,
but there's no stopping the rest of it.

152
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:28,438
Why can't it be stopped?

153
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,751
Do you want me to stop it?

154
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,987
It won't do any good.
I know it'll happen.

155
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,444
Ben and I are inevitable. The minute
that the thought entered my head,

156
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:51,871
it was as if somebody had triggered
a ticking time-bomb.

157
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,883
Nothing will stop it, no matter how many
bomb experts I bring in.

158
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,350
You can't stop it, no one can.

159
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,937
So, who triggered the time bomb?

160
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,079
The lousy sex.

161
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,065
I was in the shower...
By the way, it's the first time

162
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,777
I've been in a hurry to get
in the shower after fucking Jake.

163
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,567
And it dawned on me
that no matter what I do...

164
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,232
- Something'll happen with him.
- So are you punishing Jake

165
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:17,268
for the bad sex
or because of this new...

166
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,159
This new tenderness, this new...

167
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,229
Attentiveness that he's shown?

168
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,174
Why am I doing this?
Why can't I stop?

169
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:33,753
- You haven't done anything yet.
- But he'll be here in a minute.

170
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,059
Do you like this guy?

171
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,119
He's a prick, but it's...

172
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,199
It's like I need...

173
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,974
You need what?

174
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,523
The Employee-Of-the-Month award.

175
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,354
The Office-Slut award.

176
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,628
I'd like to go back to something that
we touched on last week.

177
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,798
You... You said that you were...

178
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,380
That you were overweight
when you were a child.

179
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,792
That really captured
your imagination, didn't it?

180
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,816
I think it's something
that we should talk about.

181
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,296
I know you said
it didn't bother you,

182
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,605
but you did say something
about children being cruel.

183
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,743
Well, I was fat.
Not overweight, fat.

184
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,226
My sister was the overweight one.

185
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,968
I'm kidding. My sister's gorgeous.

186
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:50,144
It's really hard for me to believe
that you actually ever were...

187
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,288
This overweight kid.

188
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:55,158
It's like you've erased that girl.

189
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,878
Right after my father died,
I decided to stop eating.

190
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,061
It's like I woke up 45 pounds thinner.

191
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,898
- How do you wake up 45 pounds thinner?
- I just didn't eat.

192
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:11,537
And I felt like it was the one thing
that I could control in that house.

193
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:14,136
Some days I'd just have
one cracker all day long

194
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:17,661
and I'd feel my stomach get flatter
and I'd have this wonderful sense

195
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,244
of light-headedness,
this wonderful high.

196
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:30,807
What?

197
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,217
Doesn't matter.

198
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,227
No, go on, finish the thought.

199
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:44,786
My father was a lovely man.
Sweet, charming. I loved him very much.

200
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,566
And your mother?

201
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:52,902
My mother's dead.

202
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,958
You know the joke about the farmer
with the two cows?

203
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,766
The one cow gives milk
and the other one doesn't?

204
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:09,668
Never mind.
Anyway, my dad died when I was 13.

205
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,671
My mother's rather
like Cinderella's stepmother,

206
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,474
and my sister
is like the evil stepsister.

207
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,385
Once, when I was 13...

208
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,554
My parents came back from Milan
with two identical dresses,

209
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,424
very very beautiful ones.

210
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,777
A red one for Maria, my sister,

211
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,799
and a blue one for me.

212
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:29,174
Mine, of course, didn't fit me.

213
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,291
So, my mother told her
to switch with me

214
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,612
because she was older
and hers was slightly bigger.

215
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:36,184
She, of course, didn't want to,
so she started screaming

216
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:40,303
and said she wanted the red dress,
it's not her fault that I'm so fat.

217
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:44,442
And finally, she threw the dress at me
and said: "Then take it, fatso."

218
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,105
So I started crying.

219
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,964
And my mother said:
"What are you crying for now?

220
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,328
"You should be glad
your sister's dress fits you

221
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:54,787
"and that she agreed to trade dresses.
You should thank her."

222
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:57,758
Later, I heard my parents arguing
and my dad said to my mom:

223
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:00,990
"Why didn't you just get them
the same color dress?"

224
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,401
And my mother started whispering,
she said: "I can't buy her red, she..."

225
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:08,198
I couldn't hear her properly then.
She seemed like she said: "She looks...

226
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:11,379
"like a watermelon in it.", or:
"She'd look like a fire truck in it.",

227
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,088
or: "She'd look like a beach ball.",
or...

228
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,231
I couldn't hear what she said.

229
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,796
So did you ever talk to your dad

230
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,171
about what you might have heard?

231
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,250
No, I never got a chance.

232
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,514
So could you have talked
to your mom about it?

233
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,269
Why not?

234
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:55,076
She'd say that I was making things up.
That's what she said

235
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:58,652
to most of my complaints.
She used to call me "the fabricator".

236
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:02,600
I had a very vivid imagination.
I used to make things up.

237
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Once, I told her
that I saw my sister kissing

238
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,779
the gardener behind the house.

239
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,122
She went ballistic.
She nearly had a coronary.

240
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,835
You know, once,
Maria had a blind date,

241
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:18,216
and before he got there, she said:
"Let's play a trick on him."

242
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:21,337
And she told me to open the door
and pretend that I was her.

243
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:23,412
And she'd watch
from the room next door,

244
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,891
and if she didn't like him,
she wouldn't come out

245
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:29,277
and I could pretend
that I was sick and cancel the date.

246
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,141
So when I opened the door,
he was really cute.

247
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,839
And I thought
she'd be interested in him.

248
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,364
So I kept talking to him,

249
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,880
and pretending to be her
and chatting away.

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,322
She finally came out from the other room
and said: "Hi, I'm Maria."

251
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,219
And he was completely confused,
and I was...

252
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:52,208
utterly humiliated.
I went so red. Actually,

253
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:55,833
I still get embarrassed
when I think about it today, and...

254
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,587
And she told him I was just
checking out her dates for her

255
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,109
and that at it was all just a joke.

256
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,551
The thing is, I didn't get the joke.
I mean, not till years later.

257
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,857
I didn't realize till then,

258
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:14,017
that all she really wanted was to see
the look of relief on his face

259
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:17,538
when he realized that she was his date,
not me, the fatso.

260
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,926
Hilarious, right?

261
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:27,614
Don't worry,
I got back at her years later.

262
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,531
I met him at college
and I fucked his brains out.

263
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,595
I told her that he didn't remember her
and I'd had to remind him.

264
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:36,662
And she said: "Whatever, I dumped him
after two dates anyway."

265
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:40,781
And I said: "He told me he dumped you
because you smelled like tuna."

266
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,978
And is that true?

267
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:48,262
So really,
you settled that account in bed.

268
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,299
I did indeed.

269
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,049
And now you're settling another account
in bed, with Jake this time.

270
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:05,546
What, because he's become
too sensitive for you?

271
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,279
So let me make sure I have this right.

272
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,811
Your father died when you were 13.

273
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,426
You must have been pretty devastated.

274
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:30,163
I was.

275
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:34,477
He was a lovely man.
He was affectionate and great.

276
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,316
Physically affectionate?

277
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:49,373
He'd come into our room at night,
when we were sleeping and...

278
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,240
kiss us on the eyes.

279
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:56,898
And then I'd half wake up,
I'd smell his aftershave

280
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:58,884
and know that he was there.

281
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:03,121
And then he'd whisper in my ear
that he loved me and...

282
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,734
He'd hold my face in his hands.

283
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:09,999
He had these huge hands,
like a construction worker.

284
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,698
And he was just...

285
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:14,783
So...

286
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:17,954
Tender and lovely.

287
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,873
And yet, when Jake is tender

288
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:33,200
and he expresses his love through
tenderness, it makes you angry.

289
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:37,663
You said it was "disgusting".

290
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,936
Do you think that might be
because it scares you?

291
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:46,411
You've learned you can't trust people
who express themselves

292
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,524
tenderly, that they seem weak?

293
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:53,220
That they're going to abandon you,
die and leave you behind?

294
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:58,046
And so in order to avoid that,
you provoke Jake. You make him angry.

295
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,668
You create these situations
that bring out the worst in him

296
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,519
and he treats you badly.

297
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,877
Ben'll be here any minute.
What should I do?

298
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:26,837
Do you really want me to give you
permission to have sex with your boss?

299
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:30,612
Once. Just once.
Just tell me it's not that bad.

300
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,262
I think it might be that bad.

301
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:39,057
But you'll explain him if he finds out.
Can you make sense of it for him?

302
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:41,393
And what exactly
do you want me to tell him?

303
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,118
That I'm fucked up!

304
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,875
That I can't help myself.
That it's bigger than me.

305
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,525
- Tell him that I'm fucked up!
- So even if he forgives you,

306
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:51,429
do you think
that you can forgive yourself?

307
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,087
I always forgive myself.

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,698
That's my problem.
I... I just close my eyes

309
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,973
before I go to sleep at night
and I ask God for forgiveness

310
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:02,915
and I forgive myself for everything.

311
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,723
Even the unforgivable things.

312
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:11,943
I never get punished.

313
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,719
You think that sex with Reeves
will go unpunished?

314
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,680
Who's gonna punish me?

315
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:21,178
Maybe you've already started
to punish yourself.

316
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,229
Do you really think that sleeping
with Reeves is gonna bring back

317
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,932
the good old reliable angry,
controlling Jake?

318
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,485
The one who fights you
and threatens you?

319
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:34,965
I don't know.

320
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:38,150
And now that he's expressing his love
through tenderness,

321
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,953
- do you feel that you deserve his love?
- It's not love!

322
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,416
It's neediness. It's weakness.
It's unbearable.

323
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,919
So it's only love if he chases you,
stalks you,

324
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,505
tapes you, is jealous of you,
is that it?

325
00:20:57,035 --> 00:21:00,616
I think you need to look at this
a little more carefully, Amy.

326
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,857
- It's like it's happened already.
- But it hasn't.

327
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:13,070
You still have a choice.

328
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,909
Nothing happens without you.

329
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,332
I have to go to the bathroom.

330
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:00,982
<i>Hi, it's Jake. Leave a message.</i>

331
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,561
Hey, Jake, it's me.

332
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:07,575
It's nothing important.
I just thought

333
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:10,843
I might catch you.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

334
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,223
Okay, talk to you later.
