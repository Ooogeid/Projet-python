1
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,376
Hey, good morning.

2
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:13,567
You made breakfast.

3
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:19,371
You always do that
in these situations?

4
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:21,799
Actually this doesn't happen
that often.

5
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,325
- You seem happy.
- Are you fishing?

6
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,536
Don't analyze me, Paul.

7
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:39,948
Yeah, you're right.

8
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:41,727
I'm happy.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,751
Me too.

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,380
I thought I'd feel guilty.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,310
But you don't?

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,710
It's strange.
I haven't been with or even

13
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:56,715
looked at another man for 15 years.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,830
But we... I don't know,
it just completely seemed comfortable.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,120
Comfortable?

16
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:04,802
Like an old shoe.

17
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,532
Like a perfect fit.

18
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:12,920
Like a parallel universe.

19
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,699
I even thought that if Marc found out,
he'd understand.

20
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,911
- Do you think he would?
- Nope. No.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,529
I know he wouldn't.

22
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:23,696
It would be nice
if he would, but no.

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,980
But this isn't about him.
This is...

24
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,519
... about before him.

25
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:36,544
You mean you think
I should be grandfathered in?

26
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:38,762
Excuse me.

27
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:43,015
It's my daughter.

28
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,015
I should get dressed.
I have a train to catch.

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
Hello?

30
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,025
Hi, Rosie.

31
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:54,717
No, it's not a bad time.
Can you hold on for a second?

32
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,689
Do you have to go now?

33
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,468
I thought we might
take the train down together.

34
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:05,275
No, I mean... What if somebody
sees us on the train together?

35
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,922
No, I didn't give uncle Patrick
my Brooklyn number because...

36
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:16,348
You're right, you're right.

37
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,233
I should have.

38
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,950
No, I haven't seen grandpa

39
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,505
this month, Rosie.

40
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,554
Look, if it were a real emergency,

41
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,151
the nursing home would contact me.

42
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,870
Because I'm the emergency contact,
that's why, Rosie.

43
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,473
I know you love your grandfather.

44
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,721
And...

45
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,027
She hung up.

00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,818


48
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,298
I'm sorry, I've gotta run.
Marc is in the car.

49
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:42,248
Are you all right?
Did something happen?

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,475
No, I'm fine. Are you okay?

51
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,893
- I'm all right.
- How's your dad?

52
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,355
He's great.

53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,230
So I'll call you later on then.

54
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,182
I gotta go.

55
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:14,753
Yes, come in.

56
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,120
It's good to see you.

57
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,111
Are you okay?

58
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,647
That's just what Tammy asked me.
Do I seem...

59
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,115
- You seem nervous, yes.
- I'm not.

60
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,102
My father's sick.

61
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,864
Okay, that's not true.

62
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,939
He's past sick.
He's got late-stage Parkinson's.

63
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,454
- I'm so sorry.
- That's so easy to say, isn't it?

64
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,252
It may be easy to say,
it's very hard to hear.

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
Forget it.

66
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:02,610
Thank you.

67
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,972
I'm sorry I snapped.

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,144
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Does it matter when I saw him?

69
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:19,103
I try to talk to him, but he's...

70
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,168
He's not there.

71
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,306
Or maybe he is
and he's just choosing to...

72
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:27,641
To hide.

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,036
Remind me again where he lives.

74
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,327
He's been in the same nursing home
for the last 2 years.

75
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:37,879
It's called Valley Haven, but it's not
in a valley and it's not a haven.

76
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,387
It's filled with dead men walking

77
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,980
- and pissed off nurses.
- Is he in pain?

78
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,138
He's in pain, I'm in pain,
the whole fucking world's in pain.

79
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,815
Lucky for him
I'm there to pay the bill.

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,990
Long as I do,
he gets to take his nap twice a day.

81
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,981
How did we get on to this?
Jesus.

82
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,916
Are you surprised to find yourself
talking about what a burden he is?

83
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:06,088
You know what I think? I think
he mishandled his finances deliberately

84
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,563
so that I'd have
to take care of him.

85
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:12,796
- He threw himself at my mercy.
- He's been sick for a long time.

86
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,707
Why is he
at the front of your mind today?

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,355
I don't know.
I talked to my brother Patrick.

88
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:24,353
He said my father seemed a little bit...
off somehow.

89
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,302
Like Patrick would know
what that was.

90
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:29,679
Your brother's visited him?

91
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,747
He goes over there and he eats
his dinner, according to the nurses.

92
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,972
Can't you tell them
not to let him in at mealtimes?

93
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,827
I don't really care
who eats his dinner.

94
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,566
I just...

95
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,446
What were you going to say?

96
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:55,023
I was going to say
I'm just waiting for the man to die.

97
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,859
You asked.

98
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:05,985
It's very hard to have someone sick
and dependent on you.

99
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:10,803
It drains all your reservoirs.

100
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:13,092
It makes you very very tired.

101
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,326
I mean,

102
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:16,957
it's not like he was

103
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:21,716
this great father who got Parkinson's
and disappeared.

104
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,084
He was never present in my life.

105
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,010
Somebody could always eat his dinner
for all he cared.

106
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:30,398
He ate at the hospital, he said.
My mother stopped

107
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,358
setting a place for him at the table
when I was six years old.

108
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,536
Did she stop doing
other things for him?

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm sure there were,
but the man wasn't there.

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,133
You keep calling him "the man."

111
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,276
- Does that have any meaning for you?
- What, like...

112
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:48,901
Like he was supposed to be
"the man" of the house

113
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,380
only I had to do that job for him?

114
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:53,853
Is that what it means?

115
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,893
I asked Tammy about him.
You know what she said?

116
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,115
You spoke to Tammy
about your father?

117
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,581
She said that the first time
that she saw him,

118
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:10,461
she thought he looked just like
"the man" was supposed to look.

119
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,504
- So "the man" came from Tammy?
- Her father died that year.

120
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,975
I don't know, maybe she was fantasizing
about my father.

121
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,189
Actually, I'm sure she was.

122
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:24,943
She wanted to live in my apartment

123
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:27,018
and I wanted to live in hers.

124
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,591
Anyway, Tammy and I,

125
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
we...

126
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:38,886
We went out for coffee

127
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,717
and I did
what we talked about last week.

128
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,635
I asked her what she remembered
about that Christmas Eve,

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,060
the night that my mother tried to...

130
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,083
Tried to kill herself.

131
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,585
Anyway, it turns out
that Tammy remembers,

132
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,450
but in a really crazy way.

133
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,692
A lot of it was what I remembered,

134
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,982
that my mother was at home,
she was asleep,

135
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,918
I was at Tammy's,
we ate the cookies, we were singing.

136
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,384
And then Tammy and I went...

137
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,528
to her room to talk,

138
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,918
but after a few minutes
I jumped off the bed

139
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,429
and ran down the hall
to check on my mother.

140
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:19,988
That was where your memory went blank.
What about hers?

141
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:23,663
She says that I came right back
and that I was really upset.

142
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:28,024
That my mother was sick
and my father was with her,

143
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:31,925
waiting for an ambulance.
By the time Tammy and I went back,

144
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,799
my father had already gone
to the hospital with my mother,

145
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,621
so Tammy's mother

146
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,160
brought us to the hospital.

147
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:44,459
So, that night it turns out
your father was actually with her.

148
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:48,169
That night he actually was the man.

149
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:49,837
I guess.

150
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:54,376
- You don't believe Tammy's version?
- No, I believe it. Why would Tammy lie?

151
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,952
It just doesn't add up.

152
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,328
Right, because if your father
had already left home,

153
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,935
how could he know that your mother
was going to commit suicide?

154
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,109
But...

155
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,095
that was also kinda strange.

156
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:13,174
Tammy said that he was always
calling her mother to check on us.

157
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,242
Well, of course he was.

158
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,492
It must have been a fucking lot easier
than coming over and seeing for himself.

159
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,273
Okay, but he did come over
that night.

160
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:26,081
So, yeah, he called the ambulance,
so what?

161
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,799
He happened to drop in
one night when...

162
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,787
Maybe he came over to see his boys

163
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,862
and his wife
because it was Christmas eve.

164
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:36,923
What difference does it make
if he was there one fucking night?

165
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,583
What about all the other nights?

166
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,998
The nights when he was off
with his girlfriend, when I was at home,

167
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,673
guarding my mother?

168
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,175
All those other nights,
where was your brother?

169
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,520
He's older than you.

170
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,550
Yeah, he played... He played sports.

171
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:53,925
- What kind of sports?
- Baseball.

172
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:56,729
- Did you ever see him play?
- No, I didn't.

173
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,806
Can you see me trying
to drag this lonely,

174
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,984
crying woman out to a ballpark?

175
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,675
So your father was at work,

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
your brother was at sports

177
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,582
and you were on duty.

178
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:11,306
After my father left,
Patrick didn't even...

179
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,131
sleep at home very much.

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,756
- Where did he go?
- I don't know. Friends, I supposed.

181
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,299
- Do you remember any of their names?
- Where are you going with this?

182
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:22,374
I'm wondering if your brother
was actually home.

183
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,848
Could you have
air-brushed him out too?

184
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,768
You think that they were both there
under the tree wrapping gifts?

185
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,880
Our memories can be very unreliable.

186
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:36,437
We like to think of them
as indelible records of our past,

187
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,280
but every time we pull out a scene,

188
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:43,798
we fiddle with it a little bit
before we put it back in.

189
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,330
If we hate our husband now,

190
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,793
we re-remember the wedding
as less joyous,

191
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:57,188
or we say, "He was never
the right one for me anyway."

192
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,237
We're constantly altering
our memories

193
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:03,112
so the past won't conflict
with the present.

194
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,726
My memory is fucked. So what was
my childhood really like, Gina?

195
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:11,436
No, please,

196
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,974
I'm not questioning your feelings
about your childhood.

197
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,515
They're absolutely accurate.

198
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:20,113
I'm just wondering on this,

199
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,688
you know,
particular night that maybe

200
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,575
some of the facts aren't
what you think they are.

201
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:31,487
Gina, I'm familiar with the whole notion
of a screen memory, yeah.

202
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:35,544
Okay, of course you are. So then,
you know your Christmas eve memory

203
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:39,711
tells us about that whole period
of your childhood, not just one night.

204
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:43,972
You were overwhelmed.

205
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:49,238
You felt that you were the only one
who knew how much trouble she was in.

206
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,855
My father knew,
he just didn't give a shit.

207
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,305
Are you sure about that?

208
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,731
If he cared, he would have put her
in an institution.

209
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,241
He'd have gotten her help,

210
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:01,489
which he finally had to do but not
before I spent every day of high school

211
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,990
having no idea of what
I was going to face when I came home.

212
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,239
Would all the knives
be sticking out of the wall,

213
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,814
the bathtub be overflowing?

214
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:11,095
Would she have an electrical cord
around her neck?

215
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,462
Or would she suddenly decide
to take it upon herself

216
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,751
to clean and paint the hall closets?

217
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,091
Why do you think
he didn't institutionalize her sooner?

218
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:27,151
I don't know, maybe he needed somebody
to take care of the kids.

219
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:31,082
Or maybe he didn't want to take
your mom away from you.

220
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,060
Or you away from her.

221
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,179
How about
he and my brother ignored her,

222
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:38,940
until she finally had to try to kill
herself to get them to come home?

223
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:42,064
You know, Paul, one of the...

224
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,739
confusing things about
emotional injury in families

225
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:49,064
is that it can feel so unfair,
it can feel so random.

226
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:51,453
It's like an automobile accident:

227
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:52,963
everybody's in the car,

228
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:55,373
but you're the only one
who went through the windshield.

229
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,990
Well, actually it was my mother
who went through the windshield.

230
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,615
And you tried to grab her,
but, Paul...

231
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,914
Could you look at me?

232
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,239
You were in the backseat.

233
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,587
All you could do was watch.

234
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,229
And my brother walks away
without a scratch.

235
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,739
- I don't know what he suffered.
- My father was in the driver's seat,

236
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:23,239
struggling to keep
our little family from crashing.

237
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,991
Is that what you're saying?

238
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,216
Yes, I suppose that's what
he thought he was doing.

239
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:33,844
Is that what you're trying to do now

240
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,527
with your family?

241
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:39,364
You know, coming down
to see the kids every weekend,

242
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:40,877
calling them every day?

243
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,196
He was nothing like me
and I am nothing like him.

244
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,200
Paul, you're working very hard

245
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:50,345
to keep from taking
in any good information about him.

246
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,369
Tell me why the hell
I would do that?

247
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:55,239
I mean, if he was half-decent,
I would like to know it.

248
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:58,646
He never did one
fucking thing to help.

249
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:02,594
But Tammy just told you
a good thing he did:

250
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,734
checking up on you
from down the hall.

251
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,114
What does Tammy know? He was probably
flirting with her anyway.

252
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,548
Your dad was flirting with Tammy?

253
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:13,618
He's a fucking doctor.
They're all flirts.

254
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:16,639
The whole time I was growing up,
he was always...

255
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,017
- He was always what?
- You know...

256
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:24,713
Well, it's just a memory of mine,
excuse me, so it can't be trusted.

257
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,213
Are you afraid to say it?

258
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,703
He was always...

259
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:31,920
- With other women.
- How do you know this?

260
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:36,286
Okay, I'll tell you how I know.
I was 10 years old.

261
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,612
My mother was yelling at him
because he was...

262
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:41,845
screwing this nurse

263
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,416
and she wanted him to look
at the effect that it was having on me

264
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,855
so she pushed me at him, hard,

265
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:52,407
and I hit a table and I split
my forehead wide open: he sewed me up.

266
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,202
So you're right.
He wasn't completely useless.

267
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,872
Are you happy now?

268
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,505
These fights about other women,

269
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,962
they went on for a long time.

270
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,839
Oh, early and often.

271
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:11,340
I thought that the fights
began after your father left her.

272
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:16,427
It seems that they were having trouble
before he left her,

273
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:17,932
before she got sick.

274
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,810
Maybe his fucking
around made her sick.

275
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:24,044
- His fucking around made her sick?
- That's what I said. Christ!

276
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,537
You know what? No wonder
my patients complain about this.

277
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,072
Would you stop repeating
what I'm saying?

278
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,175
Just say something else.

279
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:36,701
I know it's irritating, but I just
want to make sure that I understand.

280
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,401
- Fine.
- So

281
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:42,206
you believe
that your father's infidelity caused...

282
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:44,673
drove my mother crazy, yes.

283
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,047
When your mother
was finally admitted,

284
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,881
wasn't she diagnosed
with bipolar disorder?

285
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,120
In your experience,
can bipolar disorder

286
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:59,793
be caused
by the infidelity of a spouse?

287
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:03,725
No, Gina,
bipolar disorder is not caused

288
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,855
by events in a patient's life.

289
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,949
Events can make you feel

290
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:09,786
bipolar.

291
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,326
No, I know that much.

292
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,955
That's how I felt last year
when Kate was...

293
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,590
with her lover.

294
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,391
But no, infidelity
can't make you bipolar.

295
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,903
You either are
bipolar or you're not.

296
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,329
But...

297
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,258
if your wife...

298
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,346
was bipolar, it...

299
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:43,392
could make you
want to have an affair.

300
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:51,046
Yeah, it could.

301
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,086
Especially if you were a doctor

302
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:56,054
and your wife's mental illness
made you feel inadequate,

303
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,434
helpless,

304
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:02,293
incapable of helping the person
that you were closest to.

305
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:06,895
And since he couldn't heal her,
he left her for another woman.

306
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,781
And he left her with me.

307
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:15,508
Do you think I'm a therapist today
because I feel guilty

308
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,804
about my inability
to heal my mother?

309
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:18,970
No, I don't.

310
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:21,213
Good.

311
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,504
I think you felt your
mother's illness deeply.

312
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:28,671
And I think even as a child, you had
an empathic response to suffering.

313
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:30,855
But you were too young

314
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:35,080
and so you went to school.
You worked, you studied, you thought.

315
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,806
And now when people come to you,
you can help them.

316
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,313
But you're not a therapist because
you think you failed your mother.

317
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,895
You were a boy, Paul.

318
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:46,068
You were in the backseat.

319
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,763
You tried to grab her,
but she was already gone.

320
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,558
So I have this patient Oliver.

321
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,057
He's a kid who's trying
to survive his parents' divorce.

322
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,850
And it's taking everything I have

323
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,502
not to invite him
to come live with me.

324
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,575
I know what he needs
and I want to give it to him.

325
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,370
It's the same with
April and her cancer.

326
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,626
I just want to stop them
all going through the windshield.

327
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:36,400
Does Oliver remind you of you?

328
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,225
Yeah, neither of us...

329
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,287
Neither of us knows
how to be around our fathers.

330
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:46,733
I mean, I have an idea,

331
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,578
but it's the same idea I've had
since I was Oliver's age.

332
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,318
I think of my father
and he's still screwing his girlfriend

333
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:01,634
and I'm still scared to death
that my mother's going to die.

334
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,009
Only she's already dead.

335
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,964
And he's almost dead.

336
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:18,540
And I'm about to become the orphan
I've always felt

337
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,530
I was for 40 years.

338
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,678
I know you're going
to do well by Oliver.

339
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,709
There's always hope.

340
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:32,497
Maybe the boy that you really wanna
be good to is yourself.

341
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:36,899
Take me out to a ballgame.

342
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:38,817
Something like that.

343
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,936
Maybe what I ought to do first is...

344
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,345
Be a good son to my father.

345
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:52,081
- What would that entail?
- I Don't know, just go see the man.

346
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:56,048
See how off he really is, maybe.

347
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,349
Read him the sports page.

348
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,451
Why haven't you been
to see him this time?

349
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:05,055
Because I'm busy... I'm seeing
the kids and I've got patients.

350
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:12,221
Actually the truth is
I don't want to go.

351
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:15,999
He stinks

352
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,218
and he looks like hell.

353
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,993
I'll probably look...

354
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,082
Look bad too when I'm about to die.

355
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,388
I wonder if my kids will come
and see me when I'm where he is.

356
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,588
What if they feel about me
the way I feel about him?

357
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,340
What do they feel about you?

358
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:47,386
I don't know. They're so mad
it's hard to tell how they feel.

359
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,025
They're mad at you, Paul?

360
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,765
That's what they feel?

361
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,205
And what if I'm just like him?

362
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,152
I mean, did they feel

363
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:04,278
that they had to compete
with my patients for my attention?

364
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:09,406
Have I too left my young son
home alone with his mother?

365
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:13,370
What do the kids understand
about why you and Kate are divorcing?

366
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,779
Kate and I set them down and said
the divorce had nothing to do with them.

367
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:22,138
It was about a sentence longer than
what my mother said to me, which was,

368
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:23,975
"your father's moving out."

369
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,965
I'm sure they don't understand
it any more than I did.

370
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,569
I think I have to talk to them,

371
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,253
you know, really

372
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,745
talk to them.

373
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,743
And I should...

374
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,331
I should talk to my father too.

375
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,556
You know, just...

376
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,159
talk to him.

377
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,653
So,

378
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,980
I've got my homework to do.

379
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:24,858
And next week
we'll talk about Tammy.

380
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:28,885
- What do you mean talk about Tammy?
- Goodbye, Paul.
