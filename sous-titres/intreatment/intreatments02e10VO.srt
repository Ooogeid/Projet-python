00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:07,896
Hello, Kate.

2
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:10,486
Rosie said you'd be here.

3
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:14,528
Is there a problem?

4
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:17,552
These are the financial aid forms
I asked you to sign

5
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:19,356
for Rosie's college application.

6
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,131
I didn't know your income
this year, so...

7
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,655
I'll take care of it.

8
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,323
Appreciate it.

9
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:33,793
Rosie's at her friend Becca's house.
They're working on a science project

10
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:36,314
so you'll have to wait
until after dinner to pick her up.

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:40,280
Why can't she do it some other night?
I only see her two nights a week.

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,142
Who's choice was that, Paul?

13
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,745
I'm just supposed to wait around
until she's finished?

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,000
What am I supposed to do until then?

15
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,257
I don't know.
Maybe see your other child?

16
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,484
I'm sorry.
Please, let's not do this now.

17
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,848
And please don't come
to my therapist's, okay?

18
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:02,068
Please don't come here. I have
one fucking hour to myself. Please.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,439
I think you have
your whole life to yourself now.

20
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,538
Why don't you enjoy it?

21
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,529
- Hello, Tammy.
- Timing.

22
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:24,500
- I hope you didn't hear all that.
- Oh no, it's no problem.

23
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,575
Actually, I'm glad I ran into you.

24
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:29,873
I wanted to tell you how sorry I was

25
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:32,648
about interrupting your session
last week.

26
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,042
That's fine.

27
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:36,496
It's good to see you again.

28
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,371
It's your turn. Have fun.

29
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:06,991

30
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,091
Tammy looked like
she had a good session today.

31
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:19,179
We can't talk about another patient.
You said that last week.

32
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,982
I said a lot of things last week

33
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,962
and the truth is I don't know
what I was thinking.

34
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:27,434
Look.
I can't be in therapy with you.

35
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,734
It's nothing personal.

36
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:33,859
If I were to go to therapy, obviously
I would come to you, of course.

37
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,513
But it's just not a good time
for me to...

38
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,360
to make myself more miserable.

39
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,923
Is that what we were going to do,
make you more miserable?

40
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:45,498
I didn't want to just phone,
you know.

41
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,335
- Are you sure about this?
- Absolutely.

42
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,347
I'm sorry to hear this.

43
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,832
But I respect your decision, so.

44
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,517
- You respect my decision?
- Yes, of course I do.

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,380
Do you want me to leave?

46
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,898
You stay here and wait for the kids.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,068
It's fine.

48
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:14,232
But since I've got some free time,
I need to do some shopping.

49
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,927
- You're going shopping?
- Do you need anything from the market?

50
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:20,602
What would I need
from the market, Gina?

51
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,438
Oh, right. I don't know.

52
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,250
Did you want me to argue with you?

53
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,886
Do you want me to persuade you
to come to therapy?

54
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,840
Did you want me to just, like,
leave you a message?

55
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,572
This is very polite. I'm gonna...

56
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:43,886
- We can't have an hour of conversation?
- That's what we did last week.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,535
I'll pay you for
an hour of conversation.

58
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,748
I don't sell my conversations.

59
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:50,726
Maybe we should charge them.

60
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,542
If anyone learns anything
it'd be all the better.

61
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:57,611
So, are you gonna stay here
while I'm gone?

62
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,676
- I get what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

63
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,049
Women, they're all the same,
every last one of them.

64
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,326
Excuse me?

65
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,211
Maybe it's not a good idea
for you to stay here.

66
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:09,164
I just want you to stay and talk.

67
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,208
- You said that.
- 10 minutes,

68
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:12,703
please.

69
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,927
You don't know what kind of a week
I've had, Gina.

70
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:18,919
I've got this CEO guy,
he pays me by the insight.

71
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:21,110
When I give him the insight
he doesn't want...

72
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:25,222
I really loathe people who think
they can just buy whatever they want.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,800
Then I've got this former patient
who I haven't seen for 20 years

74
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,522
who thinks that everything that's
happened in the meantime is my fault.

75
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,043
I just want to rest for a few minutes,
that's all.

76
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,623
Just a few minutes though.

77
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,628
You can't get any rest on the train?

78
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,259
On the train I talk to you,
but you don't talk back.

79
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,839
Not just you, I talk to all the people
I don't see all week.

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,588
- Like Kate and the boys.
- And Rosie.

81
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,344
And this week
I talked to Tammy Kent.

82
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,972
Why am I thinking
about Tammy Kent all the time?

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,290
I don't know.

84
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,137
I was so happy at her house
when I was 17.

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,604
Was that the last time I was happy,
I wonder.

86
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,189
I don't think so, Paul.

87
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,559
What was it about being at her home
that made me so happy?

88
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:22,362
I don't know.

89
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,615
Maybe that's something
you could work on in therapy.

90
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,235
I could also work on why I say
such stupid things about women.

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,710
That women are all the same,
what a stupid thing to say.

92
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:34,499
Please, forgive me.

93
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,861
People say stupid things
when they're angry.

94
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:43,216
Anger is also a good thing
you could work on in therapy.

95
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:46,797
I called my lawyer from the train.

96
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,722
It turns out
that Mr. Prince's lawyers are...

97
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,227
They're deposing Laura today.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,985
She had a relationship with Alex.

99
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,649
I know she had a relationship with Alex,
while she was in love with you.

100
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,451
That's a dangerous triangle.

101
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,172
Are you worried that she'll use this
as a way to get back at you?

102
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:09,236
I don't know what she'll say.

103
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:13,011
Maybe she really thinks
that it is my fault that Alex is dead.

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,620
That's another good thing
to work out here.

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Fine.

106
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,841
I'm like my patients, you know.
I don't want to be in therapy,

107
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,942
because I don't want to talk
about my parents. My past is fine.

108
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,622
It's the present
that causes the problems.

109
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,468
I'm sure it's occurred to you, Paul,
that...

110
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,607
That why you're thinking about Tammy
so much...

111
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:44,182
Nothing has occurred to me.
Why do you think I'm here?

112
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:46,549
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,199
Please...

114
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,410
Tell me what's occurred to you.

115
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:56,213
It occurred to me that you're interested
in Tammy Kent

116
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:59,406
because there's something incomplete

117
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:03,713
in your understanding
of your father's abandonment

118
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,421
and your mother's breakdown.

119
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,343
- And how does Tammy fit into this?
- I don't know.

120
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,594
Can't you guess?

121
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,555
There's an idea. Guess therapy.

122
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,892
You tell me a problem you have,

123
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,936
and I'll try to guess
what caused it and if I guess right,

124
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:19,325
I win!

125
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,369
The only problem is I'd have to know
what caused my problem

126
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:24,586
in order to say
whether you were right.

127
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,400
All right, true.

128
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:29,024
Yes...

129
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:33,248
It had occurred to me too
that my response to Tammy Kent

130
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:37,299
was tied up with my mother's death
somehow.

131
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:42,350
That seeing Tammy opened
a kind of a window onto that time.

132
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,882
Suddenly with Tammy there,

133
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,594
I felt I had to look in,

134
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,677
you know, I think,

135
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,498
to see myself...

136
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,139
Before the fall maybe.

137
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,221
And Tammy and I were lovers...

138
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,968
And I'd want to talk about that too.

139
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,891
But I can't talk about Tammy
because she's your patient.

140
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:06,576
So...

141
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,103
I don't know, maybe I'll just take
Tammy out for a coffee sometime,

142
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,609
but I won't go looking in the...

143
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,971
In the mother window.
I'll just...

144
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,275
Let it all stay

145
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,538
dead.

146
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,249
- The problem is it's not dead.
- It's the...

147
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,417
Undead.

148
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,382
Like in a horror movie.

149
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,292
You kill it, you bury it,
but then it comes right back,

150
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,866
right out of the grave.

151
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,262
Mother!

152
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,636
Those are the monsters...

153
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,012
The things that won't stay dead.

154
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:40,363
And one night when you're too tired
to kill the thing again,

155
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,350
you let it kill you, just...

156
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,669
Just so that it will at least be

157
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:46,011
over.

158
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,825
Is that what you think happened
to your Alex up there in his plane?

159
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,715
That instead of fighting his guilt
one more time,

160
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,023
he just gave into it,

161
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,792
so it would be over?

162
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,248
Yeah.

163
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,111
It's hard to know
how much fight a person has in him.

164
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,802
- True.
- You, for instance.

165
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,870
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I'm glad.

166
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,828
But I wonder why you think
you aren't strong enough

167
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:24,957
to fight your mother one more time.
I mean, maybe this time you'd win.

168
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,856
What are you suggesting?

169
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,984
I'm suggesting that maybe
you could finally lay them to rest.

170
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,429
One of them... my dad...
is still alive.

171
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,113
Of course I know that.

172
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,281
But still,

173
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,950
if you had clarity
about what happened back then,

174
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,867
maybe that could all rest in peace.

175
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:43,914
And so could you.

176
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,388
How does that sound?

177
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,882
- As a goal for therapy?
- As a goal,

178
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,300
therapy or not.

179
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:58,411
I don't think I can do it
without therapy.

180
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,673
I know it. I won't do the work.
I won't think about it.

181
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:06,155
I'll just go on blaming myself,
taking it out on everybody else.

182
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,583
I'll start smoking again,
drinking too much.

183
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,610
I didn't know that drinking
was a problem for you.

184
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:13,889
It's...

185
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,577
As long as I don't drink alone,
it isn't.

186
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,522
Why am I so resistant to you?

187
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,528
Why do I come all the way down here,

188
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:25,616
only to tell you that I don't want
to be in therapy?

189
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,458
Clearly I have to be in therapy.

190
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,640
I have to figure out
how this next part of my life goes.

191
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,662
I have to know
if I'm doing the right job.

192
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:35,277
I have to know if I'm helping people.
And if I'm not,

193
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,024
I have to know
what I'm going to do next.

194
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,506
Did you really worry
that I couldn't hear about Tammy

195
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,071
because she was my patient?

196
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:46,140
Of course I did.
I do!

197
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,221
I appreciate that.

198
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,129
And?

199
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,605
So I thought
about whether I could treat you both,

200
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,958
especially if anything were to happen
between the two of you.

201
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,642
Do you think something
could happen between the two of us?

202
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,581
Not necessarily. But I have
to aknowledge that something

203
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:03,742
could happen.

204
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,835
No, I don't want anything like that.

205
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,081
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

206
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,002
As sure as you were that you didn't want
to see me for therapy?

207
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,537
Who doesn't want to be back in bed
with his high-school sweetheart,

208
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:20,047
the girl who looks at him
in the way he used to be?

209
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,664
I mean, don't you think
about stuff like that?

210
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,890
Let's try and stay
on the topic, Paul.

211
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:28,276
Sure, sorry. I thought
I was beginning to enjoy myself.

212
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:33,191
If I'm going to treat you and Tammy,
there's going to have to be some rules.

213
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:34,855
Like?

214
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,347
Well...

215
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,135
If you were the therapist

216
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,658
and you had two patients
who had a history,

217
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,789
- what rules would you want?
- Okay, well,

218
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:51,453
I would make it clear
that I couldn't tell either of them

219
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,883
anything that I had learned
in session about the other.

220
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,314
- Okay.
- Okay?

221
00:11:58,555 --> 00:11:59,466
And...

222
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,985
They couldn't expect me to analyze

223
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:06,402
the other one
and they couldn't use me to...

224
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,643
send messages back...
back and forth.

225
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,757
Okay.

226
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:14,643
My seeing them would have to be
a kind of open secret.

227
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,601
We'd all know about it,
of course, but we'd...

228
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,521
all put it away and just

229
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,446
- not use it.
- All?

230
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,717
Even you?

231
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,658
You think you could do that?

232
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,205
I think so, yeah.

233
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:32,236
When Alex and Laura slept together,

234
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,085
you kept your response to that
out of their therapy?

235
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:39,460
As I remember it, I threw the affair
in her face and a cup of coffee in his,

236
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,146
but that, that...
that was different.

237
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,601
- How was that different?
- Their affair was about me.

238
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:49,641
Laura slept with Alex
because I wouldn't sleep with her.

239
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:53,075
And he slept with her
because I wouldn't give...

240
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,472
And he slept with her because
she was gorgeous and he felt like...

241
00:12:58,597 --> 00:12:59,985
What were you gonna say,

242
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:02,273
before you corrected yourself?

243
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,490
He slept with her
because you wouldn't...?

244
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,622
Because I wouldn't tell him
not to fly again.

245
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,017
Because I wouldn't try
to control his recklessness.

246
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,657
And he wanted to show me
what kind of damage he could do.

247
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,875
- But you didn't see that?
- No, I didn't.

248
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,991
I guess I was too involved
so I didn't get the message.

249
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,805
He counted on me to control
his self-destructive influences.

250
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,766
Instead I lashed out at him,
he lashed out at himself and...

251
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:36,382
And down he went.

252
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,684
So...

253
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,798
You can see
why I need to remain neutral

254
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,961
if something were to happen?

255
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:45,487
Of course.

256
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,825
I need you to promise me
that nothing's going to happen.

257
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Sure.

258
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:56,363
Nothing will happen with Tammy Kent

259
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,492
until or unless

260
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,338
we are no longer your patients.

261
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:07,558
I want you to know,

262
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:09,332
that...

263
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,624
What you've said about Alex today
stays with me.

264
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:16,019
I'm not going to mention
any of that in the deposition.

265
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,638
Okay then.

266
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:21,544
Okay.

267
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,295
Do you want to proceed?

268
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,102
Yes, I do.

269
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:31,754
Good,

270
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:32,898
I'm glad.

271
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:35,580
So,

272
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,139
let's begin.

273
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,257
Last week you mentioned
your high-school sweetheart.

274
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:46,931
Yeah,

275
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,886
- Tammy Kent.
- Last week you called her

276
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:53,184
- Tammy Kent, also by her full name.
- That's what everybody called her.

277
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,289
There was another Tammy
in the neighborhood

278
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:58,073
so we called this one Tammy Kent.

279
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:02,585
- And she lived down the hall?
- They moved in when I was about 14.

280
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:05,996
And that was about the time
your father moved out?

281
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:10,432
No, he moved out
a little bit after that.

282
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,780
You know, it should've been
the worst time of my life

283
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,955
with my father gone
and my mother beginning her...

284
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,281
You know, to suffer her bouts of...

285
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,999
Depression, but...

286
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,531
I wasn't sad, you know? I was...

287
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:30,135
I was excited.

288
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,429
What was it that excited you?

289
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Tammy.

290
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,200
She'd show up out of thin air
when I was having the worst day

291
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,135
and, you know,
we'd just start talking.

292
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,373
And everything bad about my house,

293
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:46,786
it felt like a movie.

294
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,561
It felt like a movie that I was watching
but that I wasn't in.

295
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,354
And even if my mother
was crying all day,

296
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:58,580
I'd tell Tammy Kent and she'd say,
"Yeah, it's going to be okay."

297
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,198
What would be okay?

298
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:05,198
I don't know, she just made me feel
that I could get through it and that...

299
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,300
if I let my mother cry that
that was okay too.

300
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,295
And I...

301
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,813
had the hope that when I went back
down the hall, things'd be all right.

302
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,627
Or if they weren't, at least,

303
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,252
you know, I could...

304
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,339
deal with them.

305
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,973
So she helped you
take care of your parents.

306
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,386
She was so young
to be a grief counselor.

307
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,531
Well, she felt more like my...
My girlfriend.

308
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,064
And the way I felt about it was
if I had a girlfriend,

309
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,339
then I was, you know, I was okay.

310
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:43,776
I wasn't the poor kid with the absent
father and the pitiful mother...

311
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,151
I mean, I was that kid, yes, I was,

312
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,651
but I wasn't a complete failure.
At least, I had a...

313
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:50,923
a girlfriend.

314
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,801
Did you have
a physical relationship with her?

315
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,660
Back then no.

316
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,401
We were... 14.

317
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:02,161
Different times, not like kids now.

318
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,553
No, it was another three years
before we had sex.

319
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:09,817
After all that stuff
had happened and,

320
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:13,085
you know, I was over...
Over everything.

321
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,128
What was it that happened?

322
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,713
Well, after my father left.

323
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:22,661
After your father...

324
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:24,671
Left...

325
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:28,461
You and your mother
for one of his patients?

326
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,032
Right.

327
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:34,543
And then my mother went into this,
like really...

328
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:37,157
Deep...

329
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,508
depression.

330
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:43,548
I remember one Christmas Eve,

331
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,393
Tammy's mother invited us
to come over to the house and,

332
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:52,706
you know, her husband had died
that year, but you'd never know it.

333
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,121
She was the strongest woman
I think I've ever met in my life.

334
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,815
Their house was always

335
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,011
full of light and music.

336
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,873
She was determined to stay alive
for her kids, that's for sure.

337
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,918
- Not like your mother?
- No, not like my mother,

338
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:13,075
who jumped into the abyss
and pulled me down with her.

339
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,328
So... about Christmas?

340
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,947
Yeah, anyway, Christmas.
Christmas Eve.

341
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,546
Tammy... Tammy appears at the door.

342
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,621
She says, "Come on, come on."

343
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:34,785
So, I said, "Hang on for a minute."
So I went into my...

344
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,928
into my mother's room to see,
you know, did she want to come?

345
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,316
But she was asleep,

346
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,090
I decided...

347
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,124
I'd leave without her

348
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:48,143
and we went over to Tammy's place.

349
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,268
It was...

350
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,448
It was just... amazing.

351
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:56,994
Tammy's mother had baked this...

352
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:00,696
glazed ham
with the pineapples and cherries

353
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:04,348
and there were christmas cookies
and people were drinking punch

354
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,266
and everybody was singing

355
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,007
and it was just great.

356
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:12,855
So then afterwards,
Tammy and I went to her room.

357
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,067
And we were just...

358
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:18,542
You know, talking and... talking...

359
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,825
I think that was...

360
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,587
when I first fell in love with her.
You know?

361
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:32,057
I thought she was...

362
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:36,440
I thought she was the most beautiful
creature I had ever seen.

363
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,682
Anyway, suddenly,
I remembered my mother

364
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,971
because I was afraid
that she'd wake up

365
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,474
and that she wouldn't know
where I was.

366
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,899
So I ran out of Tammy's room, and...

367
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,522
What happened when you got home?

368
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,976
I don't really remember.

369
00:19:57,243 --> 00:20:00,125
Finding my mother
unconscious on the floor,

370
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,850
calling the ambulance,

371
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:05,525
the trip to the hospital...
I don't even remember any of it.

372
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,980
You know, from the time
I left Tammy's bedroom

373
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:13,431
until I got to the hospital corridor,
it's all just, like...

374
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:17,292
It's all a blur. It's all missing.

375
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:19,649
It's like... it's erased.

376
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:24,136
It's very important that you try
and remember that night.

377
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:26,825
I can't. I have tried.

378
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:34,179
My mother's first suicide attempt
the most important night of...

379
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,852
The most important night of my life,

380
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,278
but I don't remember anything.

381
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:43,712
Why was it the most important

382
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,649
night of your life?

383
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,892
Because if I'd stayed with her,

384
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:51,117
she wouldn't have tried to,
you know, kill herself.

385
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:55,824
I know it took years
before she finally did it,

386
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,604
but that Christmas Eve

387
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:59,949
when I wasn't there,

388
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,481
that was the first time she did it.

389
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,716
That's when it all started.

390
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,347
Paul, you were a 14-year-old kid.

391
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,142
You had just had
the most wonderful night of your life.

392
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,560
Yeah, but...

393
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,688
- it doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

394
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,605
She took your wonderful night
away from you.

395
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:24,037
She punished you for neglecting her.

396
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,662
She showed you
what damage she could do

397
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,836
if you ignored her,
if you didn't take care of her.

398
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:33,936
And it wasn't
just the threat on her life.

399
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,124
But a threat on my life as well,
you mean?

400
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:37,405
Yes.

401
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,380
I was totally fine. I mean,

402
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:42,343
I was just standing there
in the hall

403
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,512
with a stomachful of cookies.

404
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,068
She was the one in the hospital
with the tubes sticking out of her arms,

405
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,193
the nurses running in and out.

406
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,909
I was out enjoying myself.

407
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:56,811
She was about to die.

408
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,231
What could you have done?

409
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,307
I don't know.

410
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:10,967
All I know is I left her for one night
and that was the night she did it.

411
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:12,477
So...

412
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:16,285
whatever I was doing before that,
obviously I was...

413
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:18,785
I was helping her.

414
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:23,661
It's very important
that you remember exactly

415
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:26,733
what happened to you that night.

416
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:28,485
Because...

417
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,557
maybe you'll discover
something missing.

418
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,580
You know, some detail

419
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,881
that'll help you feel...
less guilty.

420
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,578
But I am guilty.

421
00:22:41,014 --> 00:22:43,814
I know for a fact
that you couldn't save her.

422
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:46,204
Just like I know for a fact

423
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,518
that you couldn't save Alex.

424
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,775
But my knowing those things
is meaningless.

425
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:54,408
You have to know them.

426
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,455
You do.

427
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:00,386
Okay.

428
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:04,075
So you have to do
whatever it is you have to do

429
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,756
to remember that night.

430
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:08,671
Like what?

431
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,637
Like... hypnosis?

432
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,048
You'll figure it out.

433
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,735
Okay.

434
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,913
I'll see you next week.

435
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:33,052
Yeah, and...

436
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,789
- thanks.
- You're welcome.

437
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:53,410
Hi, could I have...
A phone number for Tammy Kent?

438
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,268
I mean... Meswick.

439
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,134
Tammy Meswick.

440
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,322
Connect me.

441
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,210
Hi, Tammy, it's Paul Weston.

442
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,099
Could you give me a call at this number
when you have a chance?

443
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,644
It's nothing urgent.

444
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,510
I just wanted
to ask you something about...

445
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:22,095
About my mother.
