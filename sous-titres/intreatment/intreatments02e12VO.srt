1
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:24,788
It's April.

2
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:28,799
Can I come in a little early today?

3
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:31,663
I've been up all night trying
to finish my final project

4
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:33,989
and I just don't think
I'll make it to noon.

5
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,613
Sure.
Can you just...

6
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,133
Just hold on for a moment
while I get my book.

7
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,979
No, it's no big deal.
I'll just see you next week.

8
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:49,130
It's okay.
When did you want to come in?

9
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,033
How about now?

10
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:55,886
It's no problem.

11
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:58,557
I'll see you in a bit then, okay?

12
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:24,202
Thanks for seeing me.

13
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:28,272
I was on my way to school
to turn this in and...

14
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,376
I don't know why I did it,
but I came here instead.

15
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:33,788
This is...

16
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,652
The big project you mentioned?

17
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,497
Would you mind
if I had a look at it?

18
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:44,333
No, go ahead
if you're interested in shit.

19
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:06,751
That's really cool.

20
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,698
It's supposed to be
a World Trade Center memorial...

21
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:13,267
Of course.

22
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:16,050
What do you mean "of course"?

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,532
Because god forbid
any architecture student

24
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:20,765
in the country
gets another assignment ever again.

25
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,344
I'm sorry.
I'm an asshole.

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,921
- Don't listen to me.
- No, I think it's just...

27
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,874
I think it's beautiful.

28
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,031
It's really...

29
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,224
Exquisitely done.

30
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,335
Very beautiful.

31
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:40,995
I'm so tired.

32
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:43,838
You haven't been sleeping this week?

33
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,529
No, not at all.

34
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,169
Between my anxiety and my lymphoma

35
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,569
there's just never a good time.

36
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,134
That was supposed to be a joke.

37
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,334
- Was it funny?
- I don't think so.

38
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,651
Neither do i.

39
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,609
Can I just... Do you mind?

40
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,115
I tried so hard to sleep last night.

41
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,721
It was 2:00 a.m.,
I was out of ideas

42
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,198
and my hands were shaking so badly,
I was afraid I'd wreck the whole thing

43
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,125
if I tried to keep working on it,

44
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,148
so I put it in the box.

45
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,060
I changed my sheets, I...

46
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,336
lit candles, put on music.

47
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:43,055
It sounds like I was trying
to seduce myself.

48
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,643
So did you eventually fall asleep?

49
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:50,899
I couldn't.

50
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,227
My heart was racing
and it felt like...

51
00:03:57,178 --> 00:04:00,155
{\I don't know. }It felt like it wasn't blood running
through my veins, {\it was }something else...

52
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,832
Fire, poison.

53
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,992
I just... I wanted to...

54
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:08,539
open myself up
and get it all out somehow.

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,001
Slit my wrists
or take off my own head.

56
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,458
I would never.
Don't worry.

57
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,913
I'm just trying to describe
how it felt.

58
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,992
It sounds like a terrible night.

59
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,564
I can't have another one like that.

60
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,677
I will lose my mind.

61
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:31,785
When you said that the poison
was running through your veins,

62
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,024
Can I tell you what I thought of
immediately?

63
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,983
- Chemo.
- Cancer.

64
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,761
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

65
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,579
You can choose not to have chemo.

66
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,329
Touché.

67
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,457
I had this thought last night...

68
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,008
I just kept thinking it
over and over.

69
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,215
It used to happen to me a lot
when I was a kid.

70
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:02,655
The summer before I went to high school,
I got this song stuck in my head

71
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,670
and I couldn't get it out.

72
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,431
I really thought I was going insane.

73
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,431
What do you think it would feel like

74
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,218
to go insane?

75
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,228
Like falling...

76
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,693
Into nothing.

77
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,191
Can we not talk about
losing my mind?

78
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,499
Would you like to tell me about
the thought that you had last night,

79
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,786
the one that you couldn't get
out of your head?

80
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:31,819
I wanted to go home.

81
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,797
I really wished I could go home.

82
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,796
And then I thought,

83
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,523
"You can't go home.

84
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,061
Your home is so long ago

85
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,154
and so far away."

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,831
And then I just kept thinking,

87
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,479
"Your home is so long ago

88
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,563
and so far away.

89
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,985
Your home is so long ago
and so far away."

90
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,746
And this home that you're...

91
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,154
that you're thinking about,
where is it?

92
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,772
Or was it?

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,040
Can I tell you in a moment?

94
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,378
I mean...

95
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,945
Can I just... I just need to
close my eyes for a second.

96
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:20,742
I'm so tired.

97
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,491
What time is it?

98
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:27,770
- 8:00.
- Really? Already?

99
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
It's...

100
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,731
7:59 actually.

101
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,247
Perfect.

102
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:39,042
Could you... Could you wake me

103
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,483
at 8:00, would you mind?

104
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:42,696
Sure.

105
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:38,891
April, wake up.

106
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,646
Wake up, April.

107
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,096
Wake up

108
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,335
What time is it?

109
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,067
It's 8:00.

110
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,072
Good.

111
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,033
It's over.

112
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,412
This project was due yesterday
but my professor said

113
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:21,613
we had until 8:00 in the morning
to turn it in.

114
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,813
It was hideous.

115
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,715
It looks better now.

116
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,292
Why do you say that?

117
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,487
It didn't work at all.

118
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,094
The dimensions were all off.

119
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,637
I relied too much on negative space.

120
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,289
It was just sitting there.

121
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:43,269
I couldn't make it soar.

122
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:48,586
I have to tell you, it's...

123
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,696
it's very hard to see you
destroy your own work.

124
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:57,966
I did

125
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:01,759
I did fall asleep last night.
I just rembered a dream I had.

126
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,177
I was on top of the model,
but it was life-size, and I fell.

127
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,714
Do you ever get those?

128
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,567
Falling dreams?

129
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,204
Sure.

130
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,888
I get those all the time.

131
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,785
And how do you feel
when you wake up?

132
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,579
I don't know.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,910
My heart is pounding,
and I feel like...

134
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,062
I don't even know
how to describe it.

135
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:29,015
It's a kind of joy.

136
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:33,681
So, different from falling
into nothing?

137
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:39,571
So falling is something
that you're afraid of

138
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:43,848
and yet you're attracted to it
at the same time.

139
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,442
What does that mean?

140
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,109
When you're awake,
you work so hard to keep everybody

141
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,434
and everything under your control,

142
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,708
so in your dreams,

143
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:57,266
it makes sense
that you find yourself finally falling,

144
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,306
releasing everything,
letting everything go,

145
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,076
because it's a kind
of fantasy for you.

146
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:06,620
Why are you telling me that?
Is that supposed to help me?

147
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:09,481
It'll only help you if it rings true.
If it doesn't...

148
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,504
But it's in my head now.
You put it in my head.

149
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,963
Now I have to think about it.

150
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,692
- Like that thought you had last night.
- What?

151
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:18,010
You started thinking about something,
you can't stop.

152
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,345
Your thoughts become obsessive.

153
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,964
Don't say that. You...

154
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:24,893
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

155
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:29,942
Have you ever been
on a subway car that breaks dow

156
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,583
and there's some guy...

157
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,528
some shy-looking kid who starts
repeating something to himself

158
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,535
over and over,
like, "7:15, 59th and Lex.

159
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,437
7:15, 59th and Lex,"
over and over, louder and louder

160
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:44,533
until just saying the words
isn't enough

161
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:48,221
and he starts hitting himself
and thrashing around

162
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,972
and finally has to be subdued
and tranquilized?

163
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:53,628
That is what it means
to have obsessive thoughts.

164
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,110
I just like thinking things through.

165
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:02,655
You're talking about your brother.

166
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:07,394
I've noticed that you're constantly
trying to feel what he feels.

167
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,867
Well, he can't describe
how he feels, so...

168
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,906
he needs someone
to interpret it for him.

169
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:16,597
Your empathy is...
It's admirable, April.

170
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:20,316
But it can be really draining

171
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:24,779
trying to feel everyone else's feelings
as well as your own.

172
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:27,991
Maybe...

173
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:30,531
instead of your own.

174
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:42,046
I don't... I'm sorry
for losing my temper.

175
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:46,038
You don't have to apologize to me.

176
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,698
I did fall out of a building once.

177
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,429
- When?
- We were on vacation in Miami.

178
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,151
I was only 10.

179
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,341
My mother is obsessed with Cuba...

180
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,191
Cuban music,
Cuban food, Cuban culture.

181
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:17,311
Anyway, we were down there
without my brother.

182
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,030
We left him...

183
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,490
For the first time ever, I think...

184
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,805
with my grandparents,
just me and my folks.

185
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,269
I remember this one night
there was a band

186
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,606
playing Cuban music down below

187
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:34,090
and my parents started to dance

188
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,479
right there in the hotel room.

189
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,617
I went over to the window

190
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:42,411
so that I could watch them dance

191
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,079
and feel the...

192
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,985
The breeze from the ocean
on my back at the same time.

193
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:51,542
Somehow...

194
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,350
I don't even know how it happened...

195
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,095
I fell out the window.

196
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,585
I must've just leaned back
and fallen.

197
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,008
I landed on the...

198
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,294
What's the word? The awning

199
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:10,356
one floor below. I mean, I was fine.

200
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:14,144
I just laid there for a second,
I looked up at the window

201
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:18,813
and then I slid off
and landed on the sidewalk.

202
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,668
Do you remember feeling frightened?

203
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:25,668
I remember

204
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:30,243
as soon as my feet hit the sidewalk
I started to bawl.

205
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:36,028
Then I walked back into the hotel
and I rode the elevator up.

206
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,966
I looked in the mirror

207
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,755
and I made myself stop crying.

208
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,411
So you could stop crying,
just like that?

209
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:49,332
I just looked at myself
and I said, "April

210
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,438
"you have to stop,"

211
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:52,971
and I did.

212
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,418
I can still do that.

213
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,706
When I walked back into the room,
my mother...

214
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,552
Had her head on my dad's shoulder.

215
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,711
They were still dancing.

216
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:12,206
They hadn't noticed you were gone?

217
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:20,091
Why did you have to stop crying?

218
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,976
- What?
- {\*I mean, y}You were 10 years of age,

219
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:26,341
you had fallen out the window.
Why couldn't you cry to your mother?

220
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,956
She was so happy.

221
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,232
The way she held my father
in that room,

222
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,058
the way they swayed,

223
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,571
my mother closed her eyes
as they swayed.

224
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,075
My mother never closes her eyes.

225
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:44,636
Why not?

226
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,871
She can't take them off Daniel.

227
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,902
I'm not an empathetic person.
I'm really not.

228
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:00,634
You asked me

229
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,721
where home was for me.

230
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,409
It was there,

231
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,735
in Miami.

232
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:15,463
That's the place
I want to go back to...

233
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,760
that room with my parents.

234
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,247
- Without Daniel.
- Right.

235
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:27,027
Did you ever read that book
"On the beach"?

236
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:29,956
It's about the nuclear holocaust

237
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,514
and these people
are waiting for the radiation

238
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:37,013
to reach Australia,
but they're happy.

239
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,636
They fall in love.

240
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:42,276
They buy benches for their gardens.

241
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:45,208
They don't think about the future.

242
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,336
I was reading that
while we were down there.

243
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,873
You were reading that book
at age 10?

244
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:53,896
I used to be precocious.

245
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:57,432
And that's what I had hoped
would happen...

246
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,664
a nuclear war would destroy
everything else in the world,

247
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:07,741
and we could just stay on the beach.

248
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:11,446
We couldn't stay.

249
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:13,943
We had to get back.

250
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,401
Daniel had stopped eating,
gone back to hitting himself.

251
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,374
My grandparents called in a panic.

252
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,448
My mother went to the airport
and got the next flight home.

253
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,505
My dad and I drove back that night.

254
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,071
Daniel wouldn't even look at us.

255
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:33,596
He couldn't speak.

256
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:38,101
It was like
we had set him back three years.

257
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:43,029
My mother never forgave herself
for that trip.

258
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,573
You are an empathic person...

259
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:52,697
the way you talk about your brother,
the compassion you feel for him.

260
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,556
But you can be an empathic person
and still feel contradictory emotions,

261
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,280
still feel anger, still feel...

262
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:01,034
jealousy.

263
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,749
Why would I be jealous of Daniel?

264
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,877
Maybe because your mother
never closes her eyes to him.

265
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,380
Daniel was allowed to show your parents
how he was feeling.

266
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,876
When he got upset, hurt or scared,
they knew it,

267
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,402
whereas you had to be perfect.
You fell out a window

268
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:22,134
- and your mother had no idea.
- You can't blame her for that.

269
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,144
Jesus,
don't talk about her like that.

270
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,813
- How am I talking about her?
- As if she was a bad mother.

271
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:29,190
She's a great mother.

272
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,570
She gave me my confidence,
told me how smart I was.

273
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,071
She made me feel
like I could do anything.

274
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:38,229
{\*But m}Maybe as a child, you took that to mean
that you shouldn't depend on her,

275
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,410
that you should take care of it
all on your own.

276
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,121
- I'm not going to do this.
- What{\ are you not going to do}?

277
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,194
Slam my mother.

278
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,759
She may not have been perfect,
but she did her best.

279
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,571
She could have been
a professional ballerina.

280
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,985
She trained at Juilliard,
but she gave all of that up

281
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,502
so that Daniel could have
some semblance of a normal life...

282
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,177
- I understand that.
- ... that he could

283
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,696
not feel like such a freak.

284
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,321
So don't sit there and tell me
she made all these mistakes.

285
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:05,383
She didn't have a choice.

286
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,508
I'm not attacking your mother.

287
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,607
I'm just trying to understand
why you can't tell her that you're sick.

288
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,445
Well, how much more can she take?

289
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,694
It's not your fault
that she had to deal with Daniel.

290
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,758
Lately Daniel
has been doing so much better.

291
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:19,383
She finally has some time
on her hands.

292
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:21,821
He's living in this group situation,

293
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,329
he's got a job
at the library stacking books,

294
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,634
and she has started
to teach a dance class for little kids.

295
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,182
I went to meet her there.

296
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,943
She is having such a great time.
I am not gonna take that away from her.

297
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:35,599
- You think being sick will do that?
- She would stop teaching the class.

298
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,131
She'd think she has to drop everything
to take care of me.

299
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:41,846
Maybe that's okay if she does.
She should stop teaching for a while

300
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,695
to help take care of you{\* for a little bit}.

301
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,309
She is finally getting the chance
to live a little.

302
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,789
I respect your wanting
to protect your mother,

303
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:51,564
but I think at a deeper level
you're also trying to protect

304
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,040
yourself

305
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:57,403
from seeing your mother's fear for you,
from feeling how much danger you're in.

306
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,852
You say that you want
to protect her,

307
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:03,727
but surely you know that
if you were to die, if you were to die,

308
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,927
she would never... and I know this.
I can tell you this as a father...

309
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,834
if that happened to me,
I would never ever recover.

310
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,745
Listen to me.
You have to begin chemo immediately.

311
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,801
The reason you haven't is because
you're scared to go through it alone.

312
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:23,085
Is there anyone
you can imagine yourself telling?

313
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,110
Anyone who you would want
to be there with you?

314
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,695
- I can't.
- You can.

315
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,054
It's too horrible.

316
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,500
What am I supposed to say?
How am I supposed to tell her

317
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,123
- that her daughter...
- You mean you.

318
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,778
You.

319
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:40,584
That I have cancer?

320
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,073
No, I can't.
It's too horrible.

321
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,763
Horrible as it is,

322
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,434
not telling her is more horrible.

323
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:54,012
When you say it, it makes sense...

324
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,374
just pick up the phone and tell her.

325
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,569
But I know that once I leave here,
I won't be able to.

326
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,221
Call her from here then.

327
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,598
Now?

328
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,296
Go ahead.

329
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,551
She'll just be leaving for work.

330
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,481
Can I use your phone again?

331
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:46,067
Of course.

332
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:03,321
I presume you want the room again?

333
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:51,663
Thank you.

334
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:53,854
How'd it go?

335
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:56,015
She was in the car.

336
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,520
She wanted to call me back...

337
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,379
It's illegal to talk and drive
at the same time.

338
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,672
With my dad in the army,
she follows the law.

339
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:11,507
You can stay here for 10 minutes
and call her back.

340
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,144
No, I'm so tired.

341
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:17,037
I'm gonna take a nap
and call her when I get up.

342
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:21,441
Will you call me
after you've spoken to her?
