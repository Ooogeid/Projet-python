00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,550
- Synchro by : ¤AkaZab¤ & Kasius

3
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,113
I told you.

4
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,263
Told me what?

5
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,719
That you'd be sorry you ever encouraged
me to cry here.

6
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,237
I'm not sorry at all.

7
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:59,206
You didn't expect it to be like this,
I bet.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,826
Like what?

9
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:04,714
You know what?

10
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:06,835
It's disappointing.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,993
I thought I'd feel better,

12
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:11,109
relieved.

13
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,131
I thought it'd be a lot more fun.

14
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,297
And it isn't?

15
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,259
No, it's horrible.

16
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,952
I don't know if I'm able to talk today,
Paul.

17
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,734
I shouldn't have come.
I should have just.

18
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:27,561
I should have just called it off.
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,362
Are you all right?

20
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,313
- Yeah.
- Sit down.

21
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,599
Sit.

22
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:46,416
You know, I've been sitting
out in the parkr about four hours.

23
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:49,352
- Out here?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,843
I wanted to call it off,
the session, but...

25
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:57,081
I wasn't
sure i'd be able to make it home alone.

26
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:00,172
I took a cab here.

27
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,375
My car's at home.

28
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,679
God, at least I think it is.

29
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:11,031
Yeah yeah, my car's at home.

30
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,025
My god, it's freezing.

31
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:20,430
I came this close to knocking
on your door and asking for a sweater.

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,528
When was that?

33
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:24,424
I don't know. Maybe 5:00 or 6:00,
I can't remember.

34
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,784
It was still dark.

35
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,870
I waited for the sun to come up.

36
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,277
I've never waited

37
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,406
this long for a sunrise,

38
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,186
except maybe on a camping
trip in fifth grade.

39
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,013
Thank you.

40
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:58,980
You know what I did?

41
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,215
What?

42
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,163
I held my cell phone,

43
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,347
and I watched the minutes go by.

44
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:09,145
It felt like forever for one minute
to turn into the next.

45
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,106
I thought to myself,

46
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:12,934
"how stupiis this,

47
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,578
dying on the street like roadkill
outside your therapist's office?"

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,362
I'm sorry, Paul.

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,471
I should have called it off.
I shouldn't have come.

50
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,023
You should have come here.

51
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,314
What happened last night?

52
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,323
Well,

53
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:48,528
what didn't happen?

54
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,928
The long version or the bottom line?

55
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,100
Because the bottom line is very simple.

56
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,067
My life is over.

57
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,733
Then,

58
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,900
you'd better tell me the long version.

59
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,129
I left Andrew.

60
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:17,792
We had a

61
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:18,966
big blowout.

62
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,543
Screaming, crying. The works.

63
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,399
And at some point i,

64
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,039
I called Alona and

65
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,827
we went out for a drink.

66
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,877
We had a few drinks.

67
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:34,394
Listen, I'm not here. I'm.

68
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,707
I'm so totally not here.

69
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,746
You are very much here,

70
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:39,692
Laura.

71
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,487
No, it's not me that's here.

72
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,632
Believe me, you'd be shocked
to know the person that's sitting here.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,617
I did some.

74
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,109
I did some terrible things last night.

75
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,191
I feel sick.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,765
But I don't wanna throw up.

77
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,213
It doesn't matter, it's no big deal.

78
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,424
What do you mean?

79
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,016
It's vomit. I'm not gonna

80
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,666
vomit all over your rug.

81
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,106
It's a cheap rug, Laura.

82
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,932
Let's talk about what's

83
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,560
really going on here.

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,316
It's Andrew.

85
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,574
He knows i'm here at this time.
Why is he calling me here?

86
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:52,772
Maybe he's worried.

87
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:55,050
- You were out of the house all night.
- Yeah, right.

88
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,542
If he really cared,
he wouldn't have started with his shit.

89
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:58,658
Start what?

90
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,762
At the club, this guy.

91
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,340
Oh my god.

92
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,428
He had corduroy pants on,

93
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,883
Preppy Sweater.

94
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:24,351
A republican, probably.

95
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,600
You know can I just step out for a
second and let him know I'm here I mean,

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,709
I can't concentrate with this shit.

97
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:38,140
- Just a sec.
- Laura, the call can wait.

98
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,689
Andrew gave me an ultimatum,

99
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,427
either we get married or we split.

100
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,694
He said he wants an answer in a day
or two at the most or else he's out.

101
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,912
He said he can't take it anymore,

102
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,793
that he loves me,
that he doesn't believe I love him.

103
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:15,972
Not for real,

104
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,773
that it's been two years
already on and off.

105
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:21,085
Blah blah blah.

106
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,384
I don't know why, all of a sudn

107
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:26,391
he just started ranting and raving.

108
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:29,676
We've talked about this stuff before.

109
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,753
But it was all in theory,
if we stayed together.

110
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:33,693
If.

111
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,669
And suddenly, out of the blue, I

112
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:38,882
I can't even remember
what we were doing.

113
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,339
We were watching Tv.

114
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:43,418
All of a sudden he just,

115
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,222
gets off the couch and grabs the remote
and turns off the Tv

116
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,932
and he turns to me and he has tears
in his eyes and he says,

117
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,853
"that's it. I can't take it anymore."

118
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,357
So out of line.

119
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:57,021
Promised he'd lay off
the subject for awhile

120
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,070
and all of a sudden he's on this
crying bullshit.

121
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,737
He actually burst out crying.

122
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,648
I've never seen him like that before.

123
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,675
And to tell you the truth,
it really scared me.

124
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:09,384
- No, it made me angry.
- Why?

125
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,029
Because he's trying to manipulate me
with these. These cheap chick tricks.

126
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,889
Maybe he thought he would
break my heart or something,

127
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,750
appeal to my.

128
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,536
Shit, you know, forget it. I don't know.

129
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,953
I threw a tantrum

130
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:26,780
like a three-year-old.

131
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,898
Screamed, cried,

132
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,339
told him to fuck off.

133
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,034
I told him he was

134
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,821
a little piece of shit for doing this

135
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:40,038
to me when he knows that I'm working
double shifts at the hospital this week.

136
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,541
I slammed the door,

137
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,077
smashed his laptop on the floor.
I killed it.

138
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,225
I ran out and I called Alona.

139
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,763
She dressed me in this outfit.

140
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,138
It's, it's not mine.

141
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,938
We went out for a drink

142
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,493
at a club that she likes on chester st.

143
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,693
She tried to calm me down,
put things into perspective.

144
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,457
And she said.

145
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,827
She said I was Lucky,

146
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,729
that she wished somebody loved
her enough to give her an ultimatum.

147
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,086
And then we drank.

148
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,170
Well,

149
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:27,748
i drank.

150
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,730
And, there was this guy at the bar,

151
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,986
and at some point
Alona said that she was tired

152
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,559
and that she needed to go home.

153
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,748
And then that guy...

154
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,610
Moved next to me and,

155
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,318
you know what he said?

156
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:46,760
He said,

157
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,991
"you look so sad."

158
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,829
And I said, "really?"

159
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,257
And he said, "yeah, you do.

160
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,244
It looks good on you."

161
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:00,687
"Looks good on you."

162
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,378
I mean, whatever happened to
"do you have the time?"

163
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,066
Or "haven't we met before?"

164
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,564
I must be totally out of touch, Paul.

165
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:12,729
What do you think?
I mean, do I look good when I'm sad?

166
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,449
I...

167
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,877
I don't think anybody
looks good when they're sad.

168
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
And then,

169
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,547
I don't know how much I had to drink
cause he was ordering for me, of course.

170
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:36,297
And then he,
paid the Bill and he asked me,

171
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,590
"would you like to go somewhere else?"
And I said,

172
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,924
"yes, I'd like to go to the bathroom."

173
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,381
So I stood up and I went
to the bathroom.

174
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,030
He follows me.

175
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:49,139
And you wouldn't believe it,
but these were unisex bathrooms.

176
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,550
Am I'm Lucky or what?

177
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,889
How do you mean, i'm Lucky?

178
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,934
Well, I'm,
I'm running away from a guy and I'm.

179
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:59,155
Yeah, you were trying to get away
from the guy.

180
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,188
Right. I mean,

181
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,433
I needed to pee, you know, by myself.
I've been doing that since I was three.

182
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,818
So I realized i needed
to make a decision.

183
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:14,366
By following me to the bathroom this guy
was also giving me an ultimatum.

184
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,624
I thought, "fuck,
out of the pan and into the fire."

185
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,328
I ran away from one ultimatum

186
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,334
and there was this guy with a
hard-on giving me another.

187
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,042
Suddenly I felt like doing it.

188
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,183
I never had sex in a bathroom before.

189
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,296
I mean, what?

190
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,974
I should go and Marry Andrew
without ever knowing

191
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,755
what a good bathroom fuck's all about?

192
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,502
It's part of a young lady's education,
isn't it?

193
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,776
So you wanted to do i

194
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,500
but not to get back at Andrew?

195
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:54,396
Just for yourself?

196
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:55,424
That's right.

197
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,428
A girl being forced into marriage.

198
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,019
What's she supposed to do, die ignorant?

199
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,502
So this guy
follows me into the stall and

200
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,075
suddenly

201
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,983
I was horny.

202
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,293
Is hearing about this disgusting to you?

203
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,304
No,

204
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,686
it's not disgusting.

205
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:24,969
Go on.

206
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:29,711
He unzipped,

207
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,767
pulled down his pants,

208
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,769
and he stood there with his

209
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:37,226
huge.

210
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:43,324
God, I felt like I was 16...

211
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,465
Touching it for the very first time.

212
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,977
I was really

213
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:53,521
surprised at how.

214
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,088
Warm it felt.

215
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,999
I mean, don't I know that already?

216
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,022
And then he...

217
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,691
turned me around
to face the door...

218
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,020
And he pulled down my stockings.

219
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:12,790
He lifted up my skirt,

220
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:17,270
put his hand into his back pocket
and pulled out a condom.

221
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,885
I realize this guy's very good at this.
He does this a lot.

222
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:23,853
He's a real pro.

223
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,308
And then this...

224
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:30,803
guy entered the stall next to us
and started peeing...

225
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,670
In gushes, full volume like a racehorse.

226
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:41,648
I thought of Andrew,

227
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:46,833
how he pees in the morning,

228
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:48,704
making the same sound.

229
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:52,279
My heart ached. I just...

230
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,467
It was so stupid, you know?
I just felt

231
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,421
so sad all of a sudden.

232
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:03,424
And he's behind me
and he's rubbing up against me

233
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:04,713
and he's feeling me up...

234
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,083
I thought to myself, "it's gonna happen
any moment." And I just...

235
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:13,984
I just couldn't do it.

236
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,651
I simply closed my legs shut.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,883
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it to Andrew.

238
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,237
I just couldn't do it.

239
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,286
Seems like quite a night out.

240
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,446
Yeah, that's not the end of it

241
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,001
because this idiot...
I told him,

242
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:37,297
"I'm really sorry but I have
a boyfriend. I can't do this."

243
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:39,157
And he laughs in my face
and says "boohoo."

244
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,588
And he grabs my hands
and he says, "listen, cupcake,

245
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,163
you think you can leave me high
and dry like this?"

246
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:45,714
Pointing at his dick.

247
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,129
"The least you can do
is make it up to me."

248
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,773
I said to him, "what do you want?

249
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,413
You want some money?"

250
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,683
He said, "give me a hand job

251
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,351
and there'll be no hard feelings."

252
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,305
And I said to him, "what's the matter
with you? Are you crazy?"

253
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,463
And it was just getting really strange.
I mean, it was tense.

254
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,142
His tone changed.

255
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,073
And then I thought of you...

256
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,382
What you'd say about it.

257
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:22,016
I thought about us
going through this in therapy.

258
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,455
And what did you imagine us saying?

259
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:32,284
I imagined you not being
able to understand it...

260
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,965
That you'd be disgusted.

261
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,485
Is that why you ran over here?

262
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,194
To find out if...

263
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:45,567
I would be disgusted?

264
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:47,831
I didn't run.

265
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,339
I gave him the hand job.

266
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,239
Excuse me.

267
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,505
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

268
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:45,586
Thank you.

269
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:55,455
We talked about what happened
at the club last night,

270
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,697
but we never got back
to actually talking <about...

271
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:02,141
Andrew and that argument yesterday.

272
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,078
I don't wanna be put in this position.

273
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,411
I don't wanna have this power
to decide our future

274
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:08,948
for both of us. I just don't.

275
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,336
Do you have any idea
why Andrew chose this particular time?

276
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,412
- What do you mean?
- Do you think that

277
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:17,868
Andrew...
just out of the blue,

278
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,605
as you said yourself,

279
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,810
came up with this idea of an ultimatum?

280
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,626
Did you notice anything
over the last couple of days or weeks

281
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,882
that you think might have
brought this on?

282
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,364
Nothing. I don't know.
He just lost it.

283
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,456
I mean, shit, don't you know
that men are the new women?

284
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,213
Obsessed with weddings and children.

285
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,463
And lately he's lost touch with reality.

286
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,023
Hehe thinks I'm seeing someone.
That's how this whole thing started.

287
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:44,077
- It's unbelievable.
- But I thought you said

288
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,392
it came out of nowhere.

289
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:47,533
You were watching tv, then suddenly...

290
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,488
Well, we were watching tv.
But before that

291
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,179
we were having dinner
and he had this look on his face.

292
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,031
He had this sad look
and I could just tell something was up.

293
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,714
I mean, you can just tell, huh?

294
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,964
And I said to him, "what's going on?"
And he said,

295
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,110
"I don't know what I want.
I just know I don't want

296
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,340
this on-and-off thing."
So I said to him,

297
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:07,502
"Sure, then let's just decide:
either we get married or wsplit."

298
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:09,293
So you were the one who came up with it.

299
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,007
- With what?
- The ultimatum.

300
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,922
No, he's the one. He had the problem
with the on-and-off thing.

301
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:16,680
- Not me.
- On-and-off can mean several things.

302
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,230
You were the one who made it specific...

303
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,493
"Get married or to split up."
That was your ultimatum.

304
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,100
No, he had this thing with the on and...

305
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,439
The ultim...

306
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,035
Yeah, okay,

307
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,705
I was the first one to say it,
you're right.

308
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,639
But he jumped all over it.
I said I didn't know what I want.

309
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:43,114
And he said, "you have a day
or two max to decide what you want."

310
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,823
And I said "fine."
And then he started crying

311
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,224
and blah blah blah.

312
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,369
The whole thing was really scary
to him, I think.

313
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,408
What about you?

314
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,247
Weren't you scared?

315
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:54,627
Of what?

316
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,264
Of splitting up.

317
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,357
I wasn't suggesting that we split up.
That's not the point.

318
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:02,052
So what do you think
was the point of this argument

319
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:03,584
that you may have initiated?

320
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,156
I didn't initiate anything.

321
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,470
You may not have meant to,
but you did.

322
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:11,736
It sounds like you wanted
to bring this relationship into...

323
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:12,859
crisis.

324
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:17,501
I know you say
that Andrew hates uncertainties,

325
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:21,353
but perhaps you're the one
who can't live with them.

326
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,300
I mean, why did you choose
this particular time

327
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,510
to bring things to a head?

328
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,943
I did no such thing.

329
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,246
Why now?

330
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,395
Because he's right.

331
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:46,733
Andrew's right.

332
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,494
I am being unfaithful to him.

333
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,705
You mean what happened last night

334
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,331
at the club?

335
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,204
Not just last night.

336
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,198
I've been unfaithful
to him for a long time.

337
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,527
Why haven't we talked about this before?

338
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,314
I think we have.

339
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,245
It's been here all along.

340
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,222
You mean to say you've never noticed it?

341
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,059
You're surprised.

342
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,803
No, I'm not surprised.
I just...

343
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:35,942
I don't follow what you mean.

344
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,096
This isn't...

345
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,543
the reaction I was hoping for.

346
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:52,874
Not at all.

347
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,720
What was the reaction
that you were hoping for?

348
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,306
I had...

349
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,366
Two scenarios in my head.

350
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,724
In the first one you stand up
and you hug me...

351
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,040
And you say, "I love you.

352
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,376
I love you too, Laura.

353
00:22:14,575 --> 00:22:16,513
I've been feeling this way
for a long time.

354
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,685
I just wanted you
to be the first one to say it."

355
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,422
And then we make love.

356
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,257
And the...

357
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,513
The second scenario?

358
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,209
It's like the first one but...

359
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,161
But without the sex.

360
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,518
We just sit he together.

361
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:47,353
You know, I'm embarrassed
to even talk about it.

362
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:50,643
I mean, you're sitting there
like a fucking buddha

363
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:53,060
acting like you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

364
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:54,527
It's humiliating.

365
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,940
How long have you felt like this?

366
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:01,143
A year...

367
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,996
From the first session.
I thought it would go away.

368
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,341
I thought it's just an infatuation,
that's all.

369
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,209
But it's getting worse.

370
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,323
You've become the center of my life.

371
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:22,418
Laura,

372
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:24,551
I'm your therapist.

373
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,262
The parameters and the limitations...

374
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,644
Are established and ethically defined.

375
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:41,831
I'm not an option.

376
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,879
You may be

377
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:49,065
using me as a...

378
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:52,341
As an excuse

379
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:54,808
to bail from your relationship with...

380
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,582
With Andrew.

381
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,759
You know why I didn't fuck that guy?

382
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:10,296
Not because of Andrew.

383
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:13,581
Not because I didn't wanna cheat on him.
I do want to cheat on him...

384
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
But with you.

385
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:22,692
When I was sitting there
at the bar by myself,

386
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:26,276
I was thinking what would happen
if you were to walk in?

387
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:29,489
You'd walk in.
You'd sit next to me at the bar,

388
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,131
you'd order a drink.
I'd even...

389
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,790
I even tried to imagine
what you would order...

390
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,709
A shot of bourbon maybe,
something...

391
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,720
expensive,
something fancy.

392
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,502
Then we'd start talking...

393
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,606
What a coincidence
it is to meet like this,

394
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:45,220
how awkward it is to meet
outside the office.

395
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,106
And then, without words,

396
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:52,778
because we...
We talk enough when we're here,

397
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,795
you motion for me to follow you
to the bathroom.

398
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:00,574
And I do.

399
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,765
When I went into the stall
with that guy...

400
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,429
I imagined it was you behind me.

401
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,987
That's what made it so exciting.

402
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,270
Then that guy started peeing

403
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:22,451
and it woke me up
and I realized that it's impossible.

404
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,334
I know it, I understand it.

405
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,496
I tell myself that every time
I walk out of here. I know it,

406
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:31,173
I understand it but I'm not sure
that my body understands it.

407
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,458
I know it can never happen. I know it.

408
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,672
So don't worry.
I'm not gonna start showing up here.

409
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,492
I'm not gonna start stalking you

410
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,639
like Glenn Close in that movie.

411
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,666
I'm not gonna...

412
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,521
boil your kids' rabbit.

413
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,051
I'm not dangerous...

414
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:56,900
At least not to you.

415
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,206
God, how can I go back to my life,

416
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,422
to the hospital, to Andrew?

417
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,063
Not to Andrew, when the only thing
that matters to me is you.

418
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:21,950
Our time's up.

419
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:26,998
Yes, it is.

420
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,161
I feel like I came here in the dark

421
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,224
and I'm leaving into a bigger darkness.

422
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,360
What am I gonna do now?

423
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,287
We'll talk about it next week.

424
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,959
Okay?

425
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,279
I'll call you a taxi.

426
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:02,988
No, I'm fine.

427
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:06,163
Are you sure?

428
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:12,957
How are you gonna get home?
