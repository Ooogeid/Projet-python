1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:02,924
Previously on "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:07,315
We're lying there face to face, petting
each other like high school kids.

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:09,883
One thing seems perfectly plain to me:

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,349
you slept with my patient.

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,731
He doesn't belong to you.
He's a great guy.

6
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:15,468
A little insecure in bed maybe, but

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,821
I think I'm gonna have a tremendous
affair with him.

8
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:21,268
Are you saying that when I was fucking
Alex, I was actually fucking you?

9
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,017
It seems more like,
"look what you missed out on, Paul, you

10
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,178
coward, you idiot."

11
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:27,919
Paul, if there's one thing I've
put right out there without hinting

12
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,165
or manipulation
it's that I've wanted you.

13
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:35,154
There's more intimacy between
us than most couples in the world.

14
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,236
Isn't that right?

15
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:38,248
I don't deny that there's
a certain intimacy.

16
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,863
Is there intimacy here
or not?

17
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:42,304
Yes,

18
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:43,909
there is.

19
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:34,497
Season 1 - Episode 21
<i>Laura Week Five</i>

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,143
- Synchro : <i>¤AkaZab¤, Kasius</i>

21
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:53,719
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:02,842
Laura, I think that

23
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:06,724
we need to discuss
in a little greater detail

24
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,313
your ending therapy.

25
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:13,513
We're not stopping
yet, but in order to do it gradually,

26
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:15,977
we have to
create what we call

27
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,520
a timeline.

28
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:18,822
No timeline.

29
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,555
We're
finishing today.

30
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,858
Yeah, today.
This is our last session.

31
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:38,679
Good.

32
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,975
Feels good.

33
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,437
Resolved, I guess.

34
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:50,906
I was a little nervous about telling you
but now that that's over, I feel better,

35
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:51,794
relieved,

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,540
maybe a little tired.

37
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:58,892
And...

38
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,733
and sad.
How about you?

39
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,749
How do you feel?

40
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,943
I'm sorry,
is that not okay for me to ask?

41
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,876
- No, it's perfectly okay.
- Good, so...

42
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,797
tell me.

43
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,661
Well,

44
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,177
to be honest,
it's come as a bit of a shock.

45
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,771
Shock.
Well, okay, what else?

46
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,978
Well,
I feel sad, too.

47
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:29,692
Right.

48
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,944
Yes, I do.
You don't believe me?

49
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,306
- It just doesn't look that way.
It looks like you're

50
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:36,629
holding back this huge sigh of relief,

51
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,507
this

52
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,749
huge gulp of air trapped in your lungs.

53
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,306
See, I'm trained to see that stuff,
remember?

54
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:46,260
Monitoring respiration,
that's anesthesiology 101.

55
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,050
Go ahead,
let it go.

56
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:52,918
Exhale.

57
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:57,803
No?

58
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,353
Well...

59
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,393
maybe I'm a lousy Doctor.

60
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,605
So how's your week been?

61
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,785
Don't ask me about my week.
It was terrible.

62
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,010
How terrible?

63
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,135
I was in surgery on friday and

64
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,729
this 15-year-old girl, she

65
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,125
she had this tumor
on her cheek.

66
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,491
It was nothing, benign,

67
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,623
cosmetic.

68
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:34,948
And everything's going great,

69
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:37,141
right?
Nothing wrong with the anesthetic.

70
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,872
And my attending gets called
away to consult on a procedure

71
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,592
and the surgery ended
faster than normal.

72
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,340
It was simple.

73
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,482
And I'm left with her
still anesthetized.

74
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,493
So I called to ask what to do.

75
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,675
I'd never been in that situation before
with a patient who's never woken up.

76
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:54,814
And they told me to

77
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:56,632
take her into the recovery room.

78
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:59,229
She was still intubated,

79
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,582
and the attending was supposed
to remove the tube

80
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,117
when she wakes up.

81
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,956
She was a sweet girl, Pretty.

82
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,521
Michelle was her name.

83
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,099
Before the op, I was talking to her
mom who told me that she'd Been

84
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:17,164
asking for this operation
since she was 9,

85
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:20,333
they recommended that
she put it off for a while,

86
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,551
and how she wasn't afraid,

87
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,418
just wanted this thing gone,

88
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,666
this Fatty Lump off her Pretty face.

89
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,932
And then suddenly, she wasn't breathing.
I don't know what happened, Paul.

90
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:40,237
I took her into recovery and two
minutes later she was blue. I mean,

91
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,877
Atcheson, he's the

92
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,435
senior attending,
he pushed me aside and pounced on her

93
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,360
with chest compressions.
I had no idea what went wrong, Paul.

94
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,233
They extubated her, and she was
breathing. Everything was fine.

95
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,399
It was okay.

96
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,802
How did you feel
during those

97
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,314
few minutes when the...

98
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,810
fantastic,
never better.

99
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:05,804
I felt

100
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,514
like shit.

101
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,800
I only look competent, Paul, you know.

102
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,595
White coat, stethoscope, pen in pocket.

103
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:17,150
I'm like those Doctors from
the pharmaceutical ads. You know, like,

104
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:18,644
hand on hip,

105
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,159
brow a little furrowed with concern,

106
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:24,438
nice smile.
I have a pretty smile, right?

107
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,128
Do...

108
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,938
Do you expect that nothing
will ever go wrong with a patient?

109
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,098
I dropped the ball.

110
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,025
But is that what the

111
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,858
attending concluded?

112
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,466
I mean, couldn't it have been
something else, like,

113
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,076
I don't know an allergic reaction,

114
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,487
-  a drop in blood.
- It's always my responsibility. Paul.

115
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:56,728
Tell me a little bit more about that,
about that girl.

116
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:00,498
She had braces.

117
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:06,400
And through her surgical cap,
you could see.

118
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,958
What do they call it?

119
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:12,120
The barrettes, little butterflies
pinning back her bangs.

120
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:13,561
They were old.

121
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,219
Must have her mother's or

122
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,399
from a thrift store or something.

123
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:21,657
And she had these
beautiful hands,

124
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,767
gorgeous hands.
I mean, she's just a girl,

125
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,948
and she had these hands of a woman,

126
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:30,163
very long fingers, Pretty little nails.

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,467
Shit, when I was her
age I used to eat my nails.

128
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,038
I mean, they were ugly
and stubby and short.

129
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,132
- Nerves, I guess.
- Why were you nervous?

130
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:42,621
Well, it was,

131
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,579
you know, around the time
that my mother passed away, so...

132
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,532
And whose responsibility were you then?

133
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,234
What do you mean?

134
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,610
Well, who was
taking care of you?

135
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,100
You mean who was watching my sleep?

136
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:02,149
Yeah.

137
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:06,402
I wasn't that girl on
the operating table, Paul.

138
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:10,347
No, it's just that you told me that when
your mother died, that it was like

139
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,617
a kind of a death for you too.

140
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:13,917
Yeah, but you know what?

141
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,173
Shit happens.

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,135
Life isn't fair.
What are you going to do, sue god?

143
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,010
Well, who would you sue?

144
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:23,330
You.

145
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,771
No, suing you wouldn't
do me any good, either.

146
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,937
That's my problem with psychology, Paul.

147
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,584
You dig and you dig and you uncover
all sorts of truths about yourself,

148
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:41,342
and you touch on all sorts of painful
places, but what good does it do, Paul?

149
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:45,324
I'm serious. I'm not being cynical.
What good does it do me today

150
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,153
to know how much I suffered then?

151
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,194
I'm sick of feeling sorry for myself.

152
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,953
I fucking hate feeling sorry for myself.
That's one of the things I hate.

153
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:01,681
What else do you hate?

154
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,190
There's a long list.

155
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,137
Well, for example.

156
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,198
- Omelets.
- Omelets.

157
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,663
Omelets and all sort of eggs,
but mostly omelets.

158
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,148
That's was the thing my father and I ate

159
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,483
the entire year after
my mother passed away.

160
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:29,123
I still have flashbacks,
but from behind, you know?

161
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,524
I'm standing at the stove and I'm

162
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:36,811
I'm breaking eggs into a frying pan.
Everything's very quiet, no talking.

163
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,901
My dad's just sitting there

164
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,233
reading the news paper
or something and I'm just...

165
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,563
beating the eggs with a fork.

166
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,004
Sometimes he wouldn't even be reading
the newspaper. He would just be

167
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,182
sitting there with a vacant look,
in a daze.

168
00:09:58,312 --> 00:09:59,315
I used to.

169
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,473
I'd fantasize that he'd disappear.

170
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:11,227
Such a terrible thing to say.
It's not that I wanted him to die.

171
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,355
I just didn't want to
continue living like that.

172
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:17,939
Everything was so bleak, so suffocating.
I just didn't want to be there.

173
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:20,928
So then...

174
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:23,336
Then you went to California.

175
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,436
- Yeah.
- So you stayed there for a while.

176
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,970
How was it coming back home after
spending that

177
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,080
time with David and Celia?

178
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,018
Well, you know, you have plans,

179
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:38,964
full of beans.

180
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:41,584
I thought, "shit,
I can make him feel better. I can."

181
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,266
But I couldn't.

182
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,852
That house was like a black hole
that just

183
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,222
sucked me in.

184
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,887
Anyway, I

185
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,243
I saw David again six months later.

186
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:02,604
He came to the DC area
to try some big case.

187
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,210
He was stayed for a while,
a few months.

188
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:10,046
I thought you said
you never saw him again.

189
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:15,011
I never saw them again,
but I saw him.

190
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,481
He used to have a room
at the <i>Hay-Adams</i>,

191
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,516
but occasionally,
he'd stay over at our house.

192
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,703
He didn't have a car,
so when it got late he'd stay.

193
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,676
He always offered to take a cab
back into town,

194
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,966
but my dad refused
since he was...

195
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:41,690
so hospitable to me
during the summer.

196
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,476
I mean, he was lonely.

197
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,776
But he wasn't the same David,
you know,

198
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,588
with the Ray-Bans and the sunblock
and the surfboard.

199
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,296
He was this lawyer guy with...

200
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:58,188
a three-piece suit,
an expensive haircut

201
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:01,187
and a middle-aged pot belly,

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,021
not that there's anything wrong
with a pot belly.

203
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:15,555
Anyway, he came to our house

204
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:18,140
for dinner the first night
he was in town.

205
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,610
My brother Oliver was away at college,

206
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:24,602
so it was just the three of us,
one big happy family,

207
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,227
my dad, David and I.

208
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,045
What was that like,
sitting there with...

209
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:35,723
these extremes,
your father on one side and...

210
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,168
Nick Nolte with a pot belly
sitting on the other side?

211
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,294
- What was that like?
- At first,

212
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:44,416
self-conscious, I guess.

213
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,978
You know how you always feel
more like a kid

214
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:51,848
when your parents are around?
That happened.

215
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:57,443
I remember slurping up spaghetti,

216
00:12:57,563 --> 00:13:01,113
trying really hard not to let
the noodles drip down my chin.

217
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:06,834
Later, I guess,
I wasn't as self-conscious.

218
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,595
Why?

219
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,554
Later, after David and I made love.

220
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,446
I seduced him.

221
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,084
Have you read <i>Lolita</i>?

222
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,508
Sure.

223
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:37,299
It's amazing, because pretty much
the same thing happened to me.

224
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:48,372
That night when he came over for dinner,
my dad was still at work.

225
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,421
So we sat on the porch...

226
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:55,494
and caught up.

227
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,021
I was painting my toenails.

228
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:05,131
And it became pretty clear
that he and Celia were having problems,

229
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,340
He said just as much, which is
why she hadn't joined him on the trip.

230
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,221
So we were just sitting
on the porch swing.

231
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,624
I was on one side.
He was on the other.

232
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,903
And I was resting my...

233
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,451
legs on his to dry my nails.

234
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,623
And he was just asking about me,

235
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:32,109
what was going on with me,
I started telling him about

236
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:33,584
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

237
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,348
God, I was so into them.

238
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:39,202
When you're writing down the lyrics

239
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:40,772
and analyzing them,

240
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,788
and I started singing
at the top of my lungs.

241
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,450
And David joined in,
we were so bad.

242
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,528
I mean, we were screaming it.

243
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,278
And then I felt his hardness...

244
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,331
under my foot.

245
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:04,981
And we we're just rocking in the swing,

246
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,451
the rhythm of it starts to take over.

247
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:11,154
And I'm just rubbing him with my foot,

248
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,333
although I've never done that
before in my life. Never.

249
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,830
I had on this little skirt
with these little flowers.

250
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:23,075
And he pushed up
my skirt with his finger.

251
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,261
And his finger just started...

252
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,217
climbing further and further
up my thigh.

253
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,800
Then we see my father's Volvo
coming down the street,

254
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:39,042
so we ran over to help him

255
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,356
with the groceries.
And I remember laughing so hard

256
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,963
because David was carrying his bag
of groceries in front of his hard-on.

257
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,996
We were just cracking up like teenagers.

258
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,116
He stayed over that night
in Oliver's room.

259
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,992
Around 1:00 in the morning,
I got up 'cause I couldn't sleep,

260
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,313
I walked down...

261
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:05,050
the corridor in the house. Oliver's room
was at the back of the house.

262
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,321
And I saw his light on.

263
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:12,324
The door was open,
and he was waiting for me.

264
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,879
And we made love.
It was lovely.

265
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,723
During the two months
he was in town,

266
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:26,248
we made love almost every day,
mostly in the mornings

267
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,784
when my dad went to work,
but occasionally,

268
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,054
if he didn't have to be in court
until the afternoon,

269
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,103
I'd play hooky.

270
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:36,707
Sometimes I'd go to his fancy hotel.

271
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,836
I felt very important and grown-up

272
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:45,224
walking through that lobby
in my mother's high heels.

273
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,170
Did you ever feel that this man...

274
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:02,323
That David was taking advantage of you?

275
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,154
He wasn't taking advantage of me.
I'm telling you. I seduced him.

276
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:12,531
Lolita seduces Humbert
in the novel and she's only 12.

277
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,497
You disapprove, obviously.

278
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:18,671
Yes, I do.

279
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,812
What's the matter?
You're making a judgment on me.

280
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:24,882
You're allowing yourself
to stray from the rules.

281
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:29,592
Gosh, it's too bad
you weren't like this before,

282
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:33,639
- willing to say what's on your mind.
- You never told me this before.

283
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:39,783
It's our last session so I thought
it was only right you to tell you.

284
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:44,927
Remember I told you that the guy
from debate society was my first?

285
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,447
David was my first.

286
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,131
And I'm sorry.

287
00:17:57,814 --> 00:17:59,122
What are you sorry for?

288
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,012
For lying to you.

289
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,606
I wasn't a victim.
Don't look at me like that.

290
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,229
- I wasn't a victim.
- Really?

291
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,799
I got into his bed.

292
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,827
He was a 40-year-old man,
for Christ's sake.

293
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,589
He had a responsibility
to send you away.

294
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,202
He was very gentle.

295
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:28,402
Gentle or not, it is beside the point.
He was 40 years.

296
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:31,972
He had a moral responsibility.
He should have known better.

297
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:34,881
Let me ask you something.

298
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,675
Do you feel...

299
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,137
Do you feel any anger towards this man?

300
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,789
It's not such a big deal.

301
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,779
He didn't hurt me.
It didn't hurt at all.

302
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,215
- It wasn't rape.
- Where was your father

303
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,130
during all this?

304
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,598
He was asleep in the next room.

305
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,235
But during the two months
that David was...

306
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,298
visiting, your father
had no idea what was going on?

307
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,502
He was depressed and grieving.

308
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,881
It hadn't even been a year
since my mother passed away.

309
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:13,133
He needed someone to protect him,
and guess who?

310
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,592
I understand that,

311
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:17,618
but children aren't supposed
to take care of their parents.

312
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:21,018
It's a burden that no child deserves.

313
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,330
Do you feel any anger
towards your father

314
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,976
for not being there to protect you,

315
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:31,954
for not noticing?

316
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:36,148
No resentment?

317
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,602
Let's just say you could talk
to your father now.

318
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,601
What would you say to him?

319
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,204
I have nothing to say to him.

320
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:51,109
But just imagine for a moment
if you were face to face

321
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:52,933
and you were...

322
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:56,657
talking about this incident.

323
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,326
What do you think you might say to him?

324
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:01,741
Have you ever spoken
to your father in that way?

325
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,913
I wish I could.

326
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:06,458
Because you can't talk to your father,
you're asking me to talk to mine?

327
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,126
That's not what I'm saying.

328
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:10,128
I think it's important

329
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:13,662
that you talk to your father about this

330
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:17,402
while it's still possible,
not for his sake,

331
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:20,738
but for yours.

332
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,476
Can I have something
to drink other than water?

333
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,016
Do you have any soda?

334
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,814
So this is the famous
coffee machine, huh?

335
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:45,521
Alex's famous coffee machine, yeah.

336
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,991
How do you use it?

337
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,266
Excuse me.

338
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,647
He's such a coffee freak...

339
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,430
It's the best smell, don't you think?

340
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,279
You know that this thing
with me and Alex is over.

341
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:19,621
I ended it.

342
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,691
Are you relieved?

343
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:32,528
Jesus, look at you.

344
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,279
How can you live like this?

345
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:39,828
Can't you just say
or do something on impulse?

346
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:55,066
You know that I connected
that girl to the wrong tube.

347
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:02,065
I inflated her like a balloon.

348
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:05,622
And I almost killed her,
and you know why?

349
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,750
Because I was thinking about you.

350
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,644
And I realized what an insane effect
you're having on me.

351
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,386
It has to stop.

352
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,754
We can continue
to talk about this if you want.

353
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,399
All of a sudden you're very generous
with your time.

354
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,128
For months
I spent the week thinking

355
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:45,972
"It'll be this Monday.

356
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,871
"I'll tell him that I love him,
he'll tell me he loves me,

357
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:54,203
"and the session won't be 50 minutes.
It'll go forever."

358
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:01,293
But then Monday would come
and I wouldn't dare say anything.

359
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:06,180
And the session would end,
I would just walk out of here thinking

360
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,516
"Fuck!

361
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,226
"I didn't say anything again.

362
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:16,246
"Now I have to wait a whole
other week for my life to begin."

363
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,635
I can't continue.

364
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,430
Every minute here is tearing me apart.
