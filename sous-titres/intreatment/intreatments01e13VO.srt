1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,335
Previously on "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:06,599
I'll put yours in the dryer

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,447
And they'll be ready by
the end of the session.

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,057
Well, you'll have to help me.

5
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,909
I haven't got dressed on
my own since my accident.

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,205
How on earth do you manage
with two broken arms?

7
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:17,155
I don't.

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,552
She's cool. You could
learn a lot from your wife

9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,397
About how to talk to people.

10
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,900
Are there people who say
things about you, Sophie?

11
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:28,225
Some of the girls at the gym
might be jealous of you, and,

12
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,624
how close

13
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,185
your relationship is with Cy?

14
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,161
Don't talk to me like i'm a child.

15
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:35,245
How do you get along with Cy's wife?

16
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:36,858
I don't wanna talk about them.

17
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,986
"During first session
appears to be very impressive,

18
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,136
Sensite,

19
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,038
mature for her age,

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,690
Very intelligent

21
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,518
And a highly-independent personality."

22
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,503
Do you really think
those things you wrote?

23
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:50,748
Absolutely.

24
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:05,681
It isn't serious. It
comes off in a week.

25
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:23,039
My cousin stayed over last night.

26
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:25,954
She's here visiting colleges, so,

27
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,658
she got to sleep in my room,

28
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,549
And I had to sleep on the couch.

29
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:31,725
When I woke  this morning

30
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,123
i couldn't move my neck.

31
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:36,696
I had to go to the doctor's today anyway

32
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,198
To get my casts off,

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,265
but he took one look
at me And he was like,

34
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,639
"i don't think so."

35
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,134
He put this thing on me.

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,572
He left my casts on too because--

37
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:49,873
I don't know why, actually.

38
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,346
I guess taking them off might

39
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,378
cause too much rain on my neck.

40
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,500
I found something for you.

41
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,681
I thought you should have it.

42
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:23,074
- In here?
- Yeah, in the front pocket.

43
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,387
It's for your collection.

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,205
It's a catboat.

45
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,077
It's beautiful.

46
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:36,404
Thank you.

47
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,087
It's a going-away present.

48
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,656
This is our last session,
right? You said three.

49
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,009
No, I said

50
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,794
at least three.

51
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,500
If you're totally sick of listening

52
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,509
to other people's insipid lives,

53
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,128
Then maybe you can look at it

54
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,682
And it will make you feel
like you're somewhere else.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,911
"Insipid"--
That's a good word.

56
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:04,084
I read thesauruses for fun.

57
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:07,285
I'm not a freak, okay?
I just like words.

58
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,028
I thought you could use it.

59
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,466
It must really suck having to listen

60
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,764
To other people's problems all day.

61
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:22,703
So does that chair, like,

62
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,665
enhance your brain function?

63
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,142
i don't think so.

64
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,774
Can you read minds?

65
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,706
Unfortunately, no.

66
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,300
Yeah, it would be a
lot easier if you could.

67
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,324
It would.

68
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,551
Can I try the chair?

69
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,113
Sure.

70
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,729
Please.

71
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:53,851
Thank you.

72
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,442
How are you? You look tired.

73
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,128
I'm okay.

74
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:08,850
Maybe you should take a nap.

75
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:11,451
Maybe.

76
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:16,383
I've noticed that,
uh, Cy's drawing is--

77
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,569
Is gone.

78
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,071
- Did you erase it?
- Yes.

79
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,719
How do you feel about that?

80
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,142
How do you think I feel?

81
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:28,332
Maybe a little scared

82
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,065
Because this could be our

83
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:31,510
final session?

84
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,551
Why would I be scared?

85
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,949
Is the evaluation going to be bad?

86
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,551
I don't think it's the evaluation

87
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:41,879
that scares you.

88
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:44,625
I think it's the possibility that um,

89
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:47,335
you won't be coming back.

90
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,018
Sorry, but no.

91
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,425
I bought you a goodbye present.

92
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,705
See ya.

93
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,083
I know it's a goodbye present,

94
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,075
But there's another way to look at it.

95
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:00,956
Maybe

96
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:03,151
you want to leave something behind

97
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,727
So that I won't forget you.

98
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,215
- You said you liked the boat.
- I do.

99
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,383
If you don't want it, i'll take it back.

100
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:12,144
Do you want to take it back?

101
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:23,894
So...

102
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:27,611
if someone my age
wants to start therapy,

103
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,167
How would it work?

104
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,172
Well, we'd take it at
that person's own pace,

105
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,957
Not like these
last few sessions--

106
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,218
The evaluation, the
three-Session deadline--

107
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,499
Nothing like that.

108
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,777
See, the person who's in therapy

109
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:43,750
controls the gas,

110
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:44,989
So to speak,

111
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,617
And the wheel for that matter.

112
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,958
So it's like driving a car?

113
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:54,762
Yeah,

114
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,558
it's a bit like driving a car.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,730
So...

116
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,593
pretend i'm in therapy now.

117
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,486
All right.

118
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,100
I said pretend.

119
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:19,261
So,

120
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,787
what do I do?

121
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,923
Why don't you tell me a
little bit more about the boat?

122
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,528
I got it years ago

123
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:29,019
from a homeless woman in New York

124
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,605
when I was just a kid.

125
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,101
What were you doing in New York?

126
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,194
We were on a "family" vacation.

127
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:37,206
Why do you say that, "family" vacation?

128
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:38,910
Because it wasn't a real vacation

129
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:40,743
and we weren't a real family.

130
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:42,838
No sand, no ocean--

131
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,348
That's not a vacation, you know.

132
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:45,793
That's bullshit.

133
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,951
My dad took me to central park.

134
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,747
There was this old woman

135
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:51,840
right at the park's entrance

136
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,021
Selling these little wooden toys.

137
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:57,314
She looked so miserable.

138
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,083
And I remember thinking,

139
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:03,115
"it's worse for her."

140
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,310
|| I had just enough money
left from my allowance

141
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,592
To buy the boat.

142
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,597
By the time we came home, it was over.

143
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,135
What was over?

144
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,498
- Their marriage.

145
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,681
Actually, I think it was over

146
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,737
during the vacation but they were, like,

147
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,491
pretending or something.

148
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,051
I went to school,

149
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,683
i went to practice

150
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:29,311
And I came home

151
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,788
and they were waiting
for me in the kitchen,

152
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:34,212
Smiling like those movie stars.

153
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:35,680
Like

154
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,254
movie stars?

155
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:39,610
You know, those smiles
that movie stars do?

156
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:41,979
Those big smiles

157
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,964
but their eyes are all glazed over.

158
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:44,941
Like--

159
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:50,035
And then my mother starts to cry.

160
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,203
Then my father says
to her in this voice...

161
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,974
"Olivia, leave it to me."

162
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,087
And then he starts to cry.

163
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,819
And i'm just standing there

164
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,006
stuck in the kitchen

165
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,929
Hungry as fuck with these two babies.

166
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,895
I don't remember the
day he actually left.

167
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,448
I just remember that day in the kitchen.

168
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:12,691
- Where did he go?

169
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,147
- Back to New York

170
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:16,842
With his new wife.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,784
And I stayed here with my mother

172
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:22,860
Who's totally depressed.

173
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:28,236
Cy and Darlene--
They lived close by,

174
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,205
So,

175
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,718
they helped me get to practice and back.

176
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,645
They didn't want me to give it up.

177
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,269
Why are you looking at me like that?

178
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,070
It's just the way you talk about it,

179
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,871
Like you're not so
upset about the breakup

180
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:47,911
As

181
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,837
the way they did it.

182
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,301
Maybe that's what's making you sad.

183
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,598
I'm not sad.

184
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:57,096
Is that what people are

185
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,788
supposed to do in therapy?

186
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,674
Sit around and whine
over all their problems?

187
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,474
It's never going to happen.

188
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,849
That's what she would do.

189
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,528
I am nothing like her--

190
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,608
Your mom?

191
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:16,212
Where was your dad while
all this was going on?

192
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,159
I told you, in New York

193
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,439
with Natasha.

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,274
Did you ever consider living with them?

195
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:22,143
No.

196
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,362
We once thought maybe, but...

197
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,614
- It didn't work out.
- Why not?

198
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,589
They needed their space.

199
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,941
They didn't last anyway.

200
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,330
He wanted me to live with them.

201
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:45,451
He was really pissed
that she said no, so,

202
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,766
it really soured their relationship.

203
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,594
So you blame yourself?

204
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,132
Whatever way the cookie crumbles,

205
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,517
you're still to blame?

206
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:59,275
How old are you?

207
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,486
What do you mean, how old am i?

208
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:05,243
People really don't
talk like that anymore.

209
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:06,452
Really?

210
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,684
Your logic has

211
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,161
has some flaws, Sophie.

212
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,014
You aren't responsible

213
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,788
for what your parents did.

214
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,266
You couldn't be.

215
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,512
Were you a gymnast before--

216
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:28,409
Before you met Cy?

217
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,523
I don't remember a time before I met Cy.

218
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,635
I've known him since I was so little.

219
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,489
Besides my father,

220
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:40,409
They're the only people

221
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,136
who ever believed in me.

222
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,380
Cy discovered me gymnastically.

223
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,450
I was dancing around
on a log in the backyard

224
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,145
To entertain Dana.

225
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,334
You know, doing spins and things.

226
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,999
He put me on a beam the next day.

227
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,890
Their house was like my house.

228
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,335
I had a key.

229
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,064
Before my father left,

230
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,239
When he and my mom were
fighting all the time,

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,630
I slept over.

232
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:12,557
I had these really
bad attacks back then.

233
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,082
My stomach would start to shake

234
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,553
And then my whole body
would start to shake.

235
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,370
Sometimes i'd start throwing up

236
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,984
And I couldn't make it stop.

237
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:28,001
They took me to the
emergency room one night.

238
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,379
We never told my parents.

239
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,414
Why not?

240
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:39,879
I ruined their family.

241
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,104
I did, I really did.

242
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,005
Darlene was so good to me.

243
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,156
I was--

244
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,457
She really was good to me.

245
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,199
She told me

246
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,524
before she left for Wisconsin

247
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:58,943
That she was only going

248
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:00,353
because she knew I would be there

249
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,950
To take care of Dana.

250
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,649
She said she didn't trust Cy,

251
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,200
but she trusted me.

252
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,607
She trusted me and I ruined it.

253
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,195
You're thinking he used me.

254
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,986
You're wrong.

255
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:20,354
He kept trying to stop me.

256
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:21,935
He kept saying,

257
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,895
"Sophie, you don't
know what you're doing.

258
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:24,794
We'll get to a place and

259
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:26,850
there'll be no turning back."

260
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:30,242
He's a really good person, Cy is.

261
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:31,725
He's a gentleman.

262
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,187
He kept saying,

263
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,843
"you don't know what you're doing."

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,046
But the thing is, I did.

265
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,124
And what were you doing, Sophie?

266
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:47,725
At first, I thought
it was my imagination.

267
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,298
And then he stopped talking to me

268
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,920
while Darlene was home.

269
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:53,731
You know, like he was embarrassed,

270
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,862
Like he was hiding something.

271
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,714
And sometimes i'd catch
him holding his breath

272
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,409
While he was looking at me.

273
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,056
He loves me, I know he does.

274
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,241
So I knew

275
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:12,790
even before Darlene went away,

276
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,428
I knew that he loved me.

277
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,263
And then she left for six months

278
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,508
But Cy wouldn't have sex with me

279
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,103
Even though everyone
assumed we were doing it,

280
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,712
That we'd been doing it for months.

281
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:30,311
Cy said it was a line that we absolutely

282
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:32,843
Positively would not cross.

283
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:50,419
We'd been sleeping
in the same bed--

284
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,811
Just sleeping.

285
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,676
And then one night,

286
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,322
The night before Darlene came home,

287
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,692
I woke up in the middle of the night

288
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:02,298
And he was awake.

289
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:05,519
Then he--

290
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:08,968
I--

291
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:13,861
It happened.

292
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:19,793
It felt like nothing at all.

293
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,351
Like nothing?

294
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:29,811
Not good?

295
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,209
Not bad?

296
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,047
Kind of like--

297
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,718
Kind of like I was watching it happen...

298
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:46,158
on a really small black
and white television.

299
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,415
Like

300
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,153
i was checking my e-mail

301
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,486
At the same time.

302
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,237
Like I wasn't really there.

303
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,393
I don't know.

304
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,408
The next day we pretended

305
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,982
like it hadn't happened.

306
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:08,933
Then at practice that afternoon

307
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,665
We had this big fight

308
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,250
in front of everyone.

309
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:15,228
Because of what happened?

310
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,335
Because I fell off the beam.

311
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,608
I'd been going for this back bend

312
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,475
And for some reason I thought the beam

313
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:26,366
Was longer than it really was

314
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,462
So,

315
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,516
i bent right off of it.

316
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:32,432
I fell flat on my back.

317
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,020
I just stayed there

318
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,876
Trying to breathe,

319
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,184
Afraid to move,

320
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,110
Afraid that i'd broken something.

321
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,255
Then Cy came over and
started screaming at me.

322
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,312
"We've got two days
until this tournament

323
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,034
And you've lost your focus.

324
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,612
Now get back up there and do it right."

325
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:06,648
That night I slept on the couch.

326
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,503
Then in the middle of
the night Cy came in

327
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:13,150
And i thought that--

328
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,899
But he wanted me to
put Dana back to bed.

329
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:21,179
She'd had a bad dream

330
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,469
and come into his room looking for me.

331
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,344
So,

332
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,631
I put her back to bed
and then we talked.

333
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:35,509
He kept talking about my potential.

334
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,482
He said it would ruin

335
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,761
both of our careers if this got out.

336
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,655
He said we had to stop.

337
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,135
That's it.

338
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,075
We almost had sex again that night,

339
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:56,779
but he didn't want to.

340
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:00,051
That's it.

341
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,453
A few weeks later

342
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,781
Darlene said she wanted to talk to me.

343
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:20,053
She said that Dana had
become too attached to me

344
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,613
While she was in Wisconsin

345
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,303
And I probably shouldn't
come over for awhile.

346
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:28,874
But it was pathetic

347
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,561
Because I know her, you know?

348
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,233
She was lying to me.

349
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,002
I couldn't look at her.

350
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:43,330
I just said i'm sorry.

351
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:46,898
She said,

352
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:48,824
"don't be silly.

353
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,747
Kids forget quickly.

354
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:55,379
Grownups don't but kids do.

355
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,385
Dana will forget you."

356
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,893
Dana will never forget you, Sophie.

357
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,219
You don't think so? No.

358
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,604
I'm sure of it.

359
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,843
Darlene

360
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,121
is terribly wrong.

361
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,437
Grownups

362
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:16,422
can forget.

363
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:19,188
Children can't.

364
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,494
When I left, darlene gave me a present

365
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,678
That she got for me in Wisconsin.

366
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,704
What was it?

367
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:36,020
An apron...

368
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,630
with cows on it.

369
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,745
She knows I like to cook and

370
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,058
I collect things with cows on them, so,

371
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,625
it was sort of...

372
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,677
Perfect.

373
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,033
The accident...

374
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:54,956
it happened that night?

375
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,714
I woke up in the ambulance.

376
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:02,512
Do you remember how you got there?

377
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:03,404
I don't even remember

378
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,343
walking away from the house.

379
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:08,018
I remember her giving me the apron.

380
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,438
I didn't want it. I
tried to give it back...

381
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:14,853
but she said,

382
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,865
"Take it so you don't get dirty."

383
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,075
And then I think she kissed me.

384
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:30,414
It must've been at their door because,

385
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:31,830
now I remember stepping back

386
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,534
and seeing the whole house.

387
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:34,713
- What did you see?

388
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,592
- Nothing.

389
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,204
I saw thhouse from the outside,

390
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,662
That's all.

391
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:49,279
"I'll huff and i'll puff

392
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,077
And i'll blow your house down."

393
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,922
So what the fuck are
you gonna write now?

394
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:07,636
Are you asking me if I think

395
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,645
the accident was your fault?

396
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,435
Yes.

397
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:13,282
When you came here this morning Sophie

398
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,326
You to me that they would
going to take the casts--

399
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,632
- You're stalling, Paul.

400
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,300
- I'm trying to explain to you--

401
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,967
You know, but you're afraid to tell me.

402
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,806
Sophie, what I need
you to understand--

403
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,351
I understand!

404
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,769
I understand everything.

405
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:27,227
I understand why Darlene

406
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:28,590
kicked me out of the house.

407
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,127
I understand why you're
lying to me right now.

408
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,220
Okay, I get it!

409
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,305
- I fuing get it!
- Sophie...

410
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,073
let's finish the session.

411
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,205
- I have to use the bathroom.

412
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:42,403
- Okay.

413
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,274
Sophie?

414
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:27,817
Sophie?

415
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,981
- Are you all right?

416
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:35,535
I'm gonna open the door now.

417
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,658
- Is that okay?

418
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,619
- Yeah.

419
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,606
I'm so sorry. I don't
know how that happened.

420
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,575
It's no problem. Don't worry about it.

421
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,417
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

422
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,949
It's just a picture frame.

423
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,593
I can clean it up later
on. It doesn't matter.

424
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,572
I don't wanna fuck
everything up here too.

425
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,056
No, don't worry about it.

426
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,972
If you had to write
the evaluation now--

427
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:06,689
But I don't have to write

428
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,732
the evaluation now, Sophie.

429
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:10,997
If someone held a
gun to your head--

430
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,230
No one's holding a gun to my head.

431
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:13,259
Are you holding the gun?

432
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,713
I wanna know waht you
think ! What do you think ?

433
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,197
Do you think that you
did this to yourself ?

434
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,643
I don't remember!

435
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,521
How many times do I have to tell you?!

436
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,694
- What does your instinct tell you?

437
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,069
- I don't have any instinct.

438
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,149
- What does your heart tell you?

439
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,712
- I don't have a heart.

440
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,484
You know from what you've told me already,

441
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:35,575
I think that you're having
quite a difficult time

442
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:37,933
- Taking care of  yourself recently.
- So?

443
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,207
So it doesn't mean that you

444
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,192
deliberately ran into that car.

445
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,878
So what would you write?

446
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:49,496
i don't know, something
along the lines of...

447
00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:54,569
"as a result of the anxiety

448
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,626
She felt preceding the incident,

449
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,065
The subject may have been distracted,

450
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,400
Acted irresponsibly but

451
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:03,950
we cannot conclude

452
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,429
That the accident was a

453
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,874
premeditated, willful act--"

454
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,003
- That sounds really vague.

455
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:10,094
- I can't be any more
specific than that.

456
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm not a magician.

457
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:13,312
I don't know anything more

458
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,276
than what you've told me.

459
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,184
I fucking hate you!

460
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,252
You never say what you really mean.

461
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,050
You know, you're just like

462
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,695
all the rest of them.

463
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,543
Why can't anyone ever tell

464
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:24,505
anyone else the truth?

465
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,296
I can't listen to any more

466
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:28,908
of your stupid bullshit words.

467
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,622
"A willful and irresponsible act"?

468
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,091
Just say it--

469
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,240
She tried to kill herself or not.

470
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,475
If you think I did, then say so!

471
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,013
What's the problem?

472
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:40,528
There's a difference

473
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,937
Between not being careful

474
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,569
Because you feel vulnerable

475
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:48,866
And wanting to commit suicide. No!

476
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,308
You don't see the difference? No !

477
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,202
It's just like the picture frame.

478
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:54,925
I didn't mean to break it.

479
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,111
I didn't even see it,

480
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:58,236
But it's broken. I broke it.

481
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,586
In terms of the evaluation,

482
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,604
There's a really big difference.

483
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,538
That's what i'm trying
to get you to understand.

484
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,369
- What?

485
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,696
- Sophie, the problems that you had

486
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,270
Before the accident--

487
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:10,773
They're still there.

488
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,083
Even when they take off

489
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,680
the neckbrace and take off the casts,

490
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,406
Those problems are
still going to be there

491
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:17,324
When you go back to your

492
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,285
normal everyday routine.

493
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,541
You're gonna have to face them again.

494
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,171
'Cause if we're not careful,

495
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,215
something like this could happen again.

496
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,151
That's what you're really
asking me, isn't it?

497
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,164
If you go back to your life,

498
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,655
Will you find yourself in front of a car

499
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,000
Again someday soon?

500
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:57,679
You make me sound like a time bomb.

501
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,862
It's true, I ruin everything.
- No, you don't.

502
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,213
- Yes, I do.

503
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:07,832
You said I wanted to go home

504
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,539
because there's nothing
more For me to ruin there.

505
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:11,843
It's obvious.

506
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,756
Well, let's look at it another way.

507
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:17,899
You could really build
something at home.

508
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:20,615
With my mother? Are you on crack?

509
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,017
I have to go soon.

510
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,314
Can I ask you something before you go?

511
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:33,604
Where do you feel...

512
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,536
safe?

513
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:38,047
- What?

514
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,269
- Where are you happy?

515
00:25:39,347 --> 00:25:40,697
Where do you feel--

516
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:42,772
Where do you feel safe?

517
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:46,066
I was happy with Cy and Dana.

518
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:47,603
I ruined it.

519
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,439
You erased the drawing from your cast.

520
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,892
'Cause I was angry.

521
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,432
Is there anywhere
else that you're happy?

522
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,048
On the beam.

523
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,986
I can spend hours
walking back and forth--

524
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,472
Dive, dive and swish.

525
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:10,695
"Dive, dive and swish"?
What does that mean?

526
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,743
It's a song I sing to
myself when i'm up there.

527
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,756
It reminds me of a pelican

528
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:19,187
diving down to catch a fish in its beak.

529
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,870
Could I hear the song?

530
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,525
I have a wish, to sing and fish,

531
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:32,696
Down by the sea, just you and me,

532
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,492
???

533
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:36,476
Dive, dive and swish.

534
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,662
And on the dive i've

535
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,460
drop my foot off the beam and,

536
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,728
And on the swish I swing it back up.

537
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,284
- You feel safe up there?
- Yes.

538
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,200
You know you can't
live up there forever.

539
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,825
You have to come down,

540
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,316
eventually.

541
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:30,900
Goodbye, Sophie.

542
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:40,008
Hello, this is Paul Weston. I'am,

543
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,956
your daughter's therapist

544
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,234
And I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

545
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,883
I understand they're about to remove

546
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,178
Sophie's neckbrace and her casts

547
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,119
And I think that we should discuss

548
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,549
Her return to the gym and to training.

549
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,486
So would you mind calling me, please,

550
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,906
At my office? Thank you.
