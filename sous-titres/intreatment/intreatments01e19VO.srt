<i>Previously, on </i>In Treatment...

2
00:00:03,623 --> 00:00:06,010
- Where does he think you are?
- Maybe fucking Reeves.

3
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,261
Your boss?

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,764
- Is he attracted to you? Reeves?
- Why wouldn't he be?

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,423
- What do you think about me?
- I think you're flirting with me.

6
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:17,791
- Where's the stain?
- What were you expecting to feel

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,608
- when you saw it?
- Nothing.

8
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:21,108
No sadness?

9
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:23,043
- Over a stain?
- No.

10
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:25,452
Over the loss of your baby.

11
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,109
I'm glad I'm not pregnant anymore.

12
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:39,498
- Really? You're glad our baby died?
- Yes, I didn't want this baby.

13
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:42,005
And fucking hell, I know why.

14
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:45,272
This has been really great, Paul.

15
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:47,968
Couple more of these and we'll pay
a divorce attorney instead.

You look surprised.

00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,310
We do have a session, don't we?

21
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,648
Yes, we do.

22
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,337
So Jake isn't coming today?

23
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,145
I don't know.

24
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:09,466
Got a light?

25
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:16,542
Here he is now.

26
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,625
Good afternoon, Jake

27
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,207
Afternoon.

28
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,493
No, thank you.

29
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:58,836
Will you excuse me for a moment?
I have to take this call.

30
00:02:58,956 --> 00:02:59,906
Thank you.

31
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,611
Thank you for getting back to me.
I appreciate it.

32
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:15,455
Actually I'm with a patient
the moment, I've got to make this short.

33
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:18,723
As far as I'm concerned
she can go home, yes.

34
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,125
I owe you one.

35
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,772
Is her mom there?

36
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,414
Could I speak to her for a second,
please? Thank you.

37
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,212
How are you?

38
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,515
Please don't worry.

39
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,757
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?
Same time.

40
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:40,098
Take care, bye.

41
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm sorry about that.
I had to take that call.

42
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:48,013
Do you usually take calls
in the middle of a session?

43
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,275
It's OK. Something happened
to one of your patients?

44
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,464
A friend's daughter.
She's okay now.

45
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:55,139
I don't understand,
if it wasn't serious,

46
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,869
- why did you have to be available?
- What are you bitching about?

47
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,647
What, did we lose a minute?

48
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,605
- I just wanna to understand.
- It was an emergency.

49
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,041
And I apologize.

50
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,216
Actually, Amy has a point.
A minute with you isn't cheap.

51
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,793
It's $200 at

52
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,203
50 minutes. That'd be...

53
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,844
$4 a minute, Einstein.

54
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:24,548
You know,
I was thinking before you came in that

55
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:27,193
neither one of you is ever absent.

56
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,863
No matter what happens
the previous week,

57
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,252
you both come back.

58
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,064
I just want to say that

59
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,906
I think that's impressive.
I think it's highly commendable.

60
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,992
You saying we're predictable?

61
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,282
- No, that's not what...
- But we are. we are.

62
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,706
- We are so predictable.
- What does that mean?

63
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:48,333
It means the opposite of unpredictable.

64
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,158
Whatever is said or done,
everyone comes home

65
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:55,828
at the end of the day, right?
As long as the everyone is me.

66
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,293
When I left last week,
I said I wasn't going home,

67
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:02,307
but when I did go home later,
Lenny was alone. He was by himself.

68
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:05,642
Jake had left him and told him
that I would be home to give him dinner.

69
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,793
What if I hadn't gone home?

70
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm so sorry I changed my mind.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,193
You're sorry you came home
to your son?

72
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,610
I'm sorry you were
so sure that I would go home.

73
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:16,388
Why is that, Amy?

74
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:19,364
He's taking me for granted!
He left all night and didn't come back!

75
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,593
So what happened?
What time did you get home?

76
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:24,063
The next morning.

77
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,898
If Amy hadn't come home

78
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,237
your son would've been alone
all night?

79
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,599
She came back.

80
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,366
- See what my word is worth?
- A liar shouldn't expect

81
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:36,811
- their word to be worth anything.
- Baby, you think I lie?

82
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:40,136
I'm gonna start some real lying
to teach you a lesson.

83
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,811
God, what happened?

84
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,206
With what?

85
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:01,516
With us.
I'm asking you what happened.

86
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:04,151
What happened?

87
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,245
What happened was we started
coming here. That's what happened.

88
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,375
Are you saying things have gotten worse
between you since you started therapy?

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,199
Obviously, yeah.

90
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,688
Do you feel that way too, Amy?

91
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,133
- Maybe.
- I told you, Paul.

92
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,803
Couple more sessions
and we're gonna get divorced.

93
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:25,139
- When did you tell him that?
- After you left last week.

94
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,895
Maybe your arguments are becoming
more frequent here

95
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,247
but I don't think that means
you're headed for the divorce court.

96
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,587
Maybe you're allowing yourself to...

97
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,997
To vent because you feel
that somebody's in charge,

98
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,558
i.e., me.

99
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,909
You know, like kids who fight only
when mom's around.

100
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:48,163
Kids? Now we're kids? Jesus.

101
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,292
That sounds like him and his friends.
That's where he was the other night.

102
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:55,013
So you did know
where he was the other night?

103
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,417
Of course, it's always Simon or Elliot.

104
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:00,350
The one thinks
he's an organic farmer...

105
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:04,509
Doesn't do any work and he'll probably
be bankrupt by the end of the year.

106
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,662
the other is an aspiring
songwriter like Jake.

107
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,184
He's been writing songs for 20 years
but has nothing to show for it.

108
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:12,446
It's all

109
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,313
- very unsuccessful.
- You see, Paul,

110
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:18,768
to Amy anyone without a PhD
or a Swiss bank account is

111
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:19,912
unsuccessful.

112
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,638
A PhD? How about a GED?

113
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,567
They're losers.
They sit around and get stoned

114
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,327
and talk about their hard luck.

115
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,802
She thinks anyone who smokes a joint
on the weekend is a junkie.

116
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:34,515
But apparently
her drinking is just fine.

117
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,926
- He gets uptight when I drink a little.
- A little?

118
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:39,983
Really? Is that what that was?

119
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:42,553
And I wasn't uptight,
I was disgusted.

120
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,233
The way you were...

121
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,815
Hanging on to Eric like...

122
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,945
I don't know. You should've seen her.
She was walking around,

123
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:54,870
giving toasts like
she was Marilyn Monroe or something.

124
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,625
It used to turn you on

125
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,364
that I could drink like one of the guys.

126
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,091
You used to brag that I could drink
any guy under the table

127
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,292
- in front of your friends.
- You mean my friends

128
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,589
you used to think
were such great guys?

129
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:10,939
Those friends?

130
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,129
That's what you said, right?
Remember?

131
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,314
You said it was refreshing that
they weren't

132
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,326
these pretentious windbags.

133
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,597
And they fucking worshipped you.

134
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,287
You were so flattered.

135
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:29,451
You worshipped me too.

136
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:33,893
You came home with tequila

137
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,165
and we'd get drunk
and fuck like crazy.

138
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,778
Why isn't it sexy anymore?
Tell me. What...

139
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,784
- What happened?
- I don't know,

140
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,110
but I know
that it's not sexy to drink and laugh

141
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,418
at your own jokes
like the other night.

142
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:52,342
I know that's not sexy.
That's embarrassing.

143
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,520
I just want you to know that...

144
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,433
Whenever I hear my phone ring
and I hear that <i>Godfather</i> ringtone

145
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,078
that you put in it,
I feel embarrassed.

146
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:05,497
Every time you show up
at my work dressed like that,

147
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:06,891
I feel embarrassed.

148
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,767
What's wrong with how I dress?
I can work in these.

149
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,646
Oh, yes, your work...

150
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,973
It's interesting to me
that the things that...

151
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,643
That drew you together
in the first place are the things that

152
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:26,237
seem to annoy you about each other.

153
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,227
- It's very interesting...
- One more "it's interesting,"

154
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,529
And I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking deck you, OK?

155
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:37,610
What's wrong with you?

156
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,920
What do you think happened
between the two of you?

157
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:46,330
Nothing. Let's move on.

158
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,637
All right, we'll move on.
I'll watch my step.

159
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,761
Don't be scared,
I wasn't gonna hit you.

160
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,761
Only if you say
"it's interesting" again.

161
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,956
What bugs you about that phrase?

162
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,923
Just don't tell me that
my life is so interesting to you, okay?

163
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,185
It's our life.

164
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:05,908
It's not

165
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,445
people magazine.

166
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,991
Why isn't it interesting?

167
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,303
I think what's happening to us
is very interesting.

168
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,521
Really? You're interested too?

169
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,339
Do you remember the first time
we met here? You told me that

170
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,147
your relationship began

171
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,088
with great love.

172
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,628
I mean, you both agreed on that.

173
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,581
We haven't agreed on anything since.

174
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,537
I haven't changed, that's for sure.

175
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,290
She's changed. I don't know
what she wants from me now.

176
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,606
I don't want anything from you.

177
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,733
How do you think
she's changed, Jake?

178
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,051
Seems like I'm not good enough
for her anymore.

179
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,101
Not good enough
to have a kid with her.

180
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:54,105
God, not that again, please.

181
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:55,892
Just let it be.

182
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:08,823
I remember you said that
when you saw Jake for the first time,

183
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:12,152
you thought he was sexy as hell.
I think

184
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,346
those were your exact words.

185
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,000
We...

186
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,789
We went to this club
with Nick's partner

187
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,699
and Jake was playing. He was...

188
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,512
up on the stage singing
<i>She belongs to me.</i>

189
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,703
He was beautiful.

190
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,736
And yet now, the clothes,
the music, the friends...

191
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,263
They all seem to annoy you.

192
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,316
And, Jake,
you've referred to Amy as a snob.

193
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,292
You've called her a princess.

194
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:47,534
Maybe you've both been trying
to force your perspectives

195
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:51,517
on each other all these years
and it's become a battle for control

196
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,586
And you've become so used to it,

197
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:56,886
it's become part of the dynamic of
who you are as a couple.

198
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,557
So why doesn't it work anymore?

199
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,438
Amy has a strong need
to have a career.

200
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,187
That seems to stress you out.

201
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,244
It seems to make you insecure
and you become

202
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,975
possessive, jealous.

203
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,270
That, in turn, makes Amy...

204
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,573
Secretive.

205
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:19,331
And she lies.

206
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,819
I get the feeling that
you're both tired of this battle

207
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:27,539
and that somewhere deep
down inside you want it to stop.

208
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,054
But you're afraid.

209
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,374
You're afraid to stop.

210
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,010
But I do know one thing:

211
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:38,012
there are casualties.

212
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,809
Casualties? What are you talking about?
Who's a casualty?

213
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,097
Lenny.

214
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:55,061
You two got together
while Amy was still married.

215
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,568
Is that correct?
Would you like to...

216
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,784
talk about that a little bit, Jake?

217
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,011
After...

218
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:08,690
they came to see me play, she started
taking guitar lessons from me.

219
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,218
She wanted...

220
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:13,848
to learn a few classic songs,
she said.

221
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,187
It was Nick's idea.

222
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:19,332
Yeah. You know the rich, they love
to tap into their creative side.

223
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,556
And did your ex-husband
take these lessons also?

224
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,257
Nick with a guitar?
Are you kidding me?

225
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,476
You love making fun of him.

226
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,143
You too.

227
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:39,425
Come on, it used to crack you up
when I'd talk about how uptight he was.

228
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:44,261
Do you mind me asking you,
how did your affair...

229
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:45,968
How did it begin?

230
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,949
Jake asked me to stay after the class.

231
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,788
He insisted that I stay.

232
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:56,727
Two to tango.

233
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,587
The studio was out
by gossamer road and...

234
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,755
he asked me to go
for a walk after the class.

235
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,348
There was a woman nearby
that rented horses.

236
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,070
We went riding at sunset.
It was very romantic.

237
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,313
And we stopped along this river

238
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,065
and Jake said: "Get off your horse."

239
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,484
I said: "Why?",
and he said: "Just get off, Amy."

240
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:20,114
So I did, but he stayed on his horse,
I couldn't see him

241
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,062
because the sun was
sort of blinding me. And...

242
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,455
he said, "take off your clothes."

243
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,601
And it was so sexy,
I couldn't breathe.

244
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,445
I was speechless.

245
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:35,068
But I took them off.

246
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:36,611
And...

247
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,468
he got off his horse

248
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:42,544
and he came over to me.
I could feel his breath on my face,

249
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:46,101
and I could hear the horses stamping
their feet and I just...

250
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,893
I couldn't help myself.

251
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,685
I just couldn't.

252
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:01,489
And where do I know that from?

253
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,321
Do you like it?

254
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,807
Patrick Thomas.
One of your favorites.

255
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:16,626
- You remembered it by heart?
- I embellished a little.

256
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:20,154
Shit, for a minute there
I thought that really happened.

257
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,969
What really happened, Paul, was...

258
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,305
after one of the guitar lessons

259
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,641
we went out for a drink,
got drunk and fucked in her car.

260
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,019
- That doesn't sound as romantic as...
- No, it was forbidden.

261
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,030
It was messy. And it turned me on.

262
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,716
Jake too.
he felt like he was screwing Nick.

263
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:40,092
Remember, he was screwing
a very successful lawyer.

264
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,450
- Bullshit.
- No.

265
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,060
You turned everything
into a pissing contest with him.

266
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,964
- He was rich and he was smart.
- And boring.

267
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:48,605
Don't forget that.

268
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:51,455
You said so yourself.
She punished him for boring her.

269
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,463
Did it concern you at all
that Amy was... married at the time?

270
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,824
Let's go back for a second, 'cause...

271
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:07,512
I just gotta correct something.
First of all, she made a pass at me.

272
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,745
- I made a pass at you?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:15,263
This whole stuff about I insisted
you stay at the lesson... I mean,

274
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:17,826
it's nonsense.
Okay, it was an hour lesson.

275
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,666
Three hours into it and I'm thinking:
"OK,

276
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:23,408
"this woman really wants
to learn this song,

277
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,995
"or she's into me."

278
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,608
When you got here there was a...

279
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:33,935
distance between you,
a kind of coldness. Then...

280
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,320
I had to take that phone call,
which...

281
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,057
was an emergency,

282
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,332
and it seemed like you both...

283
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:44,357
I don't know, ganged up on me.

284
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,850
Do you think the same kind
of thing happened with Nick?

285
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,750
That that's how your intimacy
was created, with a...

286
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,613
conspiracy between you?

287
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:58,089
And now that Amy is trying
to step out of the house, so to speak.

288
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,160
she's breaking up that conspiracy.

289
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,714
So that makes you uptight
and the conflict between you...

290
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:06,300
intensifies.

291
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,579
- How will it end?
- You know, ironically, sometimes,

292
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,885
ending a conflict isn't

293
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,214
the best thing for the relationship,

294
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,459
because you get so used to fighting

295
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:24,339
each other that you might
lose interest if the conflict ends.

296
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,960
I think Jake lost interest
a long time ago,

297
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,960
- the moment he had me.
- I didn't lose interest.

298
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,317
You became interested in your boss.

299
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,329
I am not interested in Ben.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,175
Now it's Ben.

301
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,363
You are such a fucking liar.

302
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,907
Don't call me a liar.

303
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,743
- But that's what you are, baby.
- And what are you?

304
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,256
Guys, we keep coming back
to the same thing.

305
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,788
No, you're a quitter.

306
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,485
He's a winner. If you had a quarter
of the strength Ben has,

307
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,397
I'd be interested in you too.

308
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,735
Where are you fucking him?

309
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,419
- You fucked him already?
- Have you fucked Simon and Eliot?

310
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,221
No, you haven't fucked him already.
But you want to, right?

311
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,158
God...

312
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:13,772
- you do. You just said you did.
- I didn't say that.

313
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,228
- You're insane.
- You did!

314
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,416
You just said if I had a quarter
of the strength Ben Reeves has,

315
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,959
you'd be interested in me too.
You said "too",

316
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,630
- that means you're interested in him.
- I didn't say that.

317
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,829
You just said...

318
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:28,188
I know it's really hard for you,
babe, but try not to fucking lie, OK?

319
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,526
- Stop calling me a liar!
- Stop lying!

320
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,074
- Stop it!
- Liar!

321
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,161
- I'm leaving.
- You are a fucking liar!

322
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,744
God damn it! Stop it!

323
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,338
Violent and a liar.

324
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,335
<i>You're a quitter. He's a winner. </i>

325
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:47,510
<i>If you had a quarter of the strength
he has, I'd be interested in you too.</i>

326
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,441
You psychopath.

327
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:20,873
Don't count on me coming home tonight.
I'm not coming back this time.

328
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,015
She's out of control.

329
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,882
I'm afraid she might hurt somebody...

330
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,588
Me, Lenny, herself.

331
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:47,981
She's like a...

332
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:52,367
Getaway driver
in a car without seat belts.

333
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:57,785
A getaway driver without seat belts?
Where did that image come from?

334
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,252
I don't know.

335
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,228
It was in this dream I had.

336
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,628
She's...

337
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,758
She's driving my car...

338
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,460
downhill very fast and we're...

339
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,479
not wearing seat belts.

340
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,858
She looks over at me...

341
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,447
and smiles.

342
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,440
But I can tell that...
she's really worried about something.

343
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,697
She tells me
that she needs hand lotion.

344
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:39,385
It's crazy,

345
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,362
but we're gonna go rob <i>Kiehl's</i>.

346
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:45,622
- What's Kiehl's?
- It's this cosmetics store

347
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,834
that makes the hand lotion
that she likes. Anyway,

348
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,900
in the dream,
I forgot to buy it for her.

349
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,167
And she had asked me
a thousand times not to forget

350
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,837
and I fucking forgot.

351
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:03,501
So we're sitting in front of this place
and she wants me to break into it.

352
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:25,989
Do you...

353
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,749
Do you think she loves me?

354
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,074
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

355
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,363
Can you just answer the question?

356
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,817
- I think she loves you.
- Yeah?

357
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:46,194
And I'm pretty sure
that you love her too, Jake.

358
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,585
What makes you say that?

359
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:57,569
Love is not the problem, Jake.

360
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:04,713
Can I ask you something?
Have you ever recorded

361
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,498
the fights
that you've had with her before?

362
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,491
- Yeah.
- You have?

363
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:13,491
And why would you do that?

364
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:20,382
I just want to understand
what's happening to us.

365
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,819
Somehow I don't think
we'll be surprising you next week.

366
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,888
Surprising me how?

367
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,604
By showing up here together.
