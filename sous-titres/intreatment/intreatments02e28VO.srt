1
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,675
Try not to break that thing.

2
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,198
- {\I'm }Surprised you didn't start without me.
- I'm surprised you're on time.

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,148
Ready for you now.
Bess and I need to talk to you alone.

4
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,792
Sure.

5
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:46,132
Oliver, you okay for a few minutes?

6
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,283
Fuck.

7
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,215
Synchro: michvanilly,
olaola, salomon.

8
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:22,951
What?

9
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,255
Don't you want to give
Paul your big news?

10
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:29,493
You're the one who's so worked up
about it. Why don't you tell him?

11
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,845
11:00 last night Bess calls me up
and tells me she's moving upstate.

12
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:37,370
I got a job offer.

13
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,095
Two weeks from now she's gonna
pack up my son and take him away.

14
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,646
It doesn't have to be like that.
I'm not kidnapping him.

15
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,594
She dumps this on me,
no chance to talk{\ about it}.

16
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,961
I tried to talk to him about it,
and he hung up on me.

17
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,958
And when I tried to call him back,
he wouldn't pick up the phone.

18
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,364
Bess, why don't you tell
me about the job offer?

19
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:59,746
While Michelle and I were on vacation,
we visited a friend of mine

20
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,985
who's a professor at Bard College.
Turns out, one of their adjuncts

21
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,051
in the art history department
is going on emergency medical leave

22
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:07,877
and they need somebody to fill in...

23
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,432
- Starting in two weeks.
- See?

24
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,865
She's known about this
for almost a month now,

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,395
but she didn't tell me 'cause
she'd {\already}made {\all }the arrangements.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,998
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure.

27
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:21,307
{\I figured, }What's the point in having a fight
if there's nothing to fight about?

28
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,637
Bess, I'm sure you might
understand how Luke

29
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,563
might feel a little
confused about this.

30
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,456
You didn't tell him
that you were seriously considering

31
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:35,395
leaving the city, and the fact
that it's going to impact upon his life,

32
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,875
but especially on Oliver's.

33
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,410
I want to know if you already
told Oliver about this.

34
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:45,664
Of course not. I wanted to discuss it
with you first. That's why I called you.

35
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,718
Truth is, I was afraid
to tell you about it,

36
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,899
because I knew you would get upset,

37
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:57,593
and then I would probably back down and
give up. And I wasn't gonna risk that.

38
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:00,723
Can I ask you why this job

39
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,099
is so important to you?

40
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,984
You don't get a chance
like this every day.

41
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,202
And in the fall they're gonna
take on another graduate fellow.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,704
If I do well, that means
I can finally finish my degree.

43
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:16,320
So you might stay up there?

44
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:19,833
Is it necessary
for you to move upstate?

45
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,891
I'm taking your advice.

46
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,954
You told me
I've been using Oliver as a way to hide,

47
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:29,088
that he's my excuse
for never finishing anything.

48
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,567
Have you considered the effect that

49
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,634
leaving the city
will have on Oliver?

50
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,590
{\I mean, }He's been through
a tremendous upheaval.

51
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,061
No, wait. Hold on a second.
This is a huge double standard.

52
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:44,063
If Luke was offered a job out of town,
would you be telling him

53
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,689
that he's got to give it up,
{\he's got to }stay home and take care of Oliver?

54
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:50,020
She's just using this job as an excuse
to take my son away from me for good.

55
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,390
- That's not what I want at all!
- Once she takes him{\ upstate},

56
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll only see him on {\the }weekends,
{\and that's }if I'm lucky.

57
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,496
- If you'd actually let me explain...
- She wants him all for herself.

58
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,948
- That's what this is really about.
- I agree with you about Oliver.

59
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,911
I think it's a mistake
to move him up there with me right now.

60
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:10,955
That's what I was trying to tell you
last night when you hung up on me.

61
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:13,861
I think Oliver should stay here

62
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:16,083
and live with you.

63
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:22,632
Live with me?

64
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,945
{\I think }It would be awful to uproot him more
than halfway through the school year.

65
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,037
Plus I don't know yet

66
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,659
if this job's going to turn
into something more permanent.

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,206
But what are you suggesting, Bess?

68
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,100
The best plan is for Oliver
to live with Luke until June.

69
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,125
Then we can figure out
the best way to proceed.

70
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,750
So you're planning to just run away
and leave him here?

71
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,674
Five minutes ago,
I was kidnapping him.

72
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,874
Now you're saying
that I'm abandoning him?

73
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,518
Maybe you can see
why Luke might be confused.

74
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,971
I mean, when you started
coming here at first,

75
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:12,478
you were nervous about letting
Oliver stay over one night.

76
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:17,205
Now, you want him to live
there until June at least.

77
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,826
I realize I've been
too possessive of Oliver.

78
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,656
And I can see now
that I've been overly critical of Luke.

79
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,526
- You finally figured that out?
- Luke, please, let's not do that.

80
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,363
What I'm trying
to say is that I think

81
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,945
the best thing for Oliver

82
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,813
is for me to step back and let him
spend some {\more }time with his father.

83
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:38,394
You're finished screwing him up,
so you're gonna dump him on me?

84
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,208
Is that what you're saying?

85
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,004
I don't get this.

86
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,802
I thought you wanted
to spend {\more }time with him.

87
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,188
Luke, I'm not sure that Bess
understands why you've had

88
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,016
such a change of heart about this.

89
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,779
It's just impossible for me
to take him on full-time right now.

90
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,569
You just spent more than two weeks
taking care of him by yourself.

91
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:59,800
Yeah, and we nearly
killed each other.

92
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,735
What are you talking about?

93
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,423
You leave the two of us alone
in the same apartment again,

94
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:07,548
by June you're gonna be dragging
our bodies out of the Hudson.

95
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:09,795
Look,

96
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:13,308
I know that you and Oliver
have had a rough couple of weeks.

97
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:18,294
But in the last few sessions didn't you
feel that we were making real progress?

98
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:24,106
It just isn't gonna happen.

99
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,440
That's completely unfair.

100
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,679
I have spent the last 12 years
of my life taking care of him

101
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,183
practically all by myself.

102
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:36,719
And now I finally have a chance
to get a life of my own going,

103
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,457
and then you say I can't do it.

104
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:41,233
All I'm saying is I can't be with him
seven days a week.

105
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,704
{\So what, }You think it's better
to just yank him out of school

106
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,106
and force him to move somewhere
where he doesn't know anyone?

107
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,181
He's miserable at his school!

108
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,542
He'd be {\much }happier starting
over someplace else.

109
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,167
No matter how difficult
things are now,

110
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,289
they will be much worse
if you force him to move away from home.

111
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:00,461
He doesn't care what Oliver needs.

112
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,183
He just doesn't want to make
things inconvenient for himself.

113
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,923
So what are we saying here...

114
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,591
that neither of you wants
to take care of Oliver right now?

115
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:27,408
Look, I know that both
of you have had

116
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:31,398
a really tough time of it lately.
It's a huge task

117
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:33,916
just taking care of yourselves.

118
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,441
But you have got to figure
out a way to look after your son.

119
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,518
I know more than anybody
how much attention he needs.

120
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:53,993
And I'm just asking for
a couple of months so that I can

121
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:58,694
- get my feet on the ground.
- I can't cut back on my hours at work.

122
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,025
{\And }I can't leave Oliver alone in the
apartment every weeknight until 10:00.

123
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,205
You need to come
to a compromise here.

124
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,216
You're both gonna
have to give up something that you want

125
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:10,091
for the sake of your son.

126
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,923
What if he lives with you
during the week,

127
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,300
then on the weekend he takes the train
into the city and stays with me?

128
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,682
He's too young to take
the train by himself.

129
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,999
Okay then,

130
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:42,062
I could come pick him up

131
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,091
and bring him back with me.

132
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,811
You know what?
I think this is a terrible idea,

133
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:55,336
taking him out of school,
moving him away from his house.

134
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,356
I can't turn down this job.

135
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,616
I've been waiting too long
for this{\a} chance{\ like this}.

136
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,416
I think Bess is right.

137
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,378
- It's the best thing we can do.
- I think it's potentially harmful.

138
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,214
It's only for a couple of months.

139
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:13,010
And if it turns out to be a disaster,
we can

140
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,538
come up with something else, right?

141
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,265
Now we've just
got to break it to the kid.

142
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:21,494
I don't think that you can
tell him just like that.

143
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:24,313
It's not the kind of decision
that you can make in 10 minutes.

144
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,357
You both have to sit
and think about this.

145
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:30,589
Otherwise, I'm telling you,
you will regret it.

146
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,714
I can't

147
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,222
take any more time. I have to tell them
today if I'm gonna take the job.

148
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,168
Then I have to pack up the house.

149
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,306
I think we should tell
him right now,

150
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,121
while we're all here.

151
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:45,667
Are you telling me
that you really can't see any other way?

152
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:03,198
Fine.

153
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,227
Come on in for a second.

154
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,138
Do I have to?

155
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:23,677
Your mom and dad want to say

156
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,299
just a couple of things to you.

157
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:31,282
- Are they still fighting?
- No, sweetie, everything is okay now.

158
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:33,465
Don't worry{\, kiddo}.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

159
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,694
You want to take a seat?

160
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:54,749
So

161
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,539
is there anything
you'd like to say to Oliver?

162
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:04,015
Actually,
we have some really good news.

163
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:09,173
While Michelle and I were on vacation,
we ran into this old friend of mine,

164
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,715
and he offered me a job.

165
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,814
Is that why you were gone so long?

166
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,143
Partly.

167
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,815
Anyway, it's a really excellent job.

168
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,460
I'm going to be teaching
at this school called Bard College.

169
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:27,311
It's only 2 1/2 hours
north of the city.

170
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,695
You're moving away from Brooklyn?

171
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:33,150
Well, that's the exciting part,
because you and I...

172
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,590
are gonna live up there together,

173
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,340
at least for a few months, and,

174
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,465
if we both like it,
we might even decide to stay.

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,760
They already have
a really nice apartment for us.

176
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:52,002
It's on the edge of this beautiful,
beautiful forest.

177
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:55,985
- Where am I gonna go to school?
- Up there.

178
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,175
You'll be able to make new friends.

179
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:03,145
I know how much you hate the school
you're at now, so...

180
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,415
it'll be a fresh start.

181
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,695
What's gonna happen
to our real apartment?

182
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:21,039
{\Well, }That's actually something your father
and I haven't discussed yet, but...

183
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:22,655
My guess is...

184
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,010
we'll sublet it for the time being.

185
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,585
Is someone else
gonna live in my room?

186
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:31,195
Maybe, but only for a few months.

187
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,125
What about all my stuff?

188
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,131
You'll take some of it upstate

189
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:41,179
and leave some with me,

190
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,205
and we'll put the rest in storage.

191
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,605
Everything will be safe.

192
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,775
Where are you gonna be?

193
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:51,645
I'm staying here.

194
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,800
But I'll come visit.

195
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:56,225
Or I'll come pick you up

196
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,985
and we'll spend weekends
in the city.

197
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:05,617
What would you like to say

198
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,055
to your mom and dad?

199
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:09,885
I don't wanna go!

200
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,542
Listen, kiddo,

201
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,971
I know this is a lot to ask,
and I know we've asked a lot already,

202
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:22,175
but this is the way
it has to be right now.

203
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,990
- You don't care what I think?
- {\Baby, }Of course we care what you think,

204
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:29,215
and I know this has been
really really hard on you,

205
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,650
but this is
the best possible solution.

206
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,275
I don't wanna leave.

207
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,899
This is an awful lot
for you to take in,

208
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,205
but I think it's important

209
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,489
that you tell us what you need.

210
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:47,524
I don't wanna go!
Tell them they can't do this!

211
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,119
I knew this was an awful idea.

212
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,290
If you would {\just }move back to Brooklyn,
{\then }he could go to his real school,

213
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,665
{\and }stay in his real house.

214
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:56,485
Move back into our {\old }apartment?
What {\the hell }are you trying to do{\ to me}?

215
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,254
I hate staying with dad.
I won't stay with dad.

216
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,062
{\*Baby, }I know you {\guys }don't always get along,
but you {\*certainly }don't hate each other.

217
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,134
He yells at me.
He gets drunk.

218
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,344
I don't want to stay with him.

219
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,641
You get drunk
while he's staying with you?

220
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,165
That's why he can't live with me.
It's all a fucking train wreck.

221
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,352
So what{\ then}? I {\just }have to give up everything
that's important {\to me }because you can't be

222
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,646
- a {\fucking }responsible father for two seconds?
- Stop it!

223
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,245
Enough! That's it.

224
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,100
No more fighting.

225
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,525
You've got to take care of this kid.

226
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:27,235
Of course. Oliver,

227
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,118
you know that we love you
very very much.

228
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,621
Don't worry{\, kiddo}. This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

229
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
Fuck you! Fuck you!

230
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,100
Oliver, can we come inside
and try to talk about this?

231
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,225
I don't wanna talk to anybody.

232
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,332
Oliver, I know you're upset.

233
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:21,586
Let's go back to the office and
we can talk everything through, okay?

234
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,341
I need to ask you something first.

235
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:27,995
Sure. Sure.

236
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,455
Alone.

237
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:38,204
At least put your jacket on
for me, okay?

238
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:48,035
Your dad and I will be right
over there if you wanna talk.

239
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,757
So what do you want to talk about?

240
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,635
Where am I gonna live?

241
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:17,805
That's a good question.

242
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,275
It doesn't matter.

243
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,189
My mom and dad don't want me.

244
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:26,345
That's not how they really feel.

245
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:31,978
Just because they're not
married anymore doesn't mean

246
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:34,635
they're gonna stop
being your parents.

247
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,195
If I was gone,

248
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,208
my mom could go away

249
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:44,455
and start her new job,

250
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,165
my dad could live alone.

251
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,535
Everybody would be happy.

252
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:55,025
Your mom and dad,
they're frustrated right now. They're...

253
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,415
Yeah, they're angry.

254
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,185
And they're going through...

255
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:02,865
a tough time.

256
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,535
But you've got to remember
they still love you

257
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,315
very much.

258
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,975
Do you know that?

259
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,945
I'll tell you what.
Let's try an experiment.

260
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:19,530
Let's try and think of all the things
that make you happy,

261
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:23,255
all the things
that make you comfortable.

262
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,055
I'm comfortable in your office.

263
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:27,796
{\Well, }I'm glad to hear that.

264
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:31,174
What is it about my office
that makes you comfortable?

265
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,344
I like talking to you.

266
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,095
And I like talking to you too.

267
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:47,899
Can I come live with you?

268
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,965
You know, Oliver,
that sounds like a really...

269
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:04,230
a really good idea, but I...

270
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:07,419
Remember you made me a sandwich
and you took care of my turtle?

271
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,165
Look,

272
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,255
we have a good time together.

273
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:15,245
But...

274
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:19,097
You can't come and live with me.

275
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:20,700
I'd be at school all day.

276
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,810
And my school is really close
to your office. It'd be fun.

277
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,970
I know, it would be fun
for me too, but...

278
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:29,445
I don't even need my own bed.
I can sleep on your couch.

279
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,705
But you have parents of your own,

280
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,825
and they love you,

281
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,715
and they want you to be with them.

282
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:43,840
But I like you better.

283
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,499
I can never take
the place of your parents.

284
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,050
But you can come visit me
anytime at my office. Anytime.

285
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,672
And you can talk about
whatever you want to.

286
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,160
You know last week
when I ran away from school?

287
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,055
I came to your office instead of
going to my mom's or my dad's.

288
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,675
I didn't want to see them.
I wanted to see you.

289
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,525
That's because

290
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:11,055
you and I are friends.

291
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,543
If you were {\really }my friend,
you'd let me come live with you.

292
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:16,685
Oliver, I promise you
I will always be your friend.

293
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,185
And...

294
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:28,575
- You don't want me either.
- That's not true.

295
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,495
Look,

296
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:36,235
I know that...
I know that this is really...

297
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,485
upsetting for you.

298
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:40,136
It was a stupid idea.

299
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,945
Actually, it was a really cool idea.

300
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:49,295
And it makes me very happy
that you're comfortable talking to me.

301
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:52,482
You can't help me.

302
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,095
Would you at least let me try?

303
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,515
I don't need any help.

304
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:58,715
You know,

305
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,715
everybody...

306
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:04,410
everybody needs help
some time in their lives.

307
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,205
I understand.

308
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,501
I just want you to know that...

309
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,895
whenever you need
to talk to me, I'm here.

310
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,815
You want me to tell your mom and dad
you're ready to go?

311
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:44,125
I can do it myself.
I don't want you to come with me.

312
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:45,955
Are you sure?

313
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,325
I don't care.

314
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:50,425
I'm moving next week
and I'm never gonna see you again.

315
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,275
I'm sorry.
