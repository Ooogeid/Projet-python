1
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:53,827
Hello, Mia.

2
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,769
Paul, are you all right?

3
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:59,434
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

4
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:04,540
I'm so sorry about your father.

5
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,587
Uh, thank you.

6
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,298
In Treatment - Mia -
Season 2 - Episode 21

7
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,332
I found out from Ellis at work.

8
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,595
- How are you?
- I'm... I'm fine.

9
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,271
You can't really be fine.

10
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,068
I know that I'm not supposed
to talk to your lawyer,

11
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:53,493
but you never canceled on me before.

12
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,331
Some things are bigger
than protocol, aren't they?

13
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,357
I mean, life and death,

14
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,158
and losing a father.

15
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Paul?

16
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,791
Sorry.

17
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,506
It's ironic that we were talking
about your father last session.

18
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,588
I've thought about that.

19
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,792
You know, the strange thing is
I haven't spoken to him since then.

20
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,719
But I can't imagine
what I would do if...

21
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,534
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,106
This is not about me today.

23
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:37,526
Did you get my card?

24
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,354
I stood in that store forever

25
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,106
trying to pick it out, you know?
What kind of picture?

26
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,743
What kind of message?

27
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,818
What did you think?

28
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,788
I haven't read it yet.

29
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,612
Because I sent it?

30
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:59,985
You were away all last week
and you haven't opened your mail?

31
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,760
That's not a good sign.

32
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,673
Sounds like you're worried about me.

33
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,360
You do look tired

34
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,142
and you're not wearing a jacket.

35
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,481
Are you sleeping?

36
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
- Are you eating?
- No, I'm fine.

37
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,995
You said that before.

38
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,054
I know that you have to be
the neutral shrink,

39
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:27,766
but, you know, this is a relationship
of a sort, isn't it?

40
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:29,655
Yes, it is.

41
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,630
I appreciate your sympathy.

42
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,869
Granted, I am not the first person
you would reach out to.

43
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,985
Our last couple of sessions,
I have been...

44
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,512
A challenge to put it mildly.

45
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,737
But I was concerned.

46
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,599
I wondered who do you have?

47
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,279
I don't know if you're close to your ex.
I assume your kids are with her.

48
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,231
You haven't been in New York that long
and it's hard to find friends.

49
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,695
Well, are you worried I'm lonely?

50
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,927
No offense,
but I can see it in your face.

51
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:14,419
Is it possible
that you're afraid I'm not ready

52
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,078
to give you my full attention today?

53
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,512
No, that's not it.
I mean, this is me being caring.

54
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:24,187
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, of course it is.

55
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,095
It's not what you...

56
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,335
Look, you don't have to worry

57
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,641
- about my feelings.
- Does anybody?

58
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:36,311
Would you rather
I yell at you for canceling?

59
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,679
Are you saying you felt
like yelling when I canceled?

60
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:42,067
- It was fine.
- No other reaction?

61
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,717
- I got over it.
- Before or after you had seen Ellis?

62
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,419
Okay, true, I went to Ellis.

63
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,925
Also true I was a little upset...

64
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,500
more than a little.

65
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,863
And then I felt like a jerk
when I found out why you had canceled.

66
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,194
But that was last week,

67
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,176
and now everything's changed.

68
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:10,397
Why is that?

69
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,020
Because I'm pregnant.

70
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,111
Oh, that's...

71
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:30,783
... that's really...

72
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,814
big news.

73
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:34,921
No kidding.

74
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,233
Are you surprised?

75
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,465
Me too,

76
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,066
especially with my F.S.H. levels.

77
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,414
It's strange timing with us...

78
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:54,640
life and death.

79
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,742
Do you wanna have the session
out in the snow? I mean...

80
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,057
Sorry. You were
telling me about your...

81
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,328
F.S.H. levels.

82
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,144
No, we were past that.

83
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,468
I was talking about our timing.

84
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,469
20 years ago you were having
your first child and I was losing mine.

85
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,189
So have you been
thinking about that time?

86
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:39,095
It's different this time.
I know everybody says

87
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,609
you get pregnant and everything
changes, but it's really true.

88
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,566
My body feels totally different.

89
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,241
I've stopped smoking.

90
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,921
There's this preschool on my block

91
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,296
that I always avoid because it's...

92
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:57,006
moms with their humvee
strollers blocking everyone,

93
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:00,813
like they're privileged
because they procreated.

94
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,333
Now I just walk through smiling.

95
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:07,066
So you went from jealousy

96
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:10,031
to feeling like part of the club.

97
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,112
At work, Bennett...

98
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,464
who's leaving friday, finally...

99
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,177
he had asked me to
take over this big case,

100
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:21,078
assuming that I would just
crush the other side as usual.

101
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:24,266
But I took one look at the poor family
and I cut a deal.

102
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,591
He was pissed.

103
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:30,770
You're sure you're not trying
to punish Bennett?

104
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,658
He's marrying stefanie.

105
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:34,733
That'll be punishment enough.

106
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,658
I feel bad for their kid, you know?

107
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:39,833
I mean, he's a double adulterer
and she's a bimbo.

108
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:45,042
- Why are we talking about Bennett?
- Well, you brought him up.

109
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,310
And he is somebody
that you did want to have a child with.

110
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,080
It's... it's not his.

111
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:51,896
I did the math.

112
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,846
Still, it's interesting
that you found out that Bennett

113
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:58,621
was having a baby and a couple
of weeks later you're pregnant.

114
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,767
Are you saying
that I'm competing with Bennett?

115
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,377
- That's what you think I think?
- "that's what you think I think"?

116
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,472
Paul, I'm having a baby
because I went on a sex spree

117
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,762
that weekend
without using protection.

118
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:15,864
Maybe that wasn't the smartest thing
but maybe it was.

119
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,633
So maybe
you weren't just being reckless.

120
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,456
I figure it was guitar boy

121
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:28,211
and not the middle-aged cop,
which is good,

122
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:32,297
because there won't be any paternity
issues if I decide not to tell.

123
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:35,523
Guitar boy doesn't even have
my number or my last name.

124
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,261
So you don't want him involved?

125
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,848
I know the baby needs a father,
but not one like that.

126
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:50,503
Does this silence
mean you're appalled?

127
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,768
Hey, I'm pregnant.

128
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,617
I thought that

129
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,867
you would be happy,

130
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:02,832
that we'd celebrate.

131
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:06,440
This is really bad timing. I know.

132
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,796
What would you like me to say, Mia?

133
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,634
"Wow, Mia!
That's amazing!

134
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:20,677
You came saying you wanted a family,
a child,

135
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:22,806
and then you got it.
Congratulations."

136
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,309
In other words, you had a problem
and now you have a solution?

137
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:28,812
- Well, can't that happen ever?
- Of course. It sounds ideal.

138
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,011
- What else would you like to hear{\from me}?
- This game again?

139
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,136
How about

140
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,347
"don't worry.

141
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,404
You're going to be a good mom
and I'll be there for you."

142
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,574
Could you tell me what that means,
"i'll be there for you"?

143
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:42,492
I have major decisions to make.

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,619
Like what?

145
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:47,677
Like do I need a doula?
Should I have genetic testing?

146
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,416
Will my apartment be big enough?

147
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,375
And you want me to help you
with this{\those decisions}?

148
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,036
How much time should I take off?

149
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,776
Or should I just quit
and move to the country?

150
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,863
These are all big questions.

151
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:00,992
Your sisters have children.
Have you spoken to them?

152
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,617
They're busy with their own kids.
And my mother? Forget it.

153
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,761
And my dad,
he loves his grandchildren, but

154
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,970
he doesn't do anything.

155
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,251
He just lets them admire him.

156
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,018
You sound sure that your mother
wouldn't want to help you,

157
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,615
- but she did with your sisters.
- That's different...

158
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,170
they're younger, they're married...

159
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,692
And she actually likes them.

160
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,279
And she doesn't like you?

161
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,458
For me she was less
of a mom and more of

162
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:32,776
a vase...

163
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,175
beautiful, but hard to the touch.

164
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,173
- That's a very powerful image.
- She was beautiful

165
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,427
until I ruined her figure.

166
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,135
Oh yes... her mantra.

167
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,930
Has that been on
your mind this week?

168
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:49,851
I've always kept in shape. I think men
like that and now that'll all go.

169
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,105
I hear your feet get bigger.
I hate big feet.

170
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:55,670
Not to mention what birth does to

171
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,045
sex.

172
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:00,451
I mean, you've been there.

173
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,874
It stretches, right?

174
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,731
The size of a baby's head

175
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:10,279
compared to the size of a penis?
That can't be good.

176
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,248
And the man thing is over, isn't it?

177
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,573
Guys my age, they have grown kids.

178
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,296
They don't want to change
diapers again. I mean, would you?

179
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,641
What... what are you asking me?

180
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:24,176
Come on, Paul,
just answer my question.

181
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:27,955
If someone like me would be
attracted to a woman like you?

182
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,976
We've already done that.
I get it... we're not a couple.

183
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:34,312
I'm saying hypothetically

184
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,584
if I got fat, emotional...

185
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,407
more emotional...

186
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,406
- if I had to cater to an infant...
- I don't think that rules out all men.

187
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:47,451
So I could still get the drooling
guy on the back of the 6 train?

188
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:52,141
I mean, look, having a child can
ruin even a good relationship.

189
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,418
Is that what happened to you?

190
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,483
Your wife did all the child-rearing

191
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,756
while you sat in that chair{\listening to people's problems}?

192
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,427
She actually dealt with people's
problems? It must've pissed her off.

193
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,962
Obviously, something did.

194
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:16,096
But I'd rather talk about
your anger than my ex-wife's.

195
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:18,037
Fair enough.

196
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,322
Who... whose are those?

197
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,228
Yours or your kids?

198
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:34,378
And why are they in here?

199
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,673
Are you this responsive
with your kids

200
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,419
or are you different as a dad?

201
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,403
Okay, great. You're bored?
You're annoyed?

202
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,618
You can't wait
till I get out of here?

203
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:54,976
And we're back to your default...
that I want to kick you out.

204
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,669
You did just look at your watch.
You have never done that.

205
00:14:57,794 --> 00:15:00,180
- I've never worn a watch before.
- That is not the point.

206
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,255
I am right.
You should not be working this week.

207
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:04,696
I'm fine, Mia.

208
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,572
If I said "i'm fine" four times,
you would be all over me.

209
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,284
You're not even in the room,
emotionally. Admit it.

210
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,548
Why did you look at your watch?

211
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,387
It's my father's watch.

212
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,417
I'm sorry. I must have glanced
without meaning to

213
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,931
when you mentioned the word "dad."

214
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,712
It's not even ticking.

215
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,674
Time stops when I'm here.

216
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,807
If I wasn't pregnant, we could
call it a day and goo a bar.

217
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:38,701
That would be better for both of us.

218
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:42,467
Is this the bar in soho where you
hoped we'd run into each other?

219
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:45,735
Yeah, although this time
we could act like we'd just met.

220
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,501
As in "hello, is this seat taken?"

221
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,997
Right. And I'd say, "No, hi,

222
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:55,203
I just found out I'm pregnant after
a binge weekend of anonymous sex."

223
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:58,707
And you would say
"my father just died." Then

224
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,334
we'd get plastered and fly
to vegas and get married.

225
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:02,812
And then what?

226
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,019
You know me, I'd fuck it up.
But it was fun, wasn't it?

227
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:09,134
I can see how we both could think
it would solve our problems.

228
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:10,844
Don't go overboard.

229
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,184
Mia, I think there's
two issues here:

230
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:18,725
one, your feelings
about the pregnancy;

231
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,787
two, your feelings about
not having a partner.

232
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,361
And it could be that they're...

233
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:26,222
Intertwined.

234
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,994
I mean, you've said a few times
that it feels like

235
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,907
I'm not in the room today.

236
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:35,507
You mentioned you're worried that
having a baby is gonna make you feel

237
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:37,910
less physically attractive.

238
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,711
Is it that you're afraid
that no one will be there for you

239
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,362
if you have a child?

240
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,742
Well, I will be a single mom.

241
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,765
That's... harder.

242
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,953
Yes.
It can be.

243
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,385
And okay, I admit it isn't
my first choice

244
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,755
but I can't have my first choice.

245
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,587
This is what I have.

246
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,022
It's not picture perfect.

247
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,997
And what's picture perfect?

248
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:04,555
Me, a baby and a man.

249
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,450
And what kind of man?

250
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,105
- What? I don't know.
- No idea?

251
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,199
That's not the point.
Why aren't you encouraging me?

252
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,869
You're in the mood to celebrate and you
feel that I'm not joining in that.

253
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,886
No, I think that you think
that I'm too fucked up,

254
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:25,509
that I'll be miserable
- and a disaster.

255
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,275
You know that's not what I said.

256
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,024
Never mind. I will call guitar boy.
I'm sure he'll take full responsibility.

257
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,631
Or... or I'll just do it all
on my own.

258
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,611
I'll quit my job, I'll gain 100 lbs

259
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:38,523
and I'm sure I'll still be as good
as my mom except that

260
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,058
this baby won't have a dad.

261
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,685
Why don't you just take a breath?

262
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,145
God, I need to smoke.
Oh. You won't let me.

263
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:47,232
I thought you had quit
because you're pregnant.

264
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,356
One cigarette isn't going to do
any harm.

265
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:50,748
I'd rather you didn't.

266
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:52,335
I'm in withdrawal, okay?

267
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,160
I think you're agitated.

268
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,105
Why do people have children anyhow?

269
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,904
They want little versions
of themselves

270
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,129
to gaze up and say "i love you"?

271
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,088
They want to relive
their own childhoods?

272
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,963
That... that is the last thing
I want to do.

273
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,808
The truth is I like visiting
my nieces,

274
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,927
but I cannot wait to get home.

275
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,721
You don't give me that sense.

276
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,474
What was I thinking,
sleeping around like that?

277
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,699
If I had wanted a child,
I would've had one by now.

278
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:27,492
Maybe I should give it up
for adoption.

279
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:32,357
You don't want to have the baby?

280
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:35,886
I'm just...

281
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:40,512
Go on, Mia.
Just talk through it.

282
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,535
Tell me what you're feeling.
It's okay.

283
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,652
- These feelings.
- Shut up. It's not okay.

284
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:48,752
This isn't just my feelings.
This is it,

285
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
right?

286
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,295
This is my last chance...

287
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,834
And I'm... I'm too scared?

288
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,800
This sounds very similar to what
you were saying 20 years ago.

289
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,142
You're right.

290
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:11,012
This is just how it felt
back then, isn't it?

291
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:16,790
I didn't want to have a baby.
I wanted to have an abortion.

292
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,997
And is that what you want to do now?

293
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,632
No. I don't know.

294
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:30,605
I mean, come on, Paul.

295
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,330
We both know I'm...

296
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,088
I shouldn't go through with this.

297
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:38,862
Mia, look, I understand
that you may be feeling just...

298
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,597
overwhelmed right now...

299
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,770
Yeah, you think?

300
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,619
But you are in a very different place
than you were back then.

301
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:47,734
Some of your concerns are...
they're practical.

302
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,562
You can handle them now.

303
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,422
You know how to hire a nanny,
how to buy a bigger apartment,

304
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:54,184
how to make a living.

305
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,309
But maybe the real question is

306
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,199
do you want to raise a child

307
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:04,278
if you have to do it on your own?

308
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,726
Will you help me?

309
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,750
I... I can help you
as your therapist.

310
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,636
Well, I know, but I've never been
a mother - and you're the father.

311
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,245
I'm the father?

312
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:26,812
N... no, I misspoke.

313
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,293
You're not the father.

314
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:30,411
You're a father.

315
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:33,236
Nevertheless, you did want us
to celebrate,

316
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:37,245
you asked if I would stick with you
if you were pregnant

317
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,446
and then you imagined how
we might run away and get married.

318
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,593
So if you're creating
a new family, Mia,

319
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:47,252
it's possible that you'd like me
to be there...

320
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,539
in the picture or in the room.

321
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:54,564
And here we are.

322
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,717
And now I just want you
to tell me that

323
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:05,667
having a baby means I won't be
alone for the rest of my life.

324
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:10,956
Actually, I can tell you that in
my experience at times it feels like

325
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,169
when you have a child,
you'll never be alone again,

326
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:15,982
or even have a moment to yourself.

327
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:24,952
Who... who else have you told
about the pregnancy?

328
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,136
This time?

329
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,136
No one.

330
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,430
Even after you took the test?

331
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,479
I think you're right, Paul.
I do want to pull you in.

332
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,870
Of course, you know I...

333
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:50,557
I'm scared. I'm worried about
doing it on my own.

334
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:58,512
But I heard what you said. I'm not
the same person I was 20 years ago.

335
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,612
There's just this new life.

336
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,500
I can feel it.

337
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:15,984
And this time I want it.

338
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:21,221
You really do.

339
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:30,204
And I'll try my best to be
a good mother...

340
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,975
Even if I'm afraid and even if
it's just me.

341
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:47,282
I think maybe this is
a good place to stop.

342
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,253
Wow, that went fast.

343
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:51,478
It's okay.

344
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,240
I'd better get going.

345
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,268
The subways are going to be
all screwed up.

346
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:00,514
But you... you should take
the rest of the day off...

347
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,058
a snow day.

348
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:04,502
Go for a walk in the park.

349
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:06,815
Eat something.

350
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:08,935
Thank you.

351
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,328
And, Paul...

352
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,774
Please be happy for me.
