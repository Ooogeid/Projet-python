2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:07,305
I'm trying to make this work.
I want to make this work.

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,097
You don't know anything.
You don't know me at all.

4
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,510
- I've done terrible things.
- It was an acc...

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,186
Really terrible things.
I had sex with Ben!

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,867
My worst nightmare, it's happened

7
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:25,367
and I feel like this huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

8
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:28,657
You said that after your father died,
your mother never forgave you.

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,100
Maybe you've never
forgiven yourself, Amy.

10
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:34,455
Maybe you feel that if you
degrade yourself enough,

11
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:36,964
some day somebody will forgive you.

12
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:40,514
What do you see in me?

13
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:43,667
How could you possibly be with me?

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,746
I loved you.

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:48,751
"Loved"?

16
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,068
Max, don't dump that stuff
on the staircase.

17
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,026
And call Devinn and get that
reading assignment, OK?

18
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,581
Hey, how do you do?

19
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,058
Good. They're a pretty good team.

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,758
I'm glad you went.

21
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,356
It was fun.

22
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:20,502
Could you close the door, please?
I wanna talk to you about something.

23
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,434
I left Gina a message today and...

24
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,568
I told her that...

25
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:41,548
I won't be going back
to therapy anymore.

26
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,820
You and I, we can go
back and forth forever about...

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,970
where our problem started...

28
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:53,571
Who did what to whom,
who's more to blame.

29
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,052
I can't do that anymore.

30
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:58,969
I need to figure...

31
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,625
this out,

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,710
and I think I need to do that
on my own.

33
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,504
I'm really happy
that you're seeing Gina.

34
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:29,180
And I really hope it can help you.

Sync by Anyone, Lemonhead,
michvanilly, salomon.

38
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:11,154
- Is Amy joining us today?
- I don't think so.

39
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,005
So what's been up with you, Jake?

40
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:23,130
It's been a pretty weird week
since we saw you last, Paul.

41
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,862
Very quiet around the house.
Awkward.

42
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,465
We barely speak to each other
except when Lenny's around,

43
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:34,166
who somehow seems
really relaxed and at ease.

44
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,794
He's such a funny kid.
Man, I wish you could meet him.

45
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:43,265
He was telling us this joke
the other day about these...

46
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,215
These two cannibals

47
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:46,702
that eat a clown.

48
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:50,106
And one cannibal turns
to the other and says:

49
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,612
"Does this taste funny to you?"

50
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,102
Anyway, Amy and I are laughing
despite ourselves.

51
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,765
It was very surreal.

52
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:07,085
Kids tend to do that
when they sense tension.

53
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,126
They try to get the parents
to come together.

54
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,465
You're probably right, but he shouldn't
have to do it. It's not fair.

55
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,646
You're right. It's not fair.

56
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,094
Amy's been trying
to reach out to me this week...

57
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:28,954
You know, make it all OK,

58
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,942
the whole Ben thing, but how can you
make up for something like that?

59
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:36,255
To tell you the truth, it's pretty sad
watching her try.

60
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,464
When Lenny fell asleep the other night,

61
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,502
she ran around the house,
pretending to be busy with house shit,

62
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:46,065
which she never does. Not saying
anything, just trying to run into me.

63
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,168
And at one point we were
pretty close together in the kitchen,

64
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,838
she tried to kiss me...

65
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,760
And I just...

66
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,476
What?

67
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,028
Just couldn't do it.

68
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,766
I wasn't into it.
My heart wasn't there.

69
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:12,275
It can be hard
to relate to somebody...

70
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,279
- After something like an affair.
- You're telling me.

71
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:18,754
Bizarre.

72
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,900
Late that night, she had...

73
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,446
fallen asleep
watching TV and I just...

74
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:30,043
I just stood there looking at her.

75
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,966
How did you feel?

76
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,018
She sleeps with her both hands

77
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,368
tucked under her cheek
like in those kid books.

78
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,514
You know, the way they draw
the angels sleeping.

79
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:49,478
She didn't look like a woman
who had just fucked some other guy.

80
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,651
She looked really beautiful.

81
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:58,274
And I was thinking
how easy it would be to just...

82
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,919
go lay down next to her
and put my arms around her.

83
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:03,986
But you didn't.

84
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,992
No, I couldn't.

85
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:10,617
I just remembered how easily
she could chip away at me

86
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,204
and lure me back in.

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,504
So I jumped in my car
and I got the fuck out of there.

88
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:18,581
- In the middle of the night?
- That's right.

89
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,084
- Where'd you go?
- First, at Elliot's,

90
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:25,957
but then I remembered he had a date.
I didn't want to walk in on anything.

91
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:30,073
It's been about 6 years since the guy
got laid, so I just kept driving

92
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,631
and I ended up at my parents' house.

93
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,397
The kicker is they live about
four hours away in Virginia.

94
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,424
And it was too early
when I arrived to ring the doorbell,

95
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:44,522
so I just sat out front in my car
and fell asleep.

96
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,278
How often do you
see them, your parents?

97
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:52,035
Mom comes into town to see Lenny pretty
frequently every couple of months.

98
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:55,559
Maybe we go out there for the holidays
a couple of times a year, not much more.

99
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,546
And is your father close to Lenny?

100
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,685
Is my father close to Lenny?
That's a good question.

101
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,765
I think so. They spend time together,
Lenny likes him.

102
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,258
But it always feels finite.

103
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,401
I can't help but get the feeling
that he leaves him hanging,

104
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,277
like he's just spent a few minutes

105
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,512
with the neighbor's grandchild
and now it's time to move on.

106
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:17,941
Of course, my dad, being the narcissist
that he is, is oblivious to it.

107
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:20,471
Has Lenny said anything
to you about it?

108
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:25,982
No. He seems fine with it, so who knows?
Maybe I'm just seeing things.

109
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:34,356
I was asleep in the car
outside their house,

110
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,983
and all of a sudden there's this knock
on the window and its wake me up.

111
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:40,133
And it's a cop.

112
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,251
And who's the cop?

113
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,480
Mike Garnett.

114
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:48,051
Went to school with me, wanted to be
a cop since the 1st grade

115
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,723
and now that's what he is.

116
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,476
It's really funny.
He fulfilled his childhood dream.

117
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,411
I don't think I know anyone
who became

118
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,522
what they wanted to be
when they were a kid.

119
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,510
When I was growing up,
in the wintertime, there was this guy

120
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:06,430
and he would come over with
his chainsaw, swing from tree to tree

121
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,427
cutting branches
before they froze and fell off

122
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:11,754
like a fucking monkey.
It was unbelievable.

123
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,159
And he was the only guy I knew

124
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:17,524
who my father didn't tell
how to do his job.

125
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,003
That's who I wanted to be.

126
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,821
The old man, he's such a know-it-all.

127
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,916
The funny part is though,
he does know it all.

128
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,010
He can tell you the exchange rate
for a Guyanese dollar,

129
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,658
how to cook a freshwater salmon
in a clay oven,

130
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,879
or the history of the silk worm.

131
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,532
- Does he write encyclopedias?
- You'd think, right?

132
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,773
No, he's a college professor.

133
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:55,144
My mom too. Intellectuals.
Big readers, unlike me. I don't read.

134
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:58,424
I don't think I've read a book
since I left high school.

135
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,170
Does that mean
you don't or you won't?

136
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,024
- I haven't.
- Really?

137
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,745
I remember once I misquoted
Roland Barthes

138
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,756
and you corrected me.

139
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:13,252
Where did that come from?

140
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,762
I grew up in a house where everyone
was reading at dinner.

141
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:17,215
That shit was everywhere.

142
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:20,102
Any parrot could pick it up
and spit it back verbatim.

143
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,466
That's what happens when your dad is
an emeritus professor

144
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:24,884
of Renaissance studies

145
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:28,220
and your mother teaches classics...
Greek and Hebrew.

146
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,551
But I don't read.

147
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,201
I mean not literally.
Obviously I read.

148
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:36,262
I read music, manuals, headlines,

149
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:37,570
but I just...

150
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:39,938
I don't know.

151
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,172
I'm not like them.

152
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,470
I do kick ass
at crossword puzzles though.

153
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:52,578
- You do those?
- I'm not very good.

154
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,476
Sunday New York Times
crossword does me in every week.

155
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,092
It's a tough one.

156
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:03,223
To do crossword puzzles,
you need to have

157
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,666
an extensive vocabulary, no?

158
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,939
It's kinda hard to reconcile the idea
of somebody who doesn't read

159
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,339
with somebody who's really good
at crossword puzzles.

160
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,755
There's nothing to reconcile.
I'm good at it

161
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,265
and reading makes me
restless and bored.

162
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:20,665
So did you acquire your love
of crossword puzzles from your parents?

163
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:23,150
Not really.
My mom's all right at them.

164
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:25,525
My dad sucks.

165
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,054
What did you do as a kid when
everybody else was doing all this...

166
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,221
reading?

167
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:37,222
I don't know. Play guitar,

168
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:40,435
collect baseball cards, smoke pot.

169
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,345
Did that get you into trouble?

170
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:45,774
- Not really. Nobody noticed.
- Nobody noticed that you got high?

171
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:51,112
- So who were you getting high with?
- Myself mostly.

172
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,535
So would you say
that you had a lonely childhood?

173
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:58,436
Nah. Why?

174
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,741
It was okay.
I talked to myself a lot.

175
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:08,219
You know what one of
my favorite things in the world is?

176
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:10,465
Talking to Lenny.

177
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,260
And we talk about anything
but mainly,

178
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:15,087
we talk about sports.

179
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,389
And he can just go off.

180
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,183
Aluminum bats versus wood...

181
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:23,835
Fuck, anything.
That kid has a brain like a computer.

182
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,045
He's not even 10
and he can list off

183
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,510
all of Boog Powell's stats
from the 1970 world series.

184
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:33,804
That's just amazing to me.

185
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:36,441
I never get tired of hearing
that little fucker talk.

186
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,745
You get like that with your kids?

187
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:43,359
Not so much anymore
because they're older,

188
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,414
but with my youngest,
yeah, I still do.

189
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,862
- And how old is he?
- He's nine.

190
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,246
Just like Lenny.

191
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,455
Did you have that kind of relationship
with your father as a kid?

192
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:56,361
No, I avoided talking to my father
when I was a kid.

193
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,803
It just wasn't worth it.

194
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:03,115
He was the kind of guy who would wince
if you said sure instead of surely.

195
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,147
Did you find it easier
to talk to your mom?

196
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:09,452
She wasn't as bad,
but what was frustrating was...

197
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,592
she would always defer to him
on everything.

198
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,923
It's like she saw him
as this hotshot professor

199
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,553
at another level from everyone.

200
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,200
He got tenure at 33
and it just wouldn't occur to her

201
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:22,013
that she could have an opinion
different from his... <i>than</i> his.

202
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,925
If you were him, you would have just
corrected me on my grammar.

203
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,312
<i>If you were he.</i>

204
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,187
Hey, they didn't beat me, right?

205
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,032
- It could've been a lot worse.
- That's true. It doesn't...

206
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,847
It doesn't mean it wasn't difficult.

207
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,315
So when did you start to write?

208
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,876
I don't write.
My brother Nathan is the writer.

209
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,022
He's a novelist. He was just shortlisted
for some prize last year,

210
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:50,589
some big national award.

211
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,416
I can't even remember the name.
I'm sure my parents remember it.

212
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:54,987
But you're a writer too.

213
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:57,822
Or don't you consider
songwriting to be writing?

214
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,317
No, sure, I do.

215
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:04,055
Some of my favorite writers
are actually songwriters,

216
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:06,684
people like Dylan, Cohen,
John Lennon.

217
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:09,318
Hey, I agree with you, Paul.
I would put Dylan on par

218
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:12,425
with Walt Whitman, Ezra Pound,
Langston Hughes.

219
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,375
Just try telling that to my family.

220
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,283
You know, for somebody
who is not a great reader,

221
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:21,415
you seem to be pretty familiar
with great poets.

222
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,349
Nobody's really familiar with Pound.
They just fake it.

223
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:30,352
But I get the feeling
you like to play down

224
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,995
your knowledge, your intelligence.

225
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,851
I don't know.
It's just my folks' world.

226
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,173
I guess some of it
has rubbed off on me.

227
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:41,355
But it's just not me.

228
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,701
Your parents ever expressed an interest
in what you might do for a living?

229
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:48,729
My dad probably wanted me to be
some kind of academic.

230
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,417
It's the family business after all.

231
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,194
But what did he expect?
I don't know.

232
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:57,126
I think he gave up the dream on me

233
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,598
pretty early after I flunked
out of high school.

234
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,085
Which do you think came 1st,

235
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,514
your father's low expectations
or your low grades?

236
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,619
- Meaning?
- Often with expectations,

237
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,019
there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

238
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,402
Maybe you decided earlier on

239
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:13,429
you couldn't match up
to his expectations

240
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,195
- and so you gave up trying.
- Could be.

241
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,176
My mom was always trying
to get me interested.

242
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:21,865
She'd help me study for tests
on the sly.

243
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:24,159
- On the sly?
- Yeah, it pissed my dad off.

244
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,817
He thought she was
spoon-feeding me things

245
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,346
I should've known
or figured out by myself.

246
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,792
And she was terrified
he'd find out.

247
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:36,287
Was she...
generally intimidated by him?

248
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:40,099
"You're so right, Abe.
I never looked at it that way, Abe."

249
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,219
Yeah, it made me want to scream.

250
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,725
One thing you can say about me,

251
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,141
is I sure as hell
didn't marry my mother.

252
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,046
You mean you didn't marry a woman
who was intimidated by you.

253
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,990
So how do your parents
feel about Amy?

254
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:07,463
She's a successful businesswoman,
she's got an MBA,

255
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,221
they fucking love that
she went to grad school.

256
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:14,534
Their high-school dropout of a son
married a hotshot businesswoman.

257
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,997
It's interesting you use the same word
to describe your father,

258
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,174
"hot shot".

259
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:25,179
Do you think that they're alike
in other ways?

260
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,836
They're not.
They're total opposites.

261
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:31,255
He's all rumpled corduroy,
stains on his shirt,

262
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,726
and she's, well...

263
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:36,308
Hell, you know what Amy is...
Meticulous,

264
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,929
put together, very materialistic.
She loves her stuff.

265
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,386
You know, when we met,

266
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,780
I was crashing in this crappy apartment
over a garage.

267
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,217
I think it turned her on.

268
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,156
And the woman had never fucked on a bed
without a box spring, and...

269
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,398
she liked it.

270
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:57,614
Coming down from her pedestal,
hang with the riffraff.

271
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,176
Did you feel like your father
was also on a pedestal?

272
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,808
Come on, let's get off this, alright?
This is not why I'm here.

273
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,592
I don't have that many people
to talk too right now.

274
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,493
And I'm scared shitless of losing Lenny
in some custody battle.

275
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:37,554
Amy is...

276
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,064
unstable.

277
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,298
This is the second time
she's getting a divorce

278
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,991
after having an affair,
and I think she's gonna fuck him up.

279
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:46,855
You said yourself
she needs losers around.

280
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,192
I think she's gonna teach him
to be a loser.

281
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,540
She's damaged, Paul.

282
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,808
She's fucked up.

283
00:16:56,469 --> 00:17:00,047
I haven't gotten much right in my life
except that kid, and that kid is...

284
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,427
What the fuck?

285
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,615
You don't pay your electric bill
or something?

286
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,915
Looks like it's out
on the entire street.

287
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:22,849
- You want to go on?
- I can see you fine.

288
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:24,882
You're sure?

289
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,655
For the first time...

290
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,127
It really feels like
we're splitting up.

291
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:06,364
No matter how many times
we've talked about it, or...

292
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,770
brought it up, it's never felt so...

293
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:11,882
Real.

294
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,213
Why do you think
it feels different this time?

295
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:24,145
The last time you were here,

296
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,339
you implied that
you'd fallen out of love with Amy.

297
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,989
Would you still say that's true?

298
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,087
I don't know. How would I know?
What does it feel like?

299
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,926
I've only been in love
with one girl... her.

300
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,622
I've never fallen out of love.
Tell me what it feels like

301
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:41,875
and I'll tell you if I'm feeling it.

302
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,845
Have you ever felt it?

303
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,878
There's a huge sadness there.

304
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,886
'Cause you know what's been lost.

305
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:59,781
And you begin to lose the desire to...

306
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:03,576
connect.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,989
Maybe you should ask your father.
He's the guy who knows everything.

308
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:16,496
Did I tell you what he said
when I told him my marriage was over?

309
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,069
"This isn't entirely unexpected, is it?"

310
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,567
He expects me to fail.

311
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:25,937
Every time. At everything.

312
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:31,915
Why did you go home, Jake?

313
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:36,024
I don't know. It's an extend.
I just started driving,

314
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,825
that's where I ended up.

315
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,355
This is therapy.

316
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,268
We don't believe in "accidents" here.

317
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,335
Alright, fine.

318
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:49,189
I'm about to be a single dad.
Maybe I...

319
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:57,601
Maybe I just felt like
I want to talk to my mum.

320
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,086
Or your dad.

321
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,020
Have you been listening to a word I say?
I can't fucking stand my father.

322
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,155
It's interesting that
you use the same words to describe

323
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,740
Amy and your father.

324
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,915
"Hot shot".

325
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,958
But you keep insisting that
they're nothing like each other.

326
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,361
They're not.
Where're you going with this?

327
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:21,286
Look. You married an intelligent
overachieving woman

328
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:24,071
who seems absolutely certain of her...

329
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:26,314
authority in the world.

330
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:31,000
The criticism and disappointment
that you got from your father

331
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,109
do me feel that
that's what you get from Amy.

332
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,801
Your relationship with Amy's
falling apart,

333
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:45,197
so you get in a car
and you drive for 4 h to Virginia

334
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,149
and you find yourself...

335
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,679
by accident...

336
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:51,198
outside your father's house?

337
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,410
You think I was going back
to the source?

338
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,724
Jesus, that's sick.

339
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,043
It's not sick.

340
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,815
The more we open ourselves to the...

341
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,458
The therapeutic process,
the more we can examine these...

342
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:24,414
More therapy. What're you talking about?

343
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,874
I need that
like I need a hole in the head.

344
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,373
You know what?

345
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,675
Who cares
why I went home that night.

346
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:37,386
What is it matter how my parents talk
at the fucking dinner table, alright?

347
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:41,471
I've learned from my father's mistakes
and I'm a much better father than he is.

348
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,307
I don't want to fuck it up.

349
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,410
I don't want to fuck my kid up.

350
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:01,574
I need...

351
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,020
I need the help.

352
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,315
I need your help.

353
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,662
I need help.
All the help I can get.

354
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,095
Or some road map, you know?

355
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:35,894
I feel scared.

356
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,405
I wish I could say
it was that simple.

357
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:55,033
That I could just give you a road map,
a book of instructions, but...

358
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,911
unfortunately, life isn't like that.

359
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:04,619
But you know, that old saying that...

360
00:23:04,822 --> 00:23:08,230
a journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

361
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,450
Or in my case...

362
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,280
two steps up and one step back.

363
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,014
You know, if this was a movie...

364
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:40,872
the lights would come on, right now.

365
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:44,250
If this <i>were</i> a movie.

366
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,722
<i>Were</i> a movie.
