1
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:08,267
Previously on "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:11,771
I hear you, paul. You want to kick me
out of therapy. I get it.

3
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:14,477
No, I don't want to kick you out,
absolutely not.

4
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:17,740
I think that you tossed
me out a long time ago.

5
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,521
You don't want me to
treat you as a psychologist.

6
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:24,534
You want me to treat you as somebody
who's in love with you.

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,511
Let's face it. I have not been
your therapist

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,910
for a very long time, Laura.

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,183
Maybe you can't treat
me because you're in love with me too?

10
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,780
Where you headed?

11
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:46,713
You need a ride?

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,310
Laura.

13
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:50,517
Let's do it.

14
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,538
Paul?

15
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,209
Paul?

16
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:50,825
Season 1 - Episode 16
<i>Laura week four</i>

17
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,818
- Synchro by : <i>¤AkaZab¤, Kasius</i>

18
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:58,869
<i>LAURA</i> - Londay 9:00 am

19
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:01,927
Sorry.

20
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:06,076
You said that it.
That it happened in the kitchen?

21
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,094
No, it started in the kitchen.

22
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:10,461
Are you listening to me?

23
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,105
Yes, yes, I am.

24
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,125
I said I wanted to do
it right there on the counter.

25
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,368
So when he picked me up,
I thought, "okay," but

26
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:19,882
no, he took me into the bedroom and he.

27
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,767
Put me down ever so gently like I was,

28
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,109
I don't know,
a porcelain vase or something.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,247
Everything was very cautious, hesitant.

30
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,438
Like he didn't know what to do.

31
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:33,604
Maybe he didn't know what to
do with someone who wasn't his wife.

32
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:36,631
Yeah, he kept telling me he hasn't done
it with anyone but his wife

33
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,494
for 10 years, and hardly then.

34
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,097
It was very sweet, actually.

35
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,958
He imitated me.

36
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,576
He did everything I did.

37
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:51,173
I took off his shirt,
he took off my shirt.

38
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:54,431
I told him he has a fantastic body,
because

39
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:57,036
he does, and he goes, "so do you."

40
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:02,180
At one point, he strokes my hair and
he asks me what kind of shampoo I use.

41
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,231
Can you believe this?

42
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:08,264
We're lying there, face to face, petting
each other like high school kids.

43
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:13,210
Anyway, I get sick of it,
so I say to myself,

44
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,188
"maybe he's waiting for a signal."

45
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:18,084
You know, maybe
he wants me to lead.

46
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,356
Maybe if I start doing something,
you know, things will

47
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,089
finally get moving. So

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,587
I went down on him.

49
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:28,724
Everything was so proper.

50
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,963
I didn't want proper.
I just wanted him to fuck,

51
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,763
without all the bullshit about
my shampoo

52
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,383
and my beautiful breasts
and my excellent taste in curtains.

53
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,729
So did that
move things along?

54
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,047
What? The blowjob?

55
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,122
Of course.

56
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,152
But you know what?

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,710
He doesn't like sex.

58
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,007
You know what I mean?
He doesn't really like it.

59
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:09,353
It's like he's carrying out
an assignment, a mission, like a pilot.

60
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:11,539
What do you mean,
like a pilot?

61
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,033
You know those air force guys
that mark tally points on the wings

62
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,330
of their fighter jet to keep track
of how many planes they've shot down?

63
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,858
It was like that,
like he was keeping score.

64
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,418
I mean, he didn't even touch
me while he was going at it.

65
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,043
He was just, you know,

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,535
leaning on his elbows as if he didn't
want any connection between us...

67
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,213
Except where necessary.

68
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,400
And I kept

69
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,108
trying to bring my face
closer to his to kiss

70
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,388
him and he just...

71
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,414
Kept pulling his face away...

72
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:46,144
As if he couldn't stand me.

73
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,844
And that was it.
It was very fast.

74
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,950
Two minutes,
more or less, and then he came.

75
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:00,910
And then he went straight the bathroom
and I just laid there in shock. I mean,

76
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:04,007
he didn't even ask me how it was,
if I was okay or not. Nothing.

77
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:06,948
Anyway, I made myself come.

78
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,526
- While he was in the bathroom?
- No, when he got back.

79
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:12,957
I had to.

80
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,570
I mean, I hate to be left high and dry.

81
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,667
He was just lying conducting dialogue,

82
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,407
the ceiling or maybe with his wife,

83
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,738
or maybe with you,

84
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,534
and he looked so fucking sexy. So I.

85
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,721
I climbed on top of his leg.

86
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,156
I thought he'd get the hint
and he'd start something.

87
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,573
But
nothing.

88
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,750
So I just kept going...

89
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,085
Riding his thigh.

90
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,434
It felt good.

91
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,713
And then I was overwhelmed
with this sadness for him.

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,089
He broke my heart, this guy.

93
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,283
He's fragile, really.
That's what he is.

94
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,190
I don't think he could
tell what I was thinking.

95
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:04,784
I was completely in my own head,
and I was thinking to myself, "shit,

96
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:08,224
this is gonna be the saddest
orgasm of my life."

97
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:13,525
Here I am riding this hot,
sad guy's thigh.

98
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,566
I was expecting something
pitiful and measly, right?

99
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:17,448
But no.

100
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:20,457
A volcano is a cliche,
but that's what it was.

101
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:24,411
It was like 10 orgasms
exploding at once.

102
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,121
It's hard to describe.

103
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:28,996
But I screamed--

104
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,474
I did, I screamed
and I think I scared him.

105
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,507
You would have been really proud of me.

106
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,051
Why would I have been proud?

107
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:40,708
I mean, as my therapist.

108
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,005
You know, that I finally...

109
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,252
Connected with myself.

110
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,046
Doesn't happen very often.

111
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:00,655
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:04,470
That was a bit revealing.

113
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,991
But you must be used to it.

114
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,587
You know, hearing confessions like that,
it probably doesn't impress you anymore.

115
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,915
Actually,
it makes a very big impression.

116
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,452
Really?
What sort of impression?

117
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,014
Well...

118
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,028
You can look at it in all kinds of ways,
but one

119
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:23,891
thing seems perfectly plain to me:
you slept with my patient.

120
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,132
Excuse me?

121
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,764
He isn't your only patient.
He doesn't belong to you.

122
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,036
He's a great guy, okay?

123
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,746
A little fucked up, a little insecure
in bed, maybe, but he's got potential.

124
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,965
I think I'm gonna have
a terrific affair with him.

125
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:41,746
Nevertheless, it's no coincidence
that you went to bed with him

126
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,061
and I don't think it's
any coincidence that you began

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,902
your affair with him shortly after
we talked about your quitting therapy.

128
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,371
Are you saying that I
did this to get back at you?

129
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,735
Remember the guy you told me about.

130
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,771
The guy that you met at the bar,
that you went to the restroom with?

131
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:03,530
You said that you felt you were with me.

132
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,015
It's not the same thing, Paul.

133
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,452
Are you sure it isn't?

134
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,507
It was during that session, Laura,

135
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,208
that you decided to tell me
that you were in love with me.

136
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,019
And that's how you chose to tell me
how you felt about me.

137
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,998
By having sex with another man.

138
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,295
Paul, if there's one thing
that I put right out there,

139
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:26,292
without hinting or manipulation,
is that I've wanted you.

140
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:32,074
So I don't need to fuck another
man just to get my message across.

141
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,401
What made you so...

142
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:42,871
Sad about Alex?

143
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,978
His loneliness.
He's a sad guy.

144
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,302
Did you feel sad?

145
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:52,054
No, I felt horny.

146
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:55,438
So sadness for him but
no sadness for yourself.

147
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,131
What are you trying to get at here?

148
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,108
Maybe you did feel sadness...

149
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,791
Because you were with a man
you didn't really want to be with.

150
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:10,061
Are you saying that when I was fucking
Alex, I was actually fucking you?

151
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,605
- Were?
- Don't flatter yourself.

152
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:13,407
It's not really a compliment, Laura.

153
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:16,977
I think it seems more like, "look what
you missed out on, Paul. You

154
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:18,361
coward, you idiot."

155
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,533
I'm tired.

156
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,066
I'm really
so tired.

157
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:55,842
So,

158
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:57,634
after

159
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,955
Alex left, I

160
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,685
couldn't fall asleep.

161
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,728
I suddenly had this incredible
craving for cheesecake.

162
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,300
Cheesecake.

163
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,919
You know those amazingly fluffy
cheesecakes with that amazing smell?

164
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,015
Well, my mother used to bake those.

165
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:18,712
Every friday afternoon,

166
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:21,844
afternoon, after I finished playing with
my friends, I used to come home and

167
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,529
that smell.

168
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:25,278
It was intoxicating.

169
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,974
It was like a trail of scent
paving my way home,

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,446
like a cartoon character.

171
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,417
Then my mother got sick.

172
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,794
The cancer was only stage
one at that point

173
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,375
when they found it.

174
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,347
But when she started chemo,
she stopped baking.

175
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,240
You know, she was tired. She,

176
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,545
she had no energy.

177
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,624
And that was the first sign.
The first sign

178
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,558
that something really big
was about to happen.

179
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,834
And when she was really sick,
I used to find myself

180
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:09,911
roaming the halls of
the apartment building,

181
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:13,729
climbing up and down the stairs,
searching for that smell of cheesecake.

182
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:17,167
Shit, how corny is that?

183
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,682
And once I rember
a woman coming out of her apartment

184
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,698
and she,
thank you.

185
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,407
And she saw me standing out there.
She didn't know who I was.

186
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,250
She must have been new to the building.

187
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,367
And she was yelling at me,

188
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,649
"Go away, go on, go home.

189
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,928
What are you doing,
standing out here, just..."

190
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,137
Why do you think you had that...

191
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:02,654
particular memory the other night?

192
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,708
I don't know.

193
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:14,583
I searched...

194
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,778
through my whole apartment
looking for a recipe but...

195
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,202
Not that that would have done any good.
My fridge is completely empty.

196
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,839
I thought about going out
to get a piece,

197
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,167
but it was 3:00 a.m.,
so I just gave up and went to sleep.

198
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,150
Only then the phone rang
and it was Alex, he called to...

199
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,738
thank me, tell me
that he had an amazing time with me

200
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,008
and that he wants to see me again.

201
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,385
Go figure, huh?

202
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,891
He's supposed to pick
me up from here pretty soon.

203
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,011
From here?

204
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,747
Yeah, that's what he said.

205
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,260
Aren't you afraid that
Andrew will find out about this?

206
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,357
Or, maybe you want to get caught.

207
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,721
Andrew and I split up.

208
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,230
- What?
- For good.

209
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,649
And it is for good.
He's a nice guy.

210
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:02,068
He'll make a nice husband
for someone who deserves him.

211
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:03,828
But obviously not for you?

212
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,449
I nearly fuck guys in bathroom stalls,

213
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,375
as you very kindly reminded me.

214
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,670
I just couldn't stand up there
in front of everyone, promise to...

215
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,334
Well, I just shouldn't
ever make promises.

216
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,205
I promise not
to make any more promises.

217
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:20,325
How's that?

218
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,283
So I told him that...
"I'm sorry, but I can't marry you.

219
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:32,184
"I am incapable of being the woman you
want, the kind of woman you deserve."

220
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,490
I put it all on me.
Well, 'cause it is all me.

221
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,877
And he looked at me and he said:
"Thank you, Laura.

222
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:42,903
"Thank you.

223
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,642
"God exists.
It's a fact.

224
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,656
"He's made me realize
who and what you are,

225
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:57,126
"and He's saved me from a long,
endless death with you."

226
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,654
Flattering, no?

227
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,408
He must be devastated.

228
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:04,276
- Maybe he feels...
- I don't care how he feels.

229
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,876
You don't care...

230
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:09,018
Not now, I don't feel like talking
about Andrew's side of the story.

231
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:12,625
- Why does that make you so upset?
- Because I'm the one in therapy here.

232
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,072
Andrew has his own therapist.
She'll take care of him.

233
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:18,503
Don't worry about him,
worry about me.

234
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,152
I am taking care of you.

235
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:23,047
- You're kicking me out of therapy.
- I am not.

236
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,452
- I brought it up as an option.
- Don't sugarcoat it.

237
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,521
You even tried to blame it on me.

238
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:30,319
You made up the most ridiculous
case as to why I was late.

239
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,489
It was nasty, a bullshit excuse.

240
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:35,368
Instead of leveling with me
and saying: "Listen,

241
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:37,964
"I've feelings for you too,
it's hard for me to deal with."

242
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,637
Instead of figuring it out so we could
continue therapy, so we could...

243
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,659
We could be together,
that's your point?

244
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,079
We've been together for a year.

245
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
A year.

246
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:54,028
There is more intimacy between us
than most couples in the world.

247
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,565
Isn't that right?

248
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,120
I don't deny that
there's a certain intimacy, that can...

249
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,320
"A certain intimacy...
Intimacy-like..."

250
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,809
Cut the crap.

251
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,712
Is there intimacy here or not?

252
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,879
There is.

253
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,030
And now you're willing
to throw that all away.

254
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:27,801
And why?
Because you're scared?

255
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:30,260
I know that as a therapist,

256
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,746
you tell yourself
it's part of therapy to find out

257
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,897
why I'm in love with you and how
that's linked to my past and all that.

258
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,588
But isn't that always
the way it works?

259
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,916
Doesn't our past always determine
who we fall in love with?

260
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,633
What if you can trace
it back to the withholding mother,

261
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:49,689
the narcissistic father,
the parent who's missing in action.

262
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,663
Does that make our love any less real?

263
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:54,259
But sometimes circumstances are,
let's say,

264
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,526
- less than ideal.
- I know that.

265
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:59,396
I know you can delude
yourself into think...

266
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,109
Only I am not deluded.

267
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:05,729
Not about you, not about
how I feel about you, why I feel it.

268
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:09,591
There's always got to be an explanation,
but that I feel it is irrefutable.

269
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,073
I don't know
how to convince you anymore.

270
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:23,290
I mean, you think that I've imagined
this fairy tale, this...

271
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,304
happily-ever-after.
That I've idealized you.

272
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,450
You think this is a case of a miserable
patient sitting in front of her...

273
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,004
her therapist imaging
that you're my superman...

274
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:35,690
Perfect, savior,

275
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,309
mentor.
I don't see you that way at all.

276
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,237
How do you really see me?

277
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,530
I see you the way you are...

278
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:46,705
Your imperfections.

279
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,876
You're not at ease with your body,
with your profession,

280
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,501
with who you've become.

281
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:58,655
I don't know much about your life,
but I...

282
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,940
I imagine you're not happy at home.

283
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,935
Something in you is restless, damaged.

284
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:08,453
There's a yearning there,
and I know it when I see it.

285
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,985
And I want you just the way you are...

286
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,569
Damaged and restless,
yearning...

287
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,322
Warts and all.

288
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:19,737
So you can fix me?

289
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,626
God, you can be such
a fucking prick when you wannabe.

290
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:24,297
So that I can fix you then?

291
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,494
You know, next month I'll be 30.

292
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:41,151
And I've been thinking to myself...

293
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,821
"I've hated myself for 30 years.

294
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,398
"It's enough.
I don't want to anymore."

295
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,319
Why do you hate yourself?

296
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:58,456
- You're surprised?
- I've never heard you say it before.

297
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,982
I guess you save the best for last.

298
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:02,878
That's the best?

299
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,850
That you hate yourself?

300
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,161
I don't know. You're surprised?

301
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:10,272
It's something people
realize after an hour.

302
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,968
I didn't know it after an hour.
Neither after a year.

303
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,014
It's not easy for
me to hear you say that.

304
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:20,852
Maybe you should try
and find out why it's so hard for you.

305
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,106
Maybe you should see someone.

306
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,360
I've been thinking about that.

307
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:33,741
Seriously, I think the reason
it's hard for me to hear it is because

308
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:37,945
I know that you have
so many reasons to...

309
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,519
to love yourself,

310
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,546
so many things to be...

311
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,674
To be really proud of,
yet you choose to ignore them.

312
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:45,794
Why?

313
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,066
Haven't you ever hated yourself?

314
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:56,591
I guess I did...

315
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Once.

316
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:01,806
I was a kid.
You know?

317
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:03,453
My mother...

318
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:07,405
she was in pretty bad shape and...

319
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,353
I took care of her, but...

320
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,086
I couldn't...

321
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:17,733
I couldn't save her...

322
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,028
From herself, you know?

323
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,270
I guess I hated myself for that.

324
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,306
Was she sick?

325
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:33,672
She was in a difficult emotional state.

326
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,513
I thought that I could
pull her out of it.

327
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,067
I used to cook her all these,
you know, elaborate meals.

328
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:43,788
But she wouldn't eat them.
Couldn't understand why.

329
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:46,558
Like every kid,
I thought it was my fault.

330
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:49,496
It was something that I wasn't doing.

331
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,652
Maybe I could do something else.

332
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,529
But you know that's not true.

333
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,317
I know that now, yes.

334
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,139
Have you forgiven yourself?

335
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
I think so.

336
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,616
Took a long time.

337
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,720
How does that feel?

338
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,840
I mean really.
I'm curious.

339
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,119
It feels like a relief

340
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,781
to tell you the truth,

341
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,076
to know that that burden is gone...

342
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,646
The burden of blame.

343
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,520
And to know deep down that...

344
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:31,082
it never belonged there
in the first place.

345
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,867
Maybe that's why you became
a psychologist...

346
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,667
To help others with their burdens.

347
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Maybe.

348
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:52,004
So you're a product of your past too.

349
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,348
Will that be cash or check?

350
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,387
- Can I owe you that?
- Sure.

351
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:09,749
Anyway, I know where you live.

352
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,231
Yes, you do.

353
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:33,469
I should get going.
Alex is waiting for me.

354
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:00,684
I forgot, I haven't paid you.

355
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,954
That's okay.
It'll do next week.

356
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,430
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
