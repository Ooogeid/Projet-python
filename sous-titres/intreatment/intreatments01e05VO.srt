00:00:01,186 --> 00:00:03,147
Previously on <i>In Treatment</i>...

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,633
I love you.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,676
I thought it was just an infactuation,

4
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:08,712
but it's getting worse.

5
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:10,730
You've become the center of my life.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,059
Laura, I'm your therapist.
I'm not an option.

7
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:15,809
I didn't come here for therapy.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,603
I just need you to write your opinion

9
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,540
and tell me that I'm perfectly all right

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,776
and tell them that I'm not some person
that flies into cars every day.

11
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,475
Is that why you came here today, Sophie,

12
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:27,660
for me to tell you
that you're all right?

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,908
Is that the test
you're afraid of failing?

14
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:31,317
I am going back there.

15
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,087
To the site where you dropped the bomb?

16
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,179
To the place
where the children were killed?

17
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,957
Don't you think
there's a strong desire there to

18
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:39,709
atone for your actions?

19
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,505
Yes to the pregnancy or no?

20
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,273
To have an abortion or not have it?

21
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,607
Just fucking say it already.
Tell us what you think.

22
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:50,512
- I think you should have an abortion.
- Really?

23
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,723
<i>Hello, you've reached
the office of Dr. Gina Toll.</i>

24
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:55,593
Please leave me a message.

25
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,026
Gina, it's Paul. Paul Westin.

26
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,212
- Hello, Gina.
- Hello, Paul.

27
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,265
I, um...

28
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:41,945
I couldn't remember
which entrance to use.

29
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,364
I was parking the car and I thought,

30
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,191
"Is it the front entrance or the..."

31
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:48,284
You haven't been here in a while.

32
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:49,348
Sure.

33
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:50,468
Come in.

34
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:53,031
What would you like to drink? Coffee?

35
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,165
No. No no, I'm fine actually.

36
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:02,542
That's where I sit.

37
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,467
Yes, of course.

38
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,464
Season 1, Episode 5
Synchro: Tagne

39
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,665
- You look very well, Gina.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,215
It's not true but it's nice to hear.

41
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,075
The hardest part
about turning 60 is that,

42
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,641
in my mind,
I'm still as energetic as a 30-year-old.

43
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,852
For six hours,
I have all the energy of a 30-year-old.

44
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,576
The rest of the day,
I'm an old, tired woman.

45
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,611
- I can't believe that.
- Would you like a piece of cake?

46
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,528
It's sugar-free though. Doctor's orders.

47
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,049
Don't get me started.

48
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,740
I can't eat anything
that I like these days.

49
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,641
Cholesterol.

50
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:22,705
You know, it's, um...

51
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,084
It's kind of funny being here again.

52
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,659
Well, I'm retired now

53
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,463
so I turned this room into a study.

54
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,839
Yeah, so I see.

55
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:35,129
It's where I do my writing.

56
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,840
You're writing.

57
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,605
But what?

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,990
I don't know.

59
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,041
Maybe an article
or something less formal.

60
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,249
Maybe something longer.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,434
I don't know.

62
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:52,086
It's strange...

63
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:55,947
being here after David.

64
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:58,920
How are you coping with that?

65
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,142
It was probably
the most difficult time of my life,

66
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,540
coming back home without him.

67
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,740
He was a remarkable man.

68
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,074
Yes, he was.

69
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,342
How about you?

70
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,707
Oh, me.

71
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,910
Well, I'm, um...

72
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,141
I'm working too hard.

73
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,311
I'm trying to lose this weight. I can't.

74
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,068
I feel like
I'm having another midlife crisis.

75
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,401
Had one at 30,

76
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,942
another one at 40 and now
I'm having my third one at 50.

77
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,907
- How's Kate?
- Kate's good. She's fine.

78
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:42,503
- And the kids?
- The kids, well...

79
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,342
Ian's gone to college. He's at Wesleyan.

80
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,082
Rosie, well, she's busy being Rosie.

81
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,668
Rosie.
How old is she now?

82
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,802
17.

83
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,380
She's still exactly the same.

84
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:57,216
She's still got the world
wrapped around her little finger.

85
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:58,408
17.

86
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,595
And, of course, Max.

87
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:01,928
Max is nine.

88
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,514
Max?

89
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,761
Kate got pregnant
after we'd last seen each other.

90
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,188
And so we had Max...

91
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:12,482
Everybody's favorite,

92
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,922
like Joseph and his brothers.

93
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,845
So he's exactly the age
Rosie was when you...

94
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,317
Yes, when I stopped coming here, yeah.

95
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,817
Gina, I...

96
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,413
I called you last night because, um...

97
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,383
I really felt that I needed
to talk to somebody.

98
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,128
It's, um...

99
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:46,377
Actually, it's something
that's been bothering me a lot

100
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,955
lately but

101
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:51,337
only yesterday I really felt
the need that I had to...

102
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:52,897
to talk about it.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,150
I feel that...

104
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,486
I don't know how to put this
but I feel like I'm...

105
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:02,434
I'm just losing my patience.

106
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:06,070
I'm losing my patience with my patients.

107
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:12,072
There are sessions
when I can barely restrain myself

108
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:13,672
from having just...

109
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:15,757
from an outburst.

110
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,825
I want to just lock the door some days

111
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,446
and wish everybody would just go away.

112
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:25,596
I have this...

113
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,689
I have this couple
who've been coming to me

114
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,155
for marriage counseling.

115
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,954
They have one child

116
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,929
but they have been trying
for five years to have another baby.

117
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,627
So she gets pregnant

118
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:40,664
and now she wants to have an abortion.

119
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,660
I think what she really wants

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,657
is to get rid of the husband
if you ask me.

121
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,403
But anyway, this guy...

122
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,030
really got on my nerves yesterday.

123
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,630
He cornered me.

124
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,696
He badgered me until I made a decision.

125
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,131
Should we have an abortion?
Should we not have an abortion?

126
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,001
I finally said,
"Yes, good, have an abortion."

127
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,822
As soon as I said it of course

128
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:07,323
I regretted it because I knew
that I had spoken in anger but I...

129
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,635
I couldn't help it. This guy, he just...

130
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,205
he said some really nasty things to me.

131
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,615
He called me...

132
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,123
a murderer.

133
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,002
I knew he was right the second
it came out of my mouth.

134
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:26,386
Of course he was right.
I was sitting there telling him

135
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:28,981
to kill his baby.

136
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,198
But still, I was...

137
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,841
I know I'm not making much sense but...

138
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:37,377
anyway.

139
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,777
And there's this girl

140
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:42,715
who I've been working with for a year.

141
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,052
There's an issue of erotic transference

142
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:48,574
and this came out now.

143
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:52,318
Everything is all about this issue

144
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,788
and I'm thinking to myself, "What..."

145
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,323
If patients could see
what I think about them,

146
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,609
if they could really see inside my head,

147
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,510
they'd head for the hills, believe me.

148
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,077
They'd run for cover.

149
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,574
What about new patients?
Are you taking on new patients?

150
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,259
Yes, I am. I think I take them on

151
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,801
to prove to myself
that everything is okay.

152
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,374
I've taken on this guy,

153
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,379
he's a bomber pilot.

154
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:22,629
Cocky,

155
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,766
arrogant kind of a guy. Macho, you know?

156
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,255
Flew a mission over Iraq,

157
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,846
dropped a bomb

158
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,933
on a school
where 16 children were killed.

159
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,198
So he comes back, he goes on leave

160
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,195
and then he runs
for 22 miles without stopping

161
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,765
and brings a heart attack on to himself.

162
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,697
So I'm trying to get this guy
to see that

163
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,532
maybe there's a connection
between these two events but...

164
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,828
Anyway, all the time I listen, you know,

165
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,791
as if it's nothing.

166
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,343
But inside, I'm just...

167
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,640
I just find it so...

168
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,903
so disgusting.

169
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:08,885
And there's a girl
who goes to Rosie's school

170
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:09,844
who...

171
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,383
You're treating a friend
of your daughter's?

172
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:15,099
No, she's not a friend.
They're just in the same grade.

173
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,327
Anyway, this girl...

174
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:20,062
idolizes her coach.

175
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:27,236
Were you insulted?

176
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,029
About what?

177
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:31,699
That the patient called you a murderer?

178
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:34,629
Yes, I was.

179
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,081
Gina, I know I'm a good therapist.

180
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,768
I don't know, maybe this week

181
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,029
I need somebody to just tell me
to calm down,

182
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,730
tell me that everything's okay,
that everything's all right.

183
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,926
I remember you said once
that one of our biggest problems

184
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,679
was that we don't have an audience.

185
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,923
We don't have anybody
to pat us on the back,

186
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,093
to approve of what we're doing.

187
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,435
Somebody that you can go to and say,

188
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,613
"Did you see how I maneuvered
that person into that situation?

189
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,983
"Did you see how I got him
to say what I wanted him to?"

190
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,236
What I meant was,

191
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,970
is that we have no one to criticize us,
no one to review us.

192
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:19,095
Anyway, I...

193
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,319
I'm beginning to feel anxious
before sessions and I...

194
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,025
I must admit that I thought
something was going on

195
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,556
at home when you called.

196
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:38,516
At home? Why?

197
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,236
Because it's been almost 10 years

198
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:45,206
since I last heard from you.

199
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,141
The last time you were here,
you were so angry.

200
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,737
You didn't even come to the funeral.

201
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,168
I thought,

202
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,241
"How angry he must be.

203
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,657
"He didn't even come
to David's funeral."

204
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,582
And I'm really sorry about that, Gina.

205
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,214
I had...

206
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,094
I was gonna come
but I felt that it was...

207
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,082
I felt it was inappropriate.

208
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,076
Then you call me out of the blue.

209
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:23,899
Yes, because I needed somebody
to talk to.

210
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:27,940
You were the one who chose
to stop having a supervisor.

211
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,498
You said...

212
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,986
I interfered
with your practice,

213
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,656
that instead of guiding
I was interfering.

214
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,074
Yes, I said that.

215
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,944
But then there are times

216
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,361
when a supervisor has to take a stand.

217
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,031
In your case I felt
I had to take a stand.

218
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,498
I had to interfere.

219
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,819
But that's not the way I feel now.

220
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,680
I mean, that's ancient history.
Why do we have to go there?

221
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,258
Anyway, whatever happened,

222
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,709
I always felt that

223
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,018
you were somebody professionally
I could...

224
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:03,433
I could at least talk to.

225
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:07,361
Me? I'm already retired.

226
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,355
Oh, I forgot, yes.

227
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,194
You're writing your memoires.

228
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,825
No. No no no.

229
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,521
I thought that's what you meant

230
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:20,284
when you said that you were writing.

231
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,974
Why, are you afraid
I'll write about you?

232
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,957
I think there's way too many
autobiographies anyway.

233
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:28,420
Who cares?

234
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,486
Maybe somebody like Bob Dylan,

235
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,089
I'd be curious about that, but...

236
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,424
How many people like him
are out there?

237
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,303
I'm trying to write a novel.

238
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,439
Oh yeah?

239
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,507
Wow, that's...

240
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:45,801
I don't know, we'll see.

241
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,936
I've given myself a year to write.

242
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,734
I don't know what else to say
about it right now.

243
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,004
I don't know.

244
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,242
Kate and I,

245
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:02,661
we...

246
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,029
we just argue nonstop.

247
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,666
I think it's beginning
to affect my work.

248
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,418
What do you mean you argue?

249
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,860
Well, it's always about
something insignificant,

250
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,430
something trivial that triggers it off.

251
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,483
This time it was about Max

252
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,610
and being asked to go to these classes

253
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,296
for gifted children, which I just...

254
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,644
- Is Max gifted?
- He's very very smart, yeah.

255
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,329
Well then, what do you fight about?

256
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:35,067
She knows how I feel about this.

257
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,167
I have said it over and over again.

258
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,568
I am against the idea of it.
What does she do?

259
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,168
Behind my back, she takes Max to this...

260
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,107
to this class without telling me.

261
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:47,580
- And, you know, they decide that...
- Who are they?

262
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,624
This principal and... and Kate.

263
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,229
This girl...
she's barely out of college,

264
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,170
she barely knows my son's name...

265
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:58,845
Pontificating,
telling me how I should raise my kid.

266
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,015
And Kate and I start to argue about...

267
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,413
about that and then that leads onto

268
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:07,288
other stuff and then
we end up and it's like,

269
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,354
"Oh, you care so much
about your patients.

270
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,308
"If you cared as much about your family

271
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:13,667
as you cared about your patients,
then it would..."

272
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,108
- Kate said that?
- Yes.

273
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:16,993
Yes.

274
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,583
She says I don't love her...

275
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,793
That I'm always trying
to be a step ahead of her,

276
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:28,177
that I handle her like a patient.

277
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:30,955
She says the thing
that she hates the most

278
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,895
is that I see it all from a distance.

279
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,812
What do you mean, "it"?

280
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,505
Her, us, it.

281
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,364
She says that when it comes to us,

282
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,426
I'll never have any perspective.

283
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,928
She's right, isn't she?

284
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,931
But I can't help but see it
from a perspective.

285
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:49,064
And all I can see is...

286
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,435
all I can see is rupture.

287
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,659
What do you mean, "rupture"?

288
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,437
Are you trying to shrink me, Gina?

289
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,413
Sorry.

290
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,621
And yet you were here for eight years.

291
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:12,750
Yes, what does that mean?

292
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,208
You were under my counseling.

293
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,510
Eight years, I took care of you.

294
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,255
You find that difficult to accept?

295
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,413
I was your audience for eight years.

296
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:28,855
Maybe I shouldn't have told you
all this stuff about...

297
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,349
About Kate.

298
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:34,144
Maybe it's just because
I'm exhausted. I am

299
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:35,312
wiped out.

300
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,686
And I'm just afraid that

301
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,779
because of that,
something that will happen,

302
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,142
that I'll lose control.

303
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:47,601
Anyway,

304
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,106
we didn't come here to talk
about Kate... though, of course,

305
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,664
just before I came here
we had a big fight on the phone.

306
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,702
You keep saying you didn't come here
to talk about Kate

307
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,394
- but you keep talking about her.
- That's because you make me

308
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:01,273
- talk about her.
- I'm not doing anything.

309
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,587
It's been eight years,
and I'm trying to catch up.

310
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:04,900
Gina, I'm not stupid.

311
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,045
There's always a reason with you,
so don't...

312
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,726
Don't tell me we're having
a nice cozy conversation here

313
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,396
about my married life.

314
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,178
What do you wanna do?

315
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:25,696
We could get together a couple of times
and see how it goes.

316
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,125
Okay.

317
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,378
Is this time good for you?

318
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,241
Yeah, it's fine.

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,751
May I say something before we go on?

320
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,502
What about? Kate?

321
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,715
There's a sadness
when you talk about her...

322
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,025
In your voice.

323
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,739
There's something very sad about it.

324
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,214
I don't know
where she is most of the time.

325
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,278
She tells me that
she's going to the gym and I...

326
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,338
I look in her closet and...

327
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,715
her gear is still there.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,322
And I say to myself,
"Oh, you know, she's...

329
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,383
"she's probably got
another set of running shoes."

330
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,864
When I call her cell,

331
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,768
she never answers.

332
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,154
I let it go.

333
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:43,002
Usually in the evening,
we're too tired and

334
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:45,943
so a week later I'll suddenly say,

335
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,469
"Where were you last Wednesday?"

336
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,407
And she'll look at me like I'm...

337
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,669
I'm crazy.

338
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:57,665
And then...

339
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,105
Sex.

340
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,016
Sex is out of the question.

341
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,430
Once a month if I'm lucky.

342
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,451
She hardly ever...

343
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,128
initiates it.

344
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,855
I can't remember
the last time she wanted it.

345
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,167
What about you?

346
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,855
Do you want to?

347
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,678
I think about it all the time.

348
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,739
What would you say

349
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,180
if somebody came to you
with a story like mine?

350
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:37,754
I don't know.

351
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,541
We're talking about you and Kate.

352
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,291
We're not speculating about a patient.

353
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:48,743
Do you want me to say
that she's having an affair?

354
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,441
Because I don't know where she is,

355
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,637
because of her running shoes?

356
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,497
I always ask myself,

357
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:02,753
"If they were to diagnose therapists
whose marriages fell apart,

358
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,315
"how many cases of erotic transference
would they find?"

359
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:09,809
What does that mean?

360
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,297
That sometimes erotic transference
in therapy

361
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,467
is a test of your married life.

362
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,486
If a therapist can't handle a situation

363
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,546
where his patient
falls in love with him,

364
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,423
it may indicate some breakdown
in his private life.

365
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:26,993
Yes, but I don't think my marriage
to Kate is falling apart.

366
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:29,624
Yes, I had a row with Laura...

367
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,173
I mean with Kate.

368
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,341
Whose Laura? Rosie's friend?

369
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,919
The girl with the issue of

370
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:39,938
of erotic transference.

371
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,851
You didn't mention her by name.

372
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,521
You just said it had come up.

373
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,293
Okay.

374
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,868
She told me that...

375
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,608
She told me that she's in love with me

376
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,323
and that she wants to sleep with me.

377
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:57,616
Okay.

378
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,731
Okay, what?

379
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:01,982
Are you saying that Kate felt that

380
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,908
and that's where our tensions come from?

381
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,798
Good material for your novel, Gina.

382
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,550
Come on, you know that

383
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,551
therapists get divorced
like everybody else.

384
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:11,483
Please don't draw any conclusions,

385
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:13,853
because there are none to be drawn.

386
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,421
Besides, my troubles at home
didn't begin last week

387
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,636
or last month.

388
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:20,764
How would you say her therapy is going?

389
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,099
Whose therapy?

390
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:26,597
You said, talking about your sessions,
that you...

391
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,295
cut things short,
you have no patience,

392
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:33,003
that you often feel guilty
about your behavior.

393
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:34,611
Is that true also with Linda?

394
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:35,988
Laura.

395
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,454
Sorry, Laura.

396
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:39,479
Look, Gina, you know that

397
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,660
patients fall for their therapists
every few seconds.

398
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:45,069
What better way is there to air this

399
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:48,339
than to bring it to the surface
and put it out there?

400
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,175
You know,
this room is supposed to be safe zone

401
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:54,548
where we can open things up and
talk about things in a controlled way.

402
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,436
Just to make things perfectly clear,

403
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,511
this is transference, plain and simple.

404
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,695
Of course you and Mitchell
and your New York gang

405
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,165
have idealized it.

406
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,857
Gina, I didn't come here
to talk about a patient.

407
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:14,756
I think you did come here
to talk about Laura.

408
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,987
Instead, you keep talking about Kate.

409
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,699
You mentioned to me, offhand,

410
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:22,562
that there's an issue
of erotic transference,

411
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,502
and instead of focusing on that,

412
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:28,005
you go on to tell me about a couple,
a class for gifted children,

413
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,631
a new girl who goes to school
with your daughter.

414
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,401
So what are you trying to prove here,
Paul?

415
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:35,529
That you won't talk about her?

416
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,383
About Laura?
That you can avoid talking about her?

417
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:39,944
You know what, Gina?

418
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:42,442
I think this was a mistake,
coming here today.

419
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:46,304
- I think I'd better leave.
- Why?

420
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:49,937
Because you twist everything
into your own preconceived notions...

421
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:51,949
Was there physical contact?

422
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:53,374
No.

423
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,484
You hesitated before you answered.

424
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:57,595
Because I'm shocked
at where this is going.

425
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:59,677
What do you think I did?
Sleep with this girl

426
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,823
and then come here to confess to you?

427
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,954
- When did it happen?
- When did what happen?

428
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,411
Nothing happened.
I keep telling you nothing happened.

429
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:07,650
No. No no no.

430
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,249
- What did she say to you?
- She said...

431
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:12,376
she was in love with me.

432
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,622
That was just last Monday.

433
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:16,741
This week?

434
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,189
Yes.

435
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,187
Yes.

436
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:24,888
What is it you want me to say, Paul?

437
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:27,517
You know, Ginie.
You're making it really difficult for me

438
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,294
to come back here to ask you for help,
reminding me all the time

439
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:33,105
about how long it's been
since I've been here, why I left,

440
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:36,091
how I felt, how you felt...
blah blah blah.

441
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:38,402
Was I that big a disappointment to you?

442
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,071
Because I didn't stay your loyal intern
forever and ever?

443
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,532
I'm just trying to understand what it is

444
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:46,076
you're trying to tell me.

445
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:49,496
I'm trying to understand what moves
you're trying to make.

446
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:53,619
- What moves I'm trying to make?
- What are you looking for?

447
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:55,123
Legitimacy?

448
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,004
Legitimacy for what?

449
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,860
- How old is this girl?
- She's...

450
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,152
I don't know... 30, 29.

451
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,970
I just wonder,
when you talk about feeling guilty,

452
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:08,792
is it about your patients
generally that you feel guilty?

453
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:11,018
Or is it about one patient
in particular?

454
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:13,012
Oh, give me a break, Gina.

455
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,108
God, I hope your novel
doesn't sink this low.

456
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,735
What's bugging you so much?

457
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,082
You are.

458
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:22,068
You.

459
00:23:22,855 --> 00:23:25,407
It's unbelievable how much
you're enjoying yourself.

460
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,169
Erotic transference
happens all the time.

461
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,110
It's simply a question
of how one deals with it.

462
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,040
Now I know how to deal with it.

463
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:36,404
Can you honestly say to yourself

464
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,983
that her falling in love with you

465
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:41,213
is just a part of her healing process?

466
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,425
And that it has nothing to do with you?

467
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:47,667
Maybe you're a little worried

468
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:50,096
because of your family history...

469
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:53,170
- That it could go too far.
- Gina...

470
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,812
Timing, dosage, tact,
you're failing in all three.

471
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,439
I'm not my father.

472
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,506
My father was a doctor.

473
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,509
He left the house
of one of his patients.

474
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:04,163
We're talking about a girl
who has a crush on her therapist.

475
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,907
It's a completely different thing
and you know damn well it is.

476
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:09,858
You should get counseling
regarding this Linda.

477
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:10,786
Laura.

478
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,605
Sorry, Laura.

479
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:15,165
Let's not call it counseling.
Let's call it talking.

480
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,101
Laura... Laura is her name.

481
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,959
God, you're so caught up
in your little theories

482
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,437
that you don't even remember her name.

483
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,304
Why don't you ask her?

484
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:31,854
Ask who?

485
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,142
- Kate.
- What, if she's seeing somebody?

486
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:38,146
That would make you happy, I bet.

487
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:41,523
I think you should ask her
instead of driving yourself crazy.

488
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:44,694
- I'm not driving myself crazy.
- Are you afraid to find out it's true?

489
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,072
- Yes, I am.
- But you're convinced it's not.

490
00:24:47,411 --> 00:24:48,403
Correct.

491
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:52,464
Why did these questions make you
so angry?

492
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:56,540
I'll tell you why:
because you are not being helpful.

493
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,230
Helpful.

494
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,790
Now I'm totally confused.

495
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:07,479
I mean, did you come here

496
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:10,303
to ask for my guidance?

497
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,180
Or to talk to me as a friend?

498
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,987
Are you seeking advice from a colleague?

499
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,341
What role have you assigned me?

500
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:22,254
I'm trying to figure it out
but I'm failing!

501
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:36,665
Listen, Paul...

502
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,704
It's not easy for me either,

503
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:45,304
seeing you after all this time.

504
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,109
You walked through that door
after everything that happened

505
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:50,979
as though it was nothing.

506
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:55,055
It was confusing.

507
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,843
I couldn't think of anybody else

508
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,603
to talk to.

509
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,104
You know what bothers me?

510
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,358
When I walked through the door,

511
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,778
I felt that you looked at me with glee.

512
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,324
And you thought,
"Oh, here he comes again...

513
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,500
"Paul, the failure."

514
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:16,877
And I thought,

515
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,248
"She's been sitting here
like a sleepy old spider, just waiting,

516
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:23,504
"waiting for something like this
to happen."

517
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,819
Look at you. You've woken up.

518
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,060
You're full of life.

519
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,937
If that's the way you feel,
maybe we shouldn't meet.

520
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:47,981
Yeah.

521
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,529
Maybe it wasn't such
a good idea after all.

522
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,379
You should get...

523
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,990
professional help regarding this Laura.

524
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,583
I don't need it.

525
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,585
I think you do.

526
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,675
In any case, if you feel like talking,
call me.

527
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:18,342
I wouldn't be waiting on the end
of a telephone if I was you.

528
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:23,448
Why do these questions
make you so angry?

529
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:25,864
I'm not angry. I'm really not.

530
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:30,026
Why are you running away?

531
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,404
I'm not running away, Gina.

532
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:38,907
Give my best to Kate.

533
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:41,495
I will.

534
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:46,125
Talk to her about it.
It'll make things easier for you.

535
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,455
Good night, Gina.
