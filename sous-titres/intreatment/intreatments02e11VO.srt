1
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:17,061
Hey, Paul, it's 7:08
and I'm downstairs.

2
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,050
So if you're sleeping, wake up.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,325
Mia, sorry.

4
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,633
- I got detained.
- Where were you? I'm freezing.

5
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:53,637
My apologies. Come on up.

6
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,361
In Treatment - Mia -
Season 1 - Episode 11

7
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:14,098
swsub.com

8
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:46,773
You go back to Maryland
on the weekends?

9
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,377
Sorry about that.

10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,483
What happened?
Amtrak broke down?

11
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,684
Are you upset
that I kept you waiting?

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,457
I'm stood up
even by the man that I pay.

13
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:06,142
If you took the train,
it must've left around

14
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:08,585
3:00 in the morning.
That's unusual.

15
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,204
None of my business.
I know.

16
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:13,737
But, you know,
this is our first real session.

17
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:15,852
And I'm already out

18
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:17,841
12 minutes.

19
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,677
We can add it on
at the end if you like.

20
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:23,184
No, I can't.
I have a meeting with a new client,

21
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,981
a plastic surgeon.

22
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,127
Lucky you don't need lipo.

23
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,396
You go to one of my guys,
you could end up dead

24
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,881
with nice thighs.

25
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,853
I'll remember that.

26
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,470
I worked all weekend,

27
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,517
which was fine
because this was the weekend

28
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:42,772
that Bennett and I
were supposed to go away together.

29
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:46,332
And, no, he didn't call
saying he wants me back.

30
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,547
Maybe this is a mistake.

31
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,055
I mean, if I'm gonna
be kept waiting at 7:00 a.m...

32
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,635
- Do you feel like I wasn't...
- On time?

33
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:02,040
I hope it was worth it.
Were you with your girlfriend?

34
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,005
Is that what you imagine?

35
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,570
Do you deflect
everything that's personal?

36
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,021
Never mind. I already know.

37
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:16,129
My being late seems to have
brought up quite a few feelings...

38
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,959
So this is more of a home really
than an office.

39
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:23,319
I think you said last week
that you found it homey.

40
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:25,403
Homey,

41
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,905
but cold. You must

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,757
turn the heat down when you go away.

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,891
Is this how
your Maryland office looked?

44
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,665
What happened
to all of those patients?

45
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,801
I mean,
I know what happened to Alex,

46
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:57,389
but all the others. You told them
their feelings were important,

47
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,258
and then you just left them?

48
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:03,346
Is it possible that you're worried
that I might leave again, Mia?

49
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:07,286
Winter equals hell for hair.

50
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,192
What's going on?

51
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,299
- I don't want to be here.
- Why not?

52
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:18,603
I don't like brownstones...

53
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,065
Too much brown.

54
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:26,633
And this has absolutely nothing to do
with the last week's session.

55
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:29,183
Because I had not even had a chance
to think about that.

56
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,617
Actually, I have,

57
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:32,998
and...

58
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:36,775
I was thinking about what you said
at the door just before you left.

59
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,933
When I said, "you owe me a child"?

60
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,430
That was a joke.

61
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:43,948
Maybe it was.

62
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:48,160
But I get the feeling that there might
have been a little more to it than that.

63
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:52,842
No, no, there wasn't.
It was just a comment.

64
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,733
Sometimes a comment
is just a comment, right?

65
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,672
How are you? Nice to see you.
You owe me a child.

66
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,059
Aren't you glad I'm back?

67
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,337
Who's Laura?

68
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:15,684
Laura?

69
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:18,965
Who is she?

70
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,776
I'm not sure
who you're referring to.

71
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,292
It's not a hard question.

72
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,278
I'm asking you about Laura Hill.

73
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,238
She's an ex-patient of yours.

74
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,417
If she's a patient of mine,
then you know I can't discuss her.

75
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,853
- But I can.
- Where is this coming from?

76
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,509
An envelope
was delivered to my office.

77
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,403
Henry must've made a mistake and
thought that I was still your lawyer.

78
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,764
And I opened it.
And it was her deposition

79
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,716
regarding Alex's state of mind.

80
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,687
And you read it?

81
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,809
Are you curious about what she said?

82
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,650
I hope that you gave
those papers to my lawyer.

83
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,768
It's obvious
she was in love with you,

84
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,309
or is.

85
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,292
How so?

86
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:10,650
It's in and between her words.

87
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,728
She might as well have

88
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:17,002
- sealed it with a kiss.
- And what does that mean?

89
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,163
You are curious.

90
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:22,392
Well...

91
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,698
She describes how she dumped her fiance
five minutes before the wedding...

92
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:31,466
That's a nice story...
And how she slept with Alex.

93
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,074
And that tells you
that she was in love with me.

94
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,323
She did it to make you jealous. It
doesn't take Freud to figure that out.

95
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,675
She wanted to walk into her session

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,902
and tell you that she was fucking
a fucking war hero.

97
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,905
And what else did she say?

98
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,869
She said that you two became friends

99
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,917
after the therapy ended,

100
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,036
that you called her on the phone.

101
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,843
You broke the rules for her.

102
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,116
How many other patients
have you done that with?

103
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,887
Mia, whatever happened-
Whatever you imagine happened...

104
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,147
I think you had an affair with her.

105
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,481
You're not gonna respond?

106
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,254
I must've hit a nerve.

107
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,447
So what, you broke her heart?

108
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,331
She broke yours.

109
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,498
Oh, she does
support your case, though.

110
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,478
She says
that you did not mistreat Alex,

111
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,699
she mistreated you
by sleeping with him.

112
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,647
- Come on.
- Let's look atyour actions here, Mia.

113
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:47,013
Oh, she says she wants you to know,
though, you're in her thoughts.

114
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,093
You opened a legal document
that was not meant for you.

115
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,894
Point taken.
I crossed a boundary.

116
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,557
More than that, you knowingly violated
a basic tenet of your profession.

117
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,203
- That makes two of us.
- And you brought it into session.

118
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:03,173
Paul, do you have any idea how many
therapists are successfully sued

119
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,029
for sleeping with their patients?

120
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,358
What are you trying to say, Mia?

121
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,960
How could you?

122
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,445
Was she that young and pretty?

123
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:22,088
Or did she make you feel
that big and important?

124
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,746
Take it. It's yours.

125
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:31,843
Do you want me to pick that up{\ off the floor}?

126
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,345
It's all yours.

127
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,367
I've just made an ass of myself,
haven't I?

128
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,091
I bet you're angry.

129
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:01,609
Maybe I am.

130
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,274
Mostly, I'm...

131
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,719
- I'm surprised.
- No, you're furious.

132
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:11,028
I can see it all over your face.
But...

133
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:14,042
you just can't express it
because you're not supposed to.

134
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,410
You want me to go?

135
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,669
Why would you think that?

136
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:21,768
You know what? You can stop.
Stop, 'cause I'm leaving.

137
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,583
It seems to me that you're pushing me
so that you can end this treatment.

138
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,780
No, I don't blame you.
And it's no big deal.

139
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:31,442
Actually, I think it's a very big deal.
You were the one who waited for me

140
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,643
in the cold, although I was late.

141
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:35,222
You waited for me.

142
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:38,702
Is it possible that you're goading me
because it's easier

143
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,110
to feel angry with me
than look at your own pain?

144
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,218
I saw this show on the TV
The other night... BBC.

145
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,662
About men and their...

146
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,800
specially-made sex dolls.

147
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,140
The men pick out the eyes,
and the mouth and the body.

148
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:43,817
And they buy them clothes.

149
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,979
And then they put lipstick on them

150
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,563
and take them out
for picnics and bike rides.

151
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,895
And they love their girls because

152
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,404
they don't talk

153
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:58,847
and they never get pregnant
and they don't get mad.

154
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,358
And they have three perfect holes

155
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,069
that can be repaired.

156
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,284
Young and pretty forever.

157
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,987
What were you thinking
while you were watching this?

158
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,848
I was thinking about
a receptionist in my office

159
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:25,873
named Stefanie
who likes to wear a lot of pink.

160
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,178
And she's so cute and friendly.

161
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:34,724
All she does is shop online, but nobody
wants to fire her because she's just

162
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:39,048
too adorable, you know?
And...

163
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:44,245
She recently announced
that she's quitting

164
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,037
because some idiot proposed.

165
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:51,469
So now I have to go to her engagement
party and her bridal shower

166
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:55,435
and her bachelorette party and
her wedding. And it's endless torture.

167
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,977
Sounds like
you've been there before.

168
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,878
Three younger sisters and

169
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,179
dozens of colleagues.

170
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,880
When men look at a woman like

171
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,192
Stefanie,
they just see the whole package.

172
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,660
And what would that be?

173
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:23,726
Easy and fun and, you know,

174
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,355
wild in bed at night

175
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,790
and muffins from scratch
in the morning.

176
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,083
And what do they see
when they look at you, do you think?

177
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,885
Blonde lawyer,

178
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:41,051
might be fun to fuck, but...

179
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:42,884
But what?

180
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,324
But that's it.

181
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,554
What I usually get...

182
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:57,259
What I usuallygot from men is sex.

183
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,338
What did you get from Laura?

184
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,681
Do you think
that I chose her over you?

185
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,402
Well, you had sex with her.

186
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,825
Would that make you jealous?

187
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,163
Well, I did
have feelings for you, Paul.

188
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,737
Even though it was 20 years ago,
you must have noticed.

189
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,983
And it sure felt
like you had feelings for me.

190
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:36,927
It's such a cliche, isn't it...
A young woman falls for her therapist?

191
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:40,992
But if you were
gonna get involved with a patient...

192
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,061
You wonder why I didn't pick you.

193
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,101
You didn't.

194
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,071
You picked her.

195
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,622
You and Laura
fucking your brains out.

196
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,678
What, on this couch?

197
00:13:57,928 --> 00:13:59,534
That makes me sick.

198
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:03,382
I don't want to talk about it.
Don't make me talk about it.

199
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,367
What would happen
if we did keep talking about it?

200
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,437
I bet you wanted her from day one.

201
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:13,851
You were smitten.

202
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:17,421
How did you manage
to walk her to the door?

203
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,718
You assume
that I found her irresistible.

204
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,712
She knew how to get to you.

205
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,367
How?

206
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:32,198
Act helpless and girlish.

207
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,493
She probably had slim hips...

208
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,535
Smelled like candy apples,

209
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:47,386
wore pink or something.
Obviously, I have no idea.

210
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,970
Go on.

211
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:52,197
What do you imagine?

212
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:56,500
She'd stare at you all googoo-eyed,

213
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,190
impressed
by your brilliant interpretations,

214
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,341
made you feel
like the world's best shrink.

215
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:10,566
And then one day
her fiance got mad and she fell apart

216
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,382
and sobbed.

217
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,720
And you felt sorry for her,

218
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:21,690
so you sat next to her.

219
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,091
Go on.

220
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,803
And you touched her...

221
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:36,408
Her cheek, her tears.

222
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:41,013
And you realized how young
and beautiful and vulnerable she was.

223
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:44,231
And you thought,
"this is my moment."

224
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,646
And you kissed her
and there was no turning back.

225
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:52,689
Why not?

226
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,510
You had to have her,

227
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:58,708
unwrap her.

228
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:00,649
Take her.

229
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:07,887
And you had to feel
her perfect skin and her round ass

230
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,454
and her flat stomach.

231
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,184
It must've been amazing for you...

232
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,598
So forbidden.

233
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,473
And for her?

234
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:30,253
She probably didn't feel a thing.
She's made out of silicone.

235
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,036
Right, the sex doll.

236
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,396
It wasn't about the sex for her.

237
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,936
It was about winning.

238
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,715
What did she win?

239
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:42,754
You.

240
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,292
For those minutes you were hers.

241
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,701
Now do you want me to go?

242
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:05,115
I'd rather know
what you think happened next.

243
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I don't know.

244
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:09,009
Maybe you held her

245
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,009
gently until she fell asleep.

246
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,719
And she would like that?

247
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:24,835
That's what
would make her feel good?

248
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,985
That's what she really wants?

249
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,467
Yes.

250
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,855
It's good to feel that closeness.

251
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,711
Maybe that's what you want from me.

252
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,832
You mean,
to fall asleep while you hold me?

253
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,319
To be comforted, contained.

254
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,346
- That would never happen.
- Why not?

255
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:10,351
Oh, come on, Paul,
just admit that I'm difficult.

256
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,742
I push men away.

257
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,690
Look at Bennett and Andre...

258
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:23,662
I mean, pick any letter in the alphabet.
I've sent them packing.

259
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,876
I'm like a knife in your neck.

260
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,543
It feels good when it's gone.

261
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:30,858
Right?

262
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,110
So you think
I'd be relieved if you left?

263
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Sure.

264
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,647
I walk out that door...
You feel relief.

265
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,932
You want
to pretend it never happened.

266
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:43,998
Actually, I already told you,

267
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,419
I did think about our last session

268
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,881
and the ones from 20 years ago.

269
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:57,332
You know, it's okay, Paul.
You don't have to fake it with me.

270
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,737
You kicked me out of here 20 years ago
and you never thought about me again.

271
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:07,444
It's okay.

272
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,500
You know who that is?

273
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,307
That's you playing, isn't t it?

274
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,485
It's beautififul.

275
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:23,718
You kept that all these years?

276
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,307
Chopin's "raindrop prelude."

277
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:34,899
God, I love this piece,

278
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,969
how the eighth notes
sound like rain.

279
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,166
That's from m a recital.

280
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,793
My teacher, Mr. Campbell,
put that together.

281
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:53,627
He said that I was the best,
but not to tell the others.

282
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,771
So you two had a secret.

283
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:02,551
What age were you then?

284
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:04,748
I must've been 10.

285
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:09,370
That turned out
to be my farewell performance.

286
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:10,559
That's a shame.

287
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,903
You play really beautifully.

288
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,463
A few weeks after that recital I was

289
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:22,558
sent to live
at my aunt's in new jersey.

290
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:27,057
I don't remember you telling me
you were sent away when you were young.

291
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,619
It was only about six months.

292
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:32,016
But when I came back,
the piano was gone

293
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,039
and twin girls were there.

294
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:40,746
Do you rember anything else
about the separation?

295
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,525
My dad came to visit me
every sunday.

296
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,160
He'd bring my favorite candies.

297
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,578
I liked those colored dots

298
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,101
that were stuck to paper

299
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,513
and those bottles
filled with that sugary liquid.

300
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:59,184
And he would show me
pictures of the twins.

301
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,259
And I would tell him that

302
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:07,325
I missed them all
and wanted to come home.

303
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,205
But he didn't take you.

304
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,930
Where was your mother?

305
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,205
I don't know. I mean,

306
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,637
I'm sure she came,
maybe at christmas.

307
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,354
What about the rest of the time?

308
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,906
I went to school.

309
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,552
It sure was different
from Greenpoint, though.

310
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,170
Gosh, it was so clean...

311
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:33,436
And modern.
And all the textbooks were new.

312
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,563
I didn't really like the kids, though.
I thought they were boring.

313
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,095
Sounds lonely.

314
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:44,108
Maybe that's why you gave me
that casassette...

315
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,990
Because I'd know
how you felt when you were 10

316
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,012
and your parents made you leave.

317
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,067
Maybe you thought
if I listened to it back then,

318
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:57,061
I would change my mind,
let you stay.

319
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,563
- But I was difficult even then.
- You think you deserved it.

320
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:02,538
- I was impossible.
- How so?

321
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:05,297
I fought with my mother
all the time.

322
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:07,634
- Over what?
- Everything.

323
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,405
You were a difficult 10-year-old
who loved chopin.

324
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,796
I don't know why
we're talking about this.

325
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:15,642
They didn't do anything wrong
and I don't blame them.

326
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,141
Earlier in the session you said
that you didn't blame me.

327
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:22,842
I crossed the line.
I violated attorney-client privilege.

328
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:25,608
You thought I was kicking you out.

329
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,001
Well, I bet you wanted to, right?

330
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:31,327
I'm wondering, Mia,
if you were testing me today.

331
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:34,288
You reprimanded me for being late.

332
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,296
You violated my privacy.

333
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,416
You even wanted me to pick up
the deposition of the floor.

334
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:42,157
Well, I was pretty angry.

335
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,474
Maybe you were trying to see

336
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:47,781
if I could be pushed away.

337
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,722
So you're saying that...

338
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,017
my parents were right
and Bennett was right;

339
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:55,656
that I'm so fucked up
that nobody wants to be with me

340
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,632
because I push everyoyone away

341
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,126
and I'm demanding and I'm needy
and I'm angry and I'm weepy?

342
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,861
- I'm the seven fucking dwarves.
- That's not what I'm saying, Mia.

343
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,592
What I'm saying
is that maybe you are angry,

344
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:13,949
but you also want me
to be close to you;

345
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:17,898
and that no matter
how difficult you say you are,

346
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,243
that beneath the toughness
you still want to be connected to me.

347
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,265
But you're also afraid.

348
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:26,565
You're afraid
that I'm going to leave you.

349
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:48,887
I'd better leave.

350
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,259
They're early.

351
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,718
It's okay.

352
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,382
I have a meeting
and I don't want to be late.

353
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,986
And you don't want
to keep the next one waiting.

354
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:02,807
So then...

355
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:08,682
I'll see you next monday same time?

356
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:12,798
You owe me

357
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,029
the 12 minutes.

358
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:19,086
Okay, then I'll see you at...

359
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:22,096
- 6:48.
- Okay.

360
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:27,118
Did you have sex with Laura?

361
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,791
You know, this is
the second week in a row

362
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,321
we're having what's called
"a doorknob moment."

363
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,355
What a are you talking about?

364
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,315
That's when right at the end of
the session, a patient says something

365
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:44,627
important.

366
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,879
Is that your answer?
'cause that's a yes.

367
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:50,311
Is it?

368
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,165
I mean, did you?

369
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:56,216
No.

370
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:09,589
You might want
to water the plant outside.

371
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:11,853
I poureded my latte on it.
