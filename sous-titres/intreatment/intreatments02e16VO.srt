1
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:11,374
I'm late, I know.

2
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,617
We said 6:48 and now it's 6:58,

3
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,408
but I just really had to stop
and get some breakfast.

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,115
Where do you think you're going?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,118
I don't want to make a mess in here
and I just... I really have to eat.

6
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,897
It would really be fine in here.

7
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:25,984
I... I don't have sessions in here.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,551
It's not a session.
It's coffee.

9
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:31,817
I found this amazing bakery
right in your neighborhood.

10
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:33,692
The donuts are still hot.

11
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:36,160
- Here, this one's for you.
- No, thank you.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,917
No? Okay, well,
I know you drink coffee.

13
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:44,482
No? Come on.
I got it for both of us.

14
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:45,858
I've got 2%.

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,623
I've got skim.
I've got half and half.

16
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,448
I've got real sugar, fake sugar...
I've got organic fake sugar.

17
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:58,030
What's wrong?
Can't I have some breakfast?

18
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,936
Yes, of course you can. I just wonder
why you can't have it in the other room.

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,993
All right.
Well, you wonder and I'm gonna eat.

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,770
Do you have a napkin?

21
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,905
In Treatment - Mia -
Season 2 - Episode 16

22
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:36,097
I had the craziest weekend.

23
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:39,988
Friday night I went out with
the first years... the baby lawyers...

24
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,711
to this club in Brooklyn
called Warsaw.

25
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,878
It's in my old neighborhood
and very hipster.

26
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,872
If you can believe that.

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:51,043
There was this band playing
called the glass cat playing this...

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,687
kind of avant-pop postmodern rock,

29
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:57,825
which I didn't really like
because I prefer melody.

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,705
But the guitarist...
these long limbs like a gazelle

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,298
and he had these fingers
and he could play.

32
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,857
Mia, you're speaking very quickly.

33
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:10,129
Then I had a few drinks...
or more than a few.

34
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,229
And when the glass cat broke

35
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:15,276
I brought him a scotch
and I held it right up to his mouth.

36
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,145
And he grabbed it and sipped it
and said, "thanks, babe,"

37
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,470
which I liked.

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,330
And why did you like that?

39
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,013
Because he was the babe.

40
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,590
He was in his 20s.

41
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:28,717
So...

42
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,106
I went home with him.

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,800
I carried one of his guitars
like a groupie.

44
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:38,734
I had forgotten what it's like
with a young guy.

45
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:42,452
God, when he told me he wanted me,
I knew that it was true,

46
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:45,064
unlike Bennett the fish.

47
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,585
So you preferred
the cat to the fish.

48
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,284
Lawyers are the worst in bed because
they always have to be on top, you know?

49
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,891
And Bennett's penis
is the size of a pen cap.

50
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,885
No, an almond... erect.

51
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,270
And who wants to fuck
a little nut, right?

52
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:03,107
But guitar boy and I,
we went at it all night.

53
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,409
And he must watch
a lot of porn or something,

54
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,534
because the sex was acrobatic.

55
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:13,317
And you want me
to ask you about that?

56
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,535
{\It's just that }I haven't jumped around like that

57
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,269
since I took trampoline
at the Greenpoint Y.

58
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:23,175
I mean, is this...
is this shocking you?

59
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,713
Is that your intention?

60
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,053
We changed positions constantly.

61
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,152
{\I mean t}Thank goodness I go to the gym a lot.
It was like the sex olympics

62
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,627
with the pommel horse
and the handstands,

63
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,033
straddle splits, stuck landing.

64
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,479
Well, that sounds like
quite a performance.

65
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:47,281
Give me the right partner
and my game comes up.

66
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,686
With Bennett, why bother?

67
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:55,004
That's the second time you've
mentioned Bennett since you came in.

68
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,190
Bennett can kiss my well-fucked ass.

69
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,327
This boy told jokes.

70
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:07,015
What do a guitar solo and premature
ejaculation have in common?

71
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:09,915
You know it's coming

72
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:12,673
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

73
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:22,320
A little boy says to his mother, "mom,
I wanna be a musician when I grow up."

74
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:25,908
And she says, "oh, honey,
you know you can't do both."

75
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,558
That's funny.

76
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,215
His futon was on the floor.

77
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,622
His room was filled
with these beautiful guitars,

78
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:39,255
but that night, I was his favorite.

79
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,198
That's important to you, Mia,
isn't it?

80
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,972
Being the favorite.

81
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,857
Maybe that's why it was
so important for you...

82
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:50,121
I told dave about you.

83
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,062
- The musician?
- No, the cop.

84
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:54,709
Who?

85
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,631
The musician was friday night.
The cop was saturday night.

86
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:00,922
Oh, I see.

87
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,103
So saturday day, you know, no sleep,

88
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:06,766
I had to go shopping for my niece
who's turning 6 this week

89
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:10,093
and I love her. I do,
but my sisters go ballistic

90
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,916
with these birthday parties.

91
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,794
It's like roller-coaster or petting zoos
and clowns that eat fire.

92
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,945
It's insane.

93
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,645
And if I miss one,
I'm selfish aunt Mia.

94
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,557
Meanwhile on my birthday
nobody even sends me a card,

95
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:26,617
except dad.

96
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,477
He remembers.

97
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:31,163
Anyway, saturday night
I went to a local pub.

98
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:34,893
I just had a few bad chardonnays.

99
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,852
I was just sitting there
and this guy Dave...

100
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:41,427
50s, sturdy...

101
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,015
told me that it's not safe
to be in a bar alone.

102
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,504
I said, "well, then
I shouldn't be talking to you."

103
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,117
And he said, "oh, I'm a cop.

104
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:53,392
I'm the only one in here
that it's safe to be with."

105
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,728
So...

106
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,899
we went to a motel in Queens.

107
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,777
Just over the bridge.

108
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,027
He started telling me what to do...

109
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:09,035
And I was this little girl.
He had this power over me

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,210
and I had to do exactly
what he said when he said.

111
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,470
You've stopped.

112
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,264
Don't you want to know
how I reacted to that?

113
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,484
I liked it.

114
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,423
Somebody else in charge, you know?

115
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:32,391
He told me to just lie still
while he, you know, did it to me,

116
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:36,038
and that if I didn't follow
his every word...

117
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:43,095
Come on, Paul. I know you wannna
know what would happen if he...

118
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,068
Do I?

119
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:46,977
He'd spank me.

120
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,680
He told me to get on all fours
and that I'd been a naughty girl.

121
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:55,611
And then he would smack me...
a little harder every time.

122
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:03,265
Have you ever done that?
I bet you'd like to.

123
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,690
And it's even scarier with a gun.

124
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,219
He pulled a gun on you?

125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,191
It was in the holster on the chair.

126
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:17,716
He didn't use it, but it upped
the ante, I'm telling you.

127
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,763
Beats the hell
out of Bennett's blackberry.

128
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,294
We're back to Bennett.

129
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:31,278
And a year of me telling him
what to do and where to do it.

130
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,824
You know, "touch me here.
Kiss me there.

131
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,195
Over to the right
and back to the left."

132
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,145
So in one weekend you found two men
who were better than Bennett.

133
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,713
Yeah, I was trying
to fuck that man out of me forever.

134
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,883
Oh shit! Jesus!
Spilled milk, that's perfect, right?

135
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,813
Mia, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

136
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,938
It's fine.
I can do it later.

137
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,057
Maybe this is a good time for us
to go into the other room.

138
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,185
So you want me on the couch?

139
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,987
Fine, you don't want me
in your kitchen;

140
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,651
you don't want me on the couch;

141
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,142
I'll sit here.

142
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:21,934
I think we need to talk
about what's going on today.

143
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,523
No, I was hungry.

144
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,098
You wanted
to have breakfast together.

145
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,953
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm tired of eating alone.

146
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,383
- It's not about you.
- What isn't?

147
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,616
The breakfast or the weekend?

148
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,266
You really think I slept around
because of you?

149
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:41,475
- How would that work?
- Don't be coy.

150
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:45,614
You think that I'm still jealous
of Laura, so I acted out?

151
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,151
I didn't say that, Mia.

152
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,195
But as your therapist,
I am interested in your behavior.

153
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,916
Picking up two men
sounds out of character

154
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,717
and I'd be remiss
if I didn't explore what triggered it.

155
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:00,873
Well, it wasn't you.

156
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,492
It was Bennett.

157
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,413
He asked me to...

158
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,834
have lunch with him
on friday at the bowery hotel.

159
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,680
And I thought
he wanted to woo me back.

160
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Wrong.

161
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,534
After we'd eaten, he told me that...

162
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,736
he was gonna leave his wife
for his girlfriend.

163
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,943
- I didn't know he had a girlfriend.
- Yeah, that was news to me.

164
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,217
He had his wife,
he had me and he had her.

165
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,854
And guess who it is.

166
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:39,961
It's Stefanie,
our office receptionist.

167
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,562
You mentioned Stefanie last week.

168
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,100
You said you were dreading
going to her bridal shower.

169
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:51,156
Well, we're past that,
'cause now that Stefanie's pregnant

170
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:54,931
and he's plotting his divorce,
they've decided to be discreet.

171
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:57,906
That must have hit you hard.

172
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,533
He thanked me for our time together

173
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:03,602
and told me that it had
helped him through a rough patch

174
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:07,191
and that he would never forget me.
Isn't that sweet?

175
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,014
I almost called his wife right then
and there, but I resisted.

176
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,674
Then I went back to the office
and the first face I saw was Stefanie,

177
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,586
glowing like a new bride.

178
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,284
You're very hurt.

179
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,647
No. You know, why...
Why leave your 38-year-old wife

180
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,831
for your 43-year-old girlfriend

181
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:28,150
when you can nail
a 25-year-old receptionist?

182
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:31,546
So you thought of yourself
as Bennett's girlfriend?

183
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,882
Well, I guess
I wasn't really thinking.

184
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,054
You know, I can't do it.
I can't play this game.

185
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,572
- You mean the girlfriend game?
- No, the Stefanie game.

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,380
Where you giggle at bad jokes

187
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:48,772
and you collect friends on facebook
and you drink chocolate martinis.

188
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,256
But in a way isn't that what you were
trying to do when you went out with

189
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,653
the baby lawyers on friday night?

190
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,907
I was trying to feel better, so I went
on a spree. Have you never done that?

191
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,682
And that doesn't matter. It's not like
I want to see guitar boy again.

192
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:08,793
Really? You described it
as an olympic-quality night.

193
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,297
Yes, that's good...
once every four years.

194
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,675
I don't want
a relationship with a child.

195
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,955
Only men do that.

196
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,308
He fell asleep at dawn
and I went into the bathroom

197
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:28,770
and I looked in the mirror
and I knew it was time to go.

198
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,386
Mornings after can be...
can be harsh.

199
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,927
In the daylight
with the makeup smeared...

200
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,190
There was no hiding
that I am old enough to be his mother.

201
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,765
You didn't feel that the night before?

202
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,590
He had power rangers towels
hanging in his shower.

203
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,732
I just got dressed and I left.

204
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,259
Did you say goodbye?

205
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:16,738
Leave a note?

206
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,657
And I won't be sending flowers.
You disapprove?

207
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,991
Do I?

208
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:29,372
It's pretty obvious by your
"did I do this? Did I do that?"

209
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,858
So do you feel that I'm judging you?

210
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,999
Why don't you just say it, Paul?

211
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,050
What?

212
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:38,761
That I fucked two strangers
and that it was immature,

213
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:42,314
- that it was self-destructive.
- And that's what you want to hear?

214
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,075
Shut up.
Just talk like a person.

215
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,016
Say "Mia, you'll get a disease.

216
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,045
You'll getkilled."

217
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,686
The cop had a goddamn gun.

218
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,232
I'm not sure if you want me
to scold you or to protect you.

219
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,251
Do you have anything
to say to me that's real?

220
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,803
Please don't ever do this again.

221
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:10,562
You'll get hurt.

222
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:14,262
I do not want you to get hurt.

223
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,257
You think that I was stupid?

224
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,600
No, I think you were
looking for something

225
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,182
or someone.

226
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,679
Oh. You see,
I knew you were gonna do this.

227
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:35,846
What?

228
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:40,680
Point out that I had picked up
a musician in his 20s,

229
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,696
just like my old boyfriend Stevie.

230
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,634
Well, Stevie was a drummer and

231
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,132
anyone will tell you
they are totally different.

232
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,339
Two weeks ago
you did tell me that you wondered

233
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,290
if you had missed
your chance with Steve

234
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,602
and you wanted
to go back to that moment

235
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,838
when you could've had him.

236
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,983
If that's what I was trying to do,
it didn't work... not in the morning.

237
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,108
Exactly.

238
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,862
You saw in the mirror
that you're a woman now

239
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:11,468
and not a girl anymore,
and maybe you didn't want to.

240
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:16,042
If you did, you might
have to see guitar boy again

241
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,724
or give him a name.

242
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,632
Do you think it's possible
that he might've been a kind of symbol

243
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:23,401
for roads not taken?

244
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,698
He was pretty great in bed
for a symbol.

245
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:28,462
Very good.

246
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,477
Okay, let's say that guitar boy
was a symbol, right?

247
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:36,258
So what am I doing with a cop?

248
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:39,836
Well, how did you feel
when you were with him?

249
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:46,376
I felt safe.

250
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,399
So the musician
didn't make you feel young.

251
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,587
In the daylight,
you actually felt old.

252
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,662
So you found a cop

253
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,420
who treated you like a child

254
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,497
which made you feel safe.

255
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:05,701
How's that?

256
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:08,698
It's pretty good.

257
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,950
I thought
I was just sleeping around.

258
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,175
Do you plan on seeing him again?

259
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,422
The cop? No. No.

260
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,542
I don't want to have
to act like achildto have sex.

261
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,960
But you said it was fun, exciting.

262
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,933
He's married.

263
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,648
Did I leave that out?
'cause he did.

264
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,379
When did he tell you that?

265
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:35,304
When I guessed
why he wouldn't drive me home.

266
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,886
That's textbook.

267
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,368
Sounds like you've been
down that road before...

268
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,024
besides just Bennett, I mean.

269
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:50,352
You're on a roll.
Any ideas why I do that?

270
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:52,495
Well, I'd rather hear it from you.

271
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,770
I don't know.

272
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,060
Married men are unavailable?

273
00:15:57,404 --> 00:16:01,104
I know it won't work out,
so it allows me to maintain distance?

274
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:05,895
The sex is always great
'cause married guys are starved for it.

275
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,771
- There, does that cover it?
- Well, since you're asking,

276
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,246
I don't think so.

277
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:16,188
I mean, when you have
an affair with a married man

278
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:19,496
he has secrets with you.

279
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,087
Secrets with you
instead of his wife.

280
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:28,486
He's closer to you
because you're his favorite.

281
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,867
It's kind of similar in a way
to what you were doing this morning.

282
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,661
Instead of sitting on the couch,
you wanted to have breakfast

283
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,122
in the kitchen with me,

284
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:40,600
together,

285
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,792
so that you'd feel
different from my other patients.

286
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,573
Special.

287
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,683
Is this better?

288
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,297
It's not all about you, Paul.

289
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,522
I know that.

290
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:15,943
In fact, when you were sitting in
my kitchen, I remembered you telling me

291
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,996
about how you shared coffee with your
dad at his store when you were a girl.

292
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,500
You said that it was a secret

293
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:25,734
that you both kept from your mother.

294
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:29,954
What are you thinking, Mia?

295
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,824
Nothing.
I don't think it's anything.

296
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,510
My dad did come over
for brunch on sunday.

297
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,284
And so the two of you
spent the day together.

298
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:42,919
Did you invite him?

299
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,689
- When?
- That morning.

300
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,670
My mom dropped him off, happily.

301
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:53,123
She probably went off
to spend the day at her beauty parlor

302
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,702
where she likes to sit around
and talk with her friends about

303
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,742
how I ruined her modeling career.

304
00:17:57,956 --> 00:17:59,466
Is that her mantra?

305
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,431
If she hadn't had me...

306
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,512
But she had more children after you.

307
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,527
Well, 10 years later.

308
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:10,755
She treated my sisters
like they were treasures.

309
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,382
But not you?

310
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,596
No, she shipped me off to New Jersey

311
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,961
when she was getting ready
to have the twins.

312
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,058
But I thought you said
that both your parents...

313
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,715
My dad, he never would've done that
if she hadn't forced him.

314
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,394
So, no, I don't invite her.

315
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,392
She didn't mind. If he hadn't
come over, she would've had

316
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:31,901
- to take care of him all day.
- Take care of him? Is he ill?

317
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,514
He wasn't himself.

318
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,700
I mean, I hadn't slept in two days,
and he didn't even notice.

319
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,414
He was coming down with something.

320
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,586
He was coughing a lot and he spilled
his coffee all over himself

321
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,506
and I had him take off his clothes
and I washed and dried everything.

322
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,091
Like a parent.

323
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,926
He just sat there
wrapped in a blanket.

324
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,053
Not what you'd hoped for.

325
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:08,501
So you feel that your father
should take care of you,

326
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,126
make you feel loved?

327
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,915
It should be unconditional
no matter what he feels?

328
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,688
No matter what you do?

329
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,413
Well, I told you
he was having a bad day.

330
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:25,970
We adore one another and he...

331
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,912
he's definitely better
than any guy I have ever dated.

332
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,835
- You make him sound perfect.
- Is that bad?

333
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,963
Can you think of a downside to it?

334
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,141
A downside to having
a father who loves me? No.

335
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,025
The problem is
I can't find anybody as good as him.

336
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,443
You think
there's something wrong with that{\, don't you}?

337
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,718
For one thing,
your father's married to your mother.

338
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,118
Do you think there's
any connection between that

339
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:56,945
and your picking married men?

340
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,411
I said that I was done with that.

341
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,499
You did, but you also asked me
what that pattern was about.

342
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,994
Now you're gonna tell me
that my father molested me?

343
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,819
- Because he didn't.
- I didn't think that.

344
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,641
But your father has been
an essential comfort for you.

345
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:17,462
For as long as you are his favorite,
you won't ever be alone.

346
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:20,369
I'm getting the feeling
that the tight bond

347
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,534
isn't entirely comfortable.

348
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,305
- What do you mean?
- Look at this morning.

349
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,394
You came in, you crossed a boundary.

350
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,436
It made you feel special.

351
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,482
But I think it also rattled you.

352
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:38,360
Your speech was fast, graphic.
You tried to provoke me.

353
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,948
- You spilled something.
- The spill was an accident.

354
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,814
Maybe, but what I'm saying, Mia,

355
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,255
is that it's not always
a simple thing to be special.

356
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:50,909
I was thinking of the feeling
that you had when you were eight

357
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:54,041
after the robbery
in your father's store.

358
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,266
He held you.

359
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:57,444
It was too tight.

360
00:20:58,347 --> 00:20:59,989
It was life and death.

361
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,316
Do you think it's possible
that to separate from your father

362
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:13,979
is to risk being entirely alone?

363
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,790
But to stay with him
is to be uncomfortably close?

364
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,814
Why are you doing this?

365
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,408
- My dad is all I have.
- No one else?

366
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,580
- Colleagues, acquaintances.
- Is he your closest relationship?

367
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:41,965
Are you his?

368
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:49,089
I feel sick.

369
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:51,509
I ate too much.

370
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,786
This is like antitherapy.
I walk in here feeling great,

371
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,775
I'm gonna leave feeling like crap.

372
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,650
Sometimes that happens.

373
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,066
And when it does,
do you do anything?

374
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,893
- You want me to make you feel better?
- I don't wanna feel like this forever.

375
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,106
Like what?

376
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,106
Like this is my life.

377
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,969
I don't want this to be my life.

378
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,799
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

379
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,091
- I'm gonna go.
- You still have time.

380
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,228
Oh, do I?

381
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,757
I'm 43
and I'm entirely alone... your words.

382
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,570
You're right. Who do I have?

383
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:44,354
You?

384
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,726
One session a week?

385
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,742
I want someone to go home to...

386
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:56,131
Someone to be in my bed with me,

387
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:00,878
somebody who holds me when I cry.
I just want that.

388
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,381
I know.

389
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:08,552
I just want that.
