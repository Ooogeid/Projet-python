1
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:12,614
Hello, Mia.

2
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,942
Would you like to come in?

3
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,156
It's over.

4
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,189
I'm not pregnant.

5
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,078
In Treatment - Mia -
Season 2 - Episode 26

6
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:54,341
I'm not feeling well.

7
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,516
I really should've stayed home.

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,076
I called in sick at work.
That's a first.

9
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,021
What did your doctor say?

10
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,398
I'll live.

11
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,489
- Did he say anything else?
- I'm so tired.

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,460
I want to go back to bed.

13
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:20,576
I'm not up for a whole session.

14
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,392
Well, why don't we just start
and then

15
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,667
we'll see how it...
how it goes?

16
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,170
I'd rather stay here for now.

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,620
Can I get you a glass of water?

18
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,636
Maybe some tea?

19
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,418
That's very nice, but I'm fine.

20
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,565
That's what you kept saying
last week... "I'm fine."

21
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,479
How have you been?

22
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:02,696
Fine.

23
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,259
Would you like to tell
me what happened?

24
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:11,797
There's not much to tell.

25
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,948
I went to work on friday...

26
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,040
Started bleeding.

27
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,431
I went home...

28
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,310
And it didn't stop.

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,315
End of story.

30
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:31,564
So,

31
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:35,350
emotionally, how are you?

32
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,132
I'm kind of numb.

33
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,799
It feels better that way.

34
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,074
I understand.

35
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,146
I thought

36
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,616
that I was gonna be
a parent and now I know

37
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,479
I'm not.

38
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,741
I'm really sorry, Mia.

39
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:57,015
I just felt transformed
for a couple of weeks.

40
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,201
Like I had a real...

41
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:05,210
purpose. And I was a different...

42
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:07,978
a different me.

43
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:11,090
You know, a woman has a baby

44
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:14,665
and people stop asking questions:
"what's wrong with her?"

45
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,275
Or...

46
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,205
"she's so ambitious."

47
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,377
Or "pathetic" or "strange."

48
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:26,477
It's easy then... she's a mother.

49
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:28,749
It answers all the questions.

50
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,489
It seems to me that you had a lot
of questions yourself last week.

51
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,884
Maybe I melted down a little,
but I still wanted to have the baby.

52
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:46,225
The stupid thing is I can smoke
now - and I don't even want to.

53
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,396
So maybe you have changed a little.

54
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,050
Nice try.

55
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,232
You know,

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,859
There's other ways to be a parent

57
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,800
if that's what you really want.

58
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,034
You mean compete

59
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,326
with some young suburban couple
for some pregnant teen's baby?

60
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,649
I can't imagine picking

61
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:10,446
ivy league sperm out of a catalogue

62
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,235
to defrost and squirt.

63
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,176
You don't want to adopt,

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
you don't want a donor

65
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:21,218
and yet you're sure
that you wanted a baby.

66
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,644
It isn't just about being a mother,

67
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,766
like you said last week.
You also wanted to have

68
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:30,862
the perfect picture.

69
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,413
I kept waiting to meet
the right guy but it...

70
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,150
he didn't show up.

71
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,153
Or more likely

72
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,952
I pushed him away.

73
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,400
And now no man and no kid.

74
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,761
I don't want to talk about this.

75
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,051
Let's switch to the weather.

76
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,444
It was a really cold weekend,
wasn't it?

77
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,091
Actually, it was surprisingly warm.

78
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,782
Did you stay inside?

79
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,127
Did you call anybody?

80
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,782
You could've called me.

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,077
You're still in mourning

82
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,505
and you were away
over the weekend anyway, right?

83
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,797
Mia, something like this...

84
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:23,592
you call me.

85
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:26,932
Actually, I did talk to someone.
Believe it or not,

86
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,395
I spoke to my mother.

87
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,625
I'd certainly
like to hear about that.

88
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:38,837
Do you think we could
talk about it inside?

89
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,792
What is it with therapists?

90
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,050
You hear the word "mother"
and these bells go off?

91
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:45,408
Pretty much.

92
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,831
It's... it's part of the training.

93
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,444
So would you like to tell me
about the conversation

94
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,319
you had with your mother?

95
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:32,866
Cara, one of my nieces,
gave a piano recital on saturday,

96
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,936
and when my mother
saw that I wasn't there

97
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,665
she called to see if I was okay.

98
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:40,481
Your mother and

99
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,693
- not your father?
- Right.

100
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,113
I haven't heard from him in a while.

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,687
Anyway, my mother
is the queen of protocol

102
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,900
and I had missed a family event.

103
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:56,749
This... it was Cara playing Chopin,
and I have been paying for her lessons.

104
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,846
I told my sisters that if
any of the girls wanted

105
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:01,587
music lessons that I would treat.

106
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,382
I mean, what is the money for?

107
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:09,044
I defend some pretty
questionable doctors

108
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,375
present company excluded...

109
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,435
and how many pairs of
high heels do I need?

110
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:20,157
Is that because you want to make sure
that music isn't taken away from them

111
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:21,359
in the way

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,401
that it was for you?

113
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,026
Playing piano was...

114
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:28,102
the one thing
that always made me feel happy.

115
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,049
Anyway, I didn't answer the phone,
so she left a message.

116
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,718
And then later that afternoon
she showed up at my apartment

117
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:39,775
with a platter of pierogis.

118
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,253
Maybe she was concerned for you.

119
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,423
Well, there's always
a first time, right?

120
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,942
So how did it go?

121
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,256
I was still in my pyjamas.

122
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:54,749
She took one look at me,
the heating pad, the tylenol,

123
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,878
the tissues in front of me
and she said, "do you have the flu?"

124
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,406
And I shook my head no.

125
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:08,683
I started to cry and she got it.

126
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,800
And she said
"maybe that's nature's way."

127
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:19,324
I don't know when
I last cried in front of her

128
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,207
or when she's last

129
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:23,919
hugged me.

130
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,596
And then she heated up the food,

131
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,213
set the table nicely,
poured us some nalewka.

132
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,645
What's that?

133
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,140
It's a cherry-infused vodka.
It's a traditional drink.

134
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,792
Anyway, she tried to make
a consolation toast.

135
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,106
She said "to better days..."

136
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,423
And then she told me

137
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,254
that she was proud of me.

138
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,945
Well, maybe she was.

139
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:52,114
She said that I should be

140
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,032
grateful for what I have.

141
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:58,629
My independence, my career,
this interesting life I'm leading.

142
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:02,216
It sounds like some of the things
that she might have wanted

143
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,292
for herself.

144
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:08,322
Well, I snapped at her.
I said, "that's kind of a strange toast

145
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:12,158
considering you've always blamed me
for ruing your modeling career."

146
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,883
Did you tell her that?

147
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,971
Well, you won't believe
what she said.

148
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:17,886
She said that

149
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,833
she didn't really have
much of a career.

150
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,533
She wasn't that pretty and

151
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,258
that she never
would have risen above her

152
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,484
job as an underwear model,

153
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:32,196
which is not what I grew up hearing.

154
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,990
Right, her mantra.

155
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,558
Her false mantra.

156
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,894
The same lie over and over
until everyone accepts that it's true,

157
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,680
especially me, the one
that she loves to blame.

158
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:48,456
Did you ask her why she did that?

159
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,823
My mother said that it was...

160
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,545
Kind of her cover story...

161
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:01,145
That having me didn't ruin
her looks. It

162
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:03,179
destroyed

163
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:04,937
her mind.

164
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:08,554
She said that after I was born,
she lost it.

165
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,446
She couldn't get out of bed,
she didn't want to eat.

166
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:17,616
She said she stayed in her room
because she was afraid

167
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:20,672
that if she left it,
she would kill herself,

168
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,996
and that there was

169
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:28,035
some small, sane part of her
that didn't want to do that to me.

170
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,131
{\You know}there are some mothers
who get so depressed

171
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,456
that they lose sight of even that.

172
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:40,366
So where was your father
during all of this?

173
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,058
She said he just moved
into the living room.

174
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,279
He didn't try to get
her professional help?

175
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:46,704
Are you kidding?

176
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,030
He was first generation.

177
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,674
He would've been mortified
to ask someone for help,

178
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,228
to admit that his wife was crazy.

179
00:10:57,353 --> 00:11:00,038
So he took care of you
during this time?

180
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:02,163
He did everything. He had too.

181
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,911
She didn't even want to breastfeed.

182
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,873
So, really, you weren't

183
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,590
mothered for over

184
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:10,345
a year.

185
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:14,555
When she came out of it
somehow she did, she said

186
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,962
she had this rush of feeling

187
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,746
and that she wanted
to be close to me,

188
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:24,624
but by then my dad
and I were just inseparable...

189
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,907
I think the word she used was

190
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,340
"impenetrable"

191
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,774
that my father had never
forgiven her and that

192
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,399
he used our closeness
to show her how

193
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,154
she'd failed.

194
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:40,615
She said that she was
so guilt-ridden that she thought

195
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,283
she didn't deserve me,
and so she just

196
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,881
kept away.

197
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,328
That's quite an admission.

198
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:50,234
That must've given you a lot to

199
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,543
take in about

200
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,196
both your parents.

201
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,409
Yeah, I guess.

202
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:57,507
Do you think her depression
might also explain

203
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,848
why she didn't get pregnant
again for 10 years?

204
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,928
No. She talked about
that too. The twins

205
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,647
the cherished twins

206
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,348
they were an accident.

207
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:09,842
She said that

208
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,188
she was terrified when she found out
that she was pregnant again

209
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,922
and that she asked my father

210
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,030
to hire a sitter so

211
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:23,148
someone would take care of us
if she couldn't.

212
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,279
And according to her, he said

213
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,570
no.

214
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:33,185
That he couldn't afford it.
And she insisted that it was

215
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,962
his idea to send me out to
his sister's out in new jersey.

216
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,290
- And you don't believe her?
- Of course not.

217
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,302
My father adored me.

218
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,515
She also said that I was wrong about him
coming out to visit me every sunday,

219
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:51,739
that I must've made that up,
because they came together

220
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,355
once a month.

221
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:57,032
- That's not possible.
- Actually, mia, it is...

222
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:00,369
Because it's entirely
possible you airbrushed her

223
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,531
out of your memories of that time.

224
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:05,004
Sometimes the need
to protect one parent

225
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,329
is so strong a child puts
all the blame on the other.

226
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:10,814
No, you're getting this wrong.

227
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,414
She, she is the one who blamed me.

228
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,789
Until saturday,

229
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,096
when she came to you
with what sounds like

230
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,278
an unburdening.

231
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,771
I'm wondering what that must've been
like for you to hear.

232
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,697
It made me furious

233
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,932
and if I hadn't been sick,
I would have thrown her out.

234
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,351
Do you know what it was
that made you so angry?

235
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,704
She spent my whole life telling me

236
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,277
that I ruined her life,
and now she changes her mind

237
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:40,819
when I'm vulnerable,
when I've cried in her arms.

238
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,114
Well, maybe feeling you cry in
her arms is what made her open up.

239
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,746
What kind of timing is that?
What does she expect?

240
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,019
That's a good question.
What do you think she expected?

241
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:52,623
Why are we examining her motives?

242
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:58,121
I'm fucking here
because of her fucked-up motives.

243
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,922
She wanted me
to let her off the hook.

244
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,960
"Bless me, my daughter,
for I have sinned."

245
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,885
I'm supposed to listen until she's
finished and grant absolution?

246
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:11,616
What's the matter? You look horrified.
What, I'm back to monster Mia here?

247
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,269
No no no no no,
I understand your anger.

248
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:17,959
She didn't take care of you,
she lied, she was never there for you,

249
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,034
then suddenly she wants to be

250
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,401
close.

251
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:24,724
Why...

252
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,885
Did she give up?

253
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,805
Okay, she was sick for a year,

254
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,297
but after that...

255
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,547
Why didn't she fight
harder to be my mother?

256
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,502
How, how come nobody sticks by me?

257
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,755
But she did say that she tried
but that there was something

258
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,522
impenetrable about
your father's bond with you.

259
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,889
- Why are you taking her side?
- I'm not trying to take her side.

260
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,814
All I'm suggesting is that

261
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,812
it may not be as black
and white as you rember it.

262
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,544
It's black and black.

263
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,647
She manipulated me one way

264
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:06,301
for my entire life and now
she wants to manipulate me the other way

265
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,532
- to get rid of her guilt.
- That might be true,

266
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,848
but it's also possible,
perhaps in her own

267
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,922
clumsy way, that your mother
was trying to reach out.

268
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:19,500
She saw that you were in cris,
in some way like her own crisis...

269
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,128
there you were in pajamas,
you were depressed,

270
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,883
it was related to a pregnancy
and she recognized it right away.

271
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,836
She was trying to help.

272
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,642
So once again,

273
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,058
I had a chance at

274
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,820
intimacy and I screwed it up.

275
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,011
I pushed her away.
Is that your point?

276
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,799
God damn it.

277
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:47,716
Just stop all the therapy
and tell me what you think.

278
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:52,242
Your mother tells you all
these things and you get angry.

279
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:55,958
What about your father?

280
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,573
I felt bad for him.

281
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,104
His wife gives birth,

282
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,829
he wants to celebrate and she's
ready to jump out the window?

283
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:07,092
Plus he has a crying,
hungry infant to take care of.

284
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,017
He has to be both the mother
and the father, so good for him.

285
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:13,722
Has it ever occurred to you he might
have colluded in the lie that she told?

286
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,332
You just said it: she told the lie.

287
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,110
But he never corrected it.

288
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,235
Why do you think that is, Mia?

289
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:23,064
He was helping her save face.

290
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,801
For 43 years?

291
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,193
Can't you accept
that he was a good father?

292
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,588
Nobody in therapy has a good dad?

293
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,634
A good dad who shipped
a 10-year-old girl off to New Jersey

294
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,909
rather than pay for a babysitter?

295
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,805
There had to be a way
to keep you at home.

296
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:41,207
I mean, families find a way
of working things out.

297
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,172
Well, she's probably
lying about all that too.

298
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:47,839
She could be, but let's just take
her at her word for a moment.

299
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,740
What that means is that you have
to reevaluate

300
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,365
who your parents are
and what they did.

301
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:57,673
Maybe your father wasn't
the ideal man that you thought.

302
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,786
And maybe your mother was
actually trying to connect with you.

303
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:03,548
What's going on here?
She decides to rewrite history

304
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,482
and you just go along with it?

305
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,444
Well, sometimes we find it easier

306
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,819
- to hold on to the fiction.
- It's not fiction, Paul.

307
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:15,492
I'm telling you my mother
was never there for me

308
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,455
and my father always was.

309
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,613
That's your mantra, Mia,

310
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,190
and maybe
it's as false as your mother's.

311
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:26,215
Look at the way you defend it,
how angry you get if I challenge it.

312
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:28,897
I ask you to see your parents
in a different light...

313
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:31,406
I just ask you to do that...
and you go on the attack.

314
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:33,893
You accuse me of taking sides.

315
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:36,548
Maybe I just don't like it when
you blame him for everything.

316
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:37,972
I need a break.

317
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:44,503
Shit.

318
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:49,680
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

319
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:01,568
It's not about blame, Mia.

320
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:05,662
What I'm asking you to do
is more complex than that.

321
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,944
I want you to question the way that you
have thought about your parents

322
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,381
for most of your life.

323
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:13,401
Oh, is that all?

324
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:17,592
I know it isn't easy, but I can tell
you from personal experience...

325
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:23,176
It's better to do it when
your parents are still alive.

326
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,258
My whole life I had this...

327
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,872
Distorted image of

328
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,394
who my parents were.

329
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:40,038
And I didn't want to let that go.

330
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,233
I fought against it,
and then finally I did,

331
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,568
and it was too late.

332
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,443
My father was...

333
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:53,832
he was gone.

334
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:56,210
And that was...

335
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,097
a huge loss.

336
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,240
I've had enough loss this week.

337
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,973
I know, but, Mia,
if you don't go through this,

338
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,768
you're gonna stay where you are,

339
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:15,403
you're gonna keep punishing the men in
your life for not being what you need...

340
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:18,281
- men like Bennett.
- Bennett was an asshole.

341
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,574
Or like me.

342
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:22,243
You blamed me for the abortion,

343
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:25,366
but wasn't it your father
who arranged it?

344
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,129
He was just supporting me.

345
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:30,240
Or maybe he was,
once again, trying to hold on

346
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,038
too tight,
to keep you as his little girl.

347
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,163
No.

348
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,056
No, the abortion was my idea.

349
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,805
I told you that last week.

350
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,841
You said you haven't
heard from him lately,

351
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,459
even though
he must've known you were sick.

352
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,534
He was... he was always
there when I was a girl.

353
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:48,823
Was he?

354
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,323
How about your piano?

355
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,246
You said it was the one thing
that always made you happy.

356
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:00,515
Did you mother talk about
what happened to it?

357
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:11,022
She said that he sold it.

358
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:18,324
He said with two babies in
the house there was enough noise.

359
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,615
Let me ask you something:
what would happen

360
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,605
if you believed her?

361
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:31,813
If you actually let yourself
feel the hurt and the anger

362
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:36,192
that you might have buried
for this perfect dad?

363
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,792
I can't do this, Paul.

364
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,104
Okay?
Not today, not this week.

365
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:49,445
You know,
maybe this is the perfect time.

366
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,149
This is a week that's
been filled with loss.

367
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,997
You mother comes
and she gives you...

368
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,655
A new family history.

369
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,466
The picture you've had of them
is just torn up and thrown away.

370
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,929
And earlier in the week
you lost your own child,

371
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,587
the baby
that you wanted for so long.

372
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,927
That new family also
just taken away.

373
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,860
That's not quite true.

374
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:23,573
On saturday my mother
insisted on calling her doctor,

375
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:27,441
and he had us meet him
at his office in greenpoint

376
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:29,335
on a saturday night.

377
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,447
He's the same doctor
who delivered the twins.

378
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,917
Hadn't you already seen your doctor?

379
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,296
I called on friday.

380
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:42,174
My park avenue obgyn said, you know,

381
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,854
wait it out and to call him
if the pain got much worse.

382
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:51,531
My mom drove us to brooklyn
and there was old dr. Solomon,

383
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,013
sitting behind his desk.

384
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,681
He did some tests

385
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,474
and he told me that...

386
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:12,206
that I hadn't lost the baby
because I wasn't ever pregnant.

387
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:20,751
I told him about my f. s. h. level

388
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:25,518
and he said that I probably
never would be pregnant.

389
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,250
And then he went on.
He said that...

390
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:39,244
He sees this kind of thing
once a week:

391
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:45,859
women like me... successful,

392
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:50,666
no children, my age and older...

393
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:56,479
who come in just convinced
that they're pregnant.

394
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,619
And he has to tell them
that they're...

395
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:09,518
they're not.

396
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:17,176
So...

397
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,629
So you hadn't done
a test before that.

398
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,066
No.

399
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:32,095
- why not?
- I don't know.

400
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,582
I thought I would wait.

401
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,907
I had an appointment for this week

402
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:39,535
to see my doctor
and I was just so sure.

403
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,677
But I had it wrong
and you have it wrong.

404
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:52,783
I don't have to grieve for
a child that I never had.

405
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,617
Mia, last week you...

406
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,809
you talked about the...
the new life that...

407
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,816
that you felt inside you.

408
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,521
It wasn't there.

409
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,162
But in a way it was.

410
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,984
The strength of that desire to...

411
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,868
to create new life.

412
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:27,965
It's almost 7:45.

413
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,409
Is it too early to get drunk?

414
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,983
Who knows?
I could get lucky and...

415
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,140
meet another married man at the bar.

416
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:48,673
I'm gonna go.

417
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,868
Will you please call
me during the week?

418
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:55,462
Call you?

419
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,654
I want to know how you are.
