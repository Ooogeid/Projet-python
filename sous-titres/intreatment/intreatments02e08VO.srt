1
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,841
- So was that so hard?
- I think we're okay.

2
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,115
VO: michvanilly, salomon.

3
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:18,158
208 - Week two
Oliver - Wednesday 4:00 pm

4
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:24,438
- Are we gonna play another game?
- Would you like to?

5
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,972
I don't know.

6
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,986
{\You know, }Since we met the last time I've been
reading up on the rules of blackjack.

7
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,674
I don't want to play right now.

8
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,298
Okay. That's fine.

9
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,173
Why'd you learn about blackjack?

10
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:42,698
Because I want to understand
more about the things you like to do.

11
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:44,520
Why?

12
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,274
Because... I think you're
a very interesting person.

13
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,731
- I'm not interesting.
- Well, I think you are.

14
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,212
You're really observant,
you're perceptive,

15
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:59,827
you've got a great sense of humor
and you're obviously extremely smart.

16
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,845
- My teachers don't think I'm smart.
- Really?

17
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,004
They say things like that?

18
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,254
I don't want to talk about school.

19
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,528
So what would you
like to talk about?

20
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:16,269
You don't have to talk
to me if you don't want to.

21
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:18,123
- I know that.
- I won't tell my parents.

22
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,593
You'll still get paid.

23
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:23,209
I'm not gonna force you
to talk to me,

24
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:24,934
but if you're having...

25
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,361
{\you know, }if there's anything you do
want to talk about,

26
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,717
this would be a good place to do it.

27
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,861
You know
why I don't want to talk about school?

28
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,199
- 'cause all my teachers hate me.
- They hate you? That's terrible.

29
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:41,285
I can't see any reason
why they would.

30
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,330
They're all mad
because I fall asleep in class.

31
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:46,864
Does that happen a lot?

32
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,323
- Pretty much every day.
- Well, then you must be...

33
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:51,921
you must be very tired.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
No, school is just boring.

35
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,398
You don't like any of your classes?

36
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:00,909
Not really.

37
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,741
They're not about real things.

38
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,018
What do you mean by that?

39
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,484
Like, math is algebra...

40
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,992
it's not even numbers, it's letters.

41
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:14,129
- It's all fake.
- And what about all the other classes?

42
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,778
History, for example.

43
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,530
Doesn't that have to be real?

44
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,533
We don't have history...
it's called humanities,

45
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,297
and right now we're reading this
lame book called "Lord of The Flies."

46
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:25,996
Have you ever read it?

47
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,873
A long time ago.

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,934
In what way do you find it lame?

49
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,754
These kids crash on a deserted island
and start doing mean things.

50
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,507
And you don't find that realistic?

51
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,658
You don't need to crash
on an island for kids to be mean.

52
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:40,761
That's true.

53
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,924
Have you ever seen kids
be mean like that?

54
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:54,158
- You wanna see something?
- Sure.

55
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,360
They just gave
one of these to everybody at school.

56
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,645
- What is this?
- It's a turtle.

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,662
It's a turtle. Okay.

58
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,404
He's beautiful.

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,955
Do you think he's okay in there?
Do you want to let him out for a bit?

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,741
{\Well, }- Is that okay?
- Sure, go ahead.

61
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,566
- Okay.
- On the floor.

62
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,332
Do you have a name for him?

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,099
I have to take him home
and take care of him.

64
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,475
If he dies, I fail.

65
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:30,811
So why...

66
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,910
do you think that would happen?

67
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:35,068
I'm gonna forget to feed him

68
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,818
or leave him behind
and he's gonna die.

69
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,209
He looks really healthy to me.

70
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:43,782
It seems like
you're doing a great job.

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,035
I'm glad you took him
out of that backpack, though.

72
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,329
It looks like
it's a bit crowded in there.

73
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,207
Yeah,
I have to take all my books home.

74
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:52,985
Really?

75
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,585
You've got a lot of homework?

76
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:57,067
No, it's just sometimes
I'm at my dad's

77
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,590
and I forget a book
that I left at my mom's,

78
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,674
so my dad gets angry
because we have to go back to Brooklyn.

79
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,929
So it's best that I keep
all my books with me.

80
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,682
So since we last met, you've been
staying at your dad's apartment?

81
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,288
So you still feel
the same way as you felt before,

82
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,721
that you're just not ready
to stay with your dad... Just yet.

83
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,458
Well, I'm a little bit...

84
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:25,015
I'm a little bit confused.
Last week you said that the reason that

85
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,284
you couldn't stay over
at your dad's was because

86
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,536
you couldn't fall asleep
because of the noise.

87
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,614
Now you're with your mom and

88
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:35,721
you're still so tired you're falling
asleep in class. What's with that?

89
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:37,953
School's boring.

90
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,628
I just told you that.

91
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:42,427
So...

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,063
So do you have any trouble...
is he okay there?

93
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:49,885
I guess.

94
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,003
So...

95
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,937
you never have any trouble
falling asleep at your mom's house?

96
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,038
It's just hard to fall asleep.

97
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,820
Maybe the problem isn't just the noise
at your dad's apartment.

98
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,285
Maybe it's that you're having trouble
sleeping for other reasons.

99
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,410
Like what?

100
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:11,143
A lot of people
can't get to sleep because

101
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:13,240
they're really stressed
out at nighttime.

102
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,315
They can't empty their minds.

103
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,793
Do you think that's true about you?

104
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,189
Maybe.

105
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:24,276
I'm sure that there's a lot going on
in your life that must be stressful.

106
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:25,848
You think?

107
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,298
Is there anybody
you feel comfortable

108
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:36,142
talking with about how you feel?

109
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,016
Like who?
My parents?

110
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,290
That's one possibility, yeah.

111
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,506
Well, if I tell my mom,

112
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,868
she calls my dad
and then they argue.

113
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,714
And what kind of things
do they argue about?

114
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:57,874
Everything.

115
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,753
Today they had a fight because

116
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,048
my mom says I'm not getting enough
sleep and my dad says I'm not healthy.

117
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,176
And what does he mean
by that, "not healthy"?

118
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:08,486
Fat.

119
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:13,776
Has your dad ever told you
that he thinks you're fat?

120
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,658
I know he thinks I'm fat.

121
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,312
Everybody thinks I'm fat,
because I'm fat.

122
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:22,889
So,

123
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:27,194
being fat seems to be something
that really bothers you.

124
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,828
Do you think I'm fat?

125
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,887
What I'm concerned
about is what you think,

126
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,458
and I think it makes you upset just
from the way you talk about it.

127
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,174
I don't talk about it.
It's all the kids at school that do.

128
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,635
And what do they say to you?

129
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,945
We're reading "Lord Of The Flies"

130
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,357
and we have to write this essay on

131
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,547
the character
that we think we're the most like.

132
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:00,807
So everybody
in the class starts laughing,

133
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:04,401
because they say I should write
about the character named piggy,

134
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,976
which is the fat character
in the book.

135
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,351
So that's what they call me now...

136
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:10,654
piggy.

137
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,225
That's a pretty cruel thing to do.

138
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,799
Whatever. And last saturday,
this girl Maya had a Bat Mitzvah

139
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,921
and her dad got
all this chocolate for the party.

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,845
This kid Eric texts
everybody and says,

141
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,507
"if you want chocolate, then you'd
better get there before Oliver does."

142
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,717
Sounds like a real prize, this Eric.

143
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,715
He's an asshole. I didn't even want
to go to the stupid party anyway.

144
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:36,921
Did you tell your mom that?

145
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,020
Why not?

146
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,082
Because she would've called my dad

147
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,407
and then they would've had a fight.

148
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,735
So you went to the party
even though you didn't want to?

149
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:50,597
Kind of.

150
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,195
My mom dropped me off
and when I got there

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,823
I knew everybody
was upstairs in Maya's room,

152
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,124
so I snuck out the back door

153
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,040
and hid behind a bush.

154
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,694
You hid behind a bush
for the whole party?

155
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:07,212
It was fine till everybody
came outside to play in the snow.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,423
Did anybody see you out there?

157
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,183
Eric came behind
the bush to take a leak.

158
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:14,688
And?

159
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,920
He pulled out his dick
and pissed all over my shoes.

160
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,249
What happened then?

161
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:23,619
And then

162
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,389
he went back to hang out with the other
kids and they went back inside.

163
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,374
Sounds pretty awful.

164
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,446
Did you tell anybody about this?

165
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,526
I know if it happened
to me I'd find it

166
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,304
pretty hard if I didn't have anybody
to talk to about it.

167
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,653
If I tell my mom,

168
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:47,433
then she calls my dad,

169
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,795
then they fight

170
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,483
and I don't want it to be my fault

171
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,055
What don't you want
to be your fault?

172
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,069
If they get a divorce.

173
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,364
Have your mom and dad talked

174
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,771
to you at all about
the divorce since last week?

175
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:16,323
There was this couple that came out
of your office earlier.

176
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,082
Were they married?

177
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:21,370
Did they look married to you?

178
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,203
Do I have to guess?
Why can't you tell me?

179
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,459
I don't tell my other patients
about you

180
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:30,951
and...

181
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:34,132
that means I can't tell you
about other patients.

182
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,635
Why would happy people come here?

183
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,918
Sometimes people come to therapy,
they talk about how they feel

184
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:43,843
and they leave just feeling better.

185
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,981
Can you make my mom and dad happy?

186
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:55,881
What I can do is I can
make communication between

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,111
your mom, your dad and you

188
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,076
a little better...

189
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,441
But I can't make them happy.

190
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,590
Would it be okay if I invited your mom
and dad into the room?

191
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:16,406
Sure.

192
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,595
Sweetie, come over here.

193
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,121
So you solve all the problems?
Are we good now?

194
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:47,887
Well...

195
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:51,055
One of the things
that we discussed was the...

196
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:55,675
was the importance of
both of you working together

197
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:59,445
to make sure that Oliver understands

198
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:01,094
what's going on here.

199
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:05,390
You got a pretty clear sense of how well
we all work together, didn't you?

200
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,760
Is there anything
the two of you would...

201
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:13,035
like to discuss with Oliver about

202
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,317
what's happening?

203
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:26,635
Well...

204
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:32,209
First of all, you probably
know this already but...

205
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,277
just in case it isn't clear,

206
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:38,593
your mom and I have decided
that it's best for all of us

207
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,842
if we don't live together anymore.

208
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,455
For good or for just now?

209
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,305
For good.

210
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,106
Is there anything you want to say?

211
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,612
Your dad's right.

212
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,415
For good.

213
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:12,155
Do you have any questions about
what your mom and dad have just said?

214
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,685
Why can't you guys
just live together?

215
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,551
There are a lot of reasons for that.

216
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,919
For one thing,

217
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,075
I'm sure you notice
how much we fight.

218
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,808
Because of me.

219
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:33,445
No, sweetie, you can't ever think
this is about you.

220
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,755
But you guys do fight about me,
all the time.

221
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,545
It's not your fault.

222
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,005
Look, the truth is,
your mom and me, we just...

223
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:44,489
can't get along anymore.

224
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:48,545
That's why we have to get a divorce.

225
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,295
And we love you very much.

226
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:56,405
We don't want to have you see us
go at it all the time.

227
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,415
So you are getting a divorce
because of me.

228
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,736
That's not the way to do it.
You're only confusing him more.

229
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:06,161
Well, at least I'm trying over here.

230
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:14,435
Do you understand what
your dad is saying?

231
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,000
They're getting a divorce because...

232
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,225
I get too upset when they fight.

233
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,504
No, sweetie,

234
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:27,165
what we're trying to say is that...

235
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,660
your dad and I,
we can't stay together.

236
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:31,995
Okay? But we love you.

237
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,505
We love you so much and we're always
gonna love you no matter what...

238
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,045
This is what always happens.

239
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,930
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

240
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,605
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

241
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,080
Why don't you wait
in the other room,

242
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,305
and maybe do some homework,

243
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,732
and we'll call you
in a few minutes, okay?

244
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,630
And you wonder why the kid
can't fall asleep at night.

245
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:19,155
Would you stop it?

246
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,967
At least I'm letting myself
feel sad about this.

247
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:24,380
- You don't think I'm sad?
- {\Well, }You seem to be priding yourself

248
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:26,132
on how quickly you can just move on.

249
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Pride?

250
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,255
Look, I hate that
all this is happening,

251
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,680
but I don't think it's fair to our son
when you start crying in front of him.

252
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,235
Don't you think
I'm right about that, Paul?

253
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:39,748
Well, what I can tell you is that
I think that your son's sleeplessness

254
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,273
and his overeating

255
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:46,345
is probably caused by the pressure
that you're all under.

256
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,104
That's what I've been trying
to explain to her for months now.

257
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,087
You know he believes
the divorce is all his fault,

258
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,660
and that's entirely natural.

259
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,485
He also believes that
if he behaves in a...

260
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,421
particular way, it'll bring you two
back together again.

261
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,048
That's also a natural fantasy.

262
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,795
But because things
are so tense between you,

263
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,445
at the moment, he feels that...

264
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:18,365
he can't talk to you
about his problems.

265
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,895
For instance, there's a...

266
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,899
There's a boy at school
who's been picking on him.

267
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:26,615
And...

268
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:30,355
Oliver feels that he can't
speak to you about this

269
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,498
because he doesn't want
to upset you.

270
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,795
But I can tell you that he feels...

271
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,495
completely helpless.

272
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,566
You're saying that maybe
we shouldn't get divorced.

273
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,585
No, that's...

274
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,500
I don't think that's what I...

275
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,881
what I meant.

276
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:52,245
{\But }That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
{\I mean, }How selfish and how cowardly it is

277
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,220
for us to just throw in the towel
and wreck our son's life over...

278
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,099
over small stuff?

279
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:01,126
- Small stuff?
- We're both stubborn, that's all.

280
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,408
We fight about stupid things,
like how late you could stay at work,

281
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,350
how my mother drives you crazy.

282
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,725
How my friends are a bad influence,
how I curse too much,

283
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,932
how everything I do
is a bad influence on our kid.

284
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,157
And so what?

285
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:13,839
I mean, really, so what?

286
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:17,210
We're supposed to be just perfectly
in love for the rest of our lives?

287
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,032
I can't believe
we're having this {\*conversation}talk.

288
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,500
Maybe we're just going
through a rough patch here.

289
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,380
You know, what if
we just stay the course?

290
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,293
Maybe we'll come out
the other side of this.

291
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,910
Wouldn't that be better for Oliver?

292
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:31,079
Isn't there a whole book about
how parents should stay together

293
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,050
no matter how unhappy they are

294
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,261
and ultimately it's better
for the children?

295
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:39,845
That's a question that I think
a lot of couples struggle with.

296
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,725
What I care about
is what's best for...

297
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,439
for the three of you.

298
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,235
As bad as it's been between us,

299
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,790
it hasn't been any better now
that we're broken up,

300
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,415
not for me anyway...

301
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:02,706
And {\especially }not for Oliver.

302
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,174
We owe it to him

303
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:06,800
to stop and think about
what we're doing before we just...

304
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,962
we move past the point
of no return here.

305
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm already past that point.

306
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,670
You like to say things like that,
but is that really true?

307
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,720
I mean, come on,
are you really happy

308
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,695
living all alone so far away
from your family?

309
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:29,065
I'm seeing someone else.

310
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:38,950
- {\Bess, }Why don't you come back and sit down?
- {\Oliver, }Pack up your stuff. We have to go {\right }now.

311
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,535
Bess, can you please...

312
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,038
- No, {\I don't think }there's anything {\left }to talk about.
- I thought this was {\supposed to be }my night with him.

313
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,666
- {\No, }He's not gonna go with you.
- So you get to make that decision?

314
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:49,544
Please, if you'll both sit down,
we can make the decision together.

315
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,330
{\Well, }He's {\*certainly }not gonna go stay with him if
you're having women {\over }at your apartment.

316
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,855
Does Oliver know about
your new little girlfriend?

317
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:00,475
I guess he does now.

318
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,809
I thought you were the one who wanted
to break things to him gently.

319
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,000
Would you tell him that it's too soon
{\for him }to start seeing {\other }women,

320
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,273
that it would be bad{\ for Oliver}?

321
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,462
{\Bess, }I don't think we're ever gonna
figure out what's good or bad for Oliver

322
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,446
if whenever either of you get upset,
you end the session.

323
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,824
- So you're gonna skip your class again{\ tonight}?
- No, I dropped my class.

324
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:23,360
And it's a good thing{\ I did}, because one of us
needs to be {\a }responsible {\parent }right now.

325
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,770
Now see? She's just using Oliver
as an excuse.

326
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,560
She's never gonna get her degree,
she's never gonna move on,

327
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:31,155
and she's gonna keep saying
it's all because he needs her,

328
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,090
and that's complete bullshit.
The kid needs to be allowed to grow up.

329
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,468
So, honey...
Oliver, this bag, it's a mess.

330
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,262
How is he ever gonna grow up
if you keep treating him like a baby?

331
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,724
Isn't it my night to go with dad?

332
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,115
Not if you're not ready.

333
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:51,415
It's fine.

334
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,695
It's my night with dad
and I want to stay with him.

335
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:59,450
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- Hey, it's our night.

336
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,783
He wants to be with me.
What's the problem?

337
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:08,995
No, it's no problem.

338
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,135
That's why we're here.

339
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,855
You have a good time
with your dad, okay?

340
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,763
I'll pick you up on thursday
after school.

341
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,830
See you next week, Paul.

342
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:29,955
Bye, mom.

343
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,193
Why don't you walk us to the train?

344
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,792
You're gonna get a bad back
carrying all this.

345
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,378
I can never figure out what I need.

346
00:20:58,835 --> 00:20:59,835
So long.

347
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,160
Next time we'll stay
for the whole session.

348
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:04,735
That would be nice.

349
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,308
Take care, Oliver.
See you next week.

350
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,075
Can you give me a minute? Thank you.
