1
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:27,552
Do we have to wait for my mom
to get back from the deli?

2
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,615
Yeah. We also too wait for your dad.

3
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:34,858
My dad might not make it on time

4
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:37,828
this is a really crazy week
for him at his job.

5
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,003
Does he work a lot?

6
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,428
I guess so.

7
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,755
What are we supposed to do
until they both get here?

8
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,757
We could play game, if you want.

9
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,376
I've got a bunch of games
back here if you want to...

10
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,351
If you want to take a look.

11
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:01,984
There might be...

12
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:06,440
There might be something here that...
Do you like any of these.

13
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,114
Do you have any cards?

14
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,381
Cards...

15
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:17,547
Okay. Maybe...

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,260
I should have...

17
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,127
Somewhere in this mess.

18
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:27,433
Here we go.

19
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,864
So what kind of...

20
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:35,387
What kind of game
would you like to play?

21
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:39,377
Hearts, war, crazy eights?

22
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,443
Black jack.

23
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:43,978
I'll deal.

24
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,797
Whichever one of us gets
to 21 without going over wins the hand.

25
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:17,264
If you stick on anything below 15,

26
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:19,130
you fuck the deck.

27
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,726
- Am I allowed to say that here?
- Sure you can tell anything you like.

28
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:25,426
Okay.

29
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:31,826
I think I'm going to stick

30
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,327
but you can stick on 15.

31
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,701
You kind of suck at this game,
don't you?

32
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:41,581
I do.

33
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,497
I don't understand the rules.
I hope that doesn't piss you off.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,065
I'm not pissed off. It's just...

35
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:50,836
If you don't know the rules, why play?
You're just wasting your time here.

36
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,672
I guess it's a good point.
You're right.

37
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:55,863
I have a question?

38
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:57,818
Why am I here?

39
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,195
Nobody is explained it to you?

40
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:03,239
My mom says we're coming
here so I'll fell better.

41
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:05,643
My dad says we're coming here,
because we have to.

42
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll tell you what I know. {\you know} that you're
mom and dad are in the process

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,442
of getting a divorce.

44
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,336
No, they're not.

45
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,399
So...

46
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,614
Nobody explains this to you?

47
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,829
My parents are getting a divorce.

48
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,657
My dad is just not living
in home right now.

49
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:28,542
That's...

50
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,104
That's true.

51
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:33,505
But...

52
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,960
You know that...

53
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,696
They're separated.

54
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:42,088
But that doesn't mean that
they're getting a divorce.

55
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:45,228
Can I...

56
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,743
Can I ask you what...

57
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,419
Your mom and dad have told you?

58
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,192
My dad moved out.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,181
So...

60
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,903
How do you feel about that?
What's that like for you?

61
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:00,479
T's a pain and it's annoying.

62
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,310
Do you Miss your dad?

63
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,066
I still get to see him.

64
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,865
It's just annoying.

65
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,737
Well, there must be a great
deal about this situation

66
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,749
that you find annoying.

67
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,012
You still haven't
told me why I'm here.

68
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:16,864
You're here because your mom
and dad are separated now

69
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:17,978
and...

70
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,635
They want to make sure
that they both see you.

71
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,999
But I've been told that

72
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:28,392
the last month or so that you've been
refusing to stay at your dad's place.

73
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,664
So the reason we're
all meeting here today

74
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,692
is so that we can find
an answer, a solution.

75
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,980
Did I explain that properly?
Does it make sense?

76
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,013
Okay, good.

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,532
Maybe you can explain
something to me:

78
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,562
why don't you want to stay
at your dad's place?

79
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,160
- I don't like his apartment.
- Okay.

80
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,970
- What do you not like about it?
- It's on the upper east side.

81
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:54,668
And what's wrong with that?

82
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,308
Have you been to
the upper east side?

83
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:03,016
Well, what... What specifically
do you not like about the neighborhood?

84
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,638
My real home is here in brooklyn,

85
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,151
and my house is pretty
close to my school.

86
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,040
It takes me
about five minutes to walk there,

87
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:14,730
but at his place I have to get up
an hour early to ride the 4 train.

88
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:18,763
So then what you're saying
is that your dad's apartment is...

89
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,109
It's inconvenient.

90
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,697
Yes, and plus he never has any food.

91
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,157
No food at all?

92
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,153
Okay...

93
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:30,116
Maybe protein shakes,
mustard and advil,

94
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:33,810
but when he works late
he leaves money on the counter.

95
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,845
There's this fancy
grocery store downstairs,

96
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,421
but all they really have
is jars of weird olives,

97
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:43,880
so I get a candy bar or I call empire
szechuan and get some spare ribs.

98
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:47,346
You do all this shopping
by yourself? That's a big job.

99
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,358
It's the main reason I
don't like staying there.

100
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,657
Any other reasons
you don't like staying there?

101
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,273
It's hard for me to go to sleep.

102
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,857
Can't sleep at night there.

103
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,869
No, not normally. It's just
when my dad's friends come over.

104
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,591
And what happens then?

105
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,852
They hog the wii
and stay up really late.

106
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,061
Wait. What does that mean?
They...

107
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:09,804
- They what?
- The wii.

108
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,852
- The wii.
- It's a video game system.

109
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:14,741
My dad got it for
me for my birthday.

110
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:15,866
He says...

111
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:18,881
If I'm going to spend all
my time playing video games,

112
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,977
I might as well be moving.
But when his friends come over,

113
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:24,662
they play guitar hero over and over.

114
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:27,337
My mom says it's embarrassing...

115
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,847
All these 30-year-old
men playing with toys.

116
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,625
So your mom isn't happy with...

117
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,037
What goes on at your dad's house?
Did she say that to you?

118
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,231
Yeah, she doesn't
think it's a good...

119
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,166
The type of environment
I should be in...

120
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,542
... On school nights.

121
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:45,543
She wants me to eat a good dinner,
finish all my homework,

122
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,264
nd go to bed on time
so I do good in school.

123
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,617
Don't you... Don't
you want that too?

124
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,252
I guess so. It's my job.

125
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:58,318
So just to sum up so far:
your dad's apartment is too far away,

126
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,305
there's not enough food there

127
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,630
and you find it very difficult to sleep
at night-time when his friends are over.

128
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,917
Is there anything else?

129
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:09,478
Isn't that enough?

130
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:12,589
I just want to make sure
that I haven't left anything out.

131
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,241
Why? You can't do anything about it.

132
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,273
Maybe together we can.

133
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:20,364
For instance,
we can tell your dad it's hard to sleep

134
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,400
when his friends
come over on school nights.

135
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:26,881
And if we tell him
that you don't have enough to eat,

136
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,678
maybe he could go shopping for you.

137
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,351
If we...

138
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,770
You and I...
Talk to him together,

139
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,710
it'll be easier,
I think, for you to stay with him.

140
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,119
What do you think?

141
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,678
I'm sorry to interrupt,
I was just wondering if Oliver's father

142
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,758
had finally shown up
while I was out.

143
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,237
Not yet, bess, but

144
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,988
Oliver and I were just
having a little chat, so

145
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,165
if you'd like to just wait in the
waiting room till he gets here.

146
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,314
I'm a little worried though,

147
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,675
because the session's half
over and he hasn't arrived yet.

148
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,371
He works in new jersey and he lives
on the godforsaken upper east side.

149
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,491
Sometimes I think he goes out
of his way to be inaccessible

150
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,474
is that my snack?

151
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,103
Here you go, baby.

152
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,227
I have to make sure Oliver
gets something healthy to eat.

153
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,483
He's supposed to stay
with his father tonight

154
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,671
and I have to be
at the new school by 5:30...

155
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,301
So... Sure, but actually we were
in the middle of a conversation,

156
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,615
so if you don't mind, you can
wait in the waiting room until...

157
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:33,804
Just...

158
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:37,182
I guess I have to go now.

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,156
Why can't she stay with us?

160
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:42,564
Sure.

161
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:50,354
I hope it's okay to bring
a snack into your office.

162
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,271
It's just his father
never has any food at the house, so...

163
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,494
Actually,
we were just talking about that.

164
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,051
Oliver tells me
it's like a freshman dorm over there.

165
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,879
I've sent Luke like a million
emails about it,

166
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,490
but he never writes me back, so...

167
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,998
We were just trying
to figure out some ways

168
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:11,675
that we could maybe
address that issue.

169
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:15,087
Good. That would be wonderful,
because I do want

170
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,044
Oliver to feel safe
at his father's house,

171
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,560
so... A lot of things are definitely
gonna have to change around there.

172
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,939
So, Oliver, you and your mom have
discussed this already?

173
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,863
It's hard enough for him to
be away from his own bedroom...

174
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,657
You know, his desk, his books and...

175
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,499
All his stuff, you know.

176
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,859
So you and Oliver are still in the same
apartment that you all used to live in?

177
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,196
As long as we can afford it.

178
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,295
Luke wants to sell, but I think
there's been enough upheaval already.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,081
I'm so sorry.

180
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,687
You must be paul.

181
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,763
It's been a real crazy week but I know
that's no excuse.

182
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,970
Please sit down. We were
just getting started.

183
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,174
All right.

184
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,476
Is that for me?

185
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,044
Yeah, it's swag.

186
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,260
We had a presentation
with the vendors today.

187
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:10,322
Of course they kept me late, but
at least you got something out of it{\, right?}.

188
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,136
- Yeah.
- This is what he does:

189
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,440
he arrives late with apologies and gifts
as if that's gonna make up for it.

190
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,417
Hey, believe me, I wanted
to be here today,

191
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,181
on time, because I wanted to get here
before she had a chance

192
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:22,871
to say too many things like that.

193
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,582
Everything's a joke with him,
except it's never really a joke.

194
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,834
{\Hey, }Put that away.
This is important, all right?

195
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,595
Now that we're all here,
I think there's...

196
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:39,185
There's a few things that we need
to go over together.

197
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:43,183
Oliver, would you mind waiting
in the other room for a few minutes.

198
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,170
While I talk to your mom and dad?

199
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,099
Let me help you with that.

200
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,942
Yeah, go on. Go ahead.

201
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,655
Before we do anything else,
I'd like to...

202
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,597
set some ground rules for ourselves
and some goals.

203
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,365
That's why we're here.

204
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,635
We don't want our divorce
to upset him.

205
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,063
It's already upsetting him,
isn't it?

206
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,115
He's confused, yeah,

207
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,694
and when he's confused,
he gets upset.

208
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,650
You know,

209
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:41,475
one of the things that I learned
from talking to Oliver is that

210
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:46,345
he doesn't actually know
that you two are getting a divorce.

211
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,756
Does that surprise you?

212
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,216
{\Well, }It's really sad, but I have to say
it's not shocking.

213
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,927
Really? Why do you say that?

214
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,055
Because she won't ever
be straight with {\the kid}him.

215
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,250
Whenever she talks to him about it,

216
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,268
she makes it sound like
we're just taking a time out.

217
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,530
I've been perfectly clear with him.

218
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:13,150
Luke is the one
who never explains anything.

219
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,702
He told Oliver that he was moving out
while they were watching the Mets on TV.

220
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,527
Bess.

221
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,868
While they were watching {\a Mets game}the Mets,
during a commercial{\ break}.

222
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,055
He didn't give {\him }a chance
to ask {\any }questions.

223
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,367
Come on. Let's...

224
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,035
Let's not...

225
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:28,690
Well,

226
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:33,315
obviously the divorce is confusing
and emotional for both of you,

227
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:38,030
but you can imagine
how overwhelming it is for Oliver.

228
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,960
But does he understand now
that we're getting a divorce?

229
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:43,935
- Did you explain that to him?
- No, I didn't,

230
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,732
because I don't believe
that it's my job

231
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:52,305
to tell him things that you both
find painful to say to him.

232
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:02,047
I think that one of the things
we need to work on is the best way to...

233
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,115
communicate with him yourselves.

234
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:06,805
You know, it...

235
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,575
It's hard for me to try
to be a father with him

236
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,998
when he won't even
come over to my apartment.

237
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,166
Okay, let's... let's talk
about that for a moment.

238
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,390
Oliver told me that
he doesn't feel that...

239
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,008
he can eat properly at your place.

240
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:24,360
Well, it's true. He's right.

241
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:26,559
There's never anything
in his refrigerator.

242
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:31,015
No but there's money and menus for him
to buy whatever he needs for dinner.

243
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,098
I'm trying to teach the kid to...

244
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:37,149
- fend for himself.
- He's too young for that.

245
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,520
So...

246
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:42,495
The way you see it, Luke,
is that Oliver is...

247
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,595
Well, you're helping him
become more mature by...

248
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,970
giving him responsibility,
by choosing his own meals.

249
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:54,990
When I was his age, I was cooking
dinner for my family every night.

250
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,340
Since Luke's family neglected him,

251
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,625
I guess we're supposed
to neglect Oliver. That...

252
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,975
It's not neglect when
you're trying to teach your kid...

253
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,550
You're not teaching him anything.

254
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,761
You're handing him money
and then leaving him all alone.

255
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,929
We can solve the problem of what's
in the refrigerator, but I think...

256
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,025
You know, I think
there's something...

257
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:17,115
There's something else
going on here.

258
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,598
When Oliver says there's nothing to eat,
I know this sounds a little strange,

259
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:24,578
but it may be his way of saying that

260
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,616
he's not feeling nurtured.

261
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,328
Well, that's not exactly
Luke's strong suit.

262
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,515
Have you looked at the kid?

263
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,411
He's getting way too much
of that kind of nurturing already.

264
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,486
It isn't just about the food.

265
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,290
Maybe this is his way of saying

266
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,799
that he misses you both
and the home you shared together.

267
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,843
Isn't that why we're here,
{\so he'll}to get over that?

268
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,391
I think that one of the ways
that we can help {\Oliver}him is that

269
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:51,993
although he lives
in two different homes,

270
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:56,061
it's important that he adhere
to the same set of rules.

271
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:00,649
For example, you want to make sure
that Oliver eats well, right?

272
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,661
And you, Luke, you want to
give him the responsibility

273
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:08,073
of taking care of himself.
Maybe we can combine both those goals.

274
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:12,744
I just think that we're already
asking him to grow up too fast.

275
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:15,562
Maybe there's a way

276
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,635
to help him achieve
a certain kind of...

277
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,293
independence.

278
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,796
I'll be happy to help him
if I ever get to see him.

279
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:27,071
When Oliver comes to me and tells me he
can't fall asleep at his father's place,

280
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:29,344
{\I think }I have every right to be
{\a little }concerned about that.

281
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,252
So you've been asking Oliver about

282
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,665
what it's like at Luke's house?

283
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,722
- Grilling him is more like it.
- Of course I have.

284
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:43,165
I met Luke in college and I know how
he used to live before we got married.

285
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,858
You know, the real reason why the kid
can't fall asleep at my place

286
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:51,623
is because whenever he used
to wake up in the middle of the night

287
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,348
she'd let him climb
into bed with us.

288
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,973
- {\Oh, }For crying out loud.
- He's still climbing into bed with her.

289
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:58,448
- How inappropriate is that?
- One time.

290
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:00,539
One night when had just moved out,

291
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,836
he was feeling lonely,
so I let him sleep in our bed.

292
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:07,465
I'm just curious, Luke:
how did you find out about this?

293
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,387
I asked the kid
how his mom is doing,

294
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,970
he tells me she practically
begged him to sleep in our bed.

295
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,015
It sounds like, to me,

296
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:17,473
that you're both asking Oliver

297
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,136
to inform on each other.

298
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,275
I think one of the things that
we have to work on is taking him

299
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:24,750
out of the crossfire.

300
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,146
The reason that Oliver
can't fall asleep at Luke's

301
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,156
is because Luke
invites his friends over

302
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,538
to stay up past midnight
playing cards and getting drunk.

303
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:33,825
Nobody's getting drunk.

304
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,848
I haven't had a drink in two years
and she knows that.

305
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,955
What I know is that
you're up every night

306
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,310
- partying like you're back at the frat.
- I'm hardly partying.

307
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,626
I'm paying for a wife and a kid,
putting them both through school,

308
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,714
and I'd bet he graduates
before she does.

309
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,121
If my memory serves, we agreed

310
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:59,546
that I would be a stay-at-home mom
so that someone is available for Oliver.

311
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:02,687
It's lucky if he ever
gets home by 9:00 at night.

312
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,955
{\You know, }If the two of you are interested
in couple's therapy,

313
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,960
- I can make a recommendation.
- Thanks, but no thanks.

314
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:12,085
The only good thing about {\getting }a divorce
is that we're done with all that.

315
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,282
Okay, since we're not here
to discuss your relationship,

316
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,520
it might be a good idea from here on

317
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,960
to schedule separate meetings.

318
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:22,330
No, actually, I'd rather not.

319
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,927
I mean, I wanna make sure
that we are all on the same page.

320
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,462
{\And }I wanna make sure I'm here
to hear what she says about me.

321
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:31,825
Then can we agree that our job
is to focus entirely on Oliver?

322
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,339
Is everything okay?

323
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,725
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

324
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:45,455
It's fine.

325
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,575
I can deal with it later.

326
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:50,975
Oliver, why don't you come in
and join us?

327
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,418
I was wondering if there was
anything that you wanted to say,

328
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,955
now that we're all together.

329
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,890
Well, I know I'm supposed
to stay at my dad's, but...

330
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,383
it's hard when his friends
come over on school nights.

331
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:17,410
Well, up until now I thought
you liked hanging out with us.

332
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:19,535
I do like it, it's fun, but...

333
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:23,385
it's hard for me to go to sleep
and finish all my homework.

334
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,062
All right, I've got it.

335
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,880
So from now on, just...

336
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,635
you and me on school nights.

337
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,115
- Good?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:36,765
So, Oliver, is there anything else
that you'd like to say to your dad?

339
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,267
Can you go shopping for food
so I have something to eat after school?

340
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,500
Sweetie, how about this: how about
we make up a list together,

341
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,425
a shopping list you can give to your dad
and then you {\two }can go shopping together?

342
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,337
- I guess so.
- All right.

343
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:55,555
All right, so anything else
you'd like to clear up?

344
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:58,365
I don't know.

345
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,220
{\Now look, }Kiddo, it's important to both your mom
and me that you feel okay about this,

346
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:06,445
that way we can all start
moving on with our lives.

347
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:11,335
We'll never force you to do anything
you're not ready for, okay?

348
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:21,700
- I don't wanna stay at my dad's house.
- Oliver, come...

349
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,580
I wanna stay at my real house.

350
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,305
Oliver, even though

351
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,138
your dad has agreed
to make some changes,

352
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,657
are you saying that
you would still be uncomfortable

353
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:34,285
- staying at his apartment?
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

354
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,115
She rearranges both our lives

355
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,793
just for this,

356
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,025
then throws it all out
the minute he pitches a fit.

357
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,892
Shit.

358
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,817
Oliver, are you...
Are you coming or aren't you?

359
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,154
You don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do, okay?

360
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:59,875
Oh, that's great.

361
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,450
That's really gonna
help him grow up.

362
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,185
Thanks, Bess.

363
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,395
I wanna apologize for Luke.

364
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,441
But then I always
wanna apologize for Luke.

365
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:22,166
I should probably stop
doing that, right?

366
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,845
Maybe we should apologize
to Oliver too.

367
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:29,035
Sometimes, adults forget the rules.

368
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,495
- I guess it all continues.
- Yeah.

369
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,905
- Let's go.
- Okay, Oliver?

370
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,385
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

371
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,775
No, no, no, no,
I'll take care of it.

372
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,270
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

373
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,395
Bye.
