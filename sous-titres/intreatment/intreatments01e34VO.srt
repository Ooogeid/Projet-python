Previously on <i>In Treatment...</i>

00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:06,051
You really want me to give you
permission to have sex with your boss?

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:08,468
Just once, just tell me
it's not that bad.

4
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,598
I think it might be that bad.

5
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,960
Do you really think
that sleeping with Reeves

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,145
is gonna bring back
the good old reliable

7
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:18,157
angry, controlling Jake,

8
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:20,848
the one who fights you
and threatens you?

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,970
Your father died when you were 13?

10
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,323
- You must have been pretty devastated.
- I was.

11
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:29,652
He was a lovely man.
He was affectionate and great.

12
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,072
And yet when Jake is tender
and he expresses his love

13
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:37,178
through tenderness, it makes you angry.
Do you feel that you deserve that love?

14
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:39,376
It's not love. It's neediness.

15
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:41,235
It's weakness. It's unbearable.

16
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,656
So it's only love if he
chases you, stalks you,

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,341
tapes you, is jealous
of you, is that it?

18
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:54,925
- Hello, Jake.
- Hey, Paul. You miss me?

19
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:02,155
Amy's on the phone in the car.
She'll be right in.

20
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,541
You know, we've been sitting
out there for a while.

21
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:09,747
- You got a pretty nice 'hood here.
- It's come a long way since we...

22
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,951
- Since we bought the house.
- I'll say.

23
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:15,081
The houses here must be in,
like, the seven figures, right?

24
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,177
Why do you ask?
Are you interested in the market?

25
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,720
It's too rich for my blood.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,001
But, if I were you, I would sell while
the market's still good.

27
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:28,154
Get a bunch of acres over in Middleburg.
You ever been over there? Horse country.

28
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:31,027
I know. My daughter used to take

29
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:33,229
horse-riding lessons out there.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,517
I sometimes fool around
with the idea of selling, actually.

31
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,575
Really?

32
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:40,979
'Cause you don't seem the type
who fools around with anything.

33
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:47,396
- How long you been here?
- Long time now.

34
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,770
Twenty-two years, maybe.

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,435
You know the Appalachian trail
goes through this area?

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,334
I knew that.

37
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:57,767
I hiked the whole thing when I was 17,
dropped out of high school to do it.

38
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:59,488
- Did I ever tell you that?
- No.

39
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,515
In fact, I even came
into the town to stock up.

40
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,866
Maybe we met 20 years ago
in a convenience store.

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,264
Paul, if a guy like you
and a guy like me met

42
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:12,234
under different circumstances,

43
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:15,347
- you think we'd be friends?
- Possible, I suppose.

44
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:18,700
But I know nothing about
the contemporary music scene.

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,218
Neither do I, man.

46
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:24,716
Why do you think I spend half my time
making cabinets for a living?

49
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,346
We drove here together today.

50
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,111
It's part of the new plan:

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,650
trying to be agreeable,
accommodating.

52
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,634
She wanted to come together,
we do it.

53
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,593
She wanted to drive, I let her.

54
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,158
It's been a couple years since
I drove with her in her car,

55
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:10,887
and as soon as we pulled out of
the driveway, I remembered why.

56
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,414
You see, for Amy,

57
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,474
the car is her favorite
place to conduct business,

58
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:20,802
but she doesn't think
it's safe to talk and drive,

59
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,588
so she has to pull over
and not just anywhere.

60
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,282
No, not just anywhere. It has to be
a proper parking place.

61
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,798
No yellow curbs, no handicapped spaces
for this lady.

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,612
- Do you park in handicapped spaces?
- I don't park in a handicapped space,

63
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,304
but I'll park in a yellow
or a red, sure.

64
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,516
- Not worried about getting a ticket?
- No, fuck 'em.

65
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:45,480
So why didn't you offer to drive?

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,120
See, a while ago,

67
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,979
I fell asleep once at the wheel.

68
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,937
Once, while I was taking her
to the airport.

69
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:56,804
I had been working all night.
I was really tired

70
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,401
and we were stuck in traffic.
I must've closed my eyes

71
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,525
for no more than 10 sec. Next thing
I know, she's screaming at me:

72
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,169
"Get out of the car!
You almost killed us!"

73
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,340
Ever since then,
she never lets me drive her

74
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,185
and I don't like to be
driven by a chick, so...

75
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:17,129
The truth is, she's a much better driver
than I am anyway.

76
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,243
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Amy.

77
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,133
Late again, sorry.

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,700
Making up for last week.

79
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,275
- What happened last week?
- I was early.

80
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,445
- You were early?
- Yes, last week I was early,

81
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:38,104
this week I'm late.
I said I was sorry.

82
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,297
What?

83
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:43,203
What?

84
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,243
- You've got that face.
- What face?

85
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,240
I said I was sorry.
What do you wanna do?

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,418
Slap my hand?
Go on, slap my hand then.

87
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:54,801
I was late on purpose. I thought
you and Paul could catch up.

88
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,368
Amy, it's OK. Relax.

89
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,116
Don't tell me to relax.
It's annoying.

90
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,468
So how have you both been?

91
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,049
Fine.

92
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,070
- How are you?
- I'm well, thank you.

93
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:24,913
I just want to acknowledge,
Jake, that Amy and I met alone

94
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,850
- last week.
- He knows that.

95
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,819
Yes, I know he knows that.

96
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,252
Then why did you find it
necessary to say it?

97
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:34,389
Just so that we'd be clear.

98
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,800
I was meeting with a producer

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,762
who's talking about buying
some of my songs for this artist of his.

100
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,054
And, is he?

101
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,728
Are you trying to pick a fight?

102
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:51,637
Just kidding.

103
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,732
You're just kidding.

104
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,551
My bad. I think I left
my funny detector in the car,

105
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,085
so I couldn't tell.

106
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,148
I think Amy's been really
stressed out at work.

107
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:12,713
I'm not stressed out.
Work's the same as usual.

108
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,452
You've been killing yourself.

109
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:19,404
Your boss is a total asshole.
And he's been working her to the bone.

110
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,052
- Will you stop it?
- What?

111
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,221
"Works me to the bone". You make it
sound like I work in a factory.

112
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,860
I just think you've been
working too hard, that's all.

113
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,720
- I'm worried about you. Can I?
- No, stop it. You're annoying.

114
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:42,596
I don't know what to say here.
When you walk into a minefield,

115
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,909
usually there's some
warning signs, right?

116
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,223
Sorry.

117
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,335
I guess I'm a little tired.

118
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,088
I don't get where it's all coming from.
I thought we had a really good week.

119
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,620
Amy, how did you...

120
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:08,182
How did you feel about the week?

121
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,187
I thought before today, it's been

122
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,004
pretty smooth sailing on
the sea of matrimony here.

123
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:19,526
She'd come home,
I'd cook her some dinner,

124
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,279
we'd have a glass of wine on the porch.
I thought it was nice.

125
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,823
I've become your lapdog too,
so that helps, I guess.

126
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,085
My lapdog?

127
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,410
What does he mean by that?

128
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:30,949
I'm talking about 2 weeks ago,
when I castrated myself

129
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,119
before your eyes.
Don't tell me you don't remember.

130
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,627
You mean when you were honest
with Amy about how you felt?

131
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,756
Yeah, I mean when I begged her
to give a damn about me.

132
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,050
Do you regret that?

133
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,864
I don't,
not if that's what she needs.

134
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,079
What do you mean,
"if that's what she needs"?

135
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,769
What I mean is
I'm trying to keep the peace.

136
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:56,244
Look, I realize I haven't been
the easiest guy to love

137
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,565
but I'm trying to make this work.

138
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,682
I wanna make this work.
So I'm trying.

139
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:06,699
I really thought
we were happy this week.

140
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,313
Of course you did,
because you were happy.

141
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,433
I have been bending over backwards

142
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,957
far enough to stick my head up my ass.
You think that's been easy for me?

143
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,367
I don't know what you want. If I worry
about you, it's not good enough.

144
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:22,299
If I back off, it's no good.
I can't win with you.

145
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,779
"I worry about you. I back off.
I can't win."

146
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,919
I, I, I, I...

147
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,780
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

148
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,303
No, forget it.
I shouldn't have come today. I'm sorry.

149
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,450
I'm in a bad mood.
I'll just mess things up.

150
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,204
He's been great, really.
Jake's just wonderful.

151
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,222
I don't know what's wrong with me.

152
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,094
This really just started, Paul.
I mean, she's been great.

153
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:07,161
The last two weeks have been amazing.
There hasn't been a lot of drama.

154
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,852
We haven't even been arguing
about Lenny.

155
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,302
I really...

156
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:18,008
I really felt like
I was giving her what she needs.

157
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:21,774
Sorry.

158
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,412
- What the fuck was that?
- Sorry, Jake.

159
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:29,990
No, did I say something funny?

160
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,385
No, it's just,
you said you know what I need.

161
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,589
For some reason, I found that funny.

162
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:46,010
That's the face Jake makes
when he's about to hit something,

163
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,542
so, watch out.

164
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:04,066
What do you need, Amy?
Just tell me what you need.

165
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:07,070
- Tell me what you need.
- I got what I need... You.

166
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:09,822
You know,

167
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:13,241
I just told you, I really thought
everything was fine for a change.

168
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,995
Well, I'm not coming home exhausted.

169
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,581
I fall asleep because
you've become a fucking tranquilizer.

170
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:22,792
When I came in the house, you used
to grab my ass or you'd kiss me.

171
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:25,128
Now you are trying to be
so tender and sensitive...

172
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,894
When I grabbed your ass, you said

173
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:29,563
- I was treating you like an animal.
- That's true.

174
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,849
What do you think it is
that you want, Amy?

175
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:39,422
I don't know.

176
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,813
I wanna go home.
I shouldn't have come here today.

177
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,320
It was a mistake.

178
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,009
Why do you think that, Amy?

179
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,216
It was a mistake.

180
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,954
- My stomach aches.
- How convenient.

181
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,696
Amy gets these
perfectly-timed stomachaches.

182
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:03,751
They're like her secret weapons.

183
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:05,878
Would you like some tea?

184
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,694
What does it feel like? Does it...

185
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:13,718
It feels like she's having
a conversation she'd rather not have.

186
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,210
I'm asking Amy.

187
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:19,709
It feels like my stomach
is cramping.

188
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,513
The classic stomach cramp.

189
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,522
You see, it's just vague enough

190
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,660
to be completely untreatable.

191
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:30,860
Is it something
that you've had before?

192
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,542
I had the first one
when my father died,

193
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:45,350
but a thousand times
worse than this.

194
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:46,618
You know?

195
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,947
I remember I couldn't stand up.

196
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,833
I was lying curled up
on the pavement

197
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,626
with tears streaming
out of my eyes and...

198
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:06,166
I couldn't move.

199
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,942
Where was this?

200
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,864
Outside an ice cream store.
That's where he died.

201
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,005
He took me for an ice cream.

202
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,668
My mother was
in a horrible mood and...

203
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:24,761
I went to my dad's office and said:
"I wanna run away", and he said:

204
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,686
"That's okay. I wanna run away too,

205
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,557
"but let's stop first
and get an ice cream."

206
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,542
And I knew what he was doing
but I didn't care.

207
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:36,304
I just wanted to get out of the house
and spend time with my dad.

208
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,150
We sat down on the curb
outside the store,

209
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,722
eating our ice cream cones,

210
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:43,592
and we were racing to see
who could finish first and...

211
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,109
I won.

212
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:48,849
So I asked him for money
to buy another cone and...

213
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,720
I went back inside and...

214
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:52,757
A car swung...

215
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,959
into the parking lot
and plowed right into him.

216
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,748
One minute he was sitting there
and the next he was dead.

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,379
Did you see it happen?

218
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:19,532
Yes, it happened and then
all of a sudden there was this...

219
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,303
wave of pain through my stomach.

220
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:23,788
It folded me over.

221
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,879
I had to lie down on the pavement.
I couldn't even stand up

222
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,220
and there were people staring at me.
Someone came over and...

223
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,049
tried to touch me, to help me,

224
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,526
and I just started screaming,
the pain was so great, and...

225
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,345
the paramedics arrived
with two stretchers.

226
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:40,836
They put my father on one,

227
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:48,605
and me on the other
and they took me to the hospital

228
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,603
and my father to the morgue.

229
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:56,582
I don't think
my mother ever forgave me.

230
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:00,996
Forgave you for what?

231
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:05,778
It's okay.

232
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,939
- It wasn't your fault.
- Shut up.

233
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,990
You don't know
what you're talking about.

234
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,903
- What? No, you were just a kid...
- Stop it!

235
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,350
You don't know.
You don't know anything.

236
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,083
You don't know me at all.

237
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,045
I've done terrible things.

238
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,170
- It was an accident
- Really terrible things.

239
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:36,885
I had sex with Ben.

240
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,649
I didn't even enjoy it.

241
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,179
Felt like a whore.

242
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:52,753
He picked me up from here last week
and we went out drinking.

243
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,774
And then we went back to the office
and fucked on the floor.

244
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:57,794
Everyone had gone.

245
00:14:57,914 --> 00:15:01,369
He kept saying disgusting things,
degrading things.

246
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,077
And while I was doing it,
I was asking myself

247
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,632
"Why am I doing this?",
but I couldn't stop.

248
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:10,889
When we finished, he said:
"Lock up.

249
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,105
"I'm tired." And he walked out.

250
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,343
I sat alone for two hours,
drinking coffee,

251
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,617
thinking about what I should do.

252
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:26,548
And I planned to come home and tell you
and quit my job the next day.

253
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:29,466
But in the cab on the way home,
I realized...

254
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,645
I couldn't tell you.

255
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,330
You're laughing.

256
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,622
Apparently so.

257
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,862
- How can you be laughing?
- I don't know.

258
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:12,935
What is he doing?

259
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,841
Maybe he's relieved.

260
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:23,230
Yeah, I think that's it.
That's exactly it... I'm relieved.

261
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,831
This is...

262
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,058
it's always been...

263
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,312
my worst nightmare,

264
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,006
what I'm scared of the most.

265
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,737
And now it's happened
and I feel like...

266
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,328
I feel like this huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

267
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,488
It's gone.

268
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,176
I feel bad for you.

269
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,928
And sad. I think it's sad.

270
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,631
It's really sad that a woman
whose husband breaks down

271
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,661
before her, tells her
he can't live without her

272
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:16,393
goes out and fucks someone else
and hurts herself so bad.

273
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:17,987
I think that's sad.

274
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:26,848
Do you think it's related?

275
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,846
Your telling Amy...

276
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,389
that you love her
and her cheating on you?

277
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:37,462
It seems pretty obvious to me,
but...

278
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,918
What's surprising me, Paul, is...

279
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,628
And maybe I'm just in shock...
Is that I don't feel jealous.

280
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:47,283
I don't feel jealous or angry.

281
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,570
My God, I think I am really being
outstanding here, guys.

282
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,058
I mean, is anyone else
as impressed with me as I am?

283
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,877
I've imagined this over and over again
and I can tell you that I've never...

284
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:11,192
I can tell you that I've never
behaved like such a gentleman.

285
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,166
I just... I feel sad.

286
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,941
For her, for us.

287
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:42,969
He's right about the connection
between what happened with Ben

288
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,858
and what happened here.

289
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,164
From the moment Jake broke down,

290
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:51,320
I've been feeling like
I was gonna lose control.

291
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,468
I feel awful.

292
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,369
Say something.

293
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,476
- How many times did this happen?
- Just once.

294
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,912
It won't happen again.

295
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,881
Why did I do this?

296
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,850
Maybe you've always wanted
to make Jake angry because...

297
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,581
Because you don't trust
his tenderness

298
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,155
and because there's something

299
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:45,314
deep inside you
that wants to be punished.

300
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,984
But Jake has been
working hard lately

301
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:52,968
to be more patient,
to be more supportive.

302
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:57,073
And he's no longer giving you
what you need in that way.

303
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,072
And now that Jake has stopped
punishing you,

304
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,301
you've started to punish
yourself by having sex

305
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:12,008
with somebody that, as you said
yourself, you find repulsive.

306
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,895
You said that after your father died
your mother never forgave you.

307
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:28,209
Maybe you've never
forgiven yourself, Amy,

308
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:32,564
for leaving your father on the curb
while you went to get an ice cream.

309
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,247
Maybe you feel
that if you degrade yourself enough...

310
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,847
Maybe someday
somebody will forgive you...

311
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,792
For...

312
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,081
For everything.

313
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,652
What do you see in me?

314
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,730
How could you possibly be with me?

315
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:16,584
I loved you.

316
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:21,188
"Loved"?

317
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:30,124
That's it?

318
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:43,714
I deserve it.

319
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:45,809
You can hit me if you like.

320
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,400
- No, you can, you can hit me...
- I don't want to hit you, Ame.

321
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,805
We have to pick up Lenny.

322
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,247
- There's still time.
- I really wanna see him.

323
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,049
No, don't go, don't go.

324
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,210
It's too early and the class
doesn't finish until 7:00.

325
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,377
Just don't go, please.
Let's just sit here.

326
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:16,651
Let's just sit here with Paul.
Let's just be quiet for a minute.

327
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,807
Will he forgive me?

328
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,448
Why don't you ask him?
