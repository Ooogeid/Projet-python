1
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,303
You don't get it, do you?
He's sick, Paul.

2
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:09,398
Look, he can't be missing school again.

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:11,810
What is the big deal?
He'she top of his class.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,082
I don't care. He's not staying at home.

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:13,843
I swear to god, Paul,

6
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:14,654
If you take him
out of this house--

7
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:15,803
You swear what?

8
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:22,949
He's here.

9
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,561
Max ?

10
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:27,921
What are you doing ?

11
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,774
I thought you were watching tv.

12
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:34,629
103?!

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,580
You're not 103.

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,286
Your hands are cold.

15
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,415
So i suppose you wanna stay home

16
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,544
From school today.

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,944
We could rent a movie and watch it.

18
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,744
Oh, Max, i'd love to rent

19
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,565
A video and watch it with you,

20
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,244
But i can't.

21
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,808
I got no choice. I've gotta go to work.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,721
You've gotta go to school.

23
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,443
You never believe me.

24
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,756
I couldn't open the door.

25
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:54,655
I'm sorry,
it gets, uh--

26
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,123
It gets stuck.

27
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:57,976
Hi, i'm Paul.

28
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,785
Sophie.

29
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,208
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,281
- Here?
- Yes.

31
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:11,313
- Uh, do you need
any help with the--

32
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:12,875
- No, it's okay. Okay.

33
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,689
Anna Colden recommended
that i talk to you.

34
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,370
Anna Colden?

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,482
She's my lawyer.

36
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,018
She heard about you
from a friend of yours.

37
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,092
I mean, a friend of hers,

38
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,502
Not a friend of yours.

39
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:31,881
From a patient of yours

40
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,502
Who is a friends of hers.

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,749
- Sorry.

42
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,060
So Anna Colden recommended you

43
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:38,940
Through a patient of mine.

44
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,738
Do you know, do you know his name?

45
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,539
- I don't know.

46
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:45,470
- So what-- What did
Anna recommend me for?

47
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,596
After my
accident--

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,463
I told you on the phone
about the accident.

49
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:50,566
Yes.

50
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:51,996
They told me that i need the opinion

51
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,101
Of a psychiatrist

52
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:54,497
Because the insurance company

53
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:55,473
Of the car that hit me

54
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,482
Has a problem with my injuries, or,

55
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,368
Something like that.
So that's why i'm here.

56
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,025
I'm here for your professional opinion,

57
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:04,308
- Not
for--

58
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:05,682
- Not
for--

59
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,098
Not for therapy.

60
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,376
So let's see
if i'm, uh--

61
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,114
If i'm getting this right.

62
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,284
Are you

63
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,198
Suing the insurance company

64
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,583
Of the person who hit you? No,

65
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,781
Their insurance company

66
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,881
Had me talk to a social worker.

67
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,218
She started

68
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,589
Asking me all sorts
of annoying questions.

69
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,886
She was really annoying

70
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,105
So i refused to talk to her.

71
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,914
She started talking to me like

72
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:32,699
She knew me or something, so

73
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,190
I refused to talk.

74
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:35,201
And,

75
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:36,799
That didn't go over so well, so,

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,148
My mother said it would be better

77
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,887
If i came here to talk to you.

78
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:40,911
Okay.

79
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:42,764
So what happened at the accident

80
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,363
That
requires a--

81
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,230
A psychiatric opinion?

82
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,661
I really don't remember what happened.

83
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:54,067
I was on my bicycle
and a car ran into me

84
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,104
And i don't remember what happened next.

85
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,058
What did they tell you afterwards?

86
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,709
That i flew my bike
right into the street.

87
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,691
You're,

88
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:11,652
-
- You're laughing at that.

89
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,451
What that sounds like,

90
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,647
Flying straight into the street?

91
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:16,878
So,

92
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,146
You find that

93
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,660
Funny, yeah?

94
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,745
Because...

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,864
it reminds me of something

96
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,983
About two years ago.

97
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,613
A friend of mine, he,

98
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:33,632
Took me out on this motorbike

99
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,198
And he stopped to get something at

100
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,490
A convenience store.

101
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,862
Anyway, i was really bored, so,

102
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,030
I pretended that i knew how to drive it.

103
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:42,760
You know, you put your
hands on the handlebars

104
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,651
And you go like this. Well,

105
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,966
It was one of those
monster bikes--

106
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:50,123
Just by turning the handle
a little it just flies.

107
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,668
So suddenly i'm like
zoom, and it takes off.

108
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,748
My head whips back like this

109
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,356
And when i looked back down i realize

110
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,143
That i'm riding into the street.

111
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:01,210
Totally crashed into a car.

112
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:08,233
There was this old woman standing nearby

113
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,860
And she saw all this.

114
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,631
"I saw her, she did it on purpose.

115
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:12,659
She tried to kill herself.

116
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,504
She tried to kill herself."

117
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,380
That's what-- That's
what she was yelling?

118
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,929
- Yeah, she was like a crazy woman.

119
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,742
Of course, it couldn't
have been that funny

120
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,548
When it happened, i'm sure.

121
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,170
No, not really.

122
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,159
I wanted to kill her.

123
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,968
I was just lying there.

124
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,439
I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything.

125
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:37,338
I wanted to yell, "shut
up you-- You idiot.

126
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,997
Why are you screaming?"

127
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,427
You know, but i couldn't speak.

128
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,062
It's like
this feeling--

129
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,257
When somebody says something about you

130
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,092
And you can't defend yourself.

131
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:51,639
- Paul: mm-Hmm. -
It's totally unfair.

132
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,785
Like that social worker

133
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,737
You were talking about.

134
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,685
What does-- What does
she have to do with it?

135
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,133
Well, didn't you feel that she was

136
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,364
Speaking for you?

137
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,928
Yeah, but i could have said something.

138
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,793
I just didn't want to.

139
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,700
So tell me a little bit
more about this, uh--

140
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,097
This accident.

141
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,297
It's on that report.

142
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,525
Where did it happen?

143
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,619
In a gas station on madison

144
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,533
Near the gym where i train.

145
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,718
So you were on the way to the gym?

146
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,676
I don't know. I told you

147
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,380
I don't remember anything.

148
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,938
Do you feel comfortable

149
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,776
Talking about yourself, Sophie?

150
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,569
No.

151
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:54,117
My name is Sophie.

152
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:55,896
I'm 16 years old.

153
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,070
I've been a gymnast since the age

154
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,374
Of six and a half.

155
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,684
I was u.S. Junior
champion athe age of 12.

156
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,430
I'm an only child.

157
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,734
I don't know. What do you want to know?

158
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:08,477
In another few months

159
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,028
Are the
national trials--

160
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,465
Last chance to quality for the olympics.

161
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,379
I'm kind of like

162
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,492
An olympic hopeful.

163
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,700
Wow,

164
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,895
That's really impressive.

165
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,651
Congratulations.

166
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:23,690
Thank you.

167
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,537
So how is life in general?

168
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,619
What?

169
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,537
Oh, apart from the gymnastics,

170
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,078
How's life?

171
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,207
It's great.

172
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,619
I-- I st don't
have the energy

173
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:42,603
For "this is your life" right now.

174
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,290
"This is your life"?
What do-- At do you mean?

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,233
You know, like the tv show.

176
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:53,526
You're way too young
to know about that show.

177
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:54,727
It's on dvd.

178
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,676
My mom's friend watches it all the time.

179
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,159
- What do you think of it?
- It's okay.

180
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,824
Some of the people on it are so old.

181
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,445
Why do you think they
put old people on that?

182
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,130
I don't know.

183
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,608
Because they have nothing better to do.

184
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:13,471
They're retired and
they're dying off fast, so,

185
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,606
They put them on the
show before it's too late.

186
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,723
So do you think you can help me

187
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,014
With this professional opinion or not?

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,605
Well, it's not that simple, Sophie.

189
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:28,638
Why not?

190
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:31,643
Because it's not like
an x-Ray where you can

191
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,511
Take photographs, look at the results

192
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,462
And then you go on your way.

193
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,500
It doesn't quite work like that.

194
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,480
Okay.

195
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,148
Okay, so i guess i'll leave. ( Sighs )

196
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,218
Would you at least like to read

197
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,863
What it says in the report?

198
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,374
If you want me to.

199
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,460
- What, like you already
know what it says.

200
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,650
- No.

201
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,669
I have no idea what it says.

202
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:10,341
Listen,

203
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,818
I didn't come here to talk about myself.

204
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:15,644
I just need your opinion.

205
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,383
So you want me to give you my opinion

206
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,388
Based on what i read and

207
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:22,938
The conversation that we've had today.

208
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,371
Is that--
Is that it?

209
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,874
Is that a problem?

210
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:31,165
No.

211
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,750
No.

212
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll write up an opinion and, um,

213
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,803
When you come next week you can decide

214
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:41,536
Whether you want to use it or not.

215
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,005
Just like that without

216
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,672
Any more questions?

217
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,064
Well, what kind of questions

218
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,058
Do you want me to ask?

219
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,723
I don't know, shrink-Like questions.

220
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,210
Say about mom, dad,

221
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,561
That kind of thing?

222
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,427
Doesn't sound like you're interested.

223
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,780
Why would you say that, Sophie?

224
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,968
I am very interested in

225
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:09,525
Everything that you have to say.

226
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,509
I mean that.

227
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,904
You spoke to my mother
already, didn't you?

228
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,995
I didn't speak to your mother.

229
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:19,948
You already know what it says in there.

230
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,095
I've never spoken to your mom.

231
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,018
You did talk to her

232
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,045
And you're just letting me sit here

233
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:23,937
An you know exactly

234
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,565
What's in that envelope.

235
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,365
Was i-- Was i supposed
to talk to her?

236
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,538
What, did you, like, plan everything?

237
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:33,862
Like i'm some kind of idiot,

238
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:36,046
You planned this little charade.

239
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:39,427
What's the point? Whatever.

240
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,178
Of course she would send me

241
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,095
To someone like you.

242
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,684
I should have listened to my father.

243
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,798
He called them a cult
of crazies-- Shit.

244
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,970
Open the door for me, please.

245
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:53,627
- And if i did speak to your mom?

246
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,837
- I knew it.

247
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:57,284
- So what then?
- It means you're a liar,

248
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,552
Okay?

249
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,928
Because i know how
it's supposed to work.

250
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,784
You're supposed to read

251
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:02,876
What's written in that report

252
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:05,459
And ask the stupid
shrink questions you ask.

253
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,082
Doesn't it seem unprofessional

254
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,797
To so not do it that way?

255
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,879
Maybe i have something to say

256
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,606
About what it says in there.

257
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,179
I just wanted to read the report

258
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,729
By myself

259
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:21,345
Before our meeting
next week, that's all.

260
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,656
What meeting next week?

261
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,621
Well, i'd like us to
meet three or four times

262
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:27,668
For me to form an opinion of you.

263
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,527
To get to know you a little,

264
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,268
Don't you think?

265
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,359
Otherwise,

266
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,519
It wouldn't be professional.

267
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,902
I'll read it now,

268
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,871
Okay?

269
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:14,353
So are all these ships

270
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,444
Instead of sailing for real?

271
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,510
At least you won't get seasick.

272
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:24,980
Oh, i don't know about that.

273
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,267
- What do you mean?

274
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,063
- Sometimes i can get quite wobbly

275
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,572
Just sitting right here.

276
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,647
You have to make a round
window to the outside.

277
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,049
Then you'll feel like
you're in a real ship.

278
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,727
Did you really read all those books,

279
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:54,736
Or is just to make an impression?

280
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:58,029
Yes, you read them or yes,

281
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,815
You're trying to make an impression?

282
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,720
Yes,

283
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,092
I read them.

284
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,721
I feel sorry for the books up there.

285
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,962
Why do you feel sorry for them?

286
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,026
Where would you put them?

287
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,551
I don't know. They're
your fucking books,

288
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:32,702
Buster.

289
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,265
You suffer from asthma.

290
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,052
Yeah, how do you know that?

291
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,574
- There's an inhaler here.
- Oh, thanks. I,

292
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,570
I've been looking everywhere for that,

293
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:50,451
Thank you.

294
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:52,897
So what, you could have died without it?

295
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,015
According to what it says here...

296
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,358
it looks like you could have died too.

297
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,083
Yeah, that would have
solved a lot of problems.

298
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,477
What would it solve?

299
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,509
Nothing.

300
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,032
I didn't mean anything by it.

301
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,373
Can i talk to you like a normal person?

302
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,721
Do you drive your daughter crazy

303
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,847
With questions like this too?

304
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:22,116
Much more crazy, believe me.

305
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,227
How'd you know i had a daughter?

306
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,345
Because you do.

307
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,717
You know my mother.

308
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,819
You were on the pta committee

309
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,627
At arlington elementary.

310
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,731
I was there before

311
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,645
I went off to a private school.

312
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,377
I was in the same year as your daughter.

313
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:46,121
Well, why didn't you
tell me that before?

314
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:55,469
You said
that the--

315
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,069
That the social worker spoke to you

316
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,290
Like she knew you.

317
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,241
She was such a retard.

318
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,529
Did she ask
you if, um--

319
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,122
If you think about death a lot?

320
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,242
How did you know that?

321
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:16,645
According to what it says here,

322
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,665
She was trying to
prove that the accident

323
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,900
Was your fault.

324
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:27,320
It's a good thing you didn't answer

325
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,789
Any of her questions.

326
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,093
By the way,

327
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,735
Everybody thinks about death.

328
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,059
I bet she didn't say that, though.

329
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,311
Did she ask you if you had any

330
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,883
Specific thoughts about death?

331
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,873
- No.
- Do you?

332
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,737
Do i what?

333
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,360

Everyone--

334
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,602
Everyone thinks about death and, uh,

335
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:00,443
Imagines how it will come to them.

336
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:03,584
Do you have any more

337
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,803
Specific thoughts about it?

338
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,003
Maybe you have certain thoughts

339
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:12,687
That you'd like to talk about.

340
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,542
- Unless you're
worried about what i--

341
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:16,870
- I'm not worried.

342
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:18,569
Okay.

343
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:27,545
Is this how it's gonna be

344
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,166
For three appointments?

345
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:31,994
Is this a little diffult for you?

346
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,713
No.

347
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:39,529
Can i have some water?

348
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,842
Sure.

349
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,518
Hang on a minute.

350
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,055
Sorry about this.

351
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,875
It's for my little patients,

352
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:12,718
The elves.

353
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,629
It's a bendy one.

354
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,294
You need help with that?

355
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,358
Must be really
hard to be, uh--

356
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,684
To be handicapped like a,

357
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,598
What's the hardest thing about it?

358
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,849
Everyone treats me like a baby.

359
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,285
Did you come here by yourself today?

360
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,216
Yes, by bus.

361
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,643
Your mom didn't offer to drive you?

362
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,427
Yeah, right.

363
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:09,925
She knew there was
no chance i'd say yes.

364
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,151
Before when you
got angry when, uh--

365
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,315
When you thought that she'd called me,

366
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,490
I asked myself, "why didn't she call?"

367
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:21,643
It makes sense that
she would call me first.

368
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,042
I don't

369
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,651
-
- What do you mean?

370
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,848
Well, i'm just trying to figure out

371
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,473
Why you got so angry
- When you thought

372
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,611
She'd called me. - I don't
get it. - She did call?

373
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:30,585
- No no no.

374
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:32,900
Did she call or not? Tell me already.

375
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,497
She didn't call.

376
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,705
- So why are we back to this again?

377
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:40,109
Because i got the feeling that when

378
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,531
You got angry,

379
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,856
You wanted your mother to call

380
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,950
Just so that you could
get angry with her.

381
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,163
You have no idea what i'm looking for.

382
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,327
- You just don't get it.

383
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:55,490
- Okay.

384
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,152
So...

385
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,405
why don't you explain it to me then?

386
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,798
She thinks that what's
written there is true.

387
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,369
- What's true?

388
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,517
- Whatever
it says--

389
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:13,028
Suicidal tendencies, blah blah blah.

390
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,093
That's what your mother says,

391
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,361
Is true?

392
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,102
She thinks that this
accident is a wonderful

393
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:21,804
Opportunity to get rid
of the sports thing.

394
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:23,983
That's what she calls it.

395
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,686
But what does that have to do with

396
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,106
This report?

397
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,177
She's afraid.

398
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,838
She doesn't
believe that--

399
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,590
She thinks that because of all this

400
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:37,727
Competition and perfectionism

401
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,911
She thinks that i wanted to kill myself

402
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,490
And that's bullshit.

403
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,653
It's been like this for years.

404
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,181
I've been under pressure for years

405
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,413
And she has never supported me.

406
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:50,007
All the other mothers are right there

407
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:51,934
All over us visiting the gym,

408
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,468
The training camps, all of it.

409
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,239
And the only thing she has to say is,

410
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,819
"What do you need this for?"

411
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:00,241
It's obvious she doesn't
understand anything.

412
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:02,678
All this
pressure--

413
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,381
It doesn't make any difference.

414
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,814
It's so silly. Why
would i hurt myself now

415
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,823
Just before the nationals

416
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,748
When i have
all the--

417
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,004
And if i fail the lawsuit,

418
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,919
Then i really have no chance.

419
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:21,203
What do you mean fail?

420
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:24,584
Do you see this as a kind of test?

421
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,744
Tell me,

422
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:28,941
Why do
you--

423
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,520
Why are you making it sound like its...

424
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:33,426
what?

425
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:35,257
I didn't come here for therapy.

426
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,949
I just need you to write your opinion

427
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,800
And tell me that i'm perfectly all right

428
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,593
And tell them that i'm not some crazy

429
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,752
Who flies into cars every day.

430
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,884
Is that why you came here today, Sophie?

431
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,765
For me to tell you
that you're all right?

432
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,934
That you're not crazy?

433
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:09,085
Is that the test you're
afraid of failing?

434
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:20,913
I have to go.

435
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,764
It's 10:2 already.

436
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,421
You probably have to turn on

437
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:28,948
Your cell phone now.

438
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:31,793
Why are
you--

439
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,855
Are you worried that
i won't be available?

440
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,006
No.

441
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,651
Are you this much of a pain in the ass

442
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,190
With your daughter?

443
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,006
Much much worse, believe me.

444
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:44,598
And yes, i do try to
understand my daughter,

445
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,056
If that's what you're asking.

446
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,332
That's not what i'm asking.

447
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,216
Let's say she wants to talk to you now.

448
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:54,119
What'll she do?

449
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,142
I don't think she'll wait till 10 to

450
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,622
So she can talk to you.

451
00:21:57,623 --> 00:21:59,444
Who do you call, Sophie?

452
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,331
Oh, suddenly you don't feel comfortable

453
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,988
Talking about your daughter.

454
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:04,802
Look, she calls me at 10 minutes

455
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,242
Before the hour, she leaves a message

456
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,817
And i get back to her.

457
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:11,035
But who do you call?

458
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,301
Who do i call for what?

459
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:16,026
When you need to talk to someone.

460
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,998
411.

461
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,816
411?

462
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,022
Yeah.  Because my father has moved

463
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:28,184
So many times in the past few years,

464
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,908
I can never remember
his latest phone number.

465
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:33,720
It's like a family joke.

466
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,778
We call 411.

467
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,328
How do you get on with your dad?

468
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,264
He's always there for me.

469
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,763
What do you mean he's
always there for you?

470
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,092
He's there.

471
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,206
He knows what's happening to me.

472
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:53,142
Like when i had the accident,

473
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,163
He called me when i w in the ambulance.

474
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,886
He knew something had happened.

475
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,476
- That's what they told me.

476
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,619
So is it like you guys have a kind of

477
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,334
Telepathy together?

478
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:05,119
He's the only person in this world

479
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:06,669
Who truly loves me

480
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,495
And the only one that
believes that the accident

481
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:10,058
Was not my fault.

482
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,258
The only one except Cy.

483
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,537
Who's Cy?

484
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,525
This is Cy.

485
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,717
Cy is a mermaid?

486
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:30,656
No, Cy drew it.

487
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,772
He's my coach.

488
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:38,355
Dana colored it. That's his daughter.

489
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,908
I used to be her babysitter.

490
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,956
Do i have to go now?

491
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:50,051
Yes.

492
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,477
So-- So you babysit
for your coach?

493
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:55,830
Yeah, since before i joined his gym.

494
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,699
So Cy is the only one,

495
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,474
Apart from your dad, who

496
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,918
Loves you ?

497
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,538
Or he's the only who

498
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,021
Thinks that you didn't crash your bike

499
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,255
On purpose?

500
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:11,782
I don't know.

501
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,771
Is that important

502
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,791
For your professional opinion?

503
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:16,691
Okay.

504
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:20,262
I'll tell you what i want us to do.

505
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,893
I would like, before our next meeting,

506
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,773
For us to do some homework.

507
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:28,713
We both write up our opinion

508
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:31,297
Of what's in that
report. What do you say?

509
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,203
How am i supposed to write like this?

510
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,204
You can get somebody to help you.

511
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:37,832
You can do it on tape, if you'd like.

512
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:42,882
What am i supposed to write?

513
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,326
Your own opinion,

514
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:47,474
Your own assessment

515
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,223
Of what's in there.

516
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,552
What do you say?

517
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:02,552
I don't think so.

518
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:05,644
I think you can do it.

519
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,414
This way.

520
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:28,079
So will you try?

521
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,047
We'll see.
