1
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,817
Hey, Rosie, it's me,

2
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:11,825
your dad.

3
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:15,431
I haven't heard back from you yet

4
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:18,949
and I just wanted to confirm
that you're still

5
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,461
coming up next week.

6
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:23,027
So...

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,947
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

8
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:28,907
I love you.

9
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:29,896
Bye.

10
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:45,002
Synchro: mpm, So.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,283


12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,052
- Dr. Weston?
- Yes. Call me Paul.

13
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,974
- Walter Barnett.
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,147
- I didn't miss the elevator, did I?
- Unfortunately not.

15
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:09,757
This way, please.

16
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,953
- Is there someplace I could hang this?
- I can put it in the waiting room.

17
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,371
No. In here.

18
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,986
That's the trouble
with having nice things...

19
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,061
You have to worry about them.

20
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:32,633
My wife bought me that coat.

21
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:37,096
I never would have bought it myself...
cashmere, English.

22
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,015
I said,
"Honey, what's the matter with wool?"

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,430
She said, "You're a C.E.O., Walt.

24
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:47,080
“You're a C.E.O."

25
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:49,255
As if that explains everything.

26
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:02,538
We should get started.

27
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,177
How do you begin?

28
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:08,119
Well, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

29
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:11,130
What brings you here?

30
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,726
Why don't you tell me
what you already know?

31
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,755
- And we'll take it from there.
- What I already know?

32
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:21,443
I appreciate your discretion,
but I'm thick-skinned.

33
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,769
It won't hurt my feelings.

34
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,730
I wasn't trying to be discreet.

35
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,867
You really don't know who I am?

36
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,005
Well, you're a C.E.O.
with a cashmere coat and a wife.

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,661
That's all I know so far.

38
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,215
And two boys.

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,493
They're on their own... launched.

40
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,868
And a daughter.

41
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:49,297
So, you never read
the business section?

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,700
Natalie, she's my youngest.

43
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,708
She's a junior in college,

44
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:00,713
whenever I visit, or visited.

45
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:02,273
She's overseas now.

46
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:06,204
Whenever I visit her college town,
there's this coffee place,

47
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:10,666
bagels, muffs, kids behind the counter
with pierced everything.

48
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,317
And I noticed all the students
and the professors,

49
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:18,124
they all read the art sections,
the sports, politics,

50
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,056
but never the business section.

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,615
They had pristine copies
on every table.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,040
The only news that really matters...

53
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:28,996
- and they think they're above it.
- And is that what you think I think?

54
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,203
No, that's not what I meant.
You're in a different line of work.

55
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:42,823
So, <i>tabula rasa</i>?

56
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:44,629
Really?

57
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,323
Is there something you would have
liked me to know about you?

58
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,874
That's not me in the papers.
That's my company,

59
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,548
although lately that girl reporter
from <i>The Times</i>

60
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,820
has stopped making that distinction.

61
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:00,682
But no, that's good.

62
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:01,968
That's good.

63
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,363
Let's leave all that
Tommy Rot out of it.

64
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,638
A separation of Church and State.

65
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,605
We can do that.

66
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,288
I'd just like to be clear that if you
do want to talk about your job,

67
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,795
whatever you say
will be completely confidential.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,547
- Is that right?
- That's right.

69
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:18,167
Can I get that in writing?

70
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:19,797
Of course.

71
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,083
No, sit.

72
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,994
It's okay.
I trust you.

73
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:28,214
You should feel honored.
I have people working for me

74
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,207
who've spent years
trying to earn my trust.

75
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:34,994
I imagine your position requires
you to be very well guarded.

76
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:38,432
You're getting that
from all those articles you didn't read.

77
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,552
I just know that you run
a company, and...

78
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,297
which leads me to believe
that you're in charge of a lot of people

79
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:49,040
who I'm sure need all kinds
of things from you.

80
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,226
All the time.

81
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,726
It's like one constant meeting

82
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,031
15 hours a day.

83
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:58,006
And somehow I'm the only one
with the answers.

84
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,576
If I ever stop making decisions,
making calls,

85
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,829
the whole thing would grind to a halt.

86
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:07,754
Well, I'm sure finding the time
to come here can't have been easy.

87
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:11,483
So what did you want to discuss?

88
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,517
First off, it wasn't my idea
to come here.

89
00:05:14,642 --> 00:05:17,725
- It wasn't?
- It was Connie's, my wife.

90
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,415
And what did she want you

91
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,864
to talk about?

92
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,421
Sleep.

93
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:29,161
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

94
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,490
I think she's getting tired
of me tossing and turning.

95
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,530
I said, "Honey, it's a big house.

96
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:38,505
"I can sleep in a separate room
like other normal married couples."

97
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,173
But she likes to cuddle.
So here I am.

98
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,644
It sounds like you've got

99
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,136
a pretty strong relationship
with your wife.

100
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,011
It does?

101
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,338
You've mentioned her twice,

102
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,548
both times referring
to how she takes care of you.

103
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:53,978
You seem to...

104
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,605
You seem to appreciate her
a great deal.

105
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,443
Well, listen, don't tell her that.

106
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,227
What else have you
already figured out?

107
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,198
You said that you weren't sleeping.

108
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:10,278
I'd like to hear
a little bit more about that.

109
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,454
First off, I can't take pills...

110
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,970
sleeping pills,

111
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,024
anxiety meds.

112
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,960
I've been that route already.

113
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,447
Who was your psychopharmacologist?

114
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,631
Are you kidding?
That's all I need now.

115
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,854
The headline,

116
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,494
"Embattled C.E.O.
under psychiatric care."

117
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,475
I went to my internist, had him put
the prescriptions in my wife's name.

118
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,158
- They couldn't be traced to me.
- What kind of prescriptions?

119
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,655
He wanted to try Xanax, Ambien,

120
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,295
that kind of thing.

121
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,103
But either they didn't work for me
or they made me loopy.

122
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:47,727
And I can't have that.

123
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:51,106
I've got to be able to wake up anytime,
and be alert.

124
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,251
I have 20,000 workers,

125
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:56,524
factories and distributors
on six continents,

126
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,958
shareholders.

127
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,832
You never know when a brick's gonna
come flying through your window.

128
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,449
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

129
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,569
That's par for the course,
which is why my doctor suggested

130
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,480
that I talk to somebody about...

131
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,064
What did he call it?

132
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,298
... an underlying anxiety.

133
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,044
I thought you said that coming here
was your wife's idea.

134
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,290
There's the point:

135
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm used to stress,
I'm used to crisis.

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,912
I’ve been a C.E.O.
for nearly 20 years.

137
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:31,537
And before that I carried
my bosses' water, which was worse.

138
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,227
And before that I was in Vietnam.

139
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,082
My whole life, no matter
what they hit me with,

140
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,376
I've always been able to sleep
anytime, anywhere

141
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,199
for as long as they let me.

142
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:46,632
If I could get in an hour's nap,
I was good for the next 24.

143
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,218
- Only an hour?
- That's how I got where I am.

144
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,749
It wasn't because I was smarter
than the other guys.

145
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:55,055
It's because I could work
twice as hard twice as long.

146
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,280
Connie used to call me Superman.

147
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:02,857
But now I'm just lying in bed.

148
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,448
I'm not sleeping.
I'm not working.

149
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,989
When did your insomnia begin?

150
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,688
- What difference does that make?
- It might give me a clearer picture

151
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:16,005
of any underlying problem
there might be.

152
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,576
Did you read this book, <i>Blink</i>?

153
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,218
Malcolm Gladwell, smart guy.

154
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:31,536
His thesis is basically that an expert
can tell in the blink of an eye

155
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,877
what the story is.
Is the painting real or a forgery?

156
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,863
Is the war won or lost?

157
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:38,299
Sure.
I know the book.

158
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:42,396
But I think you should know that
the kind of therapy that I practice,

159
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,288
It's not a quick fix.

160
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,412
It's a process.

161
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:51,885
And eventually change happens,
but it does take time.

162
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,939
I have to tell you
I don't have a lot of time.

163
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,706
Even being here,
sitting across from you,

164
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:01,140
talking about my feelings or whatever,
this is costing me money.

165
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:04,674
It's costing my company money.
It's costing my employees money.

166
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,253
What I'm trying to say is,
you don't have to mollycoddle me.

167
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,497
You have a lot of experience,
use it.

168
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:13,572
Tell me what my problem is
and what I need to do.

169
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,174
If I need to pay extra
for more intense sessions, that's fine.

170
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,292
Walter, every patient's therapy
is different.

171
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,567
It doesn't...

172
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,815
We're all unique snowflakes.

173
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,983
But still,

174
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,277
- you know what I'm saying.
- Yes, I think I do.

175
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:34,772
I think what you're saying is,
this isn't a casual matter for you.

176
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:38,035
That the stakes are pretty high,

177
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:41,948
and that before you invest
your time in this,

178
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,459
you want to be sure
that I really can help you. All right?

179
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,463
So, blink test.

180
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,686
Help me.
What's going on?

181
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,561
Look, I wish I knew
the answers that quickly.

182
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,804
In the first place, I could charge
a lot more for my time.

183
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:01,558
The truth is, if we're going
to find a clearer picture

184
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,037
of what's going on
with your sleep problem,

185
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,662
we're gonna have
to dig a little deeper.

186
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,653
We're gonna have to do
a little bit more work.

187
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,396
What's going on is I need to be
at the top of my game right now,

188
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,486
and I can't get there
if I'm not sleeping.

189
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:23,046
I don't know how much clearer a picture
of the problem I can give you.

190
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,291
When you came in,

191
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:31,672
you mentioned something
about some articles

192
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:35,384
that were in the business section
of the newspaper.

193
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,013
Hatchet jobs, you mean.

194
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:38,846
We had to recall

195
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:42,284
certain products
strictly for precaution.

196
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,104
But you know the press.
They want to spin a scandal out of it.

197
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:52,018
And when did these...

198
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,591
articles start to appear?

199
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,008
Can you remember?

200
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,483
It's no big deal.

201
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,965
Some employee with an axe to grind

202
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,472
is feeding nonsense

203
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,796
to some reporter who doesn't know
she's being used.

204
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,177
It's not something
I'd lose sleep over.

205
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,583
You did also tell me

206
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,202
that until recently
you've never lost sleep over anything.

207
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,063
I guess
what I'm trying to find out is...

208
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,802
when you think that changed.

209
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,585
It's funny, I just can't remember.

210
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,877
It must have been gradual.
You know...

211
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:28,887
You look in the mirror one morning
and say, "when did my hair turn white?"

212
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:32,712
Or you get an email from your daughter
halfway around the world

213
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,426
and you think,
"when did my baby grow up?"

214
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:39,354
Your daughter,

215
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,283
Natalie, right?

216
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,871
You said she was spending
her junior year...

217
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,114
- abroad?
- Not like that.

218
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:51,877
My boys spent their junior year
abroad too. One drinking beer in Munich,

219
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,812
and the other
drinking Chianti in Tuscany.

220
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,616
She's nothing like them.

221
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,452
Sometimes my wife and I
will look at her

222
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:07,000
and we'll say to each other,
"where do you think she came from?"

223
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,540
She wasn't even supposed to be here.

224
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:13,465
The boys were already
in high school. When...

225
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,638
Connie told me she was pregnant,
I thought, "you can't be serious.

226
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:18,713
"I don't have time for this."

227
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,049
But Natalie wanted to be here.

228
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,926
She was in a rush,

229
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,430
premature,

230
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,199
walked early,

231
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,678
talked early.

232
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:32,504
So bright,

233
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,796
so happy.

234
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,825
She came a great distance to...

235
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,467
give us all something to believe in.

236
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,866
- You sound incredibly proud of her.
- I am.

237
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,646
And now she's...

238
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,254
halfway around the world.

239
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,502
Some clinic in Rwanda.

240
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,224
My wife didn't want her to go.

241
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,494
She wanted me to say no,
to talk her out of it. But...

242
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,844
I talked to Natalie
and I could see it in her eyes.

243
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,047
This was something she had to do.

244
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,262
So I let her go.

245
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,033
It might have been a mistake, but...

246
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,260
I let her go.

247
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:24,377
- When did she leave?
- October.

248
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,330
And when did your insomnia begin?

249
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,453
I told you, I don't know.

250
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,961
You think
that's my underlying anxiety?

251
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,649
No, but I can imagine
If I had a daughter

252
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,117
living in Rwanda,
I think that would keep me up nights.

253
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,555
So that's your blink test, Natalie?

254
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,968
I'm not so sure
that it's that one-on-one.

255
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,150
Why not?

256
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,330
I just think

257
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,999
that things may be a little bit more
complicated than that.

258
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,227
You sure you're not just trying
to get me in here for more sessions?

259
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:06,195
If people could treat themselves
and diagnose themselves,

260
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,568
there wouldn't be any need
for any kind of drugs

261
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,493
or for therapists like me.

262
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,771
So what are we supposed to do, doc?

263
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,022
I'm not exactly sure,
to tell you the truth.

264
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,986
I do think that you are suffering
from some king of

265
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,204
an anxiety.

266
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:28,500
And the only way I know to alleviate
your symptoms is to figure out

267
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,952
what's causing that anxiety.

268
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,676
And the only way
I know how to do that is to...

269
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,067
is to talk.

270
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:41,184
I talk to people all day long.
It doesn't help me sleep.

271
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,534
Sometimes I think if I could just...

272
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,131
get away somewhere,

273
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,180
the country or...

274
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:52,963
maybe a lake.

275
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,681
Just a funny thought.

276
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,196
Would you care to share it?

277
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,321
With you?

278
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,967
That's kind of what happens in here.

279
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:12,077
I'm supposed to tell you everything
that pops into my head?

280
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,882
I just thought,
"I'll sleep when I'm dead".

281
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:21,586
And that struck you as...

282
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,068
funny?

283
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:32,097
I wish someone
could take care of something,

284
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,908
without me having to...

285
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,368
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,176
You were talking about... talking.

287
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,642
It's not an easy thing,
developing self-awareness.

288
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,543
Some people say that it's...

289
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,852
a man's entire life's work.

290
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,928
That sounds pretty self-absorbed.

291
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,330
No offense.

292
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:02,252
I was talking about your patients,
understand, not you.

293
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,771
It's just that I have a thing
against people who think

294
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,796
the world owes them a favor.

295
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,489
My take,

296
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,095
you play the cards you dealt.
You do the best you can

297
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,720
to do your job,
to protect your family.

298
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,779
That, in my opinion,
is a real man's life's work.

299
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,918
It's so quiet in here, doesn't it?

300
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:33,546
I'm never usually
anywhere this quiet,

301
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,490
except on an airplane.

302
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,214
That's why I love airplanes.
My favorite place to be.

303
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:49,928
Is everything okay?

304
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,217
Never.

305
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,346
Just now you talked about how...

306
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:58,971
important...

307
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,905
your job is, and...

308
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,228
how...

309
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:05,378
difficult it is for you
to be discreet,

310
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,045
and that you're not even comfortable

311
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,070
getting certain prescriptions
in your own name.

312
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:14,869
- Are you saying I sound paranoid?
- Well, it makes me wonder.

313
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,885
Do you have anybody
that you can talk to

314
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,310
about the pressure of your business?

315
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,932
Not at work.

316
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:24,607
Anything I say
could be used against me.

317
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,006
And I don't like to worry Connie.

318
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,031
And how about your children?

319
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,469
The boys don't want to hear about
my problems. They wouldn't understand.

320
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:36,168
Why do you say that?

321
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,902
Everything came too easily for them.

322
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,567
They never had to make
their own way or fight in a war.

323
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:48,191
They just take everything for granted,
including their old man.

324
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,016
And... Natalie?

325
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:52,382
I told you, she's different.

326
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,023
I'll give you an idea
of what I'm talking about.

327
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,245
I got an interesting email
from her over the weekend.

328
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,695
To tell you the truth,
it worried me a little.

329
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,355
- Would you mind if I read it to you?
- Please.

330
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,130
- I could use your expert opinion.
- Sure.

331
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:14,763
"Hi, dad.

332
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,154
"Rwanda is hard.

333
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:22,458
"I've never worked so hard in my life
and understood so little.

334
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,359
"We've set up a rape clinic
in the village of..."

335
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,125
I'm not even going to try
to pronounce that.

336
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:32,756
"This woman came in,

337
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,331
"she was desperate.

338
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,782
"They all think we can get them visas
because we're American.

339
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,338
"I explained to her
that I could only offer her

340
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,413
some emergency contraception.

341
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,801
"She must have been angry
or disappointed,

342
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,740
"but she just...

343
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,614
"stared at me, mute,

344
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,207
"still,

345
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,067
"as if she were frozen.

346
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,283
"Then a girl came in,

347
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,409
"eight years old,

348
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,776
"gang-raped.

349
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,739
"The doctors did what they could,
but she will never be the same.

350
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,972
"I wake up every morning exhausted.

351
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:11,691
"By the end of the day
all I want to do is drink.

352
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,607
"We have nothing
to offer these people.

353
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,729
"The young men have nothing to do.

354
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,174
"Some of them are so angry,

355
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,566
"they spit at us when we pass.

356
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:33,171
"The strange thing is,
I have never felt so alive.

357
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,170
"This is what life is about,
helping people...

358
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,351
"every second of every day.

359
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,403
"I'm so grateful to be here.

360
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:44,944
"I love you and mom.

361
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,140
"I'll write more when I can."

362
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,931
So what do you think?

363
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:01,449
She sounds
like an extraordinary woman.

364
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:07,330
- I should go get her out, right?
- What do you mean, get her out?

365
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,542
She is in some kind of trouble.
This is obviously a cry for help.

366
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,960
Why do you think that?

367
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,379
Are you telling me that if...

368
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:18,049
you received an email like that
from your daughter from some

369
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,427
rape clinic in Rwanda, you wouldn't be
on the first plane to Africa?

370
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,645
There's a fine line
between bravery and stupidity.

371
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:28,863
I can't sit here and wait for her
to be kidnapped and dismembered.

372
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:32,090
- Where did you say she was staying?
- I didn't.

373
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,765
She's living in Kigali.
And the clinic's

374
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,485
- somewhere in the countryside.
- Kigali...

375
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,696
- That's the capital, isn't it?
- What?

376
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,283
You think that makes it safe?
Have you ever been to Africa?

377
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,177
Well, I have, and let me tell you,

378
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,706
what we consider stable here
and what they consider secure

379
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,055
are two very different things,
my friend.

380
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,621
They're two very different things
here as well.

381
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:57,639
- Come again?
- Stability and security.

382
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,164
They are two
very different concepts.

383
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,630
- OK, fellow.
- Well, your daughter sounds...

384
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,020
very stable.

385
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,940
From a psychological perspective,
given the...

386
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,858
situation that she's in,
she sounds remarkably healthy.

387
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,456
She obviously feels very deeply

388
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:20,062
and she has a very lucid way
of expressing herself.

389
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,927
And it leads me to believe
that you should just...

390
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,199
trust her.

391
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:29,214
And trust her to take care of herself.
As for her security.

392
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:33,145
Unless you've been there,
you have no idea what it's like.

393
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,587
- Do you have a daughter?
- If you're asking me if

394
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,247
I'd be worried, if I had a daughter in
Kigali, I have to say that I would be.

395
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,198
- And you wouldn't go and get her out?
- I can't say what I would

396
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:46,596
or what I wouldn't do
in your position.

397
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,662
But you can imagine it, can't you?
Come on, just give me an honest answer.

398
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,247
- I'm paying for your opinion, aren't I?
- In a sense.

399
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:58,088
But we are different people
with different experiences.

400
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:00,141
I'm wondering why,

401
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,319
Walter, it's important...

402
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:04,948
for you that I back you up on this.

403
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,995
I don't need
your goddamn permission.

404
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,509
I asked you for something very simple.
I have insomnia.

405
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:13,918
It's a real problem,

406
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:17,243
a concrete problem
that prevents me from functioning.

407
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:20,036
I came here and I said,
"tell me what to do".

408
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,661
Mental exercises,
breathing techniques?

409
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,103
Now you've got me...

410
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:28,971
reading my daughter' private emails
to you. I don't even know you.

411
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,041
How much do I owe you?

412
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:35,954
Are you okay?

413
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
Answer me, please.

414
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,661
Are you on medication?

415
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,232
- Do you have a doctor I can call?
- Just...

416
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:45,707
give me some air.

417
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
You're okay, Walt.

418
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
It's okay.

419
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:03,765
Breathe.

420
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,970
That's it.

421
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:19,461
Are you sure you're okay to get up?
OK, let me help you.

422
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:25,221
You feel okay?

423
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:31,528
You can stay
for as long as you like.

424
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,067
I told you, I'm fine now.

425
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:37,506
Listen,

426
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:41,270
- I'm sorry if I gave you a scare back.
- It's not a problem.

427
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:43,095
I knew it would go away.

428
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,619
They always do.

429
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:47,216
Has this happened before?

430
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:51,306
They go away.
