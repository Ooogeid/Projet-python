1
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:10,249
Sienna, please stop talking to me.
I'm not having this conversa...

2
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,803
Because it's really
none of your business.

3
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,311
<i>It's not about you.
He wasn't supposed to tell anyone.</i>

4
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,179
<i>Because it's a private matter.</i>

5
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,764
<i>No, I don't really care
who your uncle is.</i>

6
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,920
<i>Yeah, my phone...
My phone is dying.</i>

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,084
Listen,
what exactly did Kyle tell you?

8
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,398
Jesus.
What the fuck?

9
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,172
Sienna, because it's none of your...

10
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,025
<i>I have to go.
My phone is out of juice.</i>

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,118
<i>Would you just shut up?
I want you to hear me.</i>

12
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,523
<i>You have no fucking idea what...</i>

13
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:38,952
I'm glad you came.

14
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,080
- I sent you an email.
- I know.

15
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:42,512
Thanks.

16
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:45,370
But I'm just glad that you're here.

17
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,221
- Do you have an iPhone charger?
- No.

18
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,850
- You don't have an iPhone?
- No.

19
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,863
- Do you have a blackberry?
- Not anymore. I used to.

20
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,365
How do you organize your life?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,050
I've got a datebook on my desk.

22
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:02,373
Kicking it old school.

23
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,931
- How was your week?
- I bet you still have a landline.{\I bet you're one of those people who still has a landline.}

24
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,183
- Actually I do.
- Great. Can I use it?

25
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,066
Now?

26
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,628
Just for a minute.

27
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,430
Would you like to wait
till the session is over?

28
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,596
Okay, that's fine.

29
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:37,448
Are you feeling okay?

30
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,810
I'm fine.

31
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,391
This... This happens
when I get angry.

32
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,356
Tremors run in our family.
It's genetic.

33
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,619
You must be really angry.

34
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,921
I guess so.

35
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,546
I actually like when this happens.
It's this weird

36
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,148
out-of-body experience.
You know what'd help, I bet?

37
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,008
- What?
- Using your phone.

38
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,204
Would you like to tell me

39
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:02,848
what's going on?

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,264
Why your hand is shaking?
Why you're so angry?

41
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,272
Why don't you tell me
why I can't just make a call?

42
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,401
Well, you can,

43
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:13,989
but I just don't think that
it's the best use of our time together.

44
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,777
You're sure it can't wait
till the end of the session?

45
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:35,133
Fuck her.

46
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,075
Fuck who?

47
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,651
Sienna Newhouse,

48
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,455
Kyle's new girlfriend.

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,846
Do you know she has a publicist?

50
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,347
I'm not quite sure who she is.

51
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,169
Yeah, I guess you don't really
follow that world.

52
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,397
I don't really
follow that world either,

53
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:54,733
except now
apparently I'm stuck in it,

54
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,049
mired in its peripheral muck.

55
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,880
Thank you for that, Kyle.

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,355
I remember last week
that you mentioned she was wealthy.

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,368
She's filthy fucking rich.

58
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,104
I told Kyle I had cancer
and you know what she does?

59
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,291
She offers to pay for my treatment.

60
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,627
We're at a school, you stupid cunt.
We have insurance.

61
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,344
If you ever actually went to class,
you might know that.

62
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,799
I mean,
I told Kyle not to tell anyone

63
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,677
and he told herdeliberately so that
he wouldn't have to deal with me.

64
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,575
I hate them both.

65
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:28,392
I don't get this. How does
telling Sienna ensure that Kyle

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,298
doesn't have anything
to do with you?

67
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,188
I told him not to tell her.

68
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:34,963
So he...

69
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:36,953
betrayed your trust.

70
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,903
No, it's more than that.

71
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,674
Look, Kyle knows me, he knows
what I can and can't tolerate.

72
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,801
He knows that if he tells
his girlfriend I have cancer

73
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,823
and if she calls me,
I will hang up on her

74
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,269
and never speak to either of them again,
which is what he did,

75
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,259
and what she did, and what I did.

76
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,611
So that's who you were talking to
when you arrived?

77
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:58,290
And did you hang up on her?

78
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,898
No, the phone died,
which is why I have to call her back

79
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,621
so I can hang up on her.

80
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,745
Could I just use your phone?

81
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,371
Please, it'll take two minutes.
I can't concentrate at all.

82
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,359
She can't get the last word, Paul.

83
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,842
I can't die and she gets to go on
and live the perfect life

84
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,465
with the only person
I've ever loved.

85
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,089
Thank you.

86
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,460
Could I have a moment?

87
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,830
<i>Wow, he's keeping you busy.</i>

88
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,286
<i>Listen.</i>

89
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,579
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

90
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:15,811
<i>Because we're not...</i>

91
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,091
<i>Sienna, I am not...</i>

92
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,125
So...

93
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,218
What did you say to her?

94
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:05,703
I don't know.

95
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:08,525
I told her my life was
none of her fucking business.

96
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:11,725
That made you feel better?

97
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:17,790
Did... Did you talk to Kyle as well?

98
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,757
I'll call him later.

99
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:27,250
You said that he was the only
person that you had ever loved.

100
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,147
Can I ask you how it feels

101
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,086
to see him with somebody else?

102
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:39,553
I've never actually
seen them together.

103
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,585
No?

104
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,172
I didn't even know
she existed until recently.

105
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,588
I mean, I knew she existed...
everyone knows she exists.

106
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,864
Her father donated
the money for the new library.

107
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,301
She wears
all these ridiculous scarves

108
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,479
in these absurd configurations.

109
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:02,738
You shouldn't wear scarves like that
unless you're French.

110
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,152
Why not?

111
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,150
I don't know.

112
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,929
I just think they look stupid
on American girls.

113
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:10,561
Including Sienna?

114
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,845
No, not including Sienna.

115
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,503
You said you told Kyle
about your cancer.

116
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:26,369
I did.

117
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:29,008
It was...

118
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:33,137
pretty funny
the way it all went down.

119
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,180
I could use a laugh.

120
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,154
You want to tell me?

121
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,086
We hadn't spoken since we broke up,

122
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,757
because we're, like...

123
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,192
radioactive together.

124
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:50,932
But a few months had gone by,

125
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:55,176
I thought maybe we were ready.

126
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,948
I knew he was seeing someone else.

127
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,310
I thought maybe
we could have dinner, catch up.

128
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,668
He always makes me feel...

129
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:07,940
I don't know.

130
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,288
He's older.

131
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,878
He knows how to...

132
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,558
take care of things, how to keep
everything under control.

133
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,287
I sent him an email.

134
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,021
I said I was having trouble with
one of my models... which I was.

135
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,705
He came right over.

136
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:31,195
He could see immediately
that I was tired.

137
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,460
He made me risotto

138
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,432
and he brought wine.

139
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,868
And I remember thinking,

140
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:44,124
"This is nice.
We can be friends.

141
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,276
"We are friends."

142
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:49,797
As he was leaving,

143
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:51,450
he kissed me.

144
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,624
And I remember feeling confused,
but...

145
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,643
It was like it took a little while
for my brain to catch up

146
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,482
with what my body was doing,
where my hands were going.

147
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:09,480
And I heard this sound,

148
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,620
like a moan,

149
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,840
and I thought,
"Who made that sound?"

150
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,817
And then I realized it was me.

151
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,167
While it was happening,

152
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,492
I started to cry,

153
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,191
and then he started to cry.

154
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,938
I'd never seen him cry before.

155
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,302
When it was over I said,

156
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,903
"I have something to tell you."

157
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:42,181
He said,
"I have something to tell you."

158
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,148
And I said, "You go first", and...

159
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,951
So he said,

160
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,326
"I'm engaged."

161
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,880
And then I said, "I have cancer."

162
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,217
That's so painful.

163
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,920
It's him.
It's Kyle.

164
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,996
- I'm going to ignore this, okay?
- That's fine.

165
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,564
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

166
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,400
He must've gotten your number
from the ice queen's phone.

167
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,561
She must've told him what happened.

168
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,227
How do you feel about that?

169
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,747
I expected her to tell him and...

170
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,288
I'm glad that he called.

171
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:55,682
Do you think that might be
part of the reason that you were

172
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,628
so anxious to call her?

173
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,108
Because you wanted her
to convey your anger to him?

174
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,564
I don't need to go through her
to get to him, clearly.

175
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,935
Have you seen Kyle since that night?

176
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:15,973
No, I kicked him out and told him
I never wanted to see him again.

177
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,087
Because...

178
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,096
Because he told you he was engaged?

179
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,325
Because he was mean to me.

180
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,064
After I told him I had cancer,

181
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,388
he got really anxious,

182
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,459
and asked me what my plan was.
I told him I didn't have a plan

183
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,868
and he got angry and accused me
of not taking care of myself.

184
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:38,477
He got angry?

185
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,820
His dad...

186
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:43,667
was physically abusive to his mom,

187
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,252
and she wouldn't
defend herself, so...

188
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,227
So when kyle sees women
not taking care of themselves,

189
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,713
he goes apeshit.

190
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,982
- April, do you think...
- {\And }I know what you're gonna say next.

191
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,800
"Gee, April, do you think
you tried to provoke Kyle

192
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,822
with your apathy
in order to get a reaction

193
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,415
and see how much he cares about you
and the answer is no,

194
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,474
I really didn't expect to tell him.

195
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,584
It just... It slipped out.

196
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,832
Do you know
what I'm going to say next?

197
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,795
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:21,709
Actually, I think it's great that
you see things from my point of view.

199
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:23,579
Really?

200
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,887
It's really helpful.

201
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,759
Yeah, right.

202
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,311
Do you find it hard
to let yourself be taken care of?

203
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,981
It feels to me like

204
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,354
you not only want to do

205
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,490
your own work here,
but you want to do mine as well.

206
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,826
That way you believe
you can get through this

207
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,685
without... without me.

208
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:50,970
You know, when...

209
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:55,513
when you mentioned Kyle here first,

210
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,587
I was a little worried about him.

211
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:02,765
- You sound like my father.
- Yes, I guess I do react in that way.

212
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,679
You said {\that }he was older, that he had
a rich {\wealthy}girlfriend yet he slept with you.

213
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,535
You can't blame him for that.
I'm telling you, we have this thing...

214
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,160
I'm not blaming him.

215
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,027
Actually, over the session,
I think I'm beginning to understand

216
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,259
- his behavior.
- Why?

217
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:23,283
Because I think I know how he feels.

218
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,199
You described the way he responded

219
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,716
to your revelation...

220
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,108
to your cancer,
as being mean, but...

221
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,061
it seems to me
that he was behaving appropriately

222
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:36,583
anxiously.

223
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,741
{\You know, }In the last session that we had
you told me that you had cancer,

224
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:45,880
and as soon as you did
that you started to push me away.

225
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,883
And I knew that the more times
I called you this week,

226
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,337
the less likely
I was to see you again.

227
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,386
You called me like
10 times this week.

228
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,254
You must've never
wanted to see me again.

229
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,191
In the meantime, you told kyle

230
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,578
and then you started
to push him away.

231
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,317
You vilified his behavior.

232
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,977
But he can't help me anymore.

233
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,627
He doesn't belong to me.

234
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:06,947
He isn't mine.

235
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,616
So because he's not your partner,
he can't help you anymore?

236
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,462
It's all or nothing with me.
It's just the way I'm built.

237
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,196
He didn't hurt me.

238
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,758
I hurt him.

239
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,507
It wasn't his fault we broke up.
It was mine.

240
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,125
I couldn't take it.

241
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:29,013
Well, what couldn't you take?

242
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,376
How much he loved me.

243
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,304
Why?

244
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:38,366
I don't know.

245
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,066
It was just too much.

246
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,634
You said that

247
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,661
you couldn't rely on Kyle because...

248
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,698
he doesn't belong to you.

249
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,308
Is there anyone in your life

250
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,001
who does?

251
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,008
Right now?

252
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,172
Daniel.

253
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,738
So you and your brother have

254
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,614
a deep bond.

255
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,930
Did you tell him about the cancer?

256
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,783
Daniel has enough to worry about.

257
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,438
Like what?

258
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,065
Like negotiating the world, Paul.

259
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:26,662
Have you ever known anyone
with autism?

260
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,362
What's that been like for you?

261
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,897
No one understands.

262
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,977
It's... every second of every day

263
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,538
it is like he is in a foreign country
where he doesn't speak the language

264
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:43,358
and where everyone hates him.

265
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,597
He's lucky to have someone
who understands him as well as you do.

266
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,839
Yeah, well...

267
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,468
he didn't deserve what he got.

268
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,601
Do any of us deserve what we get?

269
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:08,777
When Kyle and I were together...

270
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:13,003
it's hard to explain,
but it's like I would...

271
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,755
just...

272
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,487
check out sometimes,

273
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,372
but I wouldn't go far.

274
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:26,186
I would be watching myself,
watching Kyle...

275
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,437
brushing our teeth, making coffee.

276
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,303
And I remember thinking,

277
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,513
"This is what it feels like
to be Daniel."

278
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,847
How often would this happen?

279
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:41,496
A lot...

280
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,398
Especially when we were in bed.

281
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,362
Sometimes,

282
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,676
we'd be having sex
and then suddenly....

283
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:58,054
I'd be floating above us,
looking down and thinking,

284
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,824
"Oh, they're in love.
That's nice."

285
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,144
It didn't happen

286
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,012
this last time.

287
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,626
I tried to make it happen,
but I couldn't.

288
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,275
I think that's when
I started to cry.

289
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,912
It sounds like you were what we call

290
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,303
dissociating.

291
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,697
It's a defense mechanism.

292
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:31,025
It feels like you are
outside your body,

293
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:34,869
but we do it sometimes to get away
from something that we feel is

294
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:37,441
frightening.

295
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,849
What was I afraid of?

296
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,821
That's a very important question.

297
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,038
I slept with his best friend...

298
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,292
Kyle's.

299
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:12,664
I don't know why I did it.

300
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:16,288
The whole time there was this voice
in my head saying,

301
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,382
"Don't do this.

302
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:20,924
April, please.

303
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,372
You're gonna screw everything up.
He won't forgive you."

304
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,984
I did it anyway and...

305
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:34,918
Then I told him.

306
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,672
And I was right...

307
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,526
He couldn't forgive me.

308
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:45,350
Everything was really
sort of perfect.

309
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,532
I was

310
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,387
this perfect girl to him.

311
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,326
Did that feel scary?

312
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:55,109
Now I'm...

313
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:58,579
that girl,

314
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,991
the one who's still hung up
on her ex.

315
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,295
I hate girls like this.

316
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,084
You don't like to see yourself as...

317
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,778
flawed, do you?

318
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,267
Kyle offered to take me
to the hospital

319
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:23,216
to see my oncologist,
schedule my treatments,

320
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,955
and I almost...

321
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,246
I almost let him do it, because I...

322
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,526
I wanted to see him again so badly.

323
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,313
Isn't that horrible?

324
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,907
What's so horrible about that?

325
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,539
I stopped myself.

326
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:47,722
He's been calling every day
since we saw each other,

327
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,059
like five times a day.

328
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,791
I'm not picking up.

329
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,051
You are gonna need somebody

330
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,922
to take you to chemotherapy.

331
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:01,596
And...

332
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,220
From what I understand,

333
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,181
you feel very tired afterwards.

334
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,388
I've been feeling
much better lately.

335
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:14,428
I give you credit.

336
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,794
April, would you rather die
than be weak?

337
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,322
It is very rare

338
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,420
for this disease

339
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:27,529
to go away of its own accord.

340
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:32,351
Basically,

341
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:34,709
that's unheard of.

342
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:38,796
Well, I have been feeling better
since coming here.

343
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:44,131
Did you ever have a...

344
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,972
when you were a child,
did you ever have a worry doll?

345
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:50,132
- A what?
- A worry doll.

346
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,936
You tell it your troubles

347
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:55,014
and it takes your troubles away.

348
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:56,502
Maybe...

349
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:59,984
Maybe that's what you think
you have in me.

350
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,503
You've told me you have cancer

351
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,526
and now I'm worried about it.

352
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:07,300
Now since somebody else is worrying,

353
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,441
you don't need to.

354
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,140
And since you don't need to worry,

355
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,450
you mustn't have cancer.

356
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,431
I have to tell you:

357
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:24,929
talking about this to a psychologist
is not gonna make it go away.

358
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,990
You know, I...

359
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,352
I spoke with this friend of mine
who's an oncologist.

360
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,561
You did what?

361
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:37,563
Basically, April, he thinks

362
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,942
that your delaying chemotherapy
is a sentence of death.

363
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,340
- You talked to someone else{\ about me}?
- I didn't mention your name.

364
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:46,364
You had no right to do that.
I came to you in confidence.

365
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:50,245
It would have been professionally
negligent of me to do anything else.

366
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,273
I need to find out

367
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,166
whether your behavior
might be suicidal.

368
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,836
- Suicidal?!
- What would you tell me to do, April?

369
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:03,715
You've been telling me what to do
and say throughout this session.

370
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,658
I cannot let you...

371
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:14,966
It is my duty,

372
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:19,355
my professional duty, to protect you,
April, from self-harm.

373
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:38,459
I want you to promise me

374
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,277
that won't happen again,

375
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:45,868
that no matter what I decide to do,
you won't talk

376
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:48,812
to anybody else about me
outside this room.

377
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,124
I promise.

378
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:02,425
But you have to promise me
something in return.

379
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:05,233
What?

380
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:08,570
That if you decide to stop therapy,
you have to call me.

381
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,304
You cannot sever ties unilaterally.

382
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,806
I don't want you to disappear.

383
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,555
I promise.

384
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,870
Thank you.
