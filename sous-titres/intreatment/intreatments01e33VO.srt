00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:04,874
Why didn't you tell me
your father was in Miami?

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,626
- Why was it a secret?
- It's not a fucking secret!

4
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:10,046
He still doesn't know
about your attempted suicide?

5
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:12,257
It's not his fault
that I took those pills!

6
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,635
- Are you angry at him for something?
- Shut the fuck up about him!

7
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,285
I want you to remember something.

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,691
There're other places
where you can feel safe

9
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:25,270
and here in this room,

10
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,463
is one of those places.

11
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,284
Hold up, Paul.
I just got to finish this.

12
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:44,132
Take your time.

13
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,875
I just google myself.

14
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:52,233
It's my dad, he's in Boston.
I might go visit him next week.

15
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,839
Oh my god, the most amazing thing
happened last night,

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,162
You wouldn't believe me,
but I don't care.

17
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,764
Why wouldn't believe you?

18
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,768
Because you think me and my dad
being connected is bullshit.

19
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:08,396
I never said it was bullshit,
I said I might be surprised...

20
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,649
Free your mind, Paul,
the rest will follow.

1x33: Sophie - Week 7

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,123
Oh my god, that was incredible.

24
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,637
I had this dream
that my father was in danger.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,120
I woke up feeling a little freaked,
so I called him.

26
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,476
He's staying in a hotel
with his girlfriend.

27
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:49,932
Turns out, last night...

28
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:53,130
Someone broke into his room
and stole his favorite camera.

29
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,162
So, I guess you must be feeling
pretty silly now, huh?

30
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:10,018
Because you have all this doubts
about my father and I telepathy.

31
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:11,668
You basically hate the man.

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,993
- I hate your father?
- Last week, you were insinuating...

33
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,379
Forget it,
the point is we're connected.

34
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,631
It's been prove once and for all,
you can't take that away.

35
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,414
You said that you might go to Boston.

36
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,646
Don't you have the olympic trials
coming up?

37
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,275
- Those are after I get back.
- So it's okay

38
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:38,445
to miss training
this close to the competition, is it?

39
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:42,298
Oh I'm sorry, Cy,
I was looking for my shrink.

40
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:47,746
Look, it's not a big deal.

41
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,993
It's just more important to me
to spend quality time with him.

42
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:53,585
- It's been too long.
- Maybe he can come here.

43
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,588
That way you can see him
and you can still continue to train.

44
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,121
What do you care?

45
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,468
Did you bet on me
to win a medal or something?

46
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,447
When was the last time
you saw your father?

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,715
About...

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,225
six month ago...

49
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,061
- He was in town for a week-end.
- Was that fun?

50
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,110
It was fine.

51
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:20,153
We went to this fancy restaurant.
His girlfriend came with us.

52
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,989
My dad started flirting
with the waitress.

53
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,111
His girlfriend started to cry.

54
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,089
So we had to leave which kinda sucked,
but it doesn't matter, it was fine.

55
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,451
Was it the same girl from Boston?

56
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,940
I think so.
Who can keep up?

57
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:43,830
How did you get on with her?

58
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,905
Fine.

59
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,149
She's speechy.

60
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,265
What's her name again?

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,368
Darren, Tarren, Karen,
something like that.

62
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:55,876
Clea.

63
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,059
I think it's still Clea.

64
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,107
I'm like the little sister
she never had.

65
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:07,786
He should leave her in Boston.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
We haven't taking a trip together,

67
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,216
just my dad and me
since my thirteen birthday.

68
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:15,500
Where did you go?

69
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,651
We went to Paris.

70
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,359
He took me to everything.

71
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,104
From the Eiffel Tower
to Monet's garden, the works.

72
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,652
At this sidewalk cafe,
I had this cup of chocolate

73
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:29,799
you had to eat with the spoon.
Two words: Awe-some!

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,385
We stayed in this huge apartment,
it was like a loft.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,972
Belonged to some woman,
I met for like...

76
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:42,265
five seconds, just as I was leaving
to fly back home.

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,038
She was going into the apartment
as I was going out.

78
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:50,243
The elevator reeked of her perfum,
made me wanna throw up.

79
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,132
I did, literally,

80
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:55,991
right on the street,

81
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,618
in front of the cab.

82
00:04:58,429 --> 00:04:59,700
Nobody saw it.

83
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,543
That's not true,
the cabby saw it,

84
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:04,883
but my dad didn't,
he stayed upstairs.

85
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,678
So you took the cab to airport
by yourself?

86
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,629
Well, yeah,
I was thirteen, Paul.

87
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:19,355
So you want to tell me more
about that dream that you had?

88
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:27,048
Not really, it doesn't matter,
it's just a stupid dream.

89
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,347
But I felt he was in danger,
that's the important part.

90
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:34,918
I can feel him,

91
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,367
we're linked,

92
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,226
radar love.

93
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,795
It was a terrible dream.

94
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,597
Or like a nightmare.

95
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,497
Do you get those?

96
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:53,301
Sometimes.

97
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,610
What happens in yours?

98
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:03,859
There's one I've...

99
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,363
I've had...

100
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,206
consistently since I was a kid.

101
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm sitting in this rocking chair,
and I'm rocking back and forward.

102
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,055
Everytime I go to get off, I can't.

103
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:18,542
The chair keeps rocking
back and forward.

104
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,583
And my...

105
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:21,811
My mother is calling me...

106
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,961
from upstairs.

107
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,521
I'm trying to get out
of the chair, but I...

108
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,188
I just can't let go.

109
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,074
What do you think it means?

110
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,186
I think it means that...

111
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,879
maybe that I...

112
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,925
scared to disappoint my mother,
that I'm not gonna be there for her.

113
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,114
Did you disappoint her,
in real life?

114
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:52,654
No, I...

115
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:55,606
I don't think so.

116
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,791
Anyway, back to your dream.

117
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,117
Okay. So...

118
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:11,767
I was waiting for my father
in a hotel room,

119
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,008
when a man knocked on the door.

120
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,127
I let him in.

121
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:20,465
He asked me where my father was,
I told him he was on his way.

122
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,250
But just as I said it,
I was so stupid,

123
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,878
I realize that this guy
was a serial killer.

124
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:30,991
So he sat down
to wait with me,

125
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:34,323
and I knew that the moment
my father walked into that room,

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,967
this guy was going to kill him.

127
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,934
And I didn't know how to stop it.
It was awful.

128
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,467
What did the man look like?

129
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,671
I don't remember.

130
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,467
Had you been
in this hotel room before?

131
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,112
No.

132
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,967
What was it like?
Can you describe it?

133
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:01,333
It was dark...

134
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,605
Dark wood,
dark furniture.

135
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,191
Sort of like a cave or a tunnel.

136
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,730
Yeah, like a tunnel,
but it wasn't scary.

137
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,218
You could see light at both ends,

138
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,500
like where the tunnel
started and where it ended.

139
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,909
I remember looking back and forth,

140
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,665
trying to figure out which way was
the entrance and which was the exit.

141
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,086
Anything else you remember?

142
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,534
The man was wearing
shoes like yours.

143
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:41,883
Not those shoes.
The black ones that you usually wear.

144
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,466
Like my other ones?

145
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:47,400
Not like your other shoes,
they were your shoes.

146
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:50,943
So this serial killer
was wearing my shoes?

147
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,585
It was you...

148
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,567
In the hotel room.

149
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,284
You were waiting
to kill my father.

150
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:05,998
Did I tell you
why I was gonna kill him?

151
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,279
Did your father ever show up?

152
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,255
no.

153
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:14,801
We just sat there.

154
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:17,201
We made small talk.

155
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,107
And the whole time I was trying
to figure out how to get out of there...

156
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,333
To call somebody or something.

157
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,770
Do you remember
what this small talk was about?

158
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,397
I don't...

159
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:33,867
I'm not sure.
Something about...

160
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,600
It makes perfect sense,
doesn't it?

161
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,939
You're always insinuating
shit about him.

162
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,067
That he's the mystery man,
that there's some big secret,

163
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,876
that he's the person
who really fucked me up.

164
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,294
But the joke's on you,
because there's nothing there.

165
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:55,116
My father didn't cross the line
or break any rules

166
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:57,897
or any of that crap
you love to throw around.

167
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,439
You're so wrong
it's ridiculous.

168
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,168
My father has always
been there for me.

169
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:11,604
His work and me are the only
important things in his life.

170
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,734
How do you feel
about his photographs?

171
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,254
They're beautiful...

172
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,200
If you look at them
with an open mind,

173
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,915
which of course you can't.

174
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,433
He loves the human form.

175
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:34,311
He believes the body
can be the perfect...

176
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,156
expression...

177
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,634
of every human emotion
and experience.

178
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:44,347
Is that how he speaks about his work?

179
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,144
What are you saying, Paul?

180
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,485
That I can't form an opinion
of my own father's work?

181
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,437
You think I'm quoting him?

182
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,192
You know, he says a lot of shrinks
are failed artists or writers.

183
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,340
Maybe you're jealous of him.

184
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,713
He travels around the world,

185
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,600
he works with models.

186
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,870
Meanwhile, you're trapped
in your cell with fuck-ups like me.

187
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,133
Oh, I'd take a fuck-up like you any day
over one of those supermodels.

188
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:17,364
- No, you wouldn't. Shut up.
- Yes, I would. It's true.

189
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,430
So, how was that for you,

190
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,596
your father being constantly
surrounded by beautiful women

191
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,193
when you were a kid?

192
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,634
He's an artist.
It was his job.

193
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,099
Besides, nudity was
totally normal in my house.

194
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:36,034
I got used to it.

195
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,707
Nudity?

196
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,163
Nude models.

197
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,268
The female form.

198
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:45,051
It's like drawing class 101, Paul.

199
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,197
An artist must work
from the purest inspiration.

200
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,633
His studio was at home,

201
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:54,700
so there were a lot
of models walking around naked.

202
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,524
It wasn't a big deal.
We were cool.

203
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,636
So this was
normal for you,

204
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,639
to be exposed to adults
being naked, yeah?

205
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,386
"Exposed."

206
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,424
"Ooh, nudity.
How scary.

207
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:11,367
"Breasts... Terrifying!"

208
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,603
So were you ever naked
around the house?

209
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,333
Of course not.

210
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:24,947
Look at your face.

211
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,270
You think that's my big secret?

212
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,910
I saw my father naked
and now I'm scarred for life?

213
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:33,034
Isn't that kind of a cliche?

214
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,917
So your father was naked
and your mother as well?

215
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,607
Why are you laughing?

216
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,862
My mother always wore her clothes,

217
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,534
even in the shower.

218
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:49,302
But she was perfectly
comfortable with...

219
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,598
the models?

220
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:53,444
She was clueless
about the whole thing.

221
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:56,677
Sorry, I'm having a difficult time
following this. I thought you said

222
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,731
that people were naked all the time?

223
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:02,395
Okay, not all the time.

224
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,201
A lot of the time.

225
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:07,671
During the day,
while my mother was at work.

226
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,221
So would you say
that your father was...

227
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,067
hiding it from her?

228
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,265
I'd say she was a fucking idiot

229
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,801
who couldn't see
what was right in front of her.

230
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:24,840
They were having sex.

231
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,634
Who was having sex, Sophie?

232
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:30,588
My dad...

233
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,827
With the model du jour.

234
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,102
How do you know?

235
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,159
I saw them.

236
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,359
I came home from school
early one day.

237
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,565
The mom who drove carpool that day
had to pick us up early.

238
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,639
I walked into my parents' bedroom

239
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,982
and my father was there
with a model.

240
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:53,828
Does your father know
that you saw?

241
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,663
Oh, yeah. He got up.

242
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,403
He came over to me
and just looked at me.

243
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,738
I said something like,

244
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,881
"I thought the models
only came at fixed times."

245
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,068
And what did he say?

246
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,645
I don't remember.

247
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,810
Something like,
"you're supposed to be at school."

248
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,880
And then he shut the door...

249
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,356
And locked it.

250
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,105
I remember the sound
of the latch sliding.

251
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,648
How old were you?

252
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,067
I don't know.
Seven and a half?

253
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,803
Why are you being so dramatic?
It was no big deal.

254
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,304
My father is an artist.

255
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,098
They don't live
like other people do.

256
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,390
They have to be in touch with...

257
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:40,958
They have to crap on conventional
things in order to create.

258
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,793
Did you say it to your mother?

259
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:43,854
No.

260
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:47,673
Did your father tell you not to?

261
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:48,747
no.

262
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,424
But you walked away
from the door knowing...

263
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:55,181
you weren't supposed
to say anything, that you had a secret.

264
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:02,146
Maybe that's when the idea of telepathy
between you and your dad began?

265
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:06,037
This idea that you can understand
each other without words.

266
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,867
That's your big theory?

267
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:14,658
After all your insinuations?
Pretty lame.

268
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,075
- You keep accusing me...
- You keep suggesting

269
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,285
that somebody crossed
the line with me,

270
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,972
that I don't have
the ability to say "no."

271
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:23,700
You're saying that...

272
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,132
What?

273
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,167
That I've been sexually abused.

274
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,425
You think that's the secret
I'm looking for?

275
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,875
- Well, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

276
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,510
No, right.

277
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:45,189
Do you think something
happened to you?

278
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,162
Are you listening to me?
I told you nothing happened.

279
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,028
You're the one who keeps implying...

280
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:54,156
I don't think you were
sexually abused, Sophie.

281
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:57,901
Good. Now we can finally
stop talking about that.

282
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,008
Why didn't you ever tell your mother
what you saw?

283
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,600
Don't be an idiot.

284
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,629
So this secret has been there
between you and she all these years?

285
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,963
So what? I barely speak
to the woman anyway.

286
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:14,012
You don't think there's any connection
between those two things?

287
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,512
I don't speak to her
because she's pathetic.

288
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:17,995
She's a moron.

289
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:21,303
She couldn't see
what was right in front of her face.

290
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,498
Sometimes I think
she's still waiting for him,

291
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,024
like Santa Claus or something.

292
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,319
She would never admit it,
but it's so obvious, it's pathetic.

293
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,461
But if you told her, she might not be
waiting for him any longer.

294
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,284
It's not my job
to make her face reality!

295
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,877
I'm the child.
She's supposed to be smarter than me.

296
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,239
You know, she sits there,
day after day,

297
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,085
waiting for him to come to his senses.
I want to scream at her,

298
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,540
"He doesn't give a fuck about you!

299
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,682
"You're stupid.
You're useless.

300
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:55,676
"Just get the fuck up
of your clueless ass and get a life!"

301
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:57,720
Why didn't you tell her
about his affairs?

302
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,297
It's not my fucking job!

303
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,932
Maybe you didn't tell her
because you were afraid.

304
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:04,935
Maybe you were afraid they'd separate
and it would be your fault,

305
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,023
just like you thought that you'd ruined
Cy and Darlene's marriage?

306
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,201
Why didn't you tell your mother
after they divorced?

307
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:17,668
What was I supposed to do?
Rub her face in it?

308
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,780
You're angry she couldn't see that?

309
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,785
Yes!
Fuck yes!

310
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:24,690
In all the weeks
that we've been in therapy,

311
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,416
you've never once allowed yourself
to be angry at your father.

312
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,614
It's never even been
a possibility for you.

313
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,734
Why do you think that is?

314
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,644
See, I think that your father
made you his accomplice.

315
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:39,973
He burdened you with this secret

316
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,783
way too heavy
for any child to carry,

317
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:46,699
and he drove this wedge between you
and your mother with this secret.

318
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,639
Maybe you're afraid to get angry at him

319
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,201
<i>because if you did,
you'd lose him for good.</i>

320
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:55,172
Maybe you never told your mother
because part of you still hopes

321
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,901
that they're gonna
get back together again.

322
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,729
I know that's never
going to happen.

323
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,574
- I'm not an idiot.
- Wouldn't have to be to believe that.

324
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,091
I know plenty of grownups

325
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,482
whose parents
have separated 20, 30 years,

326
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:16,003
who have even died...
They still hope in their heart of hearts

327
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:19,554
that their mother and father
still share a bed in heaven.

328
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,084
He wouldn't be a good husband
if he came back.

329
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:27,893
He'd just leave her again.

330
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,493
And you.

331
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,480
What?

332
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:34,197
He left you too,
didn't he?

333
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:35,716
No.

334
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,720
He just moved out.
He's still my dad.

335
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,364
Of course he's still your dad,

336
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,341
but he did literally
leave you, didn't he?

337
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,049
He moved away.
He's not around,

338
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,651
he doesn't even know
whether you're dead or alive.

339
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:49,832
He was working.

340
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,000
Why can't you let yourself
be angry at him?

341
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,178
Why should I be angry at him?

342
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:55,883
She's the one who...

343
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:58,221
Who pisses me off.

344
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,304
- Why?
- Because she's pathetic

345
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,976
and annoying and...

346
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,680
And she's always around.

347
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,582
I can understand why you might
be angry at her too, though.

348
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:16,625
'Cause you feel she didn't protect you
from what was going on at home.

349
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,231
But she's also a rock.

350
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,801
She's incredibly patient.
She's persistent.

351
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,014
She's not going anywhere.

352
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,362
She's really something
when you think about it.

353
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,587
Isn't she?

354
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,698
There's something
I haven't told you.

355
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:05,998
What's that?

356
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,863
I'm not really that interested
in gymnastics anymore.

357
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,224
What?

358
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:15,736
Why not?

359
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,061
I don't know.

360
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:20,362
Used to be everything to me,

361
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:22,681
and now it's not.

362
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,220
And why do you think that is?

363
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,306
No, you tell me, Paul.

364
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,440
I think that when you were growing up,
there weren't enough boundaries at home.

365
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,813
Boundaries to protect a child from...
What we you, six, seven?

366
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:46,822
From...

367
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:49,300
things that could impact your...

368
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,075
Your view of sex,

369
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,430
your body,

370
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,917
your attitudes
toward men.

371
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,574
It was also an environment

372
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:02,852
where you were expected to be
complicit in the lies of grownups.

373
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:07,124
I think you wanted to escape, so sports
became the perfect outlet for you.

374
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:11,802
A place with rules and order,
where discipline protected you

375
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,017
and guided you.

376
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,477
Gymnastics was always a place
that you were able to run away to,

377
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,336
to be in control.

378
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:29,237
Maybe...

379
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:34,570
Maybe you don't need to run away
to that world anymore.

380
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,406
- Shit.
- What?

381
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:53,171
i'll never make
the olympic team now,

382
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,234
not with that attitude.

383
00:21:57,181 --> 00:22:00,981
Well, I don't think
that's necessarily true.

384
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:05,485
I'm gonna suck at it.

385
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,165
Have you ever failed before?

386
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:10,499
Never, but...

387
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:12,208
What?

388
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:18,539
<i>... the times,
they are a-changin'.</i>

389
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,101
It's from a Bob Dylan song.

390
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:26,708
My gift to you.

391
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,551
Thank you.

392
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,266
You're welcome.

393
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,810
He's an old geezer...

394
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:36,433
Like you.

395
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,983
Thanks.

396
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:54,586
Our time is up.

397
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,466
So I'll see you next week then.

398
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:50,992
Okay?
