1
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,938
Good morning, Mia.

2
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:27,190
Me again.

3
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:29,253
Come in, please.

4
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:38,033
I know 7:00 is early, but it's
the only time that I could come.

5
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:39,562
No, it's okay.

6
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,913
You know, it's funny... 20 years ago
I was in brooklyn, you were in the city,

7
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,067
and now it's the other way around.

8
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,286
Oh, that's... that's true.

9
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:52,245
I know you've spoken with ellis
about your case

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,144
and he is on top of it, but if you're
not pleased, {\I hope you'll }let me know.

11
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,765
Thank you,
and I really appreciate the referral.

12
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:04,015
You have more light in here than you
had in your old office on 10th street.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,827
Yeah, that was...
that was a long time ago.

14
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,598
It's strange to be back.

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,660
This couch is better.

16
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:22,688
The old one was blue
with black pillows.

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,235
You have a good memory.

18
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,045
I just thought it was funny

19
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,896
that you had a black and blue couch.

20
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm sorry about last week.

21
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,310
Oh, it was fine.

22
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,317
No, it was unprofessional
and it shouldn't have happened.

23
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:03,613
Well, as you said,
these things happen.

24
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:08,209
Well, it was embarrassing
and that's why I called...

25
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:11,581
I wanted to apologize
and just talk about it.

26
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:13,546
Good.

27
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:18,519
And I understand your saying no
to having a drink. That's too personal.

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,019
Anyway, I'm happy to come in,
have a session

29
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,829
and just try to clean up
the mess I made.

30
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,693
I should've brought a mop.

31
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,913
So your feelings kind of
caught you by surprise?

32
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:37,442
But that was back on last monday
and you called me on friday.

33
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,831
Did it take you that long to decide?

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,445
I didn't know if I wanted to.

35
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,842
Sometimes it's better
just to let things go...

36
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,045
don't go ferreting around
for more problems.

37
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:55,283
I just really didn't think
I would lose it like that.

38
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,443
And you were right
about how I set it up.

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,317
I'm not so sure
that I said you set it up.

40
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,769
Oh, but I did.

41
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,933
Ellis couldn't be there, I saw
your name on the file and I grabbed it.

42
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,866
I actually thought it would be fun

43
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,726
just to needle you a little
and impress you.

44
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, I was impressed.

45
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,313
Till Bennett walked in.

46
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:27,225
- Can I smoke?
- Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.

47
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,446
Oh, really?

48
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,221
God, everyone is so healthy.
Why is that?

49
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,856
Even Bennett hates that.

50
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,548
If you can't smoke after sex,
what's the point?

51
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,130
You're telling me
that you and bennett are involved?

52
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,443
I figured you had figured that out.

53
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:44,990
I did notice your manner changed
after he came into the room, yeah.

54
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,141
He knew you were my old therapist,

55
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,208
had to mark the room
like the dog he is.

56
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,206
Oh, so you think it was territorial?

57
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,292
- And kind of funny, considering.
- How so?

58
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,025
- I'm sure you noticed he wears a ring.
- I Did.

59
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,998
It's bad enough
to sleep with a married man,

60
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:06,930
but when he's your boss,
it's really pathetic, right?

61
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,531
I'm sure you had your reasons.

62
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:13,662
Yeah, I had been seeing
this other guy... Andre...

63
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,048
and that was fading fast,
so I just thought "well,

64
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,148
"I'll have a little fling with Bennett
and it'll be easier to let andre go

65
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:21,049
"if they overlap a little."

66
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:23,192
Is there...
I think there's a term for that.

67
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:24,867
It's called shingling.

68
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:29,259
Right, well,
who wants to have a leaky roof?

69
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:35,415
I never thought it would last,
you know, past a month with Bennett.

70
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,990
But it has lasted.

71
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,541
Yeah, over a year now.

72
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,195
Nobody knows.

73
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:46,127
That's a long time to keep a secret.

74
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,904
He said he was gonna leave his wife,

75
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:54,052
he wanted to be with me,
and I believed him.

76
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,898
I mean, it does happen.

77
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:01,301
People do leave their wives,
even for older women.

78
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,384
They do.

79
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,630
Well, he didn't.

80
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,320
So what happened?

81
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,230
It doesn't matter.
So now I need to meet someone else.

82
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,778
Do you know anybody?

83
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,554
So now you want me
to introduce you to somebody?

84
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,918
Sure. I don't need a therapist,
I need a matchmaker.

85
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,493
You think I would be
a good judge of character?

86
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,582
Oh, you don't have to be.

87
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,248
Just figure out
who I'm attracted to and then...

88
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,850
pick someone else.

89
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:38,844
You do owe me.

90
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,542
What do you mean I owe you?

91
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,896
I don't get what you mean.

92
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:49,169
What if I stood by the window
and smoked?

93
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,111
You can stand wherever
you like, Mia,

94
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:53,685
but I would still rather
you didn't smoke.

95
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:55,382
Okay.

96
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,337
Don't set me up.

97
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,235
I'm sure Bennett will call.

98
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,644
His wife never has sex with him.

99
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:10,859
I don't understand how people
can stay married like that. I...

100
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,822
you're divorced, right?

101
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:19,865
I mean, I know I'm not supposed to ask
but since I'm not really a patient...

102
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,929
did you have an affair?

103
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:28,295
When you say that you don't
really think that you're a patient,

104
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,633
- I think that what you're saying is...
- You did, didn't you?

105
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,813
Your wife found out,
she left you and now you're alone.

106
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,551
And here we are,

107
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,024
together again.

108
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,511
I've been wondering this past week

109
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,458
what would've happened if you and I

110
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,823
had just run into one another
in Soho or something like that.

111
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,170
And what do you think
would've happened?

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh, probably nothing.

113
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,640
I mean, look at you.

114
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:06,468
I'm sure you don't have any trouble
finding women with the accent

115
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,665
and the eyes.

116
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,088
You probably already have
a girlfriend.

117
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,241
See, it's different for me.

118
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,777
How is it different for you?

119
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,119
It just is.

120
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:23,511
Do you feel
that you're not attractive?

121
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:25,675
No, I think I look fine.

122
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,491
I'm not talking about having sex.

123
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,824
I can find that.

124
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,403
Are you talking about having
a relationship?

125
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,619
Do you have any idea
what it's like to meet a smart,

126
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,500
interesting, available man
who's over 40?

127
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,938
No, what's it like?

128
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,591
Well, the pool is exceedingly small.

129
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,907
They're either married
or there's a very good reason

130
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,168
why they're not married.

131
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,904
And if they're divorced,
they want them young.

132
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:53,465
I bet the last woman
you fell for was... what?... 30.

133
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:58,455
Are you asking me if somebody like me
would be attracted to somebody like you?

134
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,505
Answering a question
with a question?

135
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:04,813
You sound like Bennett.

136
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,417
Lawyers should never be
with other lawyers.

137
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,731
I wonder if his wife
is sleeping with him again.

138
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:14,263
I taught him what to do,
she gets the benefits.

139
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:16,326
And what did you teach him to do?

140
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,356
God, the first time...

141
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,918
It was like...
it was like doing it with a salmon.

142
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,598
Do you ever watch
those nature documentaries?

143
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:31,403
Where the male salmon
frantically kind of jerks around

144
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:33,884
for about 15 seconds with its...

145
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,918
mouth gaping open
and then it just stops.

146
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:41,976
Not to mention
there's no hands, tongue...

147
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,231
never really touches the female.

148
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:47,194
So you turned Bennett from a...

149
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,655
from a fish into a man.

150
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:54,326
That sounds mythic.

151
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,455
A real fairy tale, you know, the one
where the princess fucks the frog

152
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,377
and turns him into a prince and then

153
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,195
he goes back to his
frigid frog wife.

154
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,427
What? What are you thinking?

155
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:11,302
I'm thinking it's a good thing
you don't write children's books.

156
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,739
Do I look like I don't understand
children?

157
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:20,100
Because I don't have any children
and you do?

158
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,179
No, I was just... no.

159
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,165
Sorry, it was a bad joke.

160
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,390
That's fine.

161
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:28,904
I'm not at my most jovial.

162
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:32,279
- I think I hurt your feelings.
- No, no, it's just...

163
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:35,335
Oh, never mind.

164
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:38,978
What is it?

165
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,459
I don't have any children.

166
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:48,654
And now, it looks like I won't.

167
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,766
My FSH level is higher
than it should be.

168
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,897
And I'm 43 and I'm a little young
for that and my doctor said

169
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:02,227
that if I wanted to get pregnant
I should have done it yesterday or

170
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,902
maybe five years ago.

171
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:07,341
I mean it's still
theoretically possible.

172
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,147
It must have been hard to hear.

173
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,902
It wasn't a complete surprise.

174
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:15,991
I'd stop taking the pill with Bennett
over the summer and nothing happened,

175
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,121
so...

176
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,245
But yeah, I went to see my doctor
on monday.

177
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,767
The same day that you and I met.

178
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,259
Yeah, that afternoon.

179
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:30,045
You're implying there's
a connection?

180
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,712
Am I?

181
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,165
Well, do you think
there's a connection?

182
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,339
Okay...

183
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:39,654
Yes.

184
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,718
Seeing you

185
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,395
just made me think

186
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,714
about my life.

187
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,965
- When did you get the results?
- On friday.

188
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,084
Did you tell Bennett?

189
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,327
And what did he said?

190
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,796
- He told me to get out.
- Get out?

191
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:08,036
- Where were you?
- I drove to his house

192
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,574
in Larchmont.

193
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:15,154
I told his wife it was a work emergency.
He wasn't even there.

194
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,260
I had to sit there and wait
with Gwen and the kids.

195
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,402
- and the tacky antiques.
- Did he show up?

196
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:22,890
Yeah, eventually.

197
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,387
We went to his study and I told him
that I wanted to see a specialist,

198
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,645
and I needed to get pregnant
right away.

199
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,464
He just said "get out"?

200
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,367
That and...

201
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:38,026
That he didn't want
to see me anymore.

202
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,620
And that's when you called me,
after you had seen Bennett.

203
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,259
Well, it's a hell of a week you had.

204
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:51,580
You get these test results
from your doctor,

205
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,605
you get rejected by Bennett,

206
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:57,056
and it kind of all begins
with meeting me on monday.

207
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,317
In a way...

208
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,951
It really all started 20 years ago.

209
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,891
You mean

210
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,518
when I was your therapist?

211
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,829
I was wondering

212
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,280
all these years later,
now that you know how it turned out,

213
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:18,488
what do you think
about that pregnancy?

214
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,907
What... what do you think?

215
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,182
No. No, Paul,

216
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,645
what do you think?

217
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,042
Seeing me last week, did it

218
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,912
make you question

219
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:33,824
that decision?

220
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,516
No, seeing you only made it worse.

221
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:41,176
So you've been struggling
with this for some time?

222
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,944
You know, it's ironic.

223
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,583
When I was looking at

224
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,513
your case file, I did the math

225
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,089
your wife

226
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,283
was pregnant at the same time I was,

227
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,857
but you thought that I should get
an abortion.

228
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,676
You think I wanted you to get
an abortion?

229
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,551
It was a mutual decision.

230
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:03,343
We made it together?

231
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,327
How did we do that, Mia?

232
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,602
Um, I was 22,

233
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,677
you were my therapist.

234
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,857
I was getting ready to go
to law school, I got pregnant

235
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:15,382
and you didn't think
I should have it.

236
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:17,546
- And what told you that?
- Oh, come on.

237
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,297
Maybe you can remind me.

238
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,526
Why don't you look over
your old session notes?

239
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:23,260
Or have you not even kept those?

240
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,193
You sound...

241
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:27,941
you sound kind of angry.

242
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,536
You know, you appear to have forgotten
the whole thing,

243
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:34,011
the gift that I gave you,
and the decision that we made.

244
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:36,226
- I don't...
- Forget it.

245
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,727
What is the point?

246
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,425
Obviously, we can't bring
the baby back,

247
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,853
but we might both learn
something if we...

248
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,158
we talk about it.

249
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,627
It seems to me that we may have
different perspectives.

250
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,080
There are facts.

251
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:54,780
- And what would they be?
- You challenged me

252
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:55,955
constantly.

253
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:58,415
Did I want to give up law school?

254
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,464
Was I ready to become a parent?

255
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:03,869
- Did I want to get married?
- And what were the answers?

256
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,657
You thought it would ruin my life.

257
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:07,630
Is that really what I said?

258
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,655
I do remember talking to you
about your anxiety

259
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,501
in relation to beginning law school

260
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,024
and separating from your family.

261
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,563
And I think you had doubts
about your boyfriend

262
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,138
at the time.
He was a musician, right?

263
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,909
- A drummer.
- Yeah.

264
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,241
You would think his timing
would've been better.

265
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,043
- It was a joke, Paul.
I... I get it.

266
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:35,741
- What was his name again?
- Stevie.

267
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:40,265
He fixed cars during the week

268
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,405
and did gigs on the weekend.

269
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:46,494
I'd follow him around
to all these dives.

270
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:52,563
He had this beautiful long hair
that would go flying everywhere.

271
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,553
But you know everyone said

272
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:58,188
- "He's a musician mechanic. He's not
or Mia." - What did you think?

273
00:14:58,469 --> 00:14:59,919
I think I loved him

274
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:02,706
and I...

275
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,353
I let him go.

276
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:08,657
Do you know what that's like?

277
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,918
He was right there

278
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:14,191
next to me.

279
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:18,363
What were we thinking that somebody
better was gonna come along,

280
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,238
somebody my family liked?

281
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,331
And now...

282
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,828
Now I'm here
and this is what I have.

283
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,731
And I wish I could go back.

284
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,866
To what?

285
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,254
To that moment

286
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,769
right before I lost him.

287
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:47,999
You were there, Paul.

288
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:54,438
Maybe this is why you wanted
to see me, Mia,

289
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:55,613
to go back.

290
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,110
To go back to that moment
and try to understand it.

291
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,335
Yeah, what happened?

292
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,278
I missed it.

293
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:08,286
I don't remember how Stevie felt
about all this.

294
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:11,022
Oh, he didn't even know
I was pregnant.

295
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:15,149
Yeah, the person I told
was my father.

296
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,599
He was great about it.
He was completely supportive.

297
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:20,824
In what way?

298
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,872
Well, I mean he was upset
about it at first, of course,

299
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,597
but then he said whatever
I wanted to do,

300
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:28,694
he'd be there for me.

301
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,743
We even made a list
of the pros and cons

302
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:32,868
together.

303
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,765
He did everything

304
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,379
he found the doctor, he paid for it,

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,336
he took me to the appointment.

306
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:42,211
You remember him as being
so perfectly there

307
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,878
for you, so present,

308
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:47,475
and I was the one who let you down.

309
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,600
He even arranged for the abortion.

310
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,575
Yeah, of course he did,
so I wouldn't have to.

311
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,931
You know, I don't think
you told me that 20 years ago.

312
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,054
Do you know why not?

313
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:03,962
I didn't come here to talk
about my father.

314
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:05,542
We're fine.

315
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:10,513
How many fathers and daughters
have as good of a relationship?

316
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,538
And you're still very close.

317
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:16,326
In fact, he called you twice
when I was in the office.

318
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,806
Yeah. I mean, is there something
wrong with that?

319
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,151
It's better than fighting
all the time.

320
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:23,686
I bet you wish you were
as close to your daughter.

321
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,627
You haven't mentioned your mom.

322
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,036
Oh, she didn't know about it.

323
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:35,554
- You didn't tell your mother
that you were pregnant? - No.

324
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:39,478
That's kind of striking.

325
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,403
And your father didn't tell her?

326
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:43,739
No.

327
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,928
So it was a kind of a...

328
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:48,676
what? A secret

329
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,661
just between the two of you?

330
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,947
Well, the three of us,
because you knew.

331
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,003
Were there any other secrets?

332
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,722
All girls have secrets with their dads.
That's normal.

333
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,497
Like what, for example?

334
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,942
Well, my dad left the apartment
before I woke up every day,

335
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,817
to go and open the store.

336
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,429
So I never got to see him
in the mornings.

337
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,620
But I would leave early
to walk to school

338
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:25,842
You know it was Greenpoint, Brooklyn,
everbody, did that then.

339
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,606
- And where was you mum?
- Oh, I don't know.

340
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,175
Probably sleeping.

341
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:32,975
And I would stop by,

342
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,788
It was a candy store with magazines

343
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:39,479
and he would give me this big smile

344
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,404
and then he would make coffee
for both of us.

345
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:47,414
I mean mine was probably mostly milk
but it felt very grown-up.

346
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,466
And we would sit and
read the papers together

347
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:53,448
and he always told me
that I was smart.

348
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:57,959
My mother never knew.

349
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,718
That was a secret.

350
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,432
Just the two of you.

351
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:05,896
One day,

352
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,517
I was in the back room,

353
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,029
and this man came in
to rob the store

354
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:15,814
and I watched as he pointed a gun
at my father.

355
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,155
And my father

356
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,773
told him to get out

357
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,974
that he had earned that money and that
he wasn't give him a penny of it

358
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,720
and that he had pressed the alarm button
and the police were on their way,

359
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,626
which, you know, was a lie.

360
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,467
How old were you?

361
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,961
I was on 2nd grade,
so probably 7 or 8.

362
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,926
You must have been terrified.

363
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:40,648
Yeah, I was, but I was so...

364
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,577
I was so proud of him, he...

365
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:49,732
but I, you know,
I didn't know what to do

366
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,807
when I tried to catch his eye

367
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,838
and he looked at me and...

368
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:56,689
the robber saw him

369
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,745
and he just aimed his gun
straight at me

370
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,759
What happened?

371
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,836
He yelled:
"Do you want to lose you girl?

372
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,611
Is that what you want?"

373
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,667
And my father,
he just emptied the register.

374
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:23,466
And, you know, I remember that
it was a friday, so the till was full

375
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:25,133
and... the guy ran.

376
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,696
My father, he just...

377
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,220
he grabbed me and he started

378
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,695
to cry and

379
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,379
I hadn't ever really seen him

380
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:44,423
do that, you know.

381
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,890
And he was shaking and I told him,
I said "I'm okay.

382
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:53,841
I'm sorry because, if it wasn't for me,
you'll still have your money."

383
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,536
He was holding me so tight.

384
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:59,867
He didn't let me go to school that day,
he wouldn't let go

385
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,542
and he let me eat
my favorite chocolates

386
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,389
and he made me promise

387
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,440
never to tell my mother.

388
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,852
Why?

389
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:14,231
Well, because
she would have blamed him for...

390
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:18,405
losing all that money
and for not having a gun

391
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,584
and not having an alarm, you know,

392
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,309
for letting me visit him
in the mornings.

393
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,551
You, obviously

394
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,813
had a really close bond.
Did that make you feel

395
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,065
- important? - You know my poor dad,
in that awful store every day,

396
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:40,591
he paid for law school

397
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:45,178
There's something else
in that memory that

398
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,347
the way that he held on to you

399
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,573
the way he cried

400
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,285
You had to stay with him all day?

401
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,390
I mean, it was
a life-or-death situation.

402
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,323
Did you feel that

403
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,070
maybe there was a part of you
that couldn't leave him?

404
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:06,523
- Maybe that it felt...
- You know, no, that's enough.

405
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,394
I didn't come in here for therapy.

406
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,871
- Which part is the therapy
- You know,

407
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,060
your mother, your father
and your chilhood

408
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,300
I don't want to talk about that.

409
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:20,685
What I want to talk...
I want a partner

410
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,807
in my life.
I want a family and a home

411
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:30,079
before it's too late,
which it may already be.

412
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:32,433
- I understand.
- Can you help me with that?

413
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,881
You're telling me you don't want
therapy, Mia,

414
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,145
but you've come to me for help
and you know

415
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,636
therapy is all I have to offer.

416
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,524
I think what we have to do
is to look at the kind of choices

417
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,949
that you've been making up until now

418
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,398
- and why you haven't found...
- OK, I...

419
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:49,223
How long does that take?

420
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:52,933
- How old I'm going to be then?
- I think you came here for a reason.

421
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,189
Not just to talk about last week
or last month.

422
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,822
- I think what we need to do is...
- You're not listening to me

423
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,812
I don't have time for that.

424
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:04,173
Doesn'it feel like we are
in a similar position to 20 years ago,

425
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,180
when the clock is ticking
and you need to take action?

426
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:10,388
I know you feel I failed you back then,
I know that.

427
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:15,071
But if I offer you some kind of
quick fix that you know I can't deliver,

428
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,169
it's going to end the same way, Mia.

429
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,522
You'll feel angry,
you'll feel let down.

430
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,967
Like you did before
and like you did with Bennett.

431
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,317
Bennett?

432
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,940
It doesn't sound like Bennett was ever
going to give you what you wanted.

433
00:23:28,065 --> 00:23:29,682
What happened was painful but

434
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,284
not really surprising.

435
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,669
It was almost set up to fail, Mia.

436
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:35,454
If I were to go along
with your request

437
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,549
- to find you a man, that will be
a set-up too - I have to go.

438
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,006
What do I owe you?

439
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,858
Well, I can send you the bill.

440
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,821
Whatever you want, I probably make
more than you do an hour.

441
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,143
I have to deal with
doctors and lawyers all day, so...

442
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,311
Your office's nicer than mine.

443
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,671
It's homey.

444
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,317
- Well, thanks.
- Would you like to come back next week?

445
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,149
Why?

446
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,587
Because, like you said, I

447
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,610
I owe you.

448
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:14,071
That's not what I meant.

449
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:17,309
What did you mean?

450
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,584
I meant you owe me a child, Paul.

451
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,220
That's what you owe me.
