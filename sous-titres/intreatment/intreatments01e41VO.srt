00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:05,423
My dad is the most important person
to me in this whole world.

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:07,514
You've tried to kill yourself,

4
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:10,629
and you don't want to tell
the most important person in your world?

5
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,131
He has a life!

6
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:14,546
It's not his fault
that I took those pills!

7
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,298
I'm not saying it is his fault.
I'm just trying to figure out

8
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:20,389
why you were so ready
to leave the planet and not tell him.

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,859
- Are you angry at him for something?
- I'm not angry at him.

10
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:26,232
You told me once that you wanted
to move across the country

11
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,044
to be with your dad and his new wife,
but that they didn't have a room for you.

12
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:31,900
I told you, he left her because of that.

13
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,812
After two years, Sophie.

14
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,429
How could he just stop loving me?

15
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:38,989
What did I do?

16
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,229
Laura, hi.

17
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:55,453
It's me, Paul.

18
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,278
I hope you're doing okay.

19
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:00,302
I'm still hoping we could...

20
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:03,390
talk, meet up maybe, have a coffee.

21
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:07,367
Okay, I guess I'll try you again.

22
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:36,791
Hey, doll.

23
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,052
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,478
Good to see you too.

25
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,789
Come here.

26
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,366
Give me a hug.

27
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,580
Look at you.

28
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,191
You're a knockout.

29
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,414
How are these arms?

30
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,501
Perfect.

31
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,104
How did you know I'd be here?

32
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,728
From mom.

33
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,716
She was eager to remind me
you had therapy this morning

34
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,579
and that you were benefiting
from therapy.

35
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,857
Getting the address
was a little harder, though.

36
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:28,677
Maybe she's afraid I'll embarrass you
in front of your shrink...

37
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,030
probably because she has.

38
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:36,876
So...

39
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,673
this is where the magic happens?

40
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,357
So I hear you kicked ass at the trials,
from mom.

41
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:48,574
Yeah.

42
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,499
How come
you didn't call me afterwards?

43
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,796
I was really tired.
I just wanted to sleep.

44
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,297
'cause you knew I was waiting
for your call, right, kiddo?

45
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,163
Were you?

46
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:03,802
You could have come
to the competion.

47
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:07,806
I can't just walk away from stuff.
You know that.

48
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,545
And plus, I didn't want
to just show up out of nowhere

49
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,964
at the last minute and surprise you.

50
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,105
I was afraid
it might make you nervous.

51
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:22,365
What's going on?
How come I haven't heard from you?

52
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,657
Are you angry at me for something?

53
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:34,430
That's quite a stare you've developed
there. It's kind of freaking me out.

54
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,058
I gotta get in there.

55
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:37,872
Wait wait, come here, come here.

56
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,192
Give me a hug.

57
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:45,005
I'm so insanely proud of you,

58
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,538
my crazy, talented kid,

59
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:54,104
it just kills me
when I don't hear from you, slays me.

60
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,816
I don't eat. I don't sleep.

61
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,608
I called, actually,

62
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,227
- a couple of times.
- But you didn't leave any messages.

63
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,364
Mom always answers her cell phone.

64
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,301
I'm not mom, honey.

65
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:11,832
Come on, let's go talk about this
over a bite to eat.

66
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,479
- I haven't had lunch yet.
- Dad, I have therapy now.

67
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,684
Right.

68
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:18,859
Therapy.

69
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,075
All right.

70
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,871
I'll wait. We'll go afterwards.

71
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,371
- You don't have to wait for me.
- I do have to.

72
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,747
Apparently, that's the only way
I'm gonna get a chance

73
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,967
to spend some time with my kid.

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,008
So how's it going with this thing,
this shrink thing?

75
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:38,981
Okay.

76
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,608
Yeah? What do you guys talk about?

77
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:42,965
Stuff.

78
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,429
What kind of stuff?

79
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,672
Boys stuff, gymnastics stuff, what?

80
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,052
Sometimes.

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,640
You talk about me?

82
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,052
Sometimes.

83
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,269
You talk about me in there?

84
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:00,211
Really?

85
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,131
We talk about a lot of things, dad.

86
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:06,601
What do you say about me?

87
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:08,815
I don't know.

88
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,666
You don't know?

89
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,683
Is that what this is about ?
All this weirdness between you and me?

90
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,019
Is that what's going on?

91
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,863
It's because of this therapy?

92
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,650
Fuck me with a rubber hose.
I'm gonna talk to him.

93
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,244
- Dad.
- Come on.

94
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:28,502
It'll just take a second.
You can come with me. It'll be fun.

95
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:35,704
Are those for me?

96
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,427
I'm Zach. I'm Sophie's father.

97
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,317
Nice to meet you. No, these are...

98
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,552
for Sophie,
for doing so well at the trials.

99
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:52,547
That's nice.

100
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:56,808
Isn't that nice, Sofa? There you go.

101
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,523
So we thought we'd come in
together today. Is that all right?

102
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,026
Did you plan to come together?

103
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,986
No. He was waiting for me outside.

104
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:11,073
- Does it matter?
- Actually, it does, yes.

105
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:15,627
- Why? What's the problem?
- Well, I'd have to talk to Sophie

106
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,996
and see how she feels
about the three of us meeting.

107
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,120
She's fine.
You're cool with it, right?

108
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,527
- Whatever.
- It's cool.

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,922
Can we come in?

110
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,370
Why don't we schedule a meeting,

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,681
A joint session
for all three of us next week?

112
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,692
No time like the present.

113
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,457
I think Sophie and I need to consider

114
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,861
whether or not a joint session
would be to her benefit.

115
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,902
- We need time to prepare...
- Time to prepare for what? I'm her father.

116
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,154
Dad, be cool.

117
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,284
- It's not a big deal.
- I'm totally cool, kiddo.

118
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,911
It's this guy who seems
to have something wedged up his ass.

119
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:00,748
Dad! We can do it next week, okay?
Please.

120
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,148
Dad!

121
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,150
Don't go !

122
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,366
I'll tell him
that he has to let you in.

123
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:30,554
Forget it.

124
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,446
He's just trying to protect me.

125
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,754
Protect you? From what?

126
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:37,163
From your dad?
Oh, good. That's a relief.

127
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,129
I'll tell him that I'll cancel
the session if you don't come in.

128
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,957
Do you honestly think
I would go back in there now?

129
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,119
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that was.

130
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,455
Me standing in front of your therapist,

131
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,296
Like I'am...

132
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:54,752
I'm what? What does he think I am?

133
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:57,512
What's the matter with you?

134
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:00,305
Are you actually
taking this guy seriously?

135
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,020
It's like
he's brainwashing you or something.

136
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,397
Brainwashing me about what?

137
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,157
You have to prepare
to meet with your dad?

138
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:14,946
Boy, is that bullshit.

139
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:22,152
You can't even look me in the eye.
Boy...

140
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,915
That just breaks my heart.

141
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,004
I raised you
to be smarter than this.

142
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,451
You didn't really raise me.

143
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,800
Excuse me?

144
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:41,413
Most of the time you were far away.

145
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:47,628
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

146
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:10,502
He said he'd never been more humiliated
in his whole life.

147
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:13,922
- I can't let him in without an appointment.
- He's my father.

148
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,368
Even still.

149
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,088
You let my mother in.

150
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,012
We'd made an appointment
with your mother ahead of time.

151
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,179
Why couldn't you just let him in?
It wouldn't have bothered me.

152
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,931
I know you're used to your father
coming in and out of your life,

153
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,741
but that doesn't mean
it doesn't bother you.

154
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:34,442
In fact,
I suspect it bothers you very much.

155
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,429
And he's not exempt
from the rules of this office.

156
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,807
You and your fucking rules...

157
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:42,805
If your wife walked in,
would you chase her away,

158
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,304
tell her to come back next week?

159
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,119
I would absolutely tell her
or anyone else

160
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,833
if I thought their presence
in my office was inappropriate.

161
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:54,638
I need time to prepare for a session
with both you and your father.

162
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,000
So it wasn't even about me at all.

163
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,884
You're so full of it.

164
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,478
What?

165
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,849
I suddenly understand
what your mother must feel.

166
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,865
What is that supposed to mean?

167
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,449
You're easy on your father.

168
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,993
He disappears for months,
then barges in unannounced,

169
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,681
wants to break into your therapy.

170
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,729
He invades your private space,
but still you defend him.

171
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,159
He is always the king.

172
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:28,808
Well, you don't have to worry because
he's never coming back here again.

173
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,874
So you can have your crown back.

174
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:34,233
- Okay, let's say he does come back.
- He won't.

175
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:37,679
But let's say we were able
to get him here. Would you want that?

176
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:38,851
Yes.

177
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:40,213
Why?

178
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,556
Because it's important to him.
Isn't that obvious?

179
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,265
To him or to you?

180
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:53,392
- Don't you have kids?
- You know I do.

181
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,993
Well, don't you ever do things
just to make them happy?

182
00:10:57,163 --> 00:11:00,070
- That's a very different situation.
- Not really.

183
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:03,074
He is the parent, not you.

184
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:05,034
So what?

185
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:10,494
- You don't see the difference?
- Don't patronize me!

186
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,837
I am not patronizing you.

187
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,808
These are your sessions, not his.

188
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:18,492
One of the reasons even adults
go into therapy

189
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:20,832
is to separate who they are

190
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:23,844
from what other people
want them to be.

191
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,491
Do you analyze your daughter too?

192
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,490
No, I try not to.

193
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,974
- Why not?
- Because it's just not a good idea.

194
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,065
It's not possible to treat
one's own children.

195
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:38,117
Why?

196
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:41,682
Parents play a big role in the
development of the child's personality.

197
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,116
So as a doctor
it would be very hard for me

198
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,886
to keep my role as a father
separate

199
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,494
from the therapy.

200
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,663
Because you are part of the problem.

201
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,762
Correct.

202
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,557
I couldn't even tell him
about my accident.

203
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:01,277
That is so fucked up.

204
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:07,277
Shit...

205
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:17,022
Let him in.
Let's just do this.

206
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,317
I want to talk to him.

207
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,402
Are you sure?

208
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,304
I need you to listen to me...

209
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,238
Come on in, please.

210
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:45,992
Oh, you've decided it's okay,
dad is not a leper?

211
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,887
Would you care to sit down?

212
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:18,083
All right,
you said I didn't raise you

213
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:20,233
and that I wasn't there for you.

214
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,213
So while I was outside

215
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,048
I made a list.

216
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,477
Every morning

217
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,896
from the time you were six
until you were 10,

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,412
I would get up with you at 5:00,

219
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,546
get you dressed

220
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:47,545
and take you to practice.

221
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,793
And I would wait outside of practice
until you were done,

222
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,002
so I could take you to school.

223
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,755
And then I would stay up with you,

224
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:05,627
so you could do your homework,
because you'd fall asleep if I didn't.

225
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,261
Except that I...

226
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,222
sucked at math,

227
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,936
so I got evening tutoring lessons

228
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,339
three nights a week.

229
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,115
And when you--

230
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:34,239
When you couldn't sleep,

231
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,591
I would hold you...

232
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:45,003
And dance with you
until you would go to sleep.

233
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,284
And when you got injured, I sat with you
in the hospital

234
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,317
day and night.

235
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,041
Enough, dad. It's okay.

236
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,064
Just don't tell me
I didn't raise you.

237
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,352
Do you have any idea

238
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,858
how much it kills me

239
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:13,043
when I don't hear from you
for two weeks?

240
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,366
I can't eat.

241
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,114
I can't sleep.

242
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,905
God, look,

243
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,456
my hands are shaking.

244
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:27,754
You didn't see me for almost 3 years.
It didn't seem to matter so much then.

245
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,313
What are you talking about?

246
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,804
When you moved to New York
with that woman.

247
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:42,911
What does that have to do with anything?

248
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:46,357
- We spoke on the phone every day.
- It wasn't the same thing.

249
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,277
I knew everything
that was going on with you.

250
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,027
No, you didn't.

251
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,553
Well, it was two years, not three.

252
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,813
- Two and a half.
- Look, kiddo...

253
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,541
You knew...

254
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,199
- that I wanted you live with us.
- It never happened.

255
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,355
Which is why I left.

256
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,471
After two and a half years.

257
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,015
We never went a day without speaking.

258
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:23,017
I was still part of your life.

259
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,481
- You know nothing about me now.
- Why do you keep saying that?

260
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,273
What haven't you told me?

261
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,795
You knew how depressed mom was.

262
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:34,112
You knew it sucked being at home.
I wanted to come live with you.

263
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:38,189
- And I wanted that too.
- Apparently not badly enough.

264
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:41,120
I left her.

265
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,332
- After two and a half years!
- I left her, Sophie.

266
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:48,086
I loved her and I left her for you.

267
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,583
And if she changed her mind

268
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:54,550
and let you come live with us,
I would go back to her in an instant.

269
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,057
To the woman
who wouldn't take your daughter in,

270
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:00,807
right?

271
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:15,278
Sometimes grownup things
are just hard to explain.

272
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:16,837
Grownup things?

273
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,354
Grownup things?

274
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:22,062
You've got to be kidding me.
Just go.

275
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,575
Leave.

276
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,350
I don't want you here anymore.

277
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:36,357
You think
you can walk in and out of my life

278
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,167
like I'm
some sort of fucking train station?

279
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,187
What are you talking about?

280
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:44,543
Is this what he tells you?
Is this what your mother tells you?

281
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:47,393
This has nothing to do with her.
This is about me.

282
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:48,605
About you?

283
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,451
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

284
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:54,795
- Do you?
- You can't love me.

285
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,478
- You don't even know me!
- Why do you keep saying that?

286
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:00,198
I'm your father.
Who knows you better than I do?

287
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,744
He does.

288
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,564
He does?

289
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,338
Really?
But you're not the father, are you?

290
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,263
One day a week for a few weeks--

291
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,357
It's not really the same thing
as the first seven years, is it, doctor?

292
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,677
No, it's not.

293
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,729
And what do you have to say to this?

294
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,949
Or is this just your voice
coming through her mouth?

295
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:35,566
I've been listening to Sophie
for quite a while now

296
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:40,436
and what I hear from her
is a great anger

297
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,330
and resentment.

298
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,816
But I also hear from her
the need for you to reclaim

299
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,623
your relationship and to fight for it.

300
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,903
I never stopped loving you.

301
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,013
What's the difference?

302
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,064
You weren't there.

303
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,864
You chose her.

304
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:37,337
I didn't plan it that way.
If I could do it over again--

305
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:39,756
- You can't.
- I know, but if I could--

306
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:41,038
You can't.

307
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:46,073
You can't do anything over again.

308
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:50,214
You can't say
you're sorry and make it better.

309
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,367
You can't

310
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:56,190
make somebody trust you
if they don't.

311
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,913
You can't put a family back together.

312
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,032
It doesn't work like that.

313
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:03,336
That's grownup.

314
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,587
Did you know I tried to kill myself?

315
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:24,126
What?

316
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,143
When?

317
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:33,026
I didn't have an accident.

318
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,065
I rode my bike into a car on purpose.

319
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:41,273
I got tired of being alive.

320
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,614
Oh, God, kiddo...

321
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,810
I want you to leave now, okay?

322
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,462
- Please.
- Sophie, please.

323
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,021
I want to stay. Please.
Let me stay, please.

324
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,173
It's my therapy,

325
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:08,887
mine.

326
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,281
Jesus, I kicked my father out.

327
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,783
But you know what?

328
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,778
This is a great insight that you had,

329
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,937
that you have the power
to let your parents into your life

330
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:20,025
when you want them and to keep them out
when you don't want them.

331
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,670
I think it's a sign of maturity.

332
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:30,156
I'll probably never see him again.

333
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:31,385
I think you will.

334
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:38,169
You know, maybe he'll realize
that he's caused you pain

335
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,340
and that this will change him.

336
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,857
People can change, you know.

337
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:47,046
You think?

338
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,755
I think you've changed.

339
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:03,125
I'm going to go out
and see if I can catch him.

340
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:04,392
Okay.

341
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,550
I'm going away to Denver to train.

342
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:20,393
I want to be by myself for a while,

343
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:24,021
to take care of myself

344
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,502
without my mom

345
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:28,777
or you.

346
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,870
No offense.

347
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,752
No offense taken.

348
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:41,497
I've got to run it by my mom
but I think she'll be okay with it.

349
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:49,862
It's good.

350
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,076
It's what I want now.

351
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:57,096
You know you can call me
any time you want.

352
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:01,809
Yeah yeah, I know the drill, doctor.

353
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,051
Are there hugging rules too, Paul?

354
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:37,545
Yep.

355
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,468
Farewell, old fart.

356
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,954
Farewell, young fart.

357
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,166
Take care of yourself,

358
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:01,605
okay?

359
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,234
Is it okay?

360
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:26,254
Sure.

361
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:29,728
So what's going on?

362
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:32,141
I just saw that patient leaving.

363
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:35,320
- You know she used to go to my school?
- Yeah.

364
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:39,149
Is that her dad?

365
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:41,676
He looks cool.

366
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:45,915
Why are you smiling?

367
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:49,067
No reason.

368
00:25:54,904 --> 00:25:56,654
Mom seems a little tense.

369
00:25:57,404 --> 00:26:00,544
You mean, about her daughter
disappearing into the night?

370
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:02,564
No, that's not what I mean.

371
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,294
You guys
are talking about everything, right?

372
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:09,914
Yeah, well, we're--

373
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,116
We're trying.
