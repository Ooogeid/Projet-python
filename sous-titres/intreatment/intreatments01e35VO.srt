1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:03,167
<i>Previously on "in treatment"...</i>

2
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,967
Kate ran into Laura.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What I saw was
this highly-sexual woman

4
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,034
who was wearing stilettos
at 10:00 in the morning.

5
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,401
Isn't it a little
embarrassing for you,

6
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:15,401
following your dick
around like a caveman?

7
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,834
Kate, I fell in love with
you not just because you're...

8
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,167
Beautiful and sexy
but because of your strength.

9
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,167
<i>I needed that. I think
we both needed that.</i>

10
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:25,367
Not anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

11
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,568
<i>You know, you said you married him</i>

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,067
because he paid such
deep attention to you.

13
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:33,134
You've outgrown
that dependency.

14
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,834
So she's not
my groupie anymore

15
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,834
so I found somebody
to replace her.

16
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,934
<i>Is that your theory?
You see what she's doing?</i>

17
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,934
<i>she's instructing you
on what you should be feeling.</i>

18
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,101
Game, set and match
to you, Gina.

19
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,667
Hello?

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,167
Oh, hi.

21
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,767
So, um...

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
So, what did
the dermatologist say?

23
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:08,434
Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,201
Okay, so don't look
in the mirror, Sophie.

25
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>Yeah, cover the mirror up
with a towel or something.</i>

26
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,568
I'm ordering you
not to look at it.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
Doctor's orders, okay?

28
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,633
<i>Take it
as a challenge.</i>

29
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,267
Mm-hmm. It'll pass.

30
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,800
I promise.

31
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,867
Good, so call me
if you need me.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,568
bye.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,101
Poor thing.

34
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:34,067
Who's that?

35
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,600
A patient rosie's age.
She thinks she's a freak.

36
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:40,000
Now she's got a rash all
over her body to prove it.

37
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,301
Oh, is it that sweet girl that
I helped into the dry clothes?

38
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,201
yes.

39
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,234
Where are my keys?

40
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,733
God, do you remember when
ian used to get those rashes

41
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,434
every time he got the flu?
So scary.

42
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:54,334
It didn't help that I put the
wrong cream on him that time.

43
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,967
Do you remember?

44
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,334
The spider awaits.
Let's go.

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
So... Rosie knows.

46
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:29,633
<i>She asked if Paul and I
were fighting</i>

47
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,800
and I started off

48
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,967
into this rather
cliched speech

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,201
about, you know, "when two
people have been together

50
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:38,267
as long as your father
and I have,

51
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,767
it's not some
romantic movie

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,667
where everybody lives
happily ever after-- "

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,367
whatever. Whatever.

54
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,034
As if that's what she
thought to begin with,

55
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,700
like she's some
little girl.

56
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,101
What did she say?

57
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,134
Typical rosie-- she
cut right to the Chase

58
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,733
and she asked me if I was
sleeping with somebody.

59
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,934
<i>Why would she suspect that?</i>

60
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,201
when I was in rome,

61
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,134
she called me

62
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,534
and she heard edward
in the background.

63
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,468
<i>Of course, she doesn't
tell me this though,</i>

64
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,667
<i>so... I got defensive.</i>

65
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,900
<i>I got kinda vague</i>

66
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,334
<i>and I said, "what makes you
think that I'm seeing somebody?"</i>

67
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,034
I almost said, "why me?
Why not your father?"

68
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,334
<i>but thank God
I didn't.</i>

69
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,468
Finally she told me
that she knew.

70
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,967
What about the boys?

71
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,800
Well, I spoke to ian.
Not about Kate's--

72
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,401
<i>Kate's affair but, um.</i>

73
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:47,534
Just about the tension
in the house.

74
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,334
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

75
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,767
Well, I'm telling you now.

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,201
Why can we not talk
about this at home?

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,201
I don't
understand that.

78
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,501
- What did you say to him?
- I said we were working

79
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,867
through some disagreements.

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,301
<i>He asked me if I was
interested in anybody else,</i>

81
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,234
<i>and I said that I had</i>

82
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,733
feelings
for somebody else

83
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,034
but that nothing
had happened.

84
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,967
Well, that's great.
That's just really great.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,568
Did you think
for a minute that maybe

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,201
that was something
we could've handled together?

87
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,067
Ito go to romen to rosie.
With somebody else, dad?

88
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:29,034
<i>Fix it, dad."
That's what she said.</i>

89
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,234
Like it was all
upo me... Again.

90
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:35,334
<i>And just after that,
ian came in, so...</i>

91
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,468
I don't know, I just felt
like I wanted to come clean.

92
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,468
<i>How do you think he took that,</i>

93
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,468
you having feelings
for someone else?

94
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:45,667
<i>Well, I think
it hit him hard</i>

95
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,667
but, you know,
he toughed it out.

96
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
"it's okay, dad, it's cool."
That kind of thing.

97
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,434
<i>Well, that's no surprise.</i>

98
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:55,367
Ian's always been on Paul's
side of the argument, always.

99
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,267
<i>- that's not true.
- Yes, it is true.</i>

100
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,733
You're always
the poor, innocent lamb

101
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,667
and I'm always
the monster. It is true.

102
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,434
When in fact, you're
blameless, is that what you're

103
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,534
- trying to say?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

104
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:08,201
You know you've never
once-- once-- taken

105
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,700
responsibility
for what you did?

106
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,700
<i>You've been sitting
here for three weeks</i>

107
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,267
and you never once said,
"I'm sorry, I made a mistake."

108
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,867
Really, I've never
said that?

109
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,800
- I've heard her say that.
- When?

110
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,234
<i>I've heard her say that
a number of times-- here.</i>

111
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,767
<i>Actually, one time she said
it was a stupid mistake.</i>

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,767
- I didn't hear that.
- 'Cause you don't wanna hear it.

113
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,934
What do you mean
by that, Kate?

114
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,767
If he'd heard it, it would
force him into deciding

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,334
whether he's willing
to forgive me or not,

116
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,101
and he's obviously not
willing to forgive me

117
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,967
because he hasn't made up his
mind about this other woman yet.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
wow.

119
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:44,568
Wow. Anything else
I should know about me?

120
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:51,600
By the way, another thing
we haven't talked about--

121
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,034
You keep saying that
I haven't been around,

122
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,134
that I don't see my kids,
that I don't see,

123
00:05:56,167 --> 00:06:00,167
that I don't give,
that I only focus on myself.

124
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,501
Can we talk about what kind
of mother you've been?

125
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,367
Can we talk about that?

126
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,034
Yeah, sure. Okay.

127
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,534
<i>Let's talk about that.</i>

128
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,034
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:16,468
Impatient, nagging--
Just ask them,

130
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,034
<i>they'll tell you.</i>

131
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,967
<i>Anything they do isn't
good enough for you.</i>

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,568
Okay.

133
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,667
You should really
be quiet right now

134
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,867
'cause you're sort of
embarrassing yourself.

135
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,867
<i>Where the hell have you
been for the past year?</i>

136
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,967
past year? What about
the past decade?

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,034
You don't know a thing
about your children--

138
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,401
<i>Ian, maybe
a little bit.</i>

139
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:39,401
Max? Rosie? Jesus.

140
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>You don't know who
she's hanging out with,</i>

141
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,468
<i>what she does.
You don't have a clue.</i>

142
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,700
He still thinks that she's
this virginal little thing

143
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,501
who doesn't go off with her
friends and party or try drugs.

144
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,667
- That she's just this... Daddy's little girl.
- What drugs?

145
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,501
<i>Come on,
I'm asking you:</i>

146
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,534
what drugs?

147
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,101
Look, she goes to concerts
with her friends

148
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,767
and she smokes pot,

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,867
but, you know, I guess
because she's your daughter

150
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,568
you think she doesn't
do that sort of thing.

151
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,700
Did she tell you that?
That she smokes pot?

152
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,301
Who else can
she tell?

153
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:20,401
- She could've told me.
- Really?

154
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,434
So what did you
say to her?

155
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:31,067
I told her that, if she did it
once, that it's not a big deal.

156
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,101
That one joint is certainly
not gonna make you a junkie.

157
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,600
So basically
you said it's okay

158
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,501
if she gets high
and smokes pot.

159
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:39,267
Come on, all of
her friends smoke.

160
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,733
<i>- that's what they do.
- So?</i>

161
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,534
<i>she tried some,
she wanted to talk about it.</i>

162
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:45,034
All her friends smoke.
So you buy into that?

163
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,867
You kn what? I'm really
happy that she feels

164
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,633
that she can come to me
and talk to me about it.

165
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,700
<i>I feel really good
about that.</i>

166
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,767
So is this how she got
involved with this noah guy?

167
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,434
Noah is
rosie's boyfriend.

168
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,700
No, she's into noah
because he's a boy.

169
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,900
<i>It's got nothing to do
with drugs whatsoever.</i>

170
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,867
Are they sleeping
with each other?

171
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,201
Yes or no?

172
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,301
Rosie's on the pill.

173
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:34,401
But, I mean, you're so close to
her, you must know that, right?

174
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,267
How did you
find this out?

175
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:52,000
I took her
to the gynecologist myself

176
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:55,800
<i>- about three months ago.
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?</i>

177
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,468
because she
asked me not to.

178
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,767
so?

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,167
Well, it's between
her and me, Paul.

180
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,234
Wow, sex and drugs, nice.

181
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,800
They're not in
the same category.

182
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,301
<i>Do you know
how often she smokes?</i>

183
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,733
<i>do you know
what she smokes?</i>

184
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,367
<i>do you know what they
put in this shit now?</i>

185
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,967
is she keeping you
up to date on that?

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,800
She's not a drug addict,
so why don't you just relax?

187
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,733
<i>I'm not gonna relax
because this isn't about</i>

188
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,468
whether rosie
smokes pot or not.

189
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,434
It's about you
keeping it from me.

190
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,000
That's the issue.

191
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,034
You took her to a gynecologist
without telling me.

192
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,967
<i>- she's a child.
- She's not a child.</i>

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,167
<i>She's our child-- ours.</i>

194
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,967
Well, I guess you kind of
enjoyed keeping it from me.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,967
Gives you some kind
of control, does it?

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,301
<i>Got such a kick out
of your little conspiracy,</i>

197
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,468
you forgot to be
concerned about rosie.

198
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,867
Not everything I do
is for your benefit.

199
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,534
- Does ian smoke pot?
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

200
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,867
In college?
I certainly hope not.

201
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,301
Well, it appears I live

202
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,900
in some kind of
an alternate reality.

203
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,900
<i>If one of her teachers
kept that kind of</i>

204
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,534
<i>information from me,
it would be bad.</i>

205
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,134
But you're her mother.
It's worse.

206
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,367
It makes it
a hundred times worse.

207
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,501
Paul, let's look

208
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,534
at how you're reacting.

209
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,101
<i>Now Kate was saying</i>

210
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,334
that this is why she's
afraid to tell you things,

211
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,234
- rosie too.
- Who wouldn't be pissed off

212
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,900
if their wife
didn't tell them,

213
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,633
if their wife
didn't include them?

214
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,600
There are reasons
to be angry.

215
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,468
But can you look
beyond that for a minute?

216
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:35,267
Kate's trying to tell you
something about rosie,

217
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,234
about her relationship with
rosie. You're not heang it.

218
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:41,267
- I think I am.
- No, you're not.

219
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,134
No, the way
you're looking at it,

220
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,900
they're excluding you,

221
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,800
but Kate's talking about
their own relationship,

222
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,367
their intimacy,
their trust.

223
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:02,167
You know, last week
when you were here,

224
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,134
you had
a legitimate concern

225
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,534
about rosie when
she disappeared for a day.

226
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:09,633
We're back here
again today

227
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,900
and we're still
talking about rosie.

228
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:14,568
<i>Now a lot of these things
are important.</i>

229
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,667
<i>They absolutely
should be addressed,</i>

230
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,134
but I'm wondering
if we don't

231
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,800
keep on talking
about rosie

232
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,967
because we're avoiding the
issues that brought you here.

233
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,134
Okay.

234
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,267
Let's try imago.

235
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,667
What does that mean?

236
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,401
Come on, Gina,
you're kidding.

237
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,501
Paul, I'm trying to get
a dialogue started.

238
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:03,700
Wait. Hello,
what's imago?

239
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:07,568
<i>It's this
pop psychology</i>

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
from the '80s. The most
earnest kind of bullshit.

241
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,101
Paul.

242
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,234
It's a type
of couples therapy

243
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,134
where you reflect
each other's feelings.

244
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,434
When I used to work with
you, you used to laugh at it.

245
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:21,167
There's a lot of it
that's... Bullshit.

246
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,600
Yeah.

247
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:25,834
<i>But it can be useful</i>

248
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,967
to get a dialogue going.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,667
We can do it for a little
while and then we'll drop it.

250
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,900
So-- I don't understand.
When you say "reflect"

251
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,999
Gina, please don't
make us do this.

252
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,767
Can understand what it is
before we make that decision?

253
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,967
Okay.

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,568
What Paul said was right.
It's about reflection.

255
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,267
One person begins
and the other person...

256
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,201
Answers.

257
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,468
So Paul will say,

258
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:02,067
"I'm upset about
what you did last night."

259
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:04,834
And you respond,
"I hear that you're upset

260
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,234
about my behavior
last night."

261
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,967
<i>And Paul will confirm
or he'll correct you</i>

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>if you left
something out.</i>

263
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:14,000
We do that
for a while

264
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:17,568
and then the listening person
summarizes what they heard.

265
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,568
Those of us
who can still hear.

266
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,434
The more you bitch about
this, the more I wanna do it,

267
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,568
- so just--
- Of course.

268
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,101
How do
we start, Gina?

269
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,834
Okay, so turn so
you're facing each other.

270
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh, Gina.

271
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,700
Well, we're definitely
doing it now, so--

272
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,800
<i>Okay, face each
other. Paul, would you face--</i>

273
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,468
okay, fine fine fine.

274
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,367
We'll do an imago.

275
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:42,834
Okay, move in
a little closer.

276
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,568
Who wants
to go first?

277
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,534
Me, I will.

278
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,568
Okay.

279
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,733
Oh...

280
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:00,633
He only repeats, right?
That's it.

281
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,134
That's right,
nothing else--

282
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,134
<i>No comments,
no reactions,</i>

283
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,867
- no analysis.
- Okay.

284
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,134
Liking this already.

285
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,401
During these
sessions with Gina,

286
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:17,034
I've started
to learn a lot

287
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,334
about myself...

288
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,568
And about you.

289
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,334
<i>Paul?</i>

290
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,468
yeah, I...

291
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,501
I hear you say

292
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,034
since we've been
seeing Gina,

293
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,600
you've started
to understand

294
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:37,134
a lot about...
Yourself.

295
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:40,600
And about you.

296
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,900
And about me.

297
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,501
Yeah, in my
heart of hearts,

298
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:51,334
<i>I really did not
want to come here,</i>

299
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,501
but I realized
that I was willing

300
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,401
to do whatever it took

301
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:59,367
<i>because I cannot
get through to you at home.</i>

302
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,934
<i>And I thought,
at least</i>

303
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,034
<i>in this setting,</i>

304
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,534
you might just have
to listen to me.

305
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:08,167
So you didn'twant to come h

306
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,800
but you thought
this was a place

307
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,468
you might get me
to listen.

308
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,101
Yeah?

309
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,900
<i>Yeah.</i>

310
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:19,201
<i>But having Gina here</i>

311
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:23,134
<i>has helped me to realize
that many of my feelings...</i>

312
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,101
Are in fact
legitimate.

313
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,767
So you think that
having Gina here

314
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,834
to listen
to us squabble--

315
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,468
Paul.

316
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,167
Being here with Gina

317
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,800
<i>helps you realize</i>

318
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:47,501
that your feelings
are... Legitimate.

319
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:50,301
Yeah.

320
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,367
And I also have
begun to understand

321
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,501
that my...

322
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:02,134
Involvement
with edward

323
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:05,900
<i>was most likely</i>

324
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,700
some kind of reaction

325
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,134
to things I've been
carrying with me

326
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,234
for many many years.

327
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,101
You think that cheating
on me with edward

328
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,167
<i>was a reaction to something
from your childhood?</i>

329
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,367
no. Paul, come on.

330
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,101
Okay.

331
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:32,134
Your relationship...

332
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,834
With edward

333
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,767
was a reaction

334
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,234
to something that you've been
carrying around for years?

335
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,934
<i>Yeah?</i>

336
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,401
yeah.

337
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,000
A reaction to what,
exactly?

338
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,600
Don't ask questions.
Just listen to her.

339
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,867
Imago. Jesus Christ, Gina.
What's happened to you?

340
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,101
Okay. Okay.

341
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,600
What else?

342
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,167
I think Gina's
also right that...

343
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,434
Your thing with Laura,

344
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:10,267
<i>that's, um...</i>

345
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,434
That's a reaction to things
that you've been carrying around.

346
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,733
<i>Paul.</i>

347
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,967
<i>Can I...?</i>

348
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,067
what I'm trying
to say is that

349
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:34,167
I get that it's
not all your fault.

350
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:39,034
<i>I get that I have
done my part.</i>

351
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,367
And, you know,
I've been so busy

352
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:46,000
trying to be
always your girlfriend,

353
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,334
your wife, the mother...

354
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,633
And I've never...

355
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:01,733
That I just never
allowed myself

356
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,834
to be Kate, really.

357
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:08,633
And how can that
possibly be your fault?

358
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,134
So what you're
saying is

359
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,234
that you let yourself
get locked into a kind of--

360
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:22,034
I don't know--
Dependent, maternal role?

361
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,067
It's just how
I saw myself, really.

362
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,600
I never questioned it.

363
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,834
<i>You know,
all this caretaking</i>

364
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,334
and pleasing
other people, it's...

365
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:36,934
You know, only feeling safe
as one-half of something.

366
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:40,267
And even looking at the gas
Bill-- "Mrs. Dr. Paul Weston."

367
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,967
I guess it never
even occurred to me

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,434
that I had the strength
to do things on my own.

369
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:53,367
But Kate, you run a
shelter for battered women.

370
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:57,234
You work with codependents,
alcoholics, kids at risk.

371
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:59,867
Your work has
such a positive effect

372
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,367
on so many
people's lives.

373
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,633
But that's...

374
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>Paul?</i>

375
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,733
could you reflect?

376
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,434
Do we switch around now?

377
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:28,267
Yeah.

378
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,067
Okay.

379
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,501
I want to say

380
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:41,267
that I was listening
to you.

381
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,434
And that, um...

382
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,434
I hear you.

383
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>It hurts me
to realize</i>

384
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,301
<i>that I've been married
to you for all this time</i>

385
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:55,867
<i>and I didn't know
that you felt this way.</i>

386
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,633
I should have.

387
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,967
And I'm angry

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,967
at myself for that.

389
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:19,167
I hear you saying that you
didn't know that I felt this way.

390
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,167
Okay?

391
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,034
Yeah.

392
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,134
I'm scared.

393
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,134
I'm frightened.

394
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,867
I've had so many patients
who were in this situation,

395
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,767
it's almost like...

396
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,800
<i>It's like deja vu.</i>

397
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:51,234
<i>And where these
couples end up,</i>

398
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:54,201
with one person leaving
to find themselves...

399
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,600
I hear you saying

400
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,867
that you're afraid
that I'll leave you.

401
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,367
No, I didn't say...

402
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,301
"leave me."

403
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:15,067
Is that
what you want?

404
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,600
Gina, you said...

405
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,501
That I might've pushed...

406
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:40,134
Kate into her...
Affair

407
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,600
because of my...
Feings for Laura.

408
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,867
<i>Maybe it's
the other way around.</i>

409
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,501
My feelings
for Laura were...

410
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,367
The reaction

411
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:58,434
to what Kate's
been going through

412
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:01,534
<i>herself.</i>

413
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:05,534
<i>Well, you're both
going through something.</i>

414
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,501
She's struggling
with dynamic

415
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,633
that existed
before you met:

416
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:13,234
<i>to cater to others,</i>

417
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:16,201
<i>to please,
to adapt to others.</i>

418
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,067
And your past
informs the way, uh...

419
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:22,367
You act with Laura.

420
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,867
<i>You're looking
for that younger woman</i>

421
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,534
that you can nurture,
who looks up to you

422
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,700
the way Kate used to.

423
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:41,401
But that also makes you confront
the situation with your father,

424
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,867
<i>which is frightening.</i>

425
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,568
<i>You were 14
when he left?</i>

426
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,468
<i>- 15.
- 15.</i>

427
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,434
<i>Your mother had
a nervous breakdown.</i>

428
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:53,700
<i>You had to
take care of her.</i>

429
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,568
<i>She was giving you
nothing in return.</i>

430
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,534
Maybe you were trying
to address that

431
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:01,301
in your relationship
with Kate--

432
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:03,367
Looking for
the mothering

433
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,134
that you didn't get.

434
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,267
<i>At the same time,</i>

435
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,267
<i>you need
to protect yourself</i>

436
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,800
<i>from needing it
so much</i>

437
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:17,234
<i>because there's always
the risk of losing it.</i>

438
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,834
And so you pull away, you
bury yourself in your work.

439
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,633
<i>You want Kate there,
you always want her there</i>

440
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,800
but you want her
at arm's length.

441
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,867
<i>So, maybe...</i>

442
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,334
Now we have
some idea...

443
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:39,600
Of what's been happening
between you

444
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,600
and maybe now
we can just begin

445
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,834
to steer the ship
back on course?

446
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,468
Don't know.

447
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:53,034
<i>- mm-hmm. - I
honestly don't know.</i>

448
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,134
I just feel that...

449
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:00,800
We've been going in the
same direction for so long,

450
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:06,568
maybe the best thing would be
for me to just get off the ship.

451
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:13,967
What are you saying?

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,867
Are you saying that
you want to leave?

453
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:22,468
I'm not sure, Paul.

454
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,468
<i>Yeah, I just
want to say--</i>

455
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:36,733
and I don't mean this
in a patronizing way,

456
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,434
but it's not uncommon

457
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:44,334
for couples your age
to be at this crossroads.

458
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,600
That doesn't mean that
what you're going through

459
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:50,534
isn't complicated
and painful.

460
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,067
And, like Paul said,
it does sometimes end

461
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,900
with someone leaving.

462
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,434
<i>But no one has
left here yet.</i>

463
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,633
And, though it may
not seem so

464
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,034
right now
at this moment,

465
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,934
I don't think anybody's
quite ready to leave.

466
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,034
Okay, well,

467
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,501
give me a call,

468
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,834
and let me know
about next Friday.

469
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,101
Okay.

470
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,267
Thanks, Gina.

471
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,534
Bye, dear.

472
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,934
Hello?

473
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:03,067
Yes, this is he.

474
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:08,633
Mm-hmm.
