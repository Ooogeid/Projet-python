1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,343
<i>Previously</i> on In Treatment...

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:05,408
I left home.

3
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:07,786
You really helped me with that
in our last session.

4
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:11,174
You showed me that leaving home
was my own personal decision.

5
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:14,799
Could you be mad at me
for something else?

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,169
- Like what?
- Because I met a patient of yours.

7
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:20,425
I got the dates wrong
and I accidentally met laura.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,633
- Should I go for her?
- I can't give you dating tips, Alex.

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,621
She's the kind of woman that can...

10
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,969
Could drive a man insane.
Am I right?

11
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,477
- Bye, Melissa.
- Bye. thank you.

12
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,633
I'm early, huh?

13
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,672
Yeah, but it's okay.
It's not a problem.

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,000
I was in the area,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,844
I didn't want to go home
and have to come all the way back.

16
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:54,595
- It's okay.
- Are you sure?

17
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,717
- You don't have things to do?
- I'm sure.

18
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,268
This is from Laura.

19
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,695
I think it's a check.

20
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:05,438
Who knows?

21
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,220
Synch: Benj!

22
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,895
I'll pay you for the extra time.

23
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,739
- No need, it's okay.
- No, no.

24
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,751
I insist. It's another 20%?

25
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,301
$30, hold on.

26
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:55,595
Do you feel better now?

27
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,813
- What do you mean?
- After paying me, do you feel better?

28
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,669
What are you trying to say?

29
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,575
I guess that I'm...

30
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,388
I'm surprised by
how much effort you put into

31
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:11,603
showing your contempt
for this process and for me.

32
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:13,222
Relax, okay?

33
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,499
It's just the way my mother raised me.

34
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,538
I don't know what it's like
with you people.

35
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,203
I don't like charity,
so I like to pay for what I get.

36
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:23,424
Well, I'm glad you're getting
something here, Alex.

37
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:26,122
Listen, let's not make
a big deal out of this, okay?

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,488
You want me to admit
that this therapy is worthwhile?

39
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:29,942
Okay, I'll admit it:

40
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,439
this therapy is changing my life.

41
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:35,091
Happy?
Can we drop it now?

42
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,353
How many patients do you have?

43
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:42,676
- Why is that relevant?
- I'm just curious.

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,727
- Like today, how many patients already?
- Why are you asking me this?

45
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,062
'Cause I wanna know
what kind of money you make.

46
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,288
Let's say you have 8 patients a day,
times 5 days a week,

47
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,744
$150 a pop.

48
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:57,197
It's pretty good living there, doc.

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,815
$24 grand a month.

50
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,561
- Do you wanna buy me out, alex?
- What?

51
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:04,278
Well, $24,000 a month
and I'm all yours.

52
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,551
And you'll be my only patient.

53
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,840
It must be hard for you
to be in this position,

54
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:17,379
to be perceived as weak.

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,934
And you have this need
to regain your strength.

56
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,063
You bring me a check from laura.

57
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,154
You've asked me about
my patients and my income.

58
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:29,197
And you've done everything
you can to put me in my little place.

59
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:30,613
Did I offend you?

60
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,620
No, I'm kind of used to it.

61
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:38,483
But then all our sessions start
out like that, don't they, Alex?

62
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,447
Maybe I was expecting
something a little different today,

63
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:43,287
maybe because you were early,

64
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,493
or because...

65
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,169
you've been asking around about me.

66
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,557
Do you want me to tell you
why I was early,

67
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:53,180
or do you wanna just go on and on
with your theories?

68
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,556
I'd love to hear.

69
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,180
I went to the base today.

70
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,207
I thought I'd pop over before my session
here and say hello to my boys.

71
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,132
When I got to the gate,
I realized I forgot my id.

72
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,140
Now usually that's not a big deal.

73
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,197
But there's a new grunt at the gate...

74
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,453
Some real...

75
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:16,162
okie from Muskogee.

76
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,059
I told him,
"look, call the base commander

77
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,875
"and tell him
that lieutenant Prince is here."

78
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,176
So he goes in the booth, calls,
comes back a minute later,

79
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,616
and he says
I'm not on the approved list.

80
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:33,426
Now of course this is a real sensitive
issue these days, as you can imagine.

81
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,550
Still I said, "To hell with the list.
This is what you do: you call Dana

82
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,193
"the secretary,
tell her to talk to the commander,

83
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,150
"and you tell him
that lieutenant Alex Prince Jr.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,830
"is waiting at the gate."

85
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,788
So he goes in,
he calls, he comes back, and he says...

86
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,789
He says, "I'm sorry,
but the commander is in a meeting."

87
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,661
Now maybe he was in a meeting
and he couldn't be disturbed.

88
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,754
Or maybe they were stuffing
their faces with doughnuts.

89
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,255
Or maybe he just didn't give a fuck.
I don't know.

90
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,308
I told that guard, I said,
"Look, you tell Dana

91
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,679
"if she took the commander's cock out
of her fucking mouth once in a while,

92
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,456
"then maybe she could hear better."

93
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,213
Man, I was this close
to knocking that motherfucker out.

94
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,478
Anyway, I didn't get in so I left.

95
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,434
And that is why I got here early.

96
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:29,881
Not...

97
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:32,868
Not an easy experience.

98
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,200
No, it's bullshit.

99
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:38,094
Now I gotta come and deal with this?
I got you coming at me like this?

100
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:44,044
That was the tip of the iceberg.
My shitty week started on saturday.

101
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,379
Why? What happened on saturday?

102
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,816
Okay, we're gonna pretend here.
All right.

103
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,572
We can pretend.

104
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,502
You know what happened.

105
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,122
Do I?

106
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,795
I wish you would've warned me
about Laura last week.

107
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,398
It would have saved us both
a lot of heartache.

108
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,147
I slept with her, okay?

109
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,297
With Laura.

110
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,450
That's what happened on saturday.

111
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,914
But I'm sure you got a full
play-by-play from her already.

112
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,511
Did she or did she not
talk to you about it?

113
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,018
I'm not at liberty to discuss
my patients or their sessions.

114
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,458
Now what is that?

115
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:35,561
Code language for she did discuss it,
but you won't tell me?

116
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:46,917
It was pretty weird.

117
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:52,047
She called to ask me
if I wanted to come over for dinner.

118
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,122
No problem, right?

119
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,161
So when I got to her place,

120
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,035
I looked at her.

121
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,848
I looked at how she was dressed.
I looked at the table.

122
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,840
I looked at the wine. And...

123
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,965
I realized that dinner
was obviously just a code name for sex.

124
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:14,170
This whole thing was like a ritual.

125
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:15,860
A ritual?

126
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,701
Yeah, and all the rules.

127
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:21,272
First, of course, there's the meal.
She doesn't look like a cook, right?

128
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,842
But she made a big effort.

129
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,084
For starters,
she prepared her own sushi...

130
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:27,594
California rolls.

131
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:31,063
- They weren't that great actually.
- It didn't taste good?

132
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,311
It was just for show.
Don't you get it?

133
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,772
That's the problem nowadays,
everything's for show.

134
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,042
If you wanna make sushi,
take a fucking course.

135
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,540
Go to a real japanese grocery.

136
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,003
Don't make it with uncle Ben's rice
and imitation crabmeat.

137
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,989
- Come on.
- Did you say anything to her?

138
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,655
Of course not, no.

139
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:54,330
The dinner was just a lead up
to us getting in bed.

140
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,657
I told you that.

141
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,563
It didn't really matter.

142
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,545
So did you want to sleep with her?

143
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:04,628
Yeah, but...

144
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,775
it has nothing to do
with wanting anything.

145
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,412
It was all premeditated.
It was like a mating ritual,

146
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,708
like the masai tribe
in Tanzania, but for yuppies.

147
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:19,793
Anyway, so we got up from the table,
we went to her bedroom and had sex.

148
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,853
And that's what happened on saturday.

149
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,011
It's interesting that you tell me
so much about this

150
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,381
ritual of you going
to bed together, but...

151
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,906
nothing about
what happened between you.

152
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,007
I'm sure that you've had lousy sushi
before, but...

153
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,907
I don't think you've been
with another woman for a long time.

154
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,563
- Isn't that correct?
- But you know what happened.

155
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,928
So why do you have to hear it from me?

156
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:54,194
You're very preoccupied with
who knows what and who said what.

157
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:58,967
What's important
is how you felt about it,

158
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,963
how the experience was for you.

159
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,119
The sex?

160
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,216
The sex is all that anyone
wants to talk about.

161
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:13,053
But is it really as important
as you people make it out to be?

162
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:14,988
Well, you tell me.

163
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,542
I know that's what it says in all
your textbooks. I know that.

164
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:22,242
But I ask myself,
"Is it really the key to everything?

165
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,799
"Or is it just the simplest answer?"

166
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:29,116
but you're the one who started the story
by saying that the sex was the issue,

167
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:33,180
that all the rest was just... foreplay.

168
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,808
Okay, I'll tell you what happened.

169
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,382
Otherwise you won't feel
like you're doing your job, right?

170
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,704
But before I start,

171
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:48,221
there's something I've gotta know.

172
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:53,016
Did you ever jerk off
to anything a patient told you?

173
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,425
What?

174
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,406
Come on.

175
00:09:57,111 --> 00:10:00,407
Come on, you must hear
some crazy stories from women...

176
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:03,438
Explicit shit, fantasies.

177
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,018
Did you ever jerk off afterwards?

178
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,690
Are you concerned that I'll masturbate
to something that you tell me?

179
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,880
Me? No.

180
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,368
I'm talking about you've got women
they sit here on your couch.

181
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,415
They tell you all about fucking.

182
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,134
It must get to you sometimes.
I know it would get to me.

183
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:20,486
Do you masturbate?

184
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:23,166
There you go again, you're answering
a question with a question.

185
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,334
All right, i'll answer with an answer.

186
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:29,550
I'm a human being.
I masturbate sometimes.

187
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:33,824
My fantasies are
about many many things,

188
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,915
all sorts of women.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

189
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:42,074
That in that regard i'm not that
substantially different from you?

190
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:45,199
That's the first time you've ever
answered one of my questions.

191
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,511
In any case, you won't masturbate
to me and Laura's story.

192
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:49,892
I guarantee you that.

193
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,980
You may think of it the next time
you're having sex with your wife

194
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,697
and you're trying not to come.

195
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,018
It must have been a very...

196
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,309
complex experience for you,

197
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,733
being with...

198
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,949
Being with another woman
after all this time.

199
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:17,425
Complex, right.

200
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,447
I gave a shitty performance.

201
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,772
I made every possible mistake.
I was a mess,

202
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,824
to tell you the truth.

203
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,814
During dinner, before we had sex,

204
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,904
I started thinking about my first date
with my wife Michaela

205
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,027
about 15 years ago.

206
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,160
Jesus.

207
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:54,252
We had gone out to this bar together,
at the time she was the liberal type.

208
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,966
She'd talk openly about everything...

209
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,970
Foreplay, favorite positions,
cuddling afterwards...

210
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,016
"cosmo" type bullshit.

211
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:05,533
And among other things, she told me
that researchers found that wine

212
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:09,805
arouses women sexually
and represses men's sexual desires.

213
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,519
Have you ever heard that?

214
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,639
I don't know what made me do it,
but at one point

215
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,714
during my conversation with laura,

216
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,006
we hit one of those deadly silences.

217
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,808
I suddenly told her that

218
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,695
alcohol sexually represses men,

219
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,479
while women, it...

220
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,604
And she... of course,
she didn't respond.

221
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:36,646
She just gave me one of those looks
saying, "Why are you telling me this?"

222
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,546
- Why did you tell her?
- I don't know.

223
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,315
Maybe it was a way to...

224
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:50,105
move the conversation in a sexual
direction, make things go forward.

225
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,817
A kind of signal that
she had been cleared to attack.

226
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:01,261
Is that what you wanted?
For her to... attack?

227
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,568
Do you think that she
understood the signal?

228
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:05,900
Yeah.

229
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,904
- Is there another way of getting it?
- It might have sounded like

230
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:13,032
an apology in advance
that you didn't have any...

231
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,971
real sexual...

232
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,407
desire for her.

233
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,871
I don't think so.
She wasn't even too fazed by it.

234
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,632
She just changed the subject right away,

235
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,036
like I had said something nasty,

236
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:30,139
something inappropriate
at the table with all that sushi.

237
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,182
And that's what pissed me off.

238
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:33,939
Like all her faggy doctor friends

239
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,558
she hangs out with always say
exactly the right thing.

240
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:39,940
So listen, the first chance I got,
I looked her right in the eye and I said

241
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
"Baby, I have to go to the bathroom.

242
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,481
"I'm a bit nervous.
It's my first time

243
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,395
"since I left my wife."

244
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,138
This time she could barely
squeeze out a smile,

245
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,294
even a phony one. And from then on,
every few minutes, i'd mention my wife

246
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:57,631
and the separation...
Even in bed.

247
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,583
I did it every chance
I got just to see her squirm.

248
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,981
I think I got her
completely out of the mood.

249
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,085
She was totally turned off.

250
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,114
We had sex.

251
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,508
It was more like two animals mating.

252
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,742
I wasn't that hard
and I came pretty fast.

253
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,614
Even on the way to the shower
I threw in another

254
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:30,180
"I'm sorry, it was my first time
in so many years," just for dessert.

255
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:36,783
I don't know why I kept saying it.

256
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,794
Were you thinking about your wife?

257
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:46,556
No.

258
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,275
Or feeling guilty maybe?

259
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:50,602
No, why would i?

260
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,480
Well, because any of those reactions
would have been natural, Alex.

261
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,952
We haven't talked about your...

262
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,414
Your separation,
how you feel about it.

263
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,280
No, that's not what this is about.

264
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,175
The separation
was the right thing to do.

265
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,108
I haven't even looked back on that.
Don't you get off topic.

266
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:08,827
What is the topic?

267
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:14,355
Do our stories match, me and laura's?
That's what I want to know.

268
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:20,321
Look, on the one hand,
you describe this feeling of...

269
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,128
helplessness, weakness,

270
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,703
as if you were dragged
into sex against your will.

271
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,132
You feel that you didn't
perform too well,

272
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:33,578
so you felt...

273
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,629
Somewhat humiliated.

274
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,538
Then to gain back

275
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,346
some strength and control,

276
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,755
you make these references
to your wife...

277
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,521
in order to belittle Laura.

278
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:48,882
Belittle her?

279
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,799
You really make some
pretty far-out connections.

280
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,684
She belittled me.
Her whole attitude is...

281
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,760
- It's patronizing.
- You're sure?

282
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,336
You're the one who suddenly felt weak,
so you attacked.

283
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,651
You wanted to regain control.

284
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,699
It reminds me of the beginning
of our session when you came in here.

285
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,011
You were vulnerable from
what happened at the base.

286
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:12,019
You give me the envelope from Laura

287
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,499
and then you throw your money
on the table,

288
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:19,089
as if you wanted to humiliate me,
to make me feel small.

289
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,761
How's your machine?

290
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,609
It's good.
Thank you.

291
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,522
Are the clients happy?

292
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,517
I'm gonna make me some coffee,
by the way, if you want some.

293
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:36,902
If you've decided
to stop being a tea man.

294
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,861
Alex, can we get back to this, please?

295
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:44,114
We're onto something here
and I don't want to lose track.

296
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,297
Just give me a second here, okay?

297
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:51,560
I realize we're onto something.
I just need a break.

298
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,090
Respect that.

299
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,025
I want you to tell me something...

300
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,462
Honestly.

301
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,220
Do you really think you can help me?

302
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:54,430
If we sit here and
we talk about fucking a few times...

303
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,532
You'll be able to solve all my problems?

304
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,084
I don't have the
answer to that question.

305
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,540
Yeah, I knew you'd say that.

306
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,874
You know, that's what
kills me about you people.

307
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,798
'Cause any other professional...

308
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,625
I go to a doctor, he takes a look
and he says, "This is what you got.

309
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:19,984
"This is how long you have to live."

310
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,310
If I went to a mechanic, he'd say,

311
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,698
"$2,000, it'll be good as new."

312
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:29,116
But you people,
you don't guarantee shit.

313
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:36,391
Can I tell you a story?

314
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,207
What kind of story?

315
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:41,971
It's a jewish parable
that a friend of mine told me.

316
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,618
These two friends are condemned
to death, but the king...

317
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,770
He liked them
and he didn't want to kill them.

318
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:55,084
So instead, he tied...

319
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:58,718
a thin rope across this abyss,

320
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:03,413
and he told them both
to walk over the rope.

321
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,051
Whoever made it to the other side
would be allowed to live.

322
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,508
So the first one walked over the rope,

323
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,837
and he makes it safely
to the other side.

324
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,349
And after he made it,
his friend yells out to him,

325
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,981
"How did you do it?"

326
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,582
And the other guy answered,

327
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:27,551
"I have no idea.

328
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,321
"All I know is that...

329
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:33,687
"whenever my weight pulled me
to one side...

330
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,380
"I leaned to the other."

331
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,351
It ain't exactly <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

332
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:52,173
True.

333
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,138
So what does it mean?

334
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,067
That you have to maintain balance
in your life?

335
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:02,523
I think what it means is

336
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,868
that there are no simple ways
of jumping over an abyss,

337
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,648
or ways that work for everyone.

338
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:11,229
I think what you're looking for, alex,

339
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,854
is a million-dollar magic trick,
and I don't have that.

340
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:19,899
I truly believe there is no simple way
to jump across an abyss.

341
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,984
Instead, we have to work in

342
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,317
small internal steps.

343
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:29,417
The question is whether you want us,

344
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,205
you and i, to engage in that process.

345
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:37,243
Eyes on your instruments.

346
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,966
What do you mean?

347
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,898
It's one of the basic
principles in aviation.

348
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,823
You ever heard of vertigo?

349
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,298
Sure.

350
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:50,288
When you go into vertigo
your directional perception changes.

351
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,475
You're spatially disoriented.

352
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,640
You'd be flying at mach 2 nose
down and think you're taking off.

353
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:00,001
So that's the first thing
they teach you at pilot school.

354
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:04,384
You go into vertigo, you look
only at your aircraft's instruments.

355
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,438
Ignore your feelings completely.

356
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:10,200
Rely on your instruments.
That's what the air controller tells you

357
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,635
if he thinks you're freaking out,
and that's what you're telling me now.

358
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,627
Eyes on your instruments.

359
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,561
So you want me to...

360
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:22,090
put myself into your hands.
You wanna navigate me.

361
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,090
Rely on you.

362
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:28,306
And on one hand, you're right.
That's why I came in the first place.

363
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,722
But keeping my eyes on the instruments
is what got me here.

364
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:34,408
What do you mean?

365
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:37,458
'Cause I kept my eyes on the instrument,
I dropped that bomb

366
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,252
 so accurately into that window.

367
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,357
I relied only on my commanders.

368
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:44,484
And I killed innocent people.

369
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,463
And now I'm supposed to rely on you.

370
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,092
Alex, I don't want you to rely on me.

371
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:01,170
I want you to rely on yourself,
on your own feelings.

372
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,993
The most I can ever be to you is...

373
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,023
an air traffic controller
who tells you to try to ignore

374
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,227
the expectations of everybody else.

375
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,851
It's the expectations that give you...

376
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,038
That give you vertigo.

377
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,218
What's the first step,

378
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:29,850
- on the way to my new life?
- Well, what...

379
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:31,638
What would you like to do?

380
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,164
I think I'll go fuck her again.

381
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,357
Yeah, I'll fuck her,

382
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:46,063
well and proper this time.
I'll fuck her slow and good.

383
00:22:46,193 --> 00:22:48,174
I'll take my time up into that...

384
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:51,120
sweet, hot little pussy.

385
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,600
I mean, what's the big deal?

386
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,303
She thinks she's the belle of the ball.
Fuck that.

387
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,331
She must be pretty miserable
if she's coming to see you, right?

388
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:02,577
Don't assume that everybody
who comes to see me is miserable, alex.

389
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:05,520
Look, doc, when I came to pick her up
from here yesterday

390
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,631
she was like a complete psychopath.

391
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,336
One minute she's hugging me,
completely over the top

392
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:11,945
like we're in some kind of movie.

393
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:14,741
The next minute, I close the car door,
and she's like, "Take me home.

394
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:17,825
"I'm too tired to do anything today."
I mean, what the fuck?

395
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,928
She turned as cold as ice.

396
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:22,430
She was two totally different people.

397
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:25,626
- Go figure what goes through her head.
- Listen to what you're saying.

398
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,491
You're belittling her again.

399
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:29,730
Hey, you don't think she belittles me?

400
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,998
You don't think I know she's completely
and totally hung up on someone else?

401
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:39,382
Check this out.

402
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:42,667
Saturday, after we had sex,
she straddles my leg.

403
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,337
She starts rubbing up against me

404
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,334
as if i'm not even there.

405
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:50,544
It so obvious she's fantasizing
about somebody else.

406
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,633
And then she starts crying.

407
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:55,787
Tears and everything.

408
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:59,963
She's just crying, and I ask her,
"Laura, what's up?

409
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,412
"Everything okay?"

410
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,911
She doesn't even look at me.

411
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:08,315
She doesn't even answer me,

412
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,926
like I'm just her dildo. So...

413
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:14,656
Don't tell me I belittle her, okay?

414
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:33,759
I know this is going to sound crazy
after everything I just said...

415
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,979
But do you think we have
a chance together, me and laura?

416
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:44,260
- If we really work at it?
- I don't know, Alex.

417
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,950
I couldn't even...

418
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,403
I don't know that.

419
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:52,176
I think it could happen.

420
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,823
I mean, like you said, doc,
it's a long series of...

421
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:57,550
small steps, right?

422
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,177
Yes it is.

423
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:08,328
Well, our time is up for today.

424
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,439
Already?

425
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:16,047
Why don't we continue next week

426
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:19,538
where we left off today, okay?

427
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,309
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
