1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,968
You're gonna get a call
from one of your compatriots.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,667
<i>He's a navy doctor
named connell.</i>

3
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,200
He's gonna be
checking up on me.

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,334
Can you imagine yourself
back in an airplane

5
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,968
flying a mission
after what happened?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,801
It's what everybody wants,
my father included.

7
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:17,267
Well, you know, he and michaela,
they're united in everything.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,200
You're putting me in a very
difficult position, Alex.

9
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:21,968
You don't expect me
to lie, do you?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,601
Paul, look-- hey, cut
the crap! I need this.

11
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,868
Tell me,
what would you do?

12
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:29,434
I would stay
in therapy.

13
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:30,968
I would continue to deal

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,234
with the difficult issues
that we've been talking about,

15
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,601
not sweep them
under the carpet

16
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,234
like you've been doing
in your life.

17
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,234
They will creep up
on you again.

18
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,701
But you won't tell me
not to fly.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,367
- Hi.
- You'll want to wait till the next hymn.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,300
The service has
already started.

21
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,634
- But they said 10:00.
- For the Garrity funeral?

22
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,067
- The prince funeral.
- Oh, sorry.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,000
That's in the Gold chapel.

24
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,133
Okay. Thank you.

25
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:32,501
I'm Paul Weston.
I was a friend of Alex's.

26
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:36,033
- My condolences.
- Thank you for coming.

27
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:41,033
- I'm deeply sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,968
I'm deeply sorry.

29
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,767
Shit.

30
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,801
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
It will dry off in a minute.

31
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,167
Hi, I'm Paul.

32
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:00,001
Roy.

33
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:02,034
I was a friend
of your dad's.

34
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,567
He was really proud of you. He
used to talk about you all the time.

35
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,401
He would be mad
to know I cussed just now.

36
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,234
You know, today I think
it would be okay

37
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:20,234
to say any cuss word
you wanted.

38
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,734
Yeah.

39
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:26,567
Mm-hmm.
I'm saying them...

40
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,267
In my head,

41
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,067
without saying them
out loud,

42
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:33,533
'cause of what I feel about
what happened to your dad.

43
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,267
Do you think swearing
is better than crying?

44
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,633
Um...

45
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,267
I think
crying's okay too.

46
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,101
I don't want to.

47
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,368
That would just make
everyone more upset.

48
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,434
You know, you don't
have to be strong.

49
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,434
My dad was
always telling me

50
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,234
<i>I needed to be strong.</i>

51
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,267
oh.

52
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,434
<i>Whenever he'd go away,</i>

53
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:07,401
he'd say to me,
"take care of mom.

54
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,500
You're the man
of the house."

55
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,301
<i>Yeah, I kinda know
what he means.</i>

56
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,600
But, you know,
being the man of the house

57
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,368
also means letting other
people know how you feel inside.

58
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,967
<i>You know, whether you're
angry or sad.</i>

59
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,934
The chances are
your mom feels the same.

60
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:26,900
And maybe the two of you could
help each other feel better.

61
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:33,334
Your dad told me that you were
an incredible chess player.

62
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,234
Did you leave
the king and the rook

63
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,401
with your father
onhe casket?

64
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:42,867
There's this move called
castling. Do you know it?

65
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,734
Kind of, yes.

66
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,434
It was my dad's
favorite move.

67
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,234
- Oh.
- He swapped them sometimes.

68
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,001
You sacrifice your rook
to save your king.

69
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,800
hmm.

70
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,767
Roy.

71
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,967
- Goodbye.
- Okay. Yeah, goodbye.

72
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,667
hi.

73
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,434
Thanks for calling me.

74
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,401
Sure.

75
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,767
Well, I wanted
to reach you

76
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,700
before you read about it
or saw it on the news.

77
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,767
Are you okay?
You look--

78
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,034
Have youlept?

79
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,001
Uh, not really.

80
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,700
Sometimes I think
it's better not to, you know?

81
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,900
I keep dreaming
about this.

82
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,900
mmm.

83
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,700
I never had a patient
die before in treatment.

84
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,434
You'd think in 20 years
but... It hasn't. Ned before,

85
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,900
you should take
some time off.

86
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,301
Well, I'm definitely
gonna take the morning off.

87
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,700
I have to keep
my afternoon appointments.

88
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,500
No, you shouldn't
do that, Paul.

89
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:16,167
I know,
but I've promised, so...

90
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,567
Also, I--

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,967
I also don't just want to sit
there and not give anything back.

92
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,101
No, you need to cancel
for your sake, Paul.

93
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,267
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

94
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,600
- Was that his son?
- He seems to be doing okay.

95
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,567
I was, uh--

96
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,767
I was talking
to him earlier on.

97
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,633
What the hell do you say
to a nine-year-old kid

98
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,201
whose father is...

99
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,368
Not coming home?

100
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,500
It's hard to see so many
people in pain, you know,

101
00:09:56,533 --> 00:10:00,167
and not be able to
help them in some way.

102
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,734
Well, maybe helping is
easier than feeling the pain.

103
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,734
- True...
- Mmm.

104
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:10,301
...Dr. Laura.

105
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:15,001
You know, my mother is
buried in this cemetery.

106
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,800
- Oh, I didn't know she--
- Mmm.

107
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,034
- When did she die?
- Oh, a long time ago.

108
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:23,468
- 18 years.
- Do you visit her often?

109
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,067
Well, you see,
we named our daughter

110
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,434
after my mother--
Rosemary--

111
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:34,234
So it's my daughter's name

112
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,800
on the gravestone
in a way.

113
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:40,234
I can't bear that,
so no, I don't--

114
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,034
I don't visit often, no.

115
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,834
Actually, I agonized whether
or not I should come today.

116
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,500
- Hmm?
- I didn't want to be disrespectful.

117
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,633
Why would you be
disrespectful?

118
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,800
Well, to her, his wife.

119
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,167
I mean,
she lost her husband,

120
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,834
her children
lost their father.

121
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,834
That's something meaningful.
I mean, what am I?

122
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,134
A what,
an ex-fling?

123
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:06,800
I think it's really great
that you came today.

124
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,234
The truth is
he was a nice guy.

125
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,633
Yeah, he was funny
and sweet and beautiful.

126
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,767
I mean, if our timing
had been different

127
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,201
or if we hadn't met
through you

128
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:24,001
or if I had been an entirely
different person, maybe...

129
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,034
Well, big ifs.

130
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,633
Big ifs. Mmm.

131
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,800
Hmm. If.

132
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,101
I'm sorry, did you get
one of these?

133
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,301
- No.
- Directions to the gravesite.

134
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,967
It's a huge cemetery,
a bit of a labyrinth.

135
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,767
Oh. Okay.
Thank you.

136
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,900
- Dr. Weston?
- Yes.

137
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,767
- I'm Daniel alterio.
- Oh.

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
I called you the other day
with the news.

139
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,067
It's nice to meet you. Thank you.

140
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:11,067
I recognized your voice. I hope
I wasn't too abrupt on the phone.

141
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,667
I had a long list
of people to call

142
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,734
and I was
still reeling myself.

143
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,700
I understand.

144
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,555
Maybe you're the person
who can explain to me

145
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:22,067
why almost every person
that I gave the news to,

146
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:26,167
their first response was
"but I just saw him."

147
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,533
Well, maybe this is just...

148
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:31,434
Their mind's way
of processing the shock.

149
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,800
- I'm sorry. Daniel.
- Laura.

150
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,700
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,434
So had you
just seen him?

152
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,867
No. No, he was
staying with me,

153
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,067
but we'd both been
so busy.

154
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:48,734
I tried to get him to go to the
opera with me the other night--

155
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,134
Sean offered Alex
his ticket--

156
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:55,067
But our Alex wasn't
the opera kind of guy.

157
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,700
<i>He was afraid of opera.</i>

158
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,034
- I'm afraid of flying.
- Me too.

159
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,434
<i>- really?
- Terrified. Thank God for drugs.</i>

160
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,101
<i>Amen.</i>

161
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:06,500
Alex was always trying
to get me to fly with him.

162
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,834
Promised if he took me up,
I'd be safe.

163
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm sure that's true.

164
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,533
Yeah.

165
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,001
<i>I just never thought it
would end like this for him.</i>

166
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,567
I mean,
I knew the risks,

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,900
but I just never thought
he'd get into trouble up there.

168
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,201
<i>Then again, everything
I ever thought of Alex</i>

169
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,401
got turned on its head
sooner or later.

170
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,800
<i>But look who I'm telling--
The authority.</i>

171
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,734
It was good to meet you.

172
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,500
- You too, Daniel.
- Uh, I'm sorry. Laurie was it?

173
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:41,034
- No, Laura. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

174
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,101
- I'll see you both in about a half hour.
- Okay. Thank you.

175
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,167
Are you okay?

176
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,667
Yeah. Are you?

177
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,001
Yeah. And if you weren't,
would you say anything to me?

178
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,767
- I would.
- Cool.

179
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Excuse me.
Do I know you?

180
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:02,067
Oh, I'm-- I'm Paul Weston.
I was friend of Alex's.

181
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,234
My deepest
deepest condolences.

182
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,468
Thank you.
I don't remember--

183
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,667
You played racquetball
with him.

184
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,101
No no no no,
that was a walton.

185
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,600
Sorry, that was
somebody-- walton.

186
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:16,167
Alex, you know,
he had so many friends

187
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,134
I never met...
Until now.

188
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
It's a terrible thing,
you know,

189
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:26,267
having to pick out
a plot for your child.

190
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,867
Michaela, she, uh...

191
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,700
She left it to me.

192
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,834
Alex, he liked
to lay in the sun.

193
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,500
He would lay on the roof
like a lizard.

194
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,167
Any-- anyway, uh,

195
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,834
I picked a spot that's

196
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,767
really out in the open,
you know, right--

197
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,468
You'll see it. U'll see it
when you get there, okay?

198
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,134
I didn't get a chance to
say it to you before, sir,

199
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,934
- but you have my deepest sympathy.
- Thank yo

200
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,368
thank you very much for
coming, you and your husband.

201
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:56,101
You're a very lucky man.
You have a lovely wife.

202
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,401
Actually,
Laura and I...

203
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,700
- No no no no.
- I'm sorry, I...

204
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,034
I'm just all
out of sorts today.

205
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,834
<i>I understand.</i>

206
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,967
It's so quiet.

207
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,967
When I was
a little girl...

208
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,567
I'd make my mother
tie my shoes so tight

209
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,633
that sometimes
the laces would snap.

210
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,234
And I liked the bed sheets
pulled really taut

211
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,101
so that it was hard
to turn over.

212
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:01,001
I liked the feeling
of something holding me in.

213
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,734
I think I was afraid
that maybe I'd float away

214
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,633
and no one would notice.

215
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,667
Sorry about that before.

216
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,434
I should've introduced
you properly.

217
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,401
Oh, it's okay.

218
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:22,368
It kind of
caught me on the hop.

219
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,301
Paul, it's fine.

220
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,500
When I was growing up,

221
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,167
people always thought
my stepmother was my--

222
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,034
Was my sister.

223
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,734
She was...

224
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:40,101
26 years younger
than my father.

225
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,500
A few times, actually,
she and I were mistaken

226
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,034
for a couple.

227
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,267
And the old man
would play into it,

228
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,201
as if she and I were
a pair of newlyweds

229
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:56,667
taking the old man out
for a night on the town.

230
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
God, he loved it so much,
being with her,

231
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,600
because she was so...

232
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,834
You know,
young and beautiful.

233
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,401
So proud
of the fact that...

234
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:08,934
She was with him.

235
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,834
How did they meet?

236
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,967
He was a doctor

237
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:21,500
and-- a heart surgeon.

238
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:25,001
She was a patient

239
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,633
and did a bypass on her.

240
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,334
They started to date
and then he left my mother.

241
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,633
That was a nightmare.

242
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:39,368
Hmm. When I was
a teenager

243
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:42,067
I was always--
Always in trouble.

244
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,034
I remember once
this counselor said to me,

245
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,567
"what are you going
to be when you grow up?"

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,001
and I remember
saying to him,

247
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,267
"anything
except my father."

248
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:03,368
Myather was
a really selfish man.

249
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,734
Whatever he wanted,
he just took it.

250
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:11,567
No regard
for anybody's...

251
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,201
Feelings or...

252
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,468
hmm.

253
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:50,934
I, uh-- I think
you should go without me.

254
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,800
- What?
- No, it's--

255
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,534
I don't know.
I just don't feel up to it.

256
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,034
Everything's
caught up with me,

257
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:04,201
and watching them put him in the
ground is a little too much for me.

258
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,900
You su?
- Yeah, you go.

259
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,167
Pay your respects.

260
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,501
No one knows
who I am, anyway.

261
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,267
hey.

262
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,434
I know who you are.
