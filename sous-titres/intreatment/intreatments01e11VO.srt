2
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:06,232
You really don't understand
why I said yes to him?

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,604
It's because you said no to me.

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,549
Perhaps I'm an alternative
to everything that Andrew

5
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:15,202
represents. Dependency, anxiety.

6
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:18,105
But I am not a realistic option for you,
Laura.

7
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:19,341
Just tell me.

8
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,656
I think you owe it to me.

9
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:27,016
Do you want me?

10
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:28,355
No.

13
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,586
I'm really sorry.

14
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,788
You wouldn't believe
what just happened to me.

15
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,052
I almost didn't make it here at all.

16
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,701
God!

17
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,659
I've gotta calm down first.

18
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,071
- Can I get some water, please?
- Sure.

19
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:41,319
What, were you going to
punish me for being late?

20
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,293
Sorry.

21
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,258
I don't know how that got there.

22
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,696
It's yours?

23
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,191
Yeah.

24
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:52,962
I thoughsomeone left it here.

25
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:06,400
So what happened?

26
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,220
Why are you 25 minutes late?

27
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:10,885
Right.

28
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:14,774
Well, I took a cab here.

29
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,993
We're flying down Madison,
right, and about

30
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:19,272
200 feet away from me is this dog.

31
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,774
She, he, it tries to cross the street.

32
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:24,216
You know, it's impossible
to cross that stretch of Madison,

33
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,758
impossible.
And of course, he gets run over.

34
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,097
Well, not run over, hit.

35
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,835
The car in front of hit him,
so ran into the middle of the street.

36
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:34,050
And then another car hit him.
It was awful.

37
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,902
The cars were playing ping-pong
with him. It was like ping, ping.

38
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,657
He didn't and a chance.

39
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,988
The cab I was in almost hit him,
but the driver stopped short. But then

40
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,698
the car on the left hit him really hard.

41
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,914
I thought he was dead, but he wasn't.

42
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,621
I looked in the rear window
and I saw him limping across the street.

43
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,724
I yelled at the driver to please stop,
but he couldn't

44
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:00,814
because the traffic there would
have caused a massive pileup.

45
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,795
But I couldn't not stop, you know?
I mean,

46
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:05,332
if the dog was alive,
I had to get him to a vet.

47
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,288
I mean, didn't i?
You would've pulled over.

48
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,540
Or maybe you wouldn't have given a damn.

49
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,158
I don't think everybody
would have pulled over.

50
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,093
But you would've pulled over, Paul.

51
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,112
I'm sure you would have.

52
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,643
You wouldn't have pulled over?

53
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,203
I wouldn't have pulled over.

54
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:24,704
No?

55
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,660
I would've assumed the dog was dead

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,031
and there wasn't anything
I could really do for him.

57
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,784
Sure, I'd be sad,
just like you were, but I wouldn't

58
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,096
have pulled over.

59
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,510
I don't believe you.

60
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,925
Well, anyway, I couldn't not stop, okay?

61
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:47,007
So I yelled at the driver
to make a u-turn

62
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:49,833
so I could g to the other side of the
street, but shit, there's no u-turns.

63
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,067
And this idiot cabbie is trying

64
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:54,301
to persuade me that
woundeanimals prefer to die alone

65
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,211
just because he can't
make a fucking u-turn.

66
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,169
So I yelled at him please, can you stop?

67
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,915
I need to figure out what to do.
I need to do something." And then

68
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,822
I looked at his dashboard
and it's five to, and it's,

69
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,386
you know,
another 25 minutes to your office.

70
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,873
It was incredibly frustrating.

71
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,151
Sounds like it was.

72
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,362
Imagine, stop for a dog that
may die anyway and be very late.

73
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:15,155
But you would've been late anyway.

74
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:17,378
What?

75
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:21,078
Well, you were still very far away
and it was already five to.

76
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,636
Dog or no dog,
you've would have been 25 minutes late.

77
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,725
The fact is you're never late, Laura.

78
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,036
I would have appreciated a call.

79
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,677
Why are you like that?

80
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,113
Like what?

81
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:42,207
I don't know.
Anti.

82
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,926
Anti?

83
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,249
Anti what?

84
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,942
Anti me. I come in

85
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:51,194
feeling like shit
for what I just witnessed and

86
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,304
you're giving me a really negative vibe.

87
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,426
I don't think I'm being negative, Laura.

88
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,704
I'm just trying to understand you,
that's all.

89
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:02,894
I think it's possible that your being
late today wasn't entirely coincidental.

90
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,176
Maybe you're trying
to tell me something.

91
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:11,457
What, I paid the dog
to get run over in front of my face?

92
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:14,193
- I planted him?
- No, you were late already, Laura.

93
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,313
I don't know what you want from me,
Paul.

94
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,405
You operate on a very tight schedule.
You're a busy woman.

95
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,019
You always call if there's
gonna be a problem.

96
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,018
If there's an emergency at the hospital
or whatever, you always call me.

97
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:31,445
You are never late.

98
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,227
In fact,
very often you're early.

99
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:35,435
And so?

100
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,287
So what do you think your
being late is trying to say to me?

101
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,583
Nothing, Paul. I, nothing.

102
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:43,535
Maybe.

103
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,799
Maybe you think that.

104
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,383
That I'm not doing my job.

105
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:54,086
'cause if that's the case,
then we should talk about that.

106
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:55,726
About

107
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,218
- what?
- Laura, I know...

108
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,383
You were upset about

109
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,374
- witnessing.
- Look at you, Paul.

110
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,849
Listen to you. You're scheming.

111
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,591
I know you. You're up to something.

112
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,476
What am I up to?

113
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,803
It seems to me that the last
few sessions that we've had

114
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:26,616
- have been quite difficult for you.
- The last few months, Paul.

115
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,358
Very Very difficult.

116
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,581
And wonderful.

117
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,681
Are you angry with me?

118
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,186
Because if you are, then

119
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,314
that's something we really need
to talk about.

120
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,387
Maybe we need to talk about

121
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,525
what good this therapy is doing you or

122
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:55,954
not doing.

123
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:58,949
Maybe you've had enough of it.

124
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,213
I was late and you're kicking me
out of therapy?

125
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:11,237
Fucking hell, use the belt.
It's a more humane punishment.

126
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,266
Look, I'm not angry. I have been.

127
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,718
I even thought about
not coming here at all

128
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:21,898
just as, like, a small protest.

129
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:24,744
When I left here last week,

130
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,797
I phoned for a cab
and the line was busy.

131
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,542
I was just walking around in circles,

132
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,996
round and round.
Around the block, around the garden.

133
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,919
Then I realized I was in shock, Paul.

134
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,864
I felt like someone had punched me.

135
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:38,652
That's how you felt?

136
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:42,546
Like I'd punched you?

137
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,529
Do I need to remind you what you said
to me right here at the door

138
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,909
at the end of the last session?

139
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,340
You know, I have a feeling that if I
hadn't mentioned it, you never

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,602
would have brought it up.

141
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,639
You would have hidden
behind that idiotic rule

142
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,321
about therapists not initiating
topics of conversation.

143
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:08,716
You're supposed to let the patient lead,
right?

144
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,734
You would've taken advantage
that rule so we'd never talk

145
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:15,966
about what happened again
as if it didn't exist.

146
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,579
What would you like to talk about today?

147
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,059
You act as if you don't know me, Paul.

148
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,818
That's what pisses me off the most.

149
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:31,286
You look at me as if,
"remind me again what your name is."

150
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,220
On the contrary.
I think I'm coming from somewhere

151
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:35,729
that I think you know very well.

152
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,356
That's exactly why I'm
dwelling on this point.

153
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:39,452
What point?

154
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,417
- Your anger.
- My anger over.

155
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,332
You're trying to make me Angry.

156
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,481
You're provoking me.

157
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,032
No, I'm suggesting that
you already were Angry

158
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,595
before you came in the door.

159
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:55,739
You were so angry that you were
considering not coming here at all.

160
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:58,681
And you expressed that anger
by coming late.

161
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,962
- Fuck! I can't win here. You're.
- I'm what?

162
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,660
I was gonna tell you what conclusions

163
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:05,158
I've reached this week,
but you're not interested, are you?

164
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,686
You'd prefer to bait me,
to piss me off to prove.

165
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:10,227
But you know what the truth is?
I'm the opposite of Angry.

166
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:13,233
- Anti-Angry.
- Fuck you, Paul!

167
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,387
When you said you didn't want me,
my first instinct was to tell you,

168
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,621
"who cares? I don't want this.
I won't come."

169
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,206
But then I realized that
it's not your fault. It's my fault.

170
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:33,711
You don't owe me anything. You don't
have to love me in return.

171
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:39,006
Laura, I realize that I may have

172
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,745
slammed the door too loudly
in your face.

173
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,794
- Maybe I was a little.
- Cruel?

174
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,860
No, I don't think I was cruel.

175
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,230
I was resolved.

176
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:55,658
See, you demanded an unequivocal
answer and I gave you one.

177
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,182
I don't apologize
for giving you that answer.

178
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,746
I am sorry
that I hurt you.

179
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,254
Okay.

180
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:19,697
So a:
I accept your apology.

181
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:26,414
And b: I think your answer
last time wasn't so unequivocal.

182
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:29,401
And c: I think my excuse
for coming late was perfect.

183
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,451
The excuse may have been perfect,
but the timing wasn't coincidental.

184
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:38,906
I see why they laugh at shrinks
and all their bullshit.

185
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:42,080
"What did you really mean?
What does that mean?" It's bullshit.

186
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,207
- Annoying one.
- Wouldn't it annoy you

187
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,625
if your therapist forced you to accept
some ridiculous interpretation,

188
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,433
you couldn't defend yourself
against it ecause you're the patient?

189
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:53,015
"Everything you say
would be held against you."

190
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,713
I should've stayed with that dog.

191
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,452
I should taken the dog to the vet
instead of coming here.

192
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:00,390
Here where you're not
being adequately treated maybe?

193
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:04,516
What do you want from me?
You refuse to listen to me.

194
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,322
I don't think
you're listening to yourself.

195
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,237
Maybe you're identifying
with the dog.

196
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,525
That dog deserves more
than being co-opted

197
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,748
as some idiotic interpretation.

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,851
You want to explore
some cockamamie theory?

199
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,358
Then make up something original.
Jesus, make an effort.

200
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:24,971
You think I don't make an effort?

201
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:29,044
Do you think I don't try hard enough
in therapy? Is that what you think?

202
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:32,689
That I sit here like a parasite
who feeds off your stories

203
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,100
and your reality
and your pain?

204
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,859
Maybe I'm not helping you at all.

205
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,252
All of a sudden,
I miss Andrew.

206
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,810
For the first time I'm sitting here
facing you, and I miss him.

207
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,822
It's so strange to miss Andrew.

208
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:05,658
Andrew who loves me,

209
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,459
who admits it,
who shouts it out in public.

210
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,205
What if I did that?

211
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,476
Have you ever imagined that?

212
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,406
I've stopped fantasizing.

213
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,165
I've kicked the habit.
It's hazardous to my health.

214
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,779
I'm getting married
in a few months.

215
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,051
I need to conserve every last drop
of energy for my wedding.

216
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:41,458
You're finding it requires
energy that you don't have?

217
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,557
I thought brides were supposed to be

218
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,934
whirling dervishes
of activity.

219
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,223
Just the word "bride"
creeps me out.

220
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:02,653
I told Andrew to pick a caterer
and location without me.

221
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:07,436
What difference does it make
between the <i>Hilton</i> or the <i>Hyatt</i>?

222
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:11,420
No matter how hard you try
to be different, you end up looking

223
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,231
like everybody else,
even worse.

224
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,806
God, I wish I could
just get married in Vegas.

225
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:26,476
No caterers, no guests,
just an alcoholic justice of the peace

226
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:28,204
and a transvestite organ player.

227
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:35,837
You know what he did...
Andrew?

228
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,250
He sent an e-mail
to everyone in his address book.

229
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,598
Everyone... His insurance agent,
his mechanic.

230
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,622
We had an exterminator
over a couple of months ago,

231
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,292
even he got an e-mail.

232
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,557
He's told everybody.
I haven't even told my father.

233
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:51,971
Really?

234
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:55,353
I haven't had time.

235
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,706
I've been busy.

236
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,404
I didn't want to tell him
over the phone.

237
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,916
Andrew suggested that we both
go in there and tell him together,

238
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,922
but something happened.
We didn't get around to it.

239
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:11,171
Besides, I didn't want us both
to go in there.

240
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,829
Hand in hand
all lovey-dovey like the movies...

241
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:15,399
"Guess what, Daddy!"

242
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:20,091
So it's not exactly
that it didn't work out.

243
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,051
You've just avoided telling him.

244
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,650
He hasn't been
feeling well lately.

245
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,289
He's had all these tests done.

246
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,160
Of course, I take him.

247
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,360
He doesn't know
what questions to ask.

248
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,278
He thinks because I'm a doctor
they'll be more straight up with me.

249
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,442
To be honest, it would
be much nicer to be in the dark,

250
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:46,908
not know the truth.

251
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,802
I could be positive,
encouraging, optimistic.

252
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,004
He has an MRI today.

253
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,850
Maybe the news of you
and Andrew would come

254
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,671
as a welcome distraction
to him.

255
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,631
It'd make him happy, yeah?

256
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:10,181
That's a problem.

257
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,040
What is the problem?

258
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,696
Well, it'll give him
something to look forward to.

259
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,025
You mean if you tell him,
it'll be real?

260
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,372
Yeah, I guess so.

261
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:37,127
I don't know,
maybe.

262
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,232
I know Andrew's been so happy
these days, I feel like

263
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,629
- cheating him.
- How?

264
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,518
Just by being sad.

265
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,494
Well, not sad exactly,
but not happy either...

266
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,949
Neutral, indifferent.

267
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,347
Andrew made us
do the rounds last week,

268
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,606
see all our friends;
tell them the good news.

269
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,376
And I just feel like...

270
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,437
Did you ever see the movie
<i>King Kong</i>?

271
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,075
How they capture him
from the wild,

272
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,706
bring him back to civilization,

273
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:13,105
they put him on display
for the whole world to see?

274
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,000
But he wasn't indifferent.

275
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,874
He was angry,
if I remember.

276
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,604
Whatever. It's a freak show.
I feel like a freak show.

277
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,600
Everyone's looking at me
with these...

278
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,370
fake smiles plastered
all over their face.

279
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,676
It's like they're all waiting to see
what I do next.

280
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,725
We don't really have
that much time left.

281
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:39,145
- Come on, I just got here.
- You were half an hour late.

282
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,395
We're back, to that again,
that bullshit about me being late.

283
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:46,007
I know you don't think
it's important. I do.

284
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,841
I give up. It's pointless.
You might as well just

285
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:52,241
bind, gag me, 'cause whatever I say
or do doesn't make a difference.

286
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:53,973
That's what you'd like...

287
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,828
- Shut me up.
- Yeah, I would,

288
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,578
'cause you keep saying the same thing.
I hear you.

289
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:00,792
You wanna kick me out of therapy.
I get it.

290
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,784
I don't want to kick you out.
Absolutely not.

291
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:10,836
I do think we should allow
the possibility into the room.

292
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:14,697
The possibility of us
winding down our therapy.

293
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,749
Believe me,
you let it in.

294
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,438
How long have you been
thinking about this?

295
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,818
Have you been thinking
about getting rid of me for a long time?

296
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,802
It looks like you've been

297
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:31,105
waiting for this to happen,
hoping it would happen.

298
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:33,944
My being late today
is the perfect excuse to get rid of me.

299
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,614
First of all,
I'm not getting rid of you.

300
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,887
I'm just asking you
to consider...

301
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,425
whether this therapy
is really helping.

302
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,533
So now you're trying
to soften the blow.

303
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,107
Thank you.
Don't bother.

304
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,704
Secondly, I think
that you tossed me out...

305
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:50,623
a long time ago.

306
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,701
You don't want me
to treat you as a psychologist.

307
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,445
You want me to treat you
as somebody...

308
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:59,061
who's in love with you.

309
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,596
And in my opinion,
that is ruining any chance

310
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,278
of this therapy being
truly productive.

311
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,833
Let's face it,
I have not been your therapist

312
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,525
for a very long time.

313
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:16,538
I'm the one who says no to you.
I'm the one who humiliates you.

314
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,078
I've been humiliating you
for the last year

315
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:21,123
by not responding to you.

316
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:25,796
My honest opinion is that
it is really difficult

317
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,470
to continue therapy this way,

318
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,805
from such an emotionally
charged place.

319
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,830
Therapy should
not be a source

320
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,439
of constant humiliation
for you.

321
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:37,092
You really deserve more.

322
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:45,853
What, you're not a good
enough therapist all of a sudden?

323
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:50,088
Am I the first patient
to be in love with you?

324
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,738
You've been a therapist
for 20 years.

325
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,295
Aren't you supposed to
know what to do in these cases?

326
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,865
For Christ's sakes,
just deal with it.

327
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:07,752
Maybe you can't treat me
because you're in love with me too.

328
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,468
I can't treat you.

329
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:13,938
Because the boundaries
have been breached too often.

330
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:18,625
By telling me that you no longer want
to be my patient.

331
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:20,423
So fucking what?

332
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:29,398
Our time is up?

333
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,110
I'm afraid it is.

334
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:35,574
Couldn't you give me
extra time?

335
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:39,212
There was this little dog,
remember?

336
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:45,238
- I'm afraid I can't.
- Come on, 10 minutes.

337
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,190
I have to be somewhere else.
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,268
It's the end of the month.

339
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,685
I presume you will need...

340
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,690
A receipt.
I've done out an invoice.

341
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:11,302
I've billed you for the...

342
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,476
- You need some help?
- If you don't mind.

343
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,143
- Thanks.
- You here to see Paul?

344
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,580
You're a patient of his?

345
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:47,956
- You?
- Yeah.

346
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,969
- What's that?
- Just something I brought him.

347
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,852
What, a gift?

348
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,876
Did he solve something huge for you?

349
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:58,398
Major crisis?

350
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,889
I've just been coming to him
for a couple of weeks.

351
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:05,859
It's funny I've never run into you
before. Is this your usual time?

352
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:07,895
Every Tuesday.

353
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:10,913
It's Monday.

354
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:13,186
What?

355
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,894
It's Monday.

356
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:29,689
- It's Monday.
- It's Monday.

357
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,139
You know, I was up all night
and somehow I got...

358
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,743
Got the times...
I'm gonna come back tomorrow

359
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,413
and bring it tomorrow.

360
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,655
Too bad your good samaritan
efforts were wasted.

361
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:53,792
It's okay.

362
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,204
Do you know of a vet,
by any chance?

363
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:05,641
A vet? Really?

364
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,633
I've got a friend who's got a dog.
I can ask him if you want.

365
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:16,233
Where you headed?

366
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:21,997
Downtown.

367
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,241
You need a ride?

368
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,782
I was gonna get a cab.

369
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:31,455
Cab? How would you look in a cab
when you could be rolling with this?

370
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,919
What's your name?

371
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:39,096
Laura.

372
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,341
Alex.
Let's do it.
