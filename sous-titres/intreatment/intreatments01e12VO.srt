00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,052
<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,737
Let's just cut to the chase, okay?

3
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,582
Saturday morning,
I'm standing near the bomb site.

4
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:11,123
It was like London
after the Blitz, just rubble.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,834
And all because of what I did.

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,860
I knew this shoud have been
the drama of my life but I felt...

7
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:18,325
Nothing!

8
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:20,793
This old man came over to me.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,586
And I look in his eyes...

10
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,966
And he was sort of amused,
kind of friendly.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,491
Like my father looks at me when
he thinks I've done something wrong.

12
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:32,150
You still think it's too early
to talk about your father?

13
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:35,110
When a person decides
he's not in love with his spouse,

14
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:37,565
he shouldn't have to put off
leaving home. Isn't that so?

15
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:39,598
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

16
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:41,574
What's your name?

17
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:53,289
This is for you.

18
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:56,301
What is it?

19
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,252
An expression machine.
The Pasquini Livia.

20
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:01,646
Top of the line.

21
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,174
For me?

22
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,151
With a three-year warranty.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,846
Is this some kind of hint about
the coffee you had here last week?

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,794
No hint.

25
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,352
It's a statement.

26
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,566
Transcript: Jonathan
Sync: Benj!

27
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,290
Check this out.

28
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:45,090
Your coffee...

29
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:46,855
was horrifying.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,268
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,310
I won't tell you the truth about your
coffee and what it says about you.

32
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,454
- What does it say about me?
- I may tell you later.

33
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:59,689
- How do you like your coffee machine?
- It's, uh, really nice.

34
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,661
But I, um... I can't accept it.

35
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,127
I'm... I'm sorry.

36
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,419
What, are you a government employee?

37
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,292
hey, I got this for an amazing price
in an auction.

38
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,993
- In a what?
- An auction.

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,805
On the internet... Ebay.

40
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,758
I pick the times when the whole
country's glued to the television.

41
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,710
Prices drop 70%, 80%. Like...

42
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,178
during the super bowl.

43
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,033
Got myself a home entertainment system,

44
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:26,305
eight speakers and a receiver
for only $1,000.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,233
Would've cost $4,500 retail.

46
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,017
Anyway, thursday...

47
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,552
was the <i>American Idol</i> finale...

48
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,706
And I thought of you.

49
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,847
So I went online and grabbed this.

50
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:38,820
Could you turn that off, please?

51
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,479
What?

52
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:44,669
Just switch it off, please.

53
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,366
What are you afraid of?
What's the big deal?

54
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,662
It's a coffee machine.

55
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,511
Look, I think it's a really

56
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,421
sweet gesture, and I... I thank you.

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,390
Don't you want to upgrade
the standard of living around here?

58
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,813
And I know you only drink tea,
but what about your poor patients?

59
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,882
Um, no offense, but...

60
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,238
don't you feel there's something
aggressive in what you're doing here?

61
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,661
I mean,

62
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:15,915
you haven't even asked me

63
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:18,648
if it's something that I want,
if it's okay with me.

64
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,222
Okay, fine.

65
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,201
It's just a stupid machine. Jeez.

66
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,628
I'm just trying to understand
what you wanted to say with this.

67
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,272
Nothing.

68
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,844
What do you think? That by
me bringing this to you that I'm,

69
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,713
- what, trying to buy you?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,680
Why is it important for me
to have a coffee machine?

71
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:50,311
Maybe because the coffee
that it makes is top quality.

72
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,306
I come here once a week
for the time being

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,856
and I need coffee here
more than anywhere else

74
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,151
to open up and all that crap.

75
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,805
So I brought the machine
with me and...

76
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,024
Six different kinds of beans
from the...

77
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,521
totally bitter gourmet Guatemala...

78
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,850
To the kind that postal pilots drink...

79
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:13,850
Jungle java,
which is sickeningly sweet.

80
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,791
You know what? I've got an idea:
deduct it from what I owe you.

81
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,216
I don't think so.

82
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:23,671
Sorry.

83
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,675
Could you be mad at me
for something else altogether?

84
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:34,433
- Like what?
- Because I met a patient of yours.

85
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,332
- You met a patient of mine?
- Yesterday.

86
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,979
I got the days wrong
and I accidentally met Laura.

87
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,340
I gather it's a delicate situation
when patients meet, yeah?

88
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,818
What do you mean
"a delicate situation"?

89
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,599
Well, I don't know. I thought
you therapists had some kind of...

90
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,110
ethical code.

91
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,434
Like I tell you intimate
details about her...

92
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,708
Things she may not want
her therapist to know about her.

93
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,974
I leave, she walks in and tells you
the same kind of information about me.

94
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:09,779
Could that be considered a breach
in your ethical code?

95
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,364
I don't think
there's any ethical problems, no.

96
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,509
Of course I'm not allowed
to discuss other patients,

97
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,181
but you are free to talk about
what's happening in your life and...

98
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,106
What's happening
between you and Laura like...

99
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:23,891
Like anything else.

100
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,401
Okay, but... what's happening
between me and Laura

101
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,129
wouldn't have happened
if we weren't patients of yours.

102
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:31,240
I met her right out front here.

103
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,565
That probably wouldn't have happened
anywhere else on the planet.

104
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:39,767
So you believe there's kind of
a unique significance to...

105
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,795
the fact that you met a patient of mine?
What do you think it is?

106
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:45,955
I'm asking you.

107
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,815
I think we've started therapy, Alex.

108
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:58,630
- What?
- You brought me a coffee machine

109
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:00,982
because you intend
to come here more often

110
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,597
and you want to feel at home.

111
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,226
Through Laura, you're trying
to relate that message to me.

112
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,394
"She's your patient and I am too."

113
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,560
So we are...

114
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:15,832
officially in therapy.

115
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:21,043
About the coffee machine,
let's do this...

116
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,522
Let's just say it's here on loan.

117
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,651
As long as I keep coming here,
it's here.

118
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,153
When it's over, I'll take it with me.

119
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:32,496
Deal?

120
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,101
Okay. I guess, um...

121
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:38,479
I... I would like some...

122
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,273
Some time to think it over,
though, but it's okay.

123
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,258
Think positive.

124
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:52,946
If I remember correctly, your wife

125
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:55,284
doesn't allow you
to drink coffee at home.

126
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:57,195
- That's correct.
- Do you feel

127
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:01,026
that this is a place
where you can say and do things

128
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:03,962
that you might not be allowed
to do at home?

129
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,417
No, that issue's solved.

130
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:07,432
Thanks to you.

131
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,959
I left home.

132
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,290
You really helped me with that
in our last session,

133
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,952
Showed me that leaving home
was my own personal decision.

134
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,657
Hey, doc, I'm serious.

135
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,262
You really did help me.

136
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,799
I left here much more determined
than when I arrived...

137
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,513
to carry out this disengagement.

138
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,360
I went straight home and told Michaela
I wanted to leave home.

139
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,106
And I said it in the same way

140
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,237
I'd tell her I was going to take
the car to the garage.

141
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:41,710
And is that what you really felt,

142
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,185
that it was

143
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,411
so trivial?

144
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:48,040
Yeah, that's what I felt. Absolutely.

145
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,701
And here's how it happened.

146
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:52,953
Michaela was making salmon...
It's always salmon on tuesdays...

147
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:56,154
And I told her I wanted to leave home.

148
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:01,530
Let me tell you, she didn't even turn
her head away from the stove.

149
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,191
She just said that...

150
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,200
"I could've guessed this would happen.

151
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:14,402
"And you never surprise me, Alex.
Not even now."

152
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,942
How did you feel about that?

153
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,280
Were you...

154
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,815
Were you... hurt by that?

155
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:25,270
She wasn't trying to hurt me.

156
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,397
It's just the way she is and...

157
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,262
I may have done her wrong last week,
the way I presented her.

158
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,709
But you've gotta understand,
she's a superintelligent woman.

159
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,691
When she was 22, she was already
working on her PHD at Georgetown,

160
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:45,353
so if she says she was expecting it,
then I've gotta believe...

161
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,790
she saw me going through something

162
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,284
since the bombing
and the heart attack

163
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,306
and the suspension from the force.

164
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,509
She saw much more than
I was willing to show.

165
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:00,375
And realized
that it could result in us separating.

166
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,259
You know what's interesting
is that you're talking today

167
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,969
about your wife like...

168
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:09,385
You know, she was some mythical

169
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:11,954
superwoman that's able to anticipate

170
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,839
everything 10 steps in advance.

171
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,177
As far as intelligence goes, absolutely.

172
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:20,092
Really, no matter what else you say
about her, she's got the brains

173
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,942
of a rocket scientist
on the Manhattan project.

174
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,261
Still, wasn't there something

175
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,998
in her reaction that disappointed you?

176
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,042
I mean, you come home,
you drop this bombshell and...

177
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,268
she's indifferent to you.

178
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,075
Yeah, but that isn't the case here.

179
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,689
We're not one of those couples
that creates drama all the time.

180
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,980
On the contrary,
we could've dragged this on for years

181
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,234
just for the sake of the kids,
as they say.

182
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,251
- Have you told the kids yet?
- No, not yet.

183
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:54,118
Now Roy, my eldest, he's been
locked up in his room for days

184
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,831
doing some kind of chess
championship on the internet.

185
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:59,724
And Noelle, my daughter,
she's on some kind of school trip.

186
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,127
But you will have to tell them
at some time.

187
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,329
Of course.

188
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,842
Someday they'll have to accept
the fact that their father

189
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,340
left home to look for a new life.

190
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:14,125
They can't understand that at their age.

191
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:16,219
How do you think
they'll feel about that?

192
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,939
Roy will understand me.

193
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,363
For sure.

194
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,855
He's a very special boy.
he has...

195
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,334
inner truth.

196
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,088
You know...

197
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:37,834
Roy's 11 years old.

198
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,609
And he hardly ever leaves the house.

199
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,827
He just sits at home
and he sits by the computer

200
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,747
and plays chess and...

201
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,842
I mean, he just...
No girlfriends,

202
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,179
no buddies, no basketball.

203
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,853
And at first it drove me crazy,
'cause he just seemed so miserable,

204
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,350
so lonely,

205
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,144
unpopular.

206
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,046
I tried everything. I...

207
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,924
I organized tours at the air force
museum for all the kids.

208
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,918
They could come and sit
in the cockpit of a real F-16,

209
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,995
play with the simulators and...

210
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,252
It was no use. I mean, those tours,
he'd walk around all alone.

211
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,322
The only one near him was like some...

212
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:24,084
I don't know, some ugly leper kid
all the kids were afraid to get next to.

213
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,468
It's kind of hard to see that, isn't it?

214
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,041
Sometimes it's harder for us
as parents to see our kid lonely

215
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,722
than it is for the kid himself.

216
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,967
It took me a long time to realize that.

217
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:53,236
Then I realized that...

218
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,752
he was happy.

219
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,536
That I had the problem.

220
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,039
That I...

221
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,010
I couldn't accept the fact
that he wasn't popular.

222
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,506
That he's an outsider, and that's okay.
It's just his personality.

223
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,658
I used to give him and michaela
such a hard time.

224
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,822
I'd call the counselor,
I'd call the teachers,

225
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,944
and everybody said,
"There's no problem.

226
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:16,308
"The boy feels good about himself.

227
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,921
"It's just the way it is."

228
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,321
Was it hard for you to accept?

229
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:24,283
Yeah, but, you know, today...

230
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:26,804
I'm jealous of him,

231
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,482
Cause he doesn't need anybody.
He's got his own world.

232
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,904
He's got his movies and books
and computer games

233
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:35,333
and chess. And the kid was born
without a competitive bone in his body.

234
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,349
Even the chess stuff,
it's not about winning.

235
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:41,209
He doesn't care if he wins.
He just likes the thinking it requires.

236
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,121
A few years ago I tried to organize
this ping-pong tournament

237
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,656
for his... for his class
in the backyard.

238
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:49,759
He turns to me and he says, "Dad,
don't you feel sorry for these kids?

239
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,360
"Only one will win,
and it's probably Robert.

240
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:55,553
"And the rest will look pathetic
in front of the girls.

241
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,915
"Don't you feel sorry for them?"

242
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,234
I swear, I don't know
where he got those genes.

243
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,065
Certainly not from me.

244
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:11,209
You think he's too good
to be connected to your genes?

245
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:14,376
- Are you making fun of me?
- I want you to listen

246
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,573
to what you're saying about yourself.

247
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:20,343
This boy is your own flesh and blood.
You... you love him.

248
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,038
Dearly.

249
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,374
You're very proud
of his beautiful qualities

250
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:27,393
and yet you think,

251
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,193
"Well, he's the exact opposite of me.

252
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,727
"He couldn't possibly
be connected to me."

253
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,876
Please,
let's not get into that again. No.

254
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:40,905
This is completely a genetic issue.
Look, he got

255
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,299
the female genes
from Michaela and my mother.

256
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,111
My mother, she was the same way.

257
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,351
There was selflessness in everything
she did, just like Michaela.

258
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,285
She never felt like she was missing out
on something somewhere else.

259
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:55,498
She didn't care if she was fulfilling
herself and all that shit.

260
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:56,799
There was...

261
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,391
There was something pure about her,

262
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:02,773
wholesome... like Roy.
No, he got that from her.

263
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,359
So the women in your family are...

264
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:10,642
they're pure and wholesome,
unblemished.

265
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,461
And that the men are somehow

266
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:16,061
the opposite... dirty,

267
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,639
in conflict with themselves.

268
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,773
That's not a bad description
of my father...

269
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:29,351
Dirty as hell.

270
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,475
He kept falling in love
with different women at the office.

271
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,376
He was having affairs
like some kind of dirty dog, yes.

272
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,677
And the guy had it made.
He had a woman at home who loved him,

273
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,227
let him have his career,

274
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,713
no questions asked.
She took care of the kids

275
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,892
and made sure that
the entity called "family" existed.

276
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:53,204
What you've got to understand about
my dad, he lived this whole life on this

277
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,513
civil-rights-pioneer ticket.

278
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:59,386
You know, a guy who survived
the Klan and marched with King.

279
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:01,201
Who could say anything to him?

280
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,425
He suffered for us all.

281
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:07,799
And you mother wasn't...

282
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,654
part of that movement?

283
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:13,314
I like him. I like my dad.
She was from back east,

284
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:17,398
from Delaware. Well-bred.
She was the hope of the family.

285
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,186
A pianist.

286
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,497
She studied at the Music Academy.

287
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,702
She was considered a virtuoso.
She could play Liszt in her sleep.

288
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,017
You know Liszt?

289
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,786
Only Liszt could play Liszt.

290
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,101
Yeah, she was really something.
She was, um...

291
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:41,962
Rare.

292
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,175
You never sensed any bitterness

293
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:49,992
in her that the whole music thing...

294
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:52,480
never materialized.

295
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,156
You still miss her?

296
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:00,661
Of course.

297
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,711
She saved his life.

298
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,909
By that I mean at...

299
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,312
At the march on Washington...
In '63.

300
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:16,267
Right before King's big speech,
Mahalia Mackson sang that song

301
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,606
<i>I been 'buked and I been scorned</i>.

302
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:22,071
And they caught eyes

303
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:23,793
in the crowd, and...

304
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,011
They both had tears
flowing down their faces.

305
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,641
And they felt connected.

306
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:34,178
My father was this lonely angry man,

307
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,803
and she...

308
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:38,430
Well, she melted him.

309
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,370
She was the only person
he ever trusted.

310
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,817
He was at war
with the rest of the world.

311
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,488
And the war ain't over, believe me.

312
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:58,124
And still he...

313
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,420
He cheated on her.

314
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:01,960
Constantly.

315
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,929
The guy just wanted more and more.

316
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:05,188
All the time.

317
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,263
But he didn't leave her?

318
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,693
No, what are you crazy?
Why would he leave her? He loved her.

319
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,479
You're sure about that?

320
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:15,174
Are you sure that...

321
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,802
it wasn't just that he held her
in very high esteem and that...

322
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,358
he was really grateful

323
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,167
for everything that she'd done for him
throughout his life?

324
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,481
Are you trying to justify him?
He could've left her.

325
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:28,308
Why make her life miserable?

326
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:32,113
And you, unlike him,

327
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:34,335
you're trying to do the right thing?

328
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,625
You're leaving home just like that.

329
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:41,275
You're not dragging out
things like he did.

330
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,127
Okay. All right, all right.

331
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,437
I see you believe
in the whole theory that

332
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,357
children try to rectify
what their parents did wrong.

333
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,038
All right. Okay.

334
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:55,110
I don't know
that it's about rectification.

335
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,936
I think it's more
what we call a pattern.

336
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,150
We unconsciously repeat patterns that...

337
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,849
we have witnessed in childhood.

338
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,243
But you said I was trying
to rectify what my father did.

339
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:12,177
I think you're presenting it that way,
but on a deeper level...

340
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,640
I think there may be more similarity

341
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,439
between you and your father's
view of marriage.

342
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,086
I don't know what you mean.

343
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:22,752
Really?

344
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,142
You can't see any way in which

345
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:28,382
you and your father may have married
the same kind of woman?

346
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,011
It seems to me
that you both married women

347
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:33,651
whom you admire, but...

348
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,595
But you don't necessarily love.

349
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,138
That's some bullshit.
You actually buy this shit?

350
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,411
That I'm repeating my father's mistakes?

351
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,420
Let me tell you something:

352
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,580
what's going on in my marriage
has got nothing to do with my father,

353
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,237
so stop comparing us.

354
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:58,926
Perhaps you might not
have loved Michaela because

355
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:02,419
you admired her so much
for being so perfect.

356
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,116
Wait. Why are we still
talking about Michaela?

357
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:06,876
That story is over.

358
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:11,172
Because I'm not sure that your
leaving her is really the solution

359
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,162
to how you feel about yourself.

360
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:31,891
I wanna go back to Laura for a minute.

361
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,497
Why is it so important
to go back to Laura?

362
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,710
Is it because
she's my patient and you think

363
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,639
it might bother me that you met?

364
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,823
I don't get this.

365
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:44,573
Why can't I talk about her?

366
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,791
What is the big deal about meeting her?

367
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,542
You won't believe how much this cost.

368
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:00,017
$450. I mean...

369
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:02,664
That's crazy, right?

370
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,352
Too bad they don't sell property
on the online auctions.

371
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,418
I mean,
now that Michaela has the house,

372
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,432
during the Indy 500 or something,
I could go on

373
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,615
get a place in the same neighborhood
for almost half a million bucks.

374
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:17,296
You got the deal of your life here, doc.

375
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,812
Someone who doesn't know
about the whole tv factor

376
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:23,593
would've paid $1,500 for it, minimum.
so if I'm here for a year,

377
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,685
then that means
you're renting it for... $8 a week.

378
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,921
Could we get back
to our therapy session, Alex?

379
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,156
Okay. Well, Laura couldn't get over it.

380
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:41,101
I showed her the machine and she just...

381
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,594
she couldn't believe it.

382
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:48,199
Would you like to...

383
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:52,253
Would you like to tell me
how you two met?

384
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,626
Sure.

385
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,107
I lost track of time.

386
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,535
I moved in with my gay friend Daniel

387
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:01,183
and his little boyfriend.
I told you about them.

388
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,868
And they are real happy I left home.

389
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,879
They bring their friends over to meet me
and they've turned me

390
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,916
into the talk of the gay community.

391
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:12,865
So I've been going along with it.
you know, I go to dinners, drinks.

392
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,818
I even went to this gay club
with them on sunday.

393
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,110
They told me
there'd be some hot ladies there,

394
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,782
somebody I could pick up
that aren't even lesbians.

395
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,289
And it didn't do anything for me.

396
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,870
What it did was make me
lose track of time.

397
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,433
I was up all night long,

398
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,672
so I could've sworn
yesterday was tuesday,

399
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,696
so I came here. but when
I got here I saw Laura leaving.

400
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,002
I walked up to her and I asked her
if everything was okay.

401
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,938
She said everything wasn't okay,

402
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:42,624
that she ran over a dog, or almost
ran over this dog yesterday morning.

403
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:45,626
The way she described it,
it sounded like this...

404
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,846
the airedale terrier pedigree.

405
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,338
The airedale terrier
is the only dog in history

406
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:53,718
to be knighted by the king of England
for bravery in battle.

407
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:56,355
- Did you know that?
- I didn't know that, no.

408
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,609
Yeah well, it did.
It's an amazing story.

409
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,131
I mean, this dog...

410
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,357
Okay, well, maybe next time.

411
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,860
I asked her
if she had been leaving a session

412
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,555
with you.

413
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:17,503
And she was a bit taken aback like
I had caught her in something shameful.

414
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:21,657
Hell, I thought only Navy pilots felt
that way about seeing a shrink.

415
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,846
Anyway, I admitted to her
that I was seeing you also.

416
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:33,061
And I realized that
I was here a day early.

417
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,738
She thought that was just hilarious.

418
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,984
That someone
could get the days mixed up.

419
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,124
And she's got this...

420
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,039
I don't know,
she's got this way of looking at you.

421
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:47,355
It's like this girl, she's got...
There's something fierce about her.

422
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,765
Right?

423
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:50,385
What do you mean?

424
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:53,036
I don't know.
She's got this look. It's like...

425
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:56,572
It's like she's used
to getting her own way.

426
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,621
And you know what she said?

427
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:00,292
She said that you

428
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,766
could ruin even a cup of Lipton tea.

429
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:06,738
I mean, come on.

430
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,165
So I guess you're both in the same...
In the same boat, so to speak.

431
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,498
Totally.

432
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,232
Anyway, so we got in my car and we...

433
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:21,198
drove to the accident site.
naturally, there wasn't any dog there,

434
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,607
so we grabbed a cup of coffee and I...

435
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,650
sketched the area on a napkin.

436
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,071
At her place?

437
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:30,572
No, why would you say that?
No, some cafe.

438
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:34,107
So I drew her an overhead
view of the area.

439
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:37,416
I'm a genius at that, you know,
the yards and the green areas...

440
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,712
anywhere where a dog
might make himself disappear.

441
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:42,566
Sounds like a real military operation.

442
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,796
To be honest, I kind of miss that,

443
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,529
just being up in the air,

444
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,716
reducing the area on a map,

445
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,538
looking for a man intelligence
has been after for 3 months.

446
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,529
So did you find the dog?

447
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,341
No, it probably went and died
somewhere.

448
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,635
But you could say
it still had a happy ending.

449
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:16,931
Hey, is...
Is our time almost up?

450
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,118
No, we have about...
We have about five minutes.

451
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:27,756
Oh, sorry.
I thought this thing was off.

452
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,096
Speak of the devil.

453
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,820
I'm supposed to meet Laura.
Do you mind if I take this?

454
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:36,352
Sure, go ahead.

455
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,414
Yeah, hey. What's up?

456
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,465
No, not yet, but...

457
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:48,108
But judging from paul's face, he'll kick
me out of here in a minute or 2.

458
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,272
I know. Right.

459
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:56,575
Yeah, all right. Bye.

460
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,817
So what do you think?

461
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,422
Should I go for her? Laura?

462
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,318
Oh, co... Paul.

463
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:11,657
Come on, you can tell me.
I know it's not ethical, but...

464
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,495
you're my shrink too.

465
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,561
She's the first woman
I've been out with in 15 years.

466
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,073
I don't want to have a lousy experience.

467
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:22,898
I'm sorry, I can't give you
that kind of advice, Alex.

468
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,420
But she's...
she's the kind of woman that,

469
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,230
you know, could drive a man insane.
am I right?

470
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:33,058
Paul. just man to man.
Give me a little tip.

471
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:36,066
- I can't do that.
- This could affect my whole life.

472
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,781
I can't give you dating tips, Alex.

473
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,857
Sorry.

474
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,251
Just stop it.

475
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,522
That's all right, 'cause I'm not used
to you giving me advice anyway.

476
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,007
But, you know,
you always help out in the end.

477
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:05,594
In your crazy roundabout kind of way.

478
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,249
And when she's here for her session,

479
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,943
try to pull the espresso handle fast...

480
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,400
'Cause she likes it with a lot of foam.
