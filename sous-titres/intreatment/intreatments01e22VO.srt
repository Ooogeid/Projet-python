00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,346
<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:10,548
I slept with her, okay?

3
00:00:10,716 --> 00:00:13,772
But I'm sure you got a full
play-by-play from her already.

4
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,382
After we had sex, she straddles my leg.

5
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,873
She starts rubbing up against me.

6
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:22,342
It's so obvious she's completely
and totally hung up on someone else.

7
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,474
Ever heard of vertigo?

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,678
When you go into vertigo, you look
only at your aircraft's instruments.

9
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:31,321
But keeping my eyes on my instruments
is what got me here.

10
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:35,522
Because I kept my eyes on my instruments
I dropped that bomb so accurately,

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,175
I killed innocent people.

12
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,945
What's the first step
on the way to my new life?

13
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,539
What would you like to do?

14
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:43,743
I think I'll go fuck her again.

15
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,633
Yeah.

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,389

23

No no, you're fine.
Come on in.

24
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,685
Finish what you're doing.
I'll make coffee.

25
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:13,858
No, it's okay.

26
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,849
You're fine.

27
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:22,359
<i>The rain in Spain
falls mainly on the plain.</i>

28
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,166
That's bullshit, you know.

29
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:27,620
I've been to Spain,
and the rain in the Pyrenees is a bitch.

30
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:33,101
Sync: Benj!

31
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,571
So I'll open with the punchline, doc:

32
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,467
I broke up with Laura.

33
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:53,603
I was actually a pretty great fuck
the second time.

34
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:55,688
I drank about a half bottle of Stoli,

35
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:57,331
just to relax.

36
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,174
I also took a pill
that Daniel gave me, you know,

37
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:01,787
one of those.

38
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,822
I had a hard-on
for a day and a half, Paul.

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,624
You should try it sometime.

40
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,446
It's a little strange, though.

41
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:13,055
It's like a woody
that actually feels like wood

42
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,599
'cause it's just sitting up there
and minding his own business

43
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,466
like it's got nothing to do with you.

44
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,542
Works like a charm, though.

45
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,968
Anyway, I made up for the last time.

46
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:23,921
We were fucking.

47
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,847
All night long, in the morning too.

48
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:30,884
In the end I realized that
she was just using me.

49
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,808
She really wasn't with me.
She was just

50
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:36,465
using me for an excuse,
you know?

51
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,782
Yeah, at any rate, it's over.

52
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,202
It's really not gonna go
anywhere from here.

53
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,836
Excuse me, when you say
"from here," forgive me,

54
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,240
- but do you mean from this office?
- What?

55
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,217
Are you trying to say
that your relationship with Laura

56
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:57,089
has something to do
with what goes on in this office?

57
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,396
Have you completely lost your mind?
What are you grasping at now, a word?

58
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,671
No, it's just that you're always trying
to make this bizarre connection

59
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,343
between you, me and Laura.

60
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:09,671
Is it me? 'Cause you're the one
always making a big deal out of it.

61
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:23,061
Tell me something didn't happen
between you and her.

62
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:24,540
What?

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,962
You're asking me to tell you
what didn't happen?

64
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,773
Yeah, I'm asking. Did something
happen between you two or not?

65
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,866
You mean apart from therapy?

66
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,590
Jesus, look at you dance.
It's a simple question.

67
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:40,108
Your million-dollar technique,

68
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,448
answering a question with a question.
Well, it ain't gonna fly this time.

69
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,175
I'll tell you why I'm asking.

70
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,101
Every time we were together,
half the time she talked about you.

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,769
She kept asking what I knew about you
and your family.

72
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:54,541
She was pretty obsessive about it.

73
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,796
And I then I remembered
how jumpy you get

74
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:59,592
every time I mention her name.
So I thought maybe

75
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,259
something went on between you.
Maybe you,

76
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,779
a married man...

77
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,809
How should I put it?

78
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:09,203
- You fooled around with her.
- What are you suggesting, Alex?

79
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,611
Can you just say that nothing
happened between you?

80
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:13,830
- Why is that so difficult?
- We've talked about this.

81
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,333
I will only discuss your relationship
with Laura,

82
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:18,576
Nothing else.

83
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,717
Sweet. So you discuss mine,
but not yours.

84
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,108
The point I'm trying to make
is that my

85
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:25,962
other patients have nothing to do
with your therapy.

86
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,406
Excuse me. You having sex

87
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:30,047
with somebody I'm dating
sounds very relevant to my therapy.

88
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,652
- She said she was having sex with me?
- Didn't have to.

89
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,959
- You're convinced that she did.
- I'm just asking.

90
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,860
The only relevant thing
is how you feel about the possibility

91
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,694
of laura having sex
with somebody other than yourself.

92
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:42,985
Don't start with your asinine shit.
You're copping out.

93
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,577
Would you stop trying to force me
into this relationship you've concocted?

94
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,552
- Why in the hell would I do that?
- Maybe you want to compete with me.

95
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:52,171
Maybe it's like the coffee,
the check, your intelligence.

96
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:55,363
If I'm not mistaken, I'm paying to talk.
This is what I want to talk about...

97
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:58,612
You and laura, and I'd like
a straight answer for a change.

98
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,377
Have you noticed when an emotional issue
comes up for you, you focus on money?

99
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:05,075
I have a different theory, though,
'cause every time we touch

100
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,706
on something that has to do with you,
you get scared shitless.

101
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,013
Why would I be scared
about talking about myself?

102
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,556
Because you want your patients
to think you're superhuman,

103
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:14,938
you're a buddha.

104
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,080
You don't eat,
you don't shit, you don't piss.

105
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,900
You don't argue with your wife.
You don't fantasize about your patients.

106
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,813
No, you're above
all of these earthly things,

107
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:26,132
because you live only for your patients.

108
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:29,976
Your private life doesn't matter,
only this inner sanctum.

109
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,549
Why are you giving me that look?

110
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,422
What look?
It's the way I look.

111
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:40,623
No, that look like you know everything,

112
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:43,158
like you can see right through me.

113
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,508
Maybe like the old man in Baghdad?

114
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:47,640
Oh, fuck.

115
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,135
Now you'll say you want
to talk about my father, right?

116
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,872
Okay, would you like
to talk about your father?

117
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,179
You people love this shit.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,188
This is right in your wheelhouse.
You wanna talk about my father?

119
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,890
Go ahead, fire away.

120
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,432
Ask me whatever you want.

121
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,989
But he is an amazing man, my dad.

122
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:10,310
He really is.

123
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,423
But that's not what you told me
last week.

124
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:14,764
He's a good man, okay?

125
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,900
There's nothing you or 200 shrinks
can change.

126
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:22,030
Let's put aside for the moment whether
he's a good man or a bad man, okay?

127
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:26,615
What interests me
is how you feel about him

128
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:29,404
and what your relationship
with him is like.

129
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:35,545
When I say he's an amazing man,
i'm talking about facts, not feelings.

130
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,151
Would you say that to...

131
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,024
a girl who was raped by her father
in third grade?

132
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,193
"You're not interested in good or bad,

133
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,762
"You're only interested in
how she feels about the relationship?"

134
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,995
When did good or bad go out of style?

135
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:53,690
That reference to the girl
being raped by her father,

136
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,503
where does that come from?

137
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:05,762
Can we go back to last week?

138
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,336
If I rember correctly, you described
your father as being

139
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,914
an unfaithful man.

140
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,116
You said that he was ungrateful.

141
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,464
He treated your mother really terribly,

142
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:19,232
but that at the same time you...

143
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,348
had a great admiration for him.
That's correct, yes?

144
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,646
It seems to me that
your feelings about your father,

145
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:28,188
alex, are pretty conflicted.

146
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:32,679
- You don't get what I said at all.
- Well, maybe you could...

147
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:37,113
- explain it to me a little bit more.
- Fuck that, it's no use.

148
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,814
You're gonna hear what you wanna hear.

149
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,056
Do you and your dad talk a lot?

150
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:51,417
Yeah, we talk, as much as is necessary.

151
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,558
What does that mean,
"as much as is necessary?"

152
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,377
- I don't understand that question.
- Well, who calls who?

153
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:59,326
We talk as much as possible.
He's not a chatterbox.

154
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,820
He's precise, you know?
He's to the point, boom.

155
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,113
He cuts straight to the heart of things.

156
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,884
He's like iron, my dad, cast iron.

157
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:11,488
Iron in everything he does,
his movement, everything...

158
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,178
The way he works,
the way he thinks, his wisdom.

159
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:17,791
I don't think
there's a book he hasn't read.

160
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm talking real literature, doc...

161
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,768
History, political science...

162
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,293
Everything.
The man is 70 years old

163
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,260
and he works
like he did 30 years ago.

164
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:32,175
He's as healthy as a horse.
He can still beat me in arm wrestling.

165
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,751
He's iron.

166
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:39,983
You know, when I think of iron,
I tend to think of something that's...

167
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:43,410
really indestructible, that's...

168
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,886
incredibly powerful, strong.

169
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,412
And yet at the same time
something that's kind of cold.

170
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:59,324
How do you feel about what I did,

171
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,878
killing people,
dropping the bomb on themadrassa?

172
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:08,022
- Why are you going back to that?
- Simple question, doc.

173
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:12,272
It's about your main thing... Feelings.
How do you feel...

174
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,338
about what I did
when I dropped a bomb on 16 kids?

175
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,985
- I'm not here to judge you.
- I'm not asking for a judgment.

176
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,956
I wanna know, how do you feel?

177
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,002
How do I feel?

178
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,803
Well, I think it must be
very difficult for you

179
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,097
to live with what happened.

180
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:33,909
What?

181
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,184
You have made an art

182
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:41,625
and a science and a career
out of taking the easy position.

183
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,599
Do you really think
not judging you is easy, Alex?

184
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,422
Let me tell you something: It's not.

185
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,768
Why can't you just say
you think I'm a murderer?

186
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,054
Because I know that's what you think.

187
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,326
I know that's what you talk about

188
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,470
when you're out with your friends
at some fancy restaurant.

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,590
You sit around the table, and you say,
"It's terrible. It's awful.

190
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,180
"It's a massacre.

191
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,724
"What it does to them,
it's just atrocious.

192
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,966
"What it does to us..."
Let me tell you something:

193
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,223
I come here

194
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,928
and I put my trust in you.

195
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,275
Why can't you be honest enough

196
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,683
to just tell me how you feel?

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,793
You know what my father said
when I told him about the mission?

198
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:31,375
What?

199
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,209
That's what he said.

200
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,587
You know what? That was the smartest
reaction I got from anybody,

201
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,349
including you
and all the other bleeding hearts.

202
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,969
'Cause there's nothing to say.
What are you gonna say?

203
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,051
Some things can't be explained away.

204
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,716
Sometimes you can't peel away
something and find...

205
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,335
It's just as plain as can be.
16 kids buried, 

206
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,628
dead under a building.
That's it.

207
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:04,085
My father had it right, the old man.
You gotta be like that.

208
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,817
You gotta be like iron, baby.

209
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,380
It must be difficult for you
to have lived in the shadow 

210
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,778
of somebody who thinks like that,
that you've got to be...

211
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:15,290
- To be like iron all the time.
- You see how you twist things around?

212
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,217
Am I ever gonna get out of this alive?
If I said he was a pussy,

213
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:21,926
you'd have a comment about that.
If I said he was a hero,

214
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,059
you'd have a comment about that.

215
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:25,656
You love to sit here.

216
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,290
You listen to people's problems
so you can probably sit on your porch

217
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,880
at the end of the day
and just tell yourself...

218
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,275
"My life is so great."

219
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:36,593
Can we stay focused on what the issue
is we're trying to deal with here?

220
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,983
The difficulty that you must have had

221
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,480
living in the shadow of your father,

222
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,972
in a world where you're not allowed
to express...

223
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,084
who you are.

224
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,049
your tender side,
maybe your feminine side, for example.

225
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:54,908
So what do you do?

226
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,668
The only thing you can do is defy him.

227
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:00,133
You have to fight
with everything you have.

228
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,208
But you know something, alex?

229
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,296
You haven't done that.

230
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,841
You haven't dared to do that.

231
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:11,033
Your father is such
a powerful, imposing character

232
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,928
that you're terrified he'll crush you.

233
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:16,040
So you come through this door
with all your rage,

234
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,075
your resentment, your jealousy,

235
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,820
your buried anger toward him.

236
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:23,173
You bring it in here
and you let it loose on me.

237
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,116
That's what you do, but that's okay.

238
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,368
That's fine.
That's why I'm here.

239
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:33,679
I think that's the most patronizing
thing I've ever heard.

240
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,309
Your wife?

241
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,337
It's okay, go ahead.

242
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,826
It's fine, really.

243
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,219
I apologize.

244
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:58,446
Jesus, look, look at you.

245
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,610
Look at how stressed you get thinking
I might learn the slightest detail

246
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,239
about your life. So what?
You got a wife at home.

247
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:06,610
Big deal.

248
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,937
See, that's the real problem
with all your theories, paul.

249
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,503
They completely ignore
your side of the whole equation,

250
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:15,243
that you are also human.

251
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:20,036
Yeah, you have this nice theory
that I see you as my father

252
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,642
and that's why I want to...

253
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:23,687
What did you say?
Defy you.

254
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,347
But what about you?
Why do you keep making it seem as if 

255
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,871
you have no personal stake in this,
as if you're only here for me?

256
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,543
It's a deception, paul.

257
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,161
Let's take Laura, for example.

258
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,167
You play such a big role in her life,
it's unbelievable.

259
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,257
She knows nothing about you.

260
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,688
She's sure you're one of the most
perfect people she's ever met

261
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,581
and she hasn't the faintest idea
of who you are,

262
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,408
what your beliefs are,
how long you've been married... Nothing!

263
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,048
Doesn't it just seem
a little insane to you?

264
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,292
Who are you?

265
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:00,757
Really?

266
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,643
I know the whole truth about you.

267
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:12,371
You're not made of iron,
that's for damn sure.

268
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,778
Not even close.

269
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:22,623
Did you have something
going on with her or not?

270
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,062
You...

271
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,695
Really are perverted.

272
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,539
You know that she's young
enough to be your daughter, man.

273
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,866
During all our sessions here
Ibet you sit here

274
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,204
and you imagine how I screwed her.

275
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,386
Right?

276
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,841
You trying to make me angry?

277
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,833
Hey, don't try to turn this into
my psychosis. I'm onto your shit.

278
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:52,183
- But you're the one in therapy.
- You're the one not telling the truth.

279
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:55,042
You're the one who's bullshitting me.
You're the hypocrite.

280
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,950
I come in here every week
and I tell you everything.

281
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:02,070
Now you can't look me in the eye
and admit that you are falling in love

282
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,731
with a patient 20 years
younger than you.

283
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,680
I mean, come on.
You can't hang with her.

284
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,299
Come on, look at you.

285
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,106
You'll look like a fool.

286
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,020
Trust me.
You can't keep up with her pace.

287
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,123
- I can tell you that.
- Let me ask you something:

288
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,907
Why did you have to sleep with her?

289
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,487
I don't know.
I got tired of jerking off.

290
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:25,658
A thousand women could
have fulfilled that function.

291
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,918
Why laura?

292
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,008
She's sexy as hell.
Have you noticed?

293
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:32,049
I think that you are
trying to get back at me...

294
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:34,451
Because she was my patient.

295
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,724
The whole world revolves
around your ass?

296
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,583
I understand your theory.

297
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,676
You've been hinting at
it for the last 3 sessions.

298
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,369
That ain't flying either.

299
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:45,396
You really think that everything
that happened between me and her

300
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:48,025
- was meant to hurt you?
- You did it to provoke me.

301
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,942
Maybe you were looking for a reaction,
some kind of reaction,

302
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,951
anything more than a pat on the thigh.

303
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,354
Something emotional,
even if it's anger.

304
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,023
That's interesting.

305
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,952
That's another brilliant
theory there, doc.

306
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,473
But how about you, paul?

307
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,810
The fact that your wife is

308
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:12,974
screwing her lover
in some pathetic hotel

309
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,711
overlooking
the piazza di trevi in Rome,

310
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,932
is that getting a reaction out of you?

311
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,802
Yeah, you'd be real surprised

312
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,266
the kind of information
you find out from a few phone calls.

313
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,526
Yeah, I found out
a bunch of things, paul,

314
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,395
about whole bunch of subjects.

315
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:41,309
In fact, I've been taking
a little interest in psychology lately.

316
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,714
I've been meaning to check out
what you got here.

317
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,994
I even read a book laura gave me,

318
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,689
about the whole concept
of reciprocity in therapy,

319
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:55,673
about how everything that goes on
in here should be reciprocal.

320
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,236
So it made me think.

321
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,533
You sit here, you listen to me

322
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,355
and you pretend
to solve all my problems.

323
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,440
But you don't have
a fucking clue about yourself.

324
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:09,215
So I figure...

325
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,550
I got a choice.

326
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:16,716
Either I accept your superiority
as if you're some kind of god,

327
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:21,225
or I use my intelligence
and do a little investigating,

328
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,756
just to make sure
that this god is not some kind of...

329
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:28,822
Dr. Ruth who tells everybody
how to fuck while she's still a virgin.

330
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:31,120
You know what I mean?
70 years old and hey...

331
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,475
But so I made a few calls, paul.

332
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,089
Nothing too complicated.
More or less the same people

333
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,153
I consulted before coming here.

334
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:41,896
What's amazing is how many people

335
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,389
are dying to help you find
what you're looking for.

336
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,838
I found a hell of a god

337
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,317
in my investigations.

338
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:04,106
A god whose life is falling apart,

339
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:08,904
whose wife is sleeping around
behind his back,

340
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,500
whose daughter is fucking junkies,

341
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,262
whose father...

342
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,154
Yeah, whose father...

343
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:23,262
is rotting away in some geriatric
hospital somewhere in virginia, and why?

344
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:27,514
Is the son too stingy to pay
for a slightly more liveable place?

345
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:30,707
What a god.

346
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,489
And then laura comes along,
your sexiest patient yet,

347
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,437
and her only wish in life
is to get you into bed because

348
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:41,025
she thinks that's gonna solve
all of her sexual hangups.

349
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:43,894
And you, you fall in
love with that crazy slut...

350
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:47,860
Don't you fucking talk
about my patients, you fuck!

351
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,206
How fucking dare you!

352
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,619
You prick.

353
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,326
Richard, it's paul.

354
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:49,046
Look, I'm really sorry.
I have to cancel our session.

355
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:53,525
Today, I...

356
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:57,823
I'm sorry it's such short notice.

357
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,950
Something has come up and...

358
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,197
I'll get back to you.

359
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,042
Call me if there's a problem, bye.

360
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,390
What's happened?

361
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,342
Nothing.
It was...

362
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,129
Why are you canceling
your appointments, paul?

363
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,116
When did you get in?

364
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,660
It was about 10 minutes ago.

365
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:35,870
Was that you knocking at the door?

366
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,420
Paul, I'm so sorry.

367
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,556
- Honestly, I thought you were alone.
- It's okay. It's okay.

368
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:45,290
What did you do to your hand?

369
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,641
Accident.

370
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,265
I dropped a...

371
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:30,420
Let me see.

372
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,106
You'll survive, you know?

373
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,381
How are the kids?

374
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,970
Max kept asking
when you were coming home.

375
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:12,395
I didn't quite know
what to say to him.

376
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:29,737
Paul, we moved into
separate rooms on the first day.

377
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:35,012
It's completely over,
if that matters at all.

378
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:50,467
Thanks.

379
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:54,626
I've got to...

380
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,301
Hello, Julian.
Come in.
