00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:06,177
Amy's been trying to reach out
to me this week

3
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,871
and make it all OK,
the whole Ben thing,

4
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:12,027
but how can you make up
for something like that?

5
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,644
I don't have that many people
to talk to right now.

6
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:18,389
I'm scared shitless of losing
Lenny in some custody battle.

7
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:19,623
Amy's...

8
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,587
She's damaged, Paul.

9
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:23,900
She's fucked up.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,766
The last time you were here,

11
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:29,038
you implied that you had fallen out
of love with Amy.

12
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,090
Would you still say that's true?

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,951
I don't know. How would I know?
What does it feel like?

14
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:36,333
I've only ever been
in love with one girl... her.

15
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,006
I've never fallen out of love.
Tell me what it feels like

16
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,363
and I'll tell you if I'm feeling it.

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,248
- Hello, Amy.
- Hey, Paul.

18
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:49,990
Hi, Jake. Come on in.

19
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:55,235
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:03,360
You know, I'm actually
gonna miss this office.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,154
I like the feel of it.

22
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:07,371
- I like the clutter.
- Really?

23
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:10,034
What do you mean,
you're gonna miss it?

24
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:15,808
It's our last session.

25
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,541
We're getting a divorce...
For real this time.

26
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:23,311
I am sorry to hear that.

27
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,548
It's because of you, actually.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,515
Well, not really you.
It's because of therapy.

29
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,261
Therapy did us good.

30
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:33,932
Would you agree with that, Amy?

31
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:37,088
Sure, if by "good,"
he means it was a disaster.

34
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,045
You ever been
through a divorce, Paul?

35
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,425
- No, I haven't.
- It's not for sissies.

36
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,022
Even when you want it more
than anything, it turns into

37
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,950
this spiral of uncertainty and pain

38
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,017
and you bury a part of yourself.

39
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,603
Maybe we should begin with just...

40
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,781
Recapping the last week.
How's it been?

41
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,986
We barely saw each other all week.
That was Jake's idea.

42
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,829
He wanted to see how it would feel.

43
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,189
And?

44
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:42,469
It felt okay.

45
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,503
Better than I expected.

46
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:49,827
Amy?

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,206
Sure! My week was light and breezy.

48
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,733
Would you mind talking about it?

49
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,425
Yes, I do mind talking about it
because every time I came here

50
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,270
I tell you about my week, you find a way
to make me feel miserable,

51
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,673
to make my childhood
seem like a nightmare,

52
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:07,530
to make my marriage
look like a sham, so sorry,

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,199
forgive me, but I'm actually
through talking about my week.

54
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:18,351
- Come on, it's not what happened here.
- Maybe not for you.

55
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,954
We came in miserable.

56
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,860
We couldn't talk to each other.
All we could do was fuck.

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,194
You know? Fuck and fight.

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,993
And now, I...

59
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,733
I don't know. I'm feeling...

60
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,986
- What?
- What Paul says he's seeing...

61
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,390
What we do to each other, how we bring
out the worst in each other.

62
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,199
I can't speak for you, but I...

63
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,549
I'm feeling better this week.

64
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,993
- Better than I've felt in a long time.
- Why can't you speak for me?

65
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,492
Because we haven't seen each other
all week.

66
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,135
Whose idea was that?

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,406
- We both agreed that...
- No, I didn't.

68
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,898
- I thought you said it was a good idea.
- I was trying to be accommodating.

69
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,202
And wait, you can't speak for me?

70
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,032
There was a time when you would've
spoken for me in a heartbeat,

71
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:11,077
a time when you knew
every thought in my head.

72
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,760
I wanted it to be true,
but it never was.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,054
And how would you know that?
It's my head.

74
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,141
Did you know I heard you play
this week?

75
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:40,114
- What are you talking about? Where?
- At Elliot's house on Friday night.

76
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,697
You were at Elliot's? When?

77
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:44,322
Well, not exactly.
I was on Elliot's street.

78
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,908
I could hear you playing

79
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,001
from my car.
You were actually quite good.

80
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:50,784
That's insane.
This was Friday night?

81
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:53,756
- Where was Lenny?
- Home with a sitter.

82
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,707
I was gonna surprise you.

83
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,858
I was gonna ring the doorbell
and come inside and say...

84
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,307
Actually I was hoping I wouldn't have
to say anything. That you'd just grab me

85
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,303
before I got to that part.

86
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,453
- You never came in.
- No.

87
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:09,352
Why not?

88
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:11,941
Because of Paul.

89
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:15,272
Because of everything
that we've said to each other here.

90
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,925
Because I couldn't remember

91
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:19,931
how we used to make up
before we came to Paul.

92
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,730
We used to have sex.
That's how we used to make up.

93
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,425
I'm so sorry
I ever suggested coming here.

94
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,647
I just wish we'd never done it.

95
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:34,373
Amy, you said that you see our work
here as being a failure.

96
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,426
- Why do you think that?
- Because it is.

97
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:42,009
Been coming to you for months
and it's only gotten worse between us.

98
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:46,434
Jake, how do you see the therapy?
Do you see it as a success?

99
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,540
I think it's a little bit
more complicated than that.

100
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,690
In what way?

101
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,312
I'm just... I don't know.

102
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:58,013
I think I'm getting it more now...
Why...

103
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,187
we can't control our dynamic,

104
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:03,910
why we trigger each other's
worst instincts. And, I don't know,

105
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,787
it feels good to me.

106
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:08,915
I mean, it feels awful,
of course, but it feels good

107
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:11,224
that it's making more sense.
You know?

108
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,518
Like, it's not me,
it's not her, it's us.

109
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:15,350
It seems to me it's finally clear

110
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,379
that you both have
radically different ideas

111
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,508
of what a relationship
fundamentally is.

112
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:23,221
Amy, you think things are falling apart,
yet the worst is gonna come.

113
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:27,130
Jake, you see things
as coming together, that the future is

114
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:28,946
brighter than the past.

115
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,444
You're evaluating
our entire beings based on the way

116
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:35,025
that we behave at the moment
we're getting divorced?

117
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,735
- That's ridiculous.
- There is a theory that says

118
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:41,974
the way a person handles one thing
is the way they handle everything.

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,716
And I guess what I'm trying to do
is take into account

120
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:49,343
the whole history of your relationship.

121
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,829
I do remember, Amy, that it was sex

122
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,905
that first attracted you
to each other.

123
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,672
And your first encounters
you described as "messy,

124
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,071
"but really really powerful."

125
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,535
And then you got pregnant,

126
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,711
which you hadn't planned,
and then you got married.

127
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,726
By then you'd begun to fall into
the patterns of provoking each other.

128
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,928
Amy, you mentioned
how depressed you were

129
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,483
when Lenny was born.
Do you remember that?

130
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,404
Do you remember why?

131
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,149
I felt like the world
was a terrible place

132
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,788
and it was wrong
to bring a child into it.

133
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,201
And what about you, Jake?

134
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,440
What do you remember feeling
when Lenny was born?

135
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:39,504
I felt pure...

136
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,810
Unadulterated relation.

137
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,304
I still don't understand.

138
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm a pessimist

139
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,028
and he's an optimist
and opposites attract.

140
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,962
And that happens all the time,
so why can't we fix this?

141
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:56,365
Why doesn't this relationship work?

142
00:07:56,822 --> 00:08:00,820
You know, I think that what we've tried
to do here in these sessions is

143
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,428
to illuminate the patterns of behavior

144
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:06,153
that have kept
the two of you kind of...

145
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,432
Coiled around each other...

146
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,931
The cycles that you've embraced,

147
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,333
the way you've hidden behind them.

148
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,637
So you can't really act out

149
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:22,457
these patterns anymore because
everything is now out in the open.

150
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,556
Now they're in the conscious mind.

151
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:28,580
The two of you are, in a way,
emotionally naked before each other.

152
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,261
I remember when it all started.

153
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:43,589
After Lenny was born,
I just sort of lost it.

154
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,533
There were nights I'd sit there holding
him watching television, just crying.

155
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,659
And then of course,
he'd start to cry.

156
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,336
Jake would come home from work
and take Lenny and...

157
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,355
take him into another room.

158
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,290
I mean, I came out of it eventually,
but Jake...

159
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,710
didn't look at me
the same way again.

160
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,046
- That's not exactly what happened.
- It is.

161
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:05,194
When I got depressed, it was like
you took it personally or something.

162
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:08,216
- You acted as if I'd betrayed you.
- You had.

163
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:14,926
When I met you,

164
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:18,557
you seemed like this person
who was unhappy in a relationship.

165
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:19,846
So I thought:

166
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:23,801
"Take the woman out of the relationship
and you'll take away her pain."

167
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:26,571
But I got you out of the relationship
and you were still unhappy.

168
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:31,200
And then we had a kid, a beautiful kid,
and you were still unhappy, so...

169
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,895
I felt like I'd been tricked.

170
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:44,854
Sorry.

171
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:48,022
I wasn't trying to trick you.

172
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:53,556
I'm sorry too.

173
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,618
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.

174
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,201
No, I do. I'm sorry.

175
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,528
I really have screwed
a lot of things up and...

176
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,446
I'm really sorry that I...

177
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,097
Got angry.

178
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:19,456
I knew you were having a hard time
and I shouldn't have done that.

179
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,413
I don't know. I just...

180
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:35,999
I got scared.

181
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,748
We both did.

182
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,704
I'm gonna miss our family.

183
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,144
This is what I see in front of me:

184
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,716
two people who have
really loved each other deeply.

185
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,938
And even though
you're not bringing each other

186
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:06,057
happiness right now, the truth is
you've gotten to this place together.

187
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:11,665
And though you're looking at it
from different perspectives,

188
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,790
it is the same place.

189
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:18,313
And I guess what I'm asking you to do

190
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,602
is to think about not turning away.

191
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,778
Even at this difficult time
when you're...

192
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:26,731
contemplating the notion
of separation,

193
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,575
you can still draw strength from...

194
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:31,263
From each other.

195
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,909
What are you saying?
You think we shouldn't get divorced?

196
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,618
Couples therapy either helps people heal
or it shows them

197
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:41,890
how they can separate.

198
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,833
The therapist's job in the end,
I suppose,

199
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,032
is to let the couple decide.

200
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,608
But we've been coming here for weeks.
We've told you so much.

201
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,502
You must have an opinion.

202
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:57,098
All I can say is that
you are a unique couple.

203
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,260
I know couples
who use less energy to make love

204
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,744
than you two use
in casual conversation.

205
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:07,078
And passion like that
is a rare commodity.

206
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:09,370
But passion itself isn't enough

207
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,986
to sustain a relationship
for a lifetime.

208
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:13,446
What is?

209
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,159
What is enough to keep
two people together for a lifetime?

210
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,809
I wish I knew the answer to that.

211
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,764
I'm so worried about Lenny.

212
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:37,260
Yeah, he's gonna have
a whole different life.

213
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,724
So you're gonna share custody then.

214
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:44,727
I assume we would.

215
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:53,093
Joint custody.

216
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:00,868
You understand what that means.

217
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:03,094
It means he moves
back and forth, right?

218
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,995
Yes, but I think it's a little bit
more specific than that.

219
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,541
But you know what?
This isn't my area of expertise.

220
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,921
You both need to sit down

221
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,027
and discuss this in detail

222
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:14,624
with a lawyer.

223
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,448
Jesus.

224
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:21,460
We can barely get him to school
on time as it is

225
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,909
between the two of us.

226
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,296
Amy's working as much as she does...

227
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,782
So I guess, what?

228
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,113
I should take him during the week?

229
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,385
Actually, I'm not working anymore.

230
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:34,995
What, did you quit?

231
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,610
- What happened?
- I slept with my boss.

232
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,077
And he has a wife.
He didn't want me around anymore.

233
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,453
So you were fired.

234
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,759
That fucking asshole.

235
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,707
I'm relieved, actually.

236
00:13:56,827 --> 00:14:00,491
We've got a bit of a cushion
with the severance package, so...

237
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:10,318
And I got a producer who's still really
interested in a few songs of mine.

238
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,065
I think it might be helpful

239
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,867
to talk through some
of the more complicated questions

240
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,730
that arise as a result.

241
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:22,766
For example, have you thought
about where you're going to live?

242
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,035
I was thinking of
getting a place in the city.

243
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,475
I know a guy, he's a friend of Elliot.
He's got a loft.

244
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,626
It's rough, but it's cheap.
There's enough space for me,

245
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,711
Lenny, and maybe
a little recording studio.

246
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:36,390
- Is it safe?
- Sure.

247
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,425
- Is there a doorman?
- I just told you it was cheap.

248
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,492
I don't want him staying
in a bad place.

249
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,604
What do you want me to do?
Stay in the house,

250
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,044
build a little wall
through the bedroom?

251
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:51,603
I thought about moving away,
starting over in another place,

252
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,023
but I want him to be close to you.

253
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:55,387
It'll be fine.

254
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:57,665
It'll be good for him
to get out of the suburbs anyway.

255
00:14:57,785 --> 00:15:00,196
And you know I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to him.

256
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,259
If worse comes to worse,
you could always

257
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,324
get your parents to help out
with Lenny.

258
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,452
I'd live on the streets
before I ever ask my parents for help.

259
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,960
Have you told them about this,
about us?

260
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,630
- What'd they say?
- My dad cried.

261
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:22,090
- Really?
- No, but I think he wanted to.

262
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,926
I could tell.

263
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,138
Probably invite you for Christmas,
tell you to bring a date.

264
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:33,729
We'll figure this custody thing out.
People do it every year, right?

265
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:50,233
Have either of you talked to Lenny
about what's been going on between you?

266
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,897
Not really, but he knows.

267
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,291
Kids pick up on everything.

268
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,439
They certainly do.

269
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,420
He thinks we're crazy, I can tell.

270
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,674
He's only 9 but he already realizes
he's got crazy parents.

271
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,676
He's not entirely wrong there, is he?

272
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,597
Remember that time we tried to teach him
where babies come from?

273
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,089
Amy had gotten him this book called

274
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,856
"Where do I come from?"
It was one of those

275
00:16:18,358 --> 00:16:21,668
cartoon books that they write
to teach kids about sex.

276
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,449
It was a pretty good book, except...

277
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,843
Except that it left out
this really significant part,

278
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,286
that sex is pleasurable.

279
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,755
Which Amy felt like
Lenny really needed to know.

280
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,090
They made it sound like
sex was something adults did

281
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,122
'cause they had to,
like brushing your teeth.

282
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,275
I'm reading the book
and Amy keeps interrupting

283
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,427
trying to explain to him
what sex feels like

284
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,463
using these ridiculous metaphors
to describe how sex feels for a woman.

285
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:45,126
It was my only frame of reference.
Meanwhile, Jake keeps correcting me

286
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,563
with contradictory metaphors
from the male perspective,

287
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:50,362
saying it's like hitting a home run
naked inside of someone else.

288
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:52,881
And this poor kid
is just looking at us

289
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,741
just more and more confused,

290
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,936
- until finally he just...
- Got up and walked away.

291
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:58,730
Just walked right out the door.

292
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:01,423
Shaking his head
like a little old man.

293
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,050
Yeah he'll be okay.

294
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:44,918
My father used to say
there's no greater distance

295
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,217
than the space between two heads.

296
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:57,969
We're over, aren't we?

297
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:21,707
Damn it.

298
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:29,926
Oh, God!

299
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,904
We should get going.

300
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:08,818
Lenny's piano lesson
is gonna be over pretty soon.

301
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:14,618
Sorry.

302
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:20,488
And I need to go.
I can't be here any longer.

303
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,267
We're gonna talk to him now?

304
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:23,708
- No, later.
- When?

305
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:27,544
- I don't know, OK?
- I think you'll find the right time.

306
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,592
We're gonna be late. Let's go.

307
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,997
You wanna stay and talk to Paul
for a few more minutes and I can

308
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:38,980
- go pick Lenny up myself?
- No, I want this to be harder for you.

309
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,174
It is hard for me.

310
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:44,244
No, it's not.
You can't wait to get out of here.

311
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,739
No, I'm just done with this room.

312
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:51,750
Okay? I wanna go to a bar,
get drunk, and cry like a baby.

313
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,734
I wanna feel all those things.
I just don't want to do it here, OK?

314
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,398
Come on, Ame.

315
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,259
Who's that?

316
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,019
My next patients.

317
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:47,853
Let's go.

318
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:57,484
Amy.

319
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,389
Jake.
