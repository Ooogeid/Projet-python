00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:08,533
<i>Previously on</i> "in Treatment"...

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,766
A liar shouldn't expect
their word to be worth anything.

3
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:14,566
I'm gonna start some real lying
to teach you a lesson.

4
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:17,066
You said that when you saw Jake
for the first time,

5
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:20,706
- you thought he was sexy as hell.
- He was beautiful.

6
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:24,825
Amy has a strong need to have a career.
That seems to make you jealous.

7
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:28,076
That in turn makes Amy secretive
and she lies.

8
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,535
- Stop calling me a liar!
- Stop lying!

9
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:33,401
- Stop it!
- You're a fucking liar...

10
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,706
- God damn it! Stop it!
- You are a fucking liar!

11
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,127
<i>You're a quitter. He's a winner.</i>

12
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:43,130
<i>If you had a quarter of Ben's strength
I'd be interested in you too.</i>

13
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,742
You psychopath.

14
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,172
Have you ever recorded
your arguments with her before?

15
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:53,285
I just want to understand
what's happening to us.

16
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:05,997
What's up?

17
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,394
You fall asleep?

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,140
- How long have you been here?
- Five minutes.

19
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,664
- Should we go in?
- There's someone in there.

20
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,752
Can I sit?

21
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,454
What time is it?

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,449
Five to.

23
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,227
Well...

24
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:48,986
Well, what?

25
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:54,798
Are you gonna be like this
in there too?

26
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,080
Like what?

27
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,338
I don't know.

28
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,046
Season 1, Episode 24.

29
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,311
Week 4, Session 4.

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,483
Sync by: michvanilly, Gaillots, Anyone.

31
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:42,474
So how are you both?

32
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,115
Fine.

33
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:45,975
Fantastic.

34
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:49,441
Before we begin,
I want to talk about last week.

35
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:52,026
I can tolerate
yelling and outbursts

36
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,983
that result from your arguments
but I will not,

37
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,740
absolutely not,
tolerate any physical violence.

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,435
- Do you understand that?
- It's OK. We separated a week ago.

39
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:05,223
Separated.

40
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,135
I'm sorry to hear that.

41
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,837
So it's a little late
to start setting up ground rules.

42
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,365
- Hope you don't feel like an idiot.
- That's what you would want, I suppose.

43
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,367
Why would I wanna make you look
like an idiot?

44
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:21,166
- Because it makes you feel good.
- Wait, did you hear what I just said?

45
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,403
Yes. You said that you'd been
separated for a week.

46
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:29,088
- Would you like to tell me why?
- He threatened to kill me.

47
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:32,925
You're smiling.

48
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,357
You're taking on
a huge responsibility.

49
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:41,558
- What responsibility?
- You act like you aren't concerned.

50
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,727
You don't think he's capable
of doing it?

51
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,231
- He could be perfectly capable of it.
- Then why are you smiling?

52
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:50,208
I've had patients over the years
who've had their lives threatened.

53
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,528
You just brought this up
like it was nothing.

54
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,471
- Well, I'm not into this.
- What's the matter?

55
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,847
Can't you hear
how he's talking to us?

56
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,168
What the hell is wrong with you?

57
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:06,116
- Why are you being so hostile?
- That's what it feels like to you?

58
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,502
Very much so.

59
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:08,752
- OK.
- What?

60
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:14,259
I have to put up with you both
being hostile to each other and to me

61
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,450
- constantly.
- That's why we pay you.

62
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,180
The money isn't really important to me.
I have other patients.

63
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:26,855
I don't understand. You say
you don't wanna treat us anymore?

64
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,904
Do I want to treat you?
That's a tough one, actually.

65
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,839
This is what therapy would be like
if nobody respected boundaries.

66
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,943
It is chaotic, it is disrespectful
and it's unproductive.

67
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,820
Do you understand that?
Is that what you want?

68
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,653
Can't even get couples therapy right.

69
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,899
Our own therapist doesn't want
to treat us anymore.

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,757
Why don't you just tell me what happened
after the session last week?

71
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,981
I took Lenny
and went to my mother's,

72
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:25,011
and then Jake showed up on Saturday
and wanted to take Lenny home.

73
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,449
- Before they poisoned him with sugar.
- Please.

74
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,770
You should see the crap
they force-feed him.

75
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,957
Don't do that. Anyway,
we went to the bedroom to talk,

76
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:36,274
one thing led to another
and we ended up having sex.

77
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:40,385
How did one thing and another
lead to the sex?

78
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,599
- You want some details, bro?
- Whatever you'd like to tell me.

79
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,617
Things that dull at home?

80
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,949
I'm interested in your sex
because it's part

81
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:51,647
of your dialogue as a couple.

82
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,192
So how did it go from sex
to a murder threat?

83
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,641
He had just finished coming.

84
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:03,002
He was still lying on top of me.
He was still inside me,

85
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,411
and he whispered in my ear
that if I left him, he'd kill me.

86
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,841
He didn't even bother pulling out.

87
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,799
I was disgusted.

88
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,236
That's an unusual reaction
to somebody threatening to kill you.

89
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:27,859
- What was it that disgusted you?
- Let me tell you what disgusts me.

90
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,511
Watching her and her mother
shove junk food down my son's throat.

91
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,212
It's a miracle
the kid doesn't shit <i>Twinkies.</i>

92
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:38,405
- What does Lenny have to do with this?
- No, what you do to him disgusts me.

93
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,774
- He's 9 and he weighs 100 pounds.
- He doesn't weigh 100 pounds.

94
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,096
So, is Lenny overweight?

95
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,317
He's a child.

96
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,039
He'll grow out of it
when he hits puberty. I was the same.

97
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:55,165
You were overweight?

98
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,803
My dirty little secret.

99
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:03,276
- She had issues with food.
- I was thin by the time we got married.

100
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:05,137
Who cares what I weighed
when I was 5?

101
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,192
- You never mentioned that before.
- We never spoke about it

102
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:11,393
'cause it's irrelevant in this context.
This is couple's therapy, right?

103
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:15,355
- When did you lose the weight?
- In my teens. Just melted off.

104
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,736
So does it bother you
that Lenny is overweight?

105
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,571
Please stop saying that.

106
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:27,284
I don't like referring to him that way.
He has a little baby fat,

107
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,214
- he'll lose it.
- 30 pounds of it.

108
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,966
Her mother lets him eat candy,
drink soda, play Xbox...

109
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,074
- He doesn't want him to see my mother.
- He'd be better off on the streets.

110
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,472
- He's got the genes of an athlete.
- I saw it coming.

111
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,977
It's my fault he's fat.
I passed down shitty genes.

112
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:42,282
We can't talk about Lenny
without me being blamed

113
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,426
for the terrible genes I gave him.

114
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,813
So the fact that you were overweight,

115
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,982
that does come up
in arguments between you?

116
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:59,483
Don't you think
it's a relevant subject for therapy?

117
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,309
No, I don't understand
why we're going in this direction.

118
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,905
Yes, he wants to talk about
our fat little boy.

119
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,741
Why don't we talk about
how Jake's screwing Lenny up?

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,454
She means
I'm screwing him up socially.

121
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,271
- Lenny hits.
- Because he gets laughed at

122
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,708
for being fat.

123
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,155
No, Lenny hits
because Jake teaches him to hit.

124
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,807
He gets bullied at school,
so I taught him to defend himself.

125
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:25,092
It's normal. Besides, you were the one
doing the hitting last week.

126
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,488
You convinced Paul
it's gonna escalate to murder.

127
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,679
You're the one
planning to kill me, remember?

128
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,908
I would gladly
but I'd feel bad for Paul.

129
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:35,119
- We already ruined his couch once.
- Right.

130
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,490
Can you see the pattern here?

131
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,612
What you do to each other?

132
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:49,296
You take the most sensitive subjects,
you just toss them away carelessly.

133
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,250
Sometimes you laugh,
sometimes it hurts you.

134
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,123
But don't you feel that it makes it
much more difficult to get

135
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,165
to the bottom of
your real feelings?

136
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,044
You think I find it funny
that he's threatening me?

137
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,131
Do you mean it
when you say these things?

138
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:07,717
- What you gonna do? Call the police?
- Possibly.

139
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:12,928
- Aren't there laws against that?
- Against threatening to kill somebody?

140
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:16,513
No, laws against telling other people
what your patients tell you.

141
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,929
They don't apply to serious crimes.

142
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,796
Just letting you know.

143
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:29,778
But at least you are calling
yourself a patient.

144
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,409
- That's progress, Jake.
- So fucking condescending.

145
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,770
Somebody should really
teach you a lesson.

146
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,780
What is that, another threat?
So many threats flying around the place,

147
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:42,628
- I'm having trouble keeping up.
- What's going on with you today?

148
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:46,853
I'm trying to get you guys to listen,
really listen, to what you're saying.

149
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,045
Let me ask you something. Has Jake
threatened you before, physically?

150
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,612
I didn't really mean
I'd kill her, OK?

151
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:59,356
- It just came out.
- How did you put it, exactly?

152
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,889
He said:
"If you leave me, I'll kill you."

153
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,898
- Did you mean that?
- Of course not.

154
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,150
I'm not gonna fucking kill her.

155
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,861
This week.

156
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,450
What's that supposed to mean?
What are you trying to say?

157
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,040
And you said you weren't afraid, Amy,
but you felt disgusted.

158
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:22,966
- Yes.
- What does that mean, "disgusted"?

159
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:26,082
What do you think, Paul?
Tell me what you think.

160
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:29,168
He'd just come inside me and then
said that he wanted to kill me.

161
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,838
What do you think
disgusted me about that?

162
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:37,885
Jake, do you understand the severity
of what you said, that threat?

163
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:42,270
You realize she could get a restraining
order against you, don't you?

164
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,344
I think you understand
what I'm talking about.

165
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,548
"If you leave me,

166
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,411
"I'll kill you."

167
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,580
We've been concentrating
on the 2nd part of that sentence,

168
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:04,251
but let's look at the first part of it.
"If you leave me."

169
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,721
That says to me that you're afraid.

170
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,558
You're afraid of what will happen to
you if Amy leaves.

171
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,522
The fear that you would cease
to exist maybe.

172
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:17,338
That you...

173
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:18,793
would die.

174
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,743
Let's just leave that for a moment.

175
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:38,113
I'd like to go back to something
that we talked about earlier on.

176
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:42,164
Would you like to talk about
your memories of being a child?

177
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:43,779
Being overweight?

178
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:46,906
I don't think about that.

179
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,242
I live my life moving forward.

180
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,716
And does that need to be analyzed?

181
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,573
Would you say that you were
a confident child?

182
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,931
Not really.

183
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,015
I would say I was overweight and shy
but I grew out of it and I'm fine.

184
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,770
Actually, I'm more than fine
and Lenny will be fine too.

185
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:08,888
Last week you said
Jake and his friends were pathetic.

186
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,125
Yes, they are that.

187
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:14,363
Maybe it's convenient for you
to think of Jake as being

188
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,793
pathetic, as you say,

189
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,576
being an underachiever.

190
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:19,750
Why?

191
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,914
Perhaps because it helps you avoid
seeing your own insecurities.

192
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:31,066
I think that when he threatened you
in bed, he revealed how

193
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,367
desperately he needed you,
although he did it in a very scary way.

194
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,162
But that was Jake
at his most vulnerable...

195
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:40,714
Which I think you associate with him
being pathetic.

196
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:46,356
And you don't want that.

197
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:52,662
So you're saying
that I'm with an underachiever

198
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:56,530
- because I lack self-esteem?
- Perhaps that's a way for you to avoid

199
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,392
dealing with negative feelings
about yourself.

200
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,456
I want a divorce.

201
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,405
Fine. I'm taking Lenny with me.

202
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,560
You think I'm just gonna let him

203
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,565
go with you so you can turn him
into some fat-ass couch potato

204
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:11,056
- because you wanna make a change?
- I don't want to make a change.

205
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:13,941
I want my life. Lenny needs me.
He should be with me.

206
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,519
He needs me too.

207
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,689
Fuck, Amy, what do you want from me?

208
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,095
What do you want from me?

209
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:31,986
Nothing.

210
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,766
Let's just try and do this nicely,
Jake, please.

211
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,792
What the fuck's so nice about it?

212
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,685
I happen to know this couple

213
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:39,449
who went to therapy after they'd already
decided to get divorced,

214
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,113
and they made a decision in the end

215
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,441
to stay together.

216
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:50,190
That's not gonna be the case here.

217
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,714
The only reason I mention it
is because I want you to know

218
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:58,319
that even when divorce becomes
a possibility, it isn't always...

219
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,881
so final.

220
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,234
- Are you trying to change our minds?
- Your mind.

221
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,556
This particular couple had problems.

222
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,369
They couldn't even hold
a civil conversation with each other.

223
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:14,073
- They slept in separate bedrooms...
- Why?

224
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,977
- There'd been an affair
- Who cheated?

225
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,068
That's not really the point.

226
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,660
There's been no infidelity
in our relationship.

227
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,684
I'm not inferring that, Amy.

228
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,868
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that I know what it's like.

229
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:34,081
You know, sometimes people have
to get to this precipice

230
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:37,001
to understand what they really mean
to each other.

231
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,248
I can't do this anymore.

232
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:49,414
Don't you think there are still some

233
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,516
very positive aspects
to your relationship?

234
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:54,763
Like what?

235
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,474
The murder threats, the suspicion,
the recordings, the stakeouts, what?

236
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:02,924
I see it in the way that you look
at each other sometimes,

237
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,619
The way you make each other laugh.
And you've...

238
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:09,992
You've been working
on your relationship pretty steadily

239
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,002
by coming here every week.

240
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,541
Are you cheating on me?

241
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:23,339
So why did Paul just tell us
about that other couple then?

242
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:26,932
- Was that story about you?
- No...

243
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:29,065
Of course it was.
That's not the point.

244
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,941
She told you she was cheating
or not?

245
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:34,320
- I must hear everything, remember?
- I'm not cheating.

246
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,523
Neither of you is opening up here.

247
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,318
You're both too busy attacking
each other. I want you to listen.

248
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,675
I want each of you to examine
your own culpability here,

249
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:52,655
not continuously looking
for what's wrong with the other person.

250
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,338
- And not to be so on guard all the...
- On guard?

251
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,000
Are we playing poker or something?
I come here to save my marriage

252
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,794
- and you tell me she's has an affair?
- He never said that.

253
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:06,285
- So you are here to save your marriage.
- No, because I got a thing for you.

254
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:09,513
You're here to save your marriage,
you just said it. Now say it to Amy.

255
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,374
Jake, look at your wife

256
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:15,940
and tell her.

257
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,851
Jake, we're constantly fighting.

258
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,819
We'll stay together
and then we won't fight.

259
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,798
If we stay together, we won't be
able to stop. Even Paul said so.

260
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,024
What was all this therapy for?

261
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,114
I don't know what to do.
Paul, what am I supposed to do?

262
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,959
Talk to your wife. Say it to Amy.

263
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:43,125
- Amy, I want to tell you something.
- Jake, stop, please.

264
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:45,688
Listen to me,
I wanna tell you something.

265
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,609
I don't want you to leave me.

266
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,359
I don't want to lose you.

267
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,155
I don't want you to leave me.

268
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,443
I haven't slept in, like, a week.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

269
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,233
I don't know what to do.

270
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,296
But I really...

271
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,441
I don't want you to leave me.

272
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:30,956
Please don't leave me.
Please don't fucking leave me.

273
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:45,853
Please don't leave me.
