1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,288
It's a not as fast as the human eye

2
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:15,254
so like every...
when you're looking at... when the lens

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,847
looks at stuff, everything
seems much faster.

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,303
That's really cool.
It looks amazing.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,874
So how are you doing in school?

6
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,445
- Good, good.
- How are you doing in English?

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,670
Pretty well.

8
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:33,671
So what subject are you
not doing so well in?

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,575
- Your mom said that...
- Writing.

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,245
Writing,
she said that you got a C in that.

11
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,957
It's no big deal, dad.
It's just one C.

12
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,817
On your next report,
why don't you let me help you?

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,384
You can email it to me
and we can work on it together?

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,552
Okay?

15
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,920
Email it?
Are you joking?

16
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:58,346
God.

17
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,036
Can you hold on for a second?

18
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,475
Okay, Max.
I've got to go, unfortunately.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,361
I've got a patient coming to see me.

20
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,422
You don't have patients this late.

21
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,290
- Is it a girlfriend?
- No, it's not a girlfriend.

22
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,618
It's a patient
who left something behind.

23
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,712
I'd tell you if I had a girlfriend.

24
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,475
No, you wouldn't.

25
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,053
I've got to go now, Max, okay?

26
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:28,750
I'll talk to you real soon, okay?

27
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,051
Have fun with your girlfriend.

28
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:48,275
- I've come to collect the turtle.
- Of course. Come on in.

29
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,846
I didn't even know my son
had a turtle until this morning.

30
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,177
I haven't seen Oliver
all week, so...

31
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,182
I'll get him for you in a second.
He's been...

32
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,533
he's been in my kitchen living...

33
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:03,247
living the good life.

34
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:09,268
Yeah. Oliver's been with Luke all week.

35
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,430
He's having a good time,
or so Luke says, so...

36
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:15,136
I figured why spoil the party?

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,097
It was nice having my week.
I actually finished "Middlemarch."

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,355
I think you're the only one
I know who has.

39
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:25,644
Does it end well?

40
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,942
I can't even remember.

41
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,955
And plus I had a three-hour
phone call with my sister,

42
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:33,419
which was...

43
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,314
actually pretty harrowing.

44
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:38,593
But at least now
I've done my duty, so...

45
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,261
I found this shoe box for...

46
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,947
for safe travel.

47
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:49,928
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

48
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,736
It's really no trouble at all.

49
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,047
Actually, he was good company.

50
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,753
I was worried
about leaving him alone, but...

51
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,699
I guess turtles are

52
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,056
pretty self-sufficient.

53
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,726
Yeah, and I baked you some cookies.

54
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,050
I mean, not just for you.
I did a lot of baking over the weekend.

55
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,881
That's really sweet of you.

56
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,334
I made too much and...

57
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:17,480
The turtle, it's way above
and beyond the call of duty.

58
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:21,581
Thank you.

59
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,382
So I'll leave you to your evening.

60
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,524
- See you Wednesday, 4 o'clock.
- Good night.

61
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:44,873
VO: Gillesilb, michvanilly, salomon

62
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,718
Oliver - Week 3

63
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:01,526
So...

64
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,247
Who wants to go first?

65
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,959
How was your week?

66
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:16,838
Great.

67
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,131
Glad to hear that.

68
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,408
And what was great about it, Oliver?

69
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,374
I stayed at my dad's.

70
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,681
All week?

71
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,386
We went to a basketball game
and we sat up close.

72
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,782
My feeling is every New-York kid
should have a chance to go the Garden

73
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:34,857
and watch the Knicks suffer
humiliating defeat.

74
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:37,973
And we watch The Godfather.

75
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,846
That's a pretty cool movie.
I had never seen it before.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,327
Tell Paul what you said when
we watched it.

77
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:46,043
What{\you decided} you wanted to be
when you grow up.

78
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,095
I want to be a Consingulary.

79
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,479
A Consiglieri.

80
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,458
What else did we do?

81
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,464
We went to the Met
and saw Arms and Armor

82
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:00,458
- and bought some posters for his room.
- Did you have any trouble sleeping?

83
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,941
He was out like a light
the second his head hit the pillow.

84
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,934
We were running
around the city so much.

85
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:07,157
And did your dad have
the right kind of food for you?

86
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:10,768
We went out to eat every night.
Guess what I like now? Paella.

87
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,145
What's not to like about paella?

88
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,439
Everything good is in paella.

89
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,313
So it was just you
and your dad all week?

90
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:21,403
- None of your dad's friends came over?
- They came over to watch football.

91
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:22,900
But at halftime,

92
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:25,505
we played Wii Golf
and I beat everybody.

93
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,408
So...

94
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:29,161
it sounds like
you had a really good time.

95
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,957
Was there any time
to do your homework?

96
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,532
What's that supposed to mean?

97
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,282
Just if you guys were eating out
every night and watching movies

98
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,130
and running around the city, when did
Oliver have time to do his homework?

99
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,551
I got it all done.

100
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,813
That's not entirely true, is it?
'Cause I found out that

101
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,262
one of your assignments
was to take care of a turtle.

102
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,683
Did you apologize to Paul
for making him do that?

103
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:53,936
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem.

104
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,503
{\Anyway, }I'm glad you got him back. I know
you were worried about him last week.

105
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,840
But you forgot all about him
when you were at your dad's.

106
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,613
Can't you just cut
the kid some slack?

107
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:04,196
I'm glad you guys had a good time.
I just want to make sure

108
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,365
that homework
and school come first for oliver.

109
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,243
I got all of my homework done.

110
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,495
- Did you?
- I've already told you that.

111
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,313
Nina came over
and helped me finish it all.

112
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,473
I'm sorry, who's...

113
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:23,857
who's Nina?

114
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:28,804
My girlfriend.

115
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,624
So Oliver met
your girlfriend this week?

116
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:42,124
This person is staying
at your apartment?

117
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,779
Not staying. She came over a few times
to help Oliver with his homework.

118
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,973
Didn't we clearly agree
it was too soon for that?

119
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:50,451
You heard him, right, Paul?

120
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,942
What's the big deal?

121
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,483
The kid had a great week.
You heard him.

122
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,979
How did it feel
to spend time with Nina?

123
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:03,168
It was okay.

124
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:05,256
She only came
over two or three times.

125
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,212
She went with us to Arms and Armor.

126
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:09,744
- It was her idea.
- Why didn't you say anything before?

127
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,811
Did your dad tell you
not to say anything?

128
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:13,432
He didn't want to get you sad.

129
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,005
So now he's telling Oliver
to keep secrets from me.

130
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,000
No, I just wanted to avoid
this exact kind of conversation.

131
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,041
Luke, I wonder if you can see how...

132
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:26,403
upsetting that might be to Bess.

133
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,962
The way she sees it,

134
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,889
you've asked Oliver
to keep a secret from her.

135
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,109
But it ended up being
a great week. All went well.

136
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,874
I don't see why everybody wants
to make this harder than it really is.

137
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,161
Don't we have enough people going on
without bringing

138
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,379
- some strange woman into the mix?
- Mom, I already knew Nina.

139
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,707
How exactly do you know Nina?

140
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,808
She was my teacher last year.

141
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,636
Nina Cabot,

142
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:03,183
- his homeroom teacher?
- From last year.

143
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,441
When he was in the lower school.

144
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,654
He's on a whole different floor now.

145
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,104
That really puts my mind at ease.

146
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,531
- How long have you been dating her?
- A month.

147
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,075
Six weeks.

148
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,843
Oliver, is there anything
that you would like to say about this?

149
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,859
Whatever I say,

150
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:30,823
makes everything worse.

151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,413
Tell you what:

152
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:41,484
why don't you and I go
into the waiting room?

153
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,481
And we just take a few minutes?

154
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,156
Give your mom and dad
some time together?

155
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,413
What do you want?

156
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,336
I shouldn't have said anything.

157
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,390
I'm glad you told the truth.

158
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,294
I thought if I stayed at my dad's,
everybody would be happy.

159
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:15,973
But they're fighting again.

160
00:09:18,588 --> 00:09:22,102
You certainly don't need to apologize
for having a good time at your dad's.

161
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:24,065
It wasn't so great.

162
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,879
Really?
But you...

163
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,960
you said in there that you had fun.

164
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,320
I did have fun.
But the Knicks lost.

165
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,908
It was still hard
for me to fall asleep.

166
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:36,925
Really?

167
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,870
My dad checked on me,
so I pretended to be asleep.

168
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,789
Sometimes he sits at my desk
and watches me.

169
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,500
And I try really hard
not to open my eyes.

170
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,797
So what did it feel like

171
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,874
to have your dad
watching you like that?

172
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,132
It felt like

173
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,089
he was a soldier.

174
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,501
You know, like guarding me.

175
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,479
Guarding you from what?

176
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:05,308
He wants me to be asleep,
except I'm not.

177
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,658
So I didn't want to tell him that.

178
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,533
You mean you didn't want
to worry him but...

179
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,862
with everything that's
going on right now...

180
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,573
Well, I can't sleep
at my mom's either.

181
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,700
Do you pretend
to be asleep there as well?

182
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,590
I don't feel comfortable anywhere.

183
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,738
I just wish there was someplace
I did feel comfortable.

184
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:26,413
Makes a lot of sense.

185
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:31,046
Did you like spending time
with Nina?

186
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,177
I miss my mom.

187
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,644
I know that you love
your mom very much.

188
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:43,934
And I'm sure
that she misses you too.

189
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,236
She called every night.

190
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:49,147
I told her I was fine,
but she sounded sad.

191
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,358
Did you find it hard
not to tell her about Nina?

192
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:57,179
My dad said if we told her,
she'd get upset.

193
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,425
And she did.

194
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,962
Do you feel that...

195
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,911
you have to keep secrets
from your mom and dad

196
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:08,804
so that they won't get
angry or upset?

197
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,065
Oliver, I know that
you want to help them.

198
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,925
But you can't keep them
from being angry or sad.

199
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,265
I just wish none of this
ever happened.

200
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:32,995
I hear you.

201
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:40,255
You know, I spent a lot of time
watching your turtle.

202
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,635
I thought...

203
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,975
"How he carries that house
on his back wherever he goes".

204
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,000
That's why turtles are so slow.

205
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,025
Always walking around
with their houses.

206
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,020
Anything else you noticed
about the turtle?

207
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,945
Not really.
I just got him back this morning.

208
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,390
You spent more time with him
than I did.

209
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,615
That's true.

210
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,110
I did notice one thing.

211
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,235
Yeah?

212
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,710
When my mom met me at school
to bring me the turtle,

213
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,385
he was in a shoe box.

214
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:16,690
I thought it was mine,
but she said it was yours.

215
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:19,215
And what made you think
it was yours?

216
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,145
'Cause it was for a kid sneaker.

217
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,159
I asked my mom.

218
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:26,635
She said maybe you have a son.

219
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:28,065
Do you?

220
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,040
Are you wondering
what kind of dad I would be?

221
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:33,220
I bet you're a good dad.

222
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,495
You sound pretty sure about that.

223
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:37,756
'Cause you listen to me.

224
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,720
So, do you have a son,
or you're gonna make me guess?

225
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,540
Okay, for now, let's say that...

226
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:49,565
that I do have a son.

227
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,000
Tell me what you think about that.

228
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,375
Well, I think he doesn't live here.

229
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,055
Not most of the time.

230
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:59,105
How come?

231
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,040
'Cause I come here
right after school.

232
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:05,380
And if he lived here, I'd see him
coming home from school, too.

233
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,290
So where do you think he does live?

234
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,912
Probably with his mom.

235
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,505
And what do you think
that's like for him?

236
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,705
Maybe he's lonely.

237
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,547
He probably misses
seeing you all the time.

238
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:21,355
Anything else?

239
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,388
I wanna meet him.

240
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,641
Why would you like to meet him?

241
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,445
I don't know.

242
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:34,860
Just to talk to someone like me.

243
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:38,275
I guess it'd be good to have a friend
who's going through the same stuff.{\, yeah?}

244
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,425
Does he have any
brothers or sisters?

245
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,785
Would that make a difference?

246
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,235
It would make it easier.

247
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:53,540
Would you like to have
a brother or a sister?

248
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,100
I was supposed to get one, but...

249
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:59,210
I'm not thinking
he's coming anymore.

250
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,785
I don't understand.

251
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,005
Well, my parents were gonna
adopt a baby boy.

252
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:07,835
They were supposed to fly
someplace in Africa to get him.

253
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,345
My mom showed me his pictures.

254
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,392
And what happened?

255
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:15,005
They just stopped talking about him.

256
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,465
And then my dad moved out.

257
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,986
So since then, they haven't spoken
to you about the adoption?

258
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:28,755
Maybe he's...

259
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:33,225
Maybe he's still waiting for
my mom and dad to come get him.

260
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:37,695
Maybe if they don't get a divorce,
he'll come live with us.

261
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,877
I don't know.

262
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:44,355
That's a big thing
not to know, Oliver.

263
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,935
Do I have to go back in there?

264
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,392
Can't you just talk to them
by yourself?

265
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,515
You can stay here.

266
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,505
It won't be long.

267
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:11,070
You left the two of us alone
in the same room together.

268
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,330
You sure like to live dangerously,
don't you?

269
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,660
{\Well, }I didn't want the two of you to continue
talking about Nina in front of Oliver.

270
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:21,489
You mean, how Luke's been fucking
Oliver's 23 year old school teacher?

271
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:24,214
Things have been all really well
in here so far, can't you tell?

272
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,155
Or how you've been using Oliver
to get laid.

273
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:28,930
I knew Olive liked her,

274
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:33,055
so I wanted to talk {\to her }about how things
were going for him at school this year.

275
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,975
I didn't have any big plan.

276
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,107
And she likes him.
She helps him with his homework.

277
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,397
She's a good person.
What's the problem?

278
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,720
We got agreed it was too soon for Oliver
to meet someone you're dating.

279
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,930
And you just overturned that decision
all by yourself.

280
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,955
You remember agreeing to that, Luke?

281
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,470
What I remember is an ultimatum.

282
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,518
So instead of seating down
and discussing{\ this with me}...

283
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,743
There's no discussions with you.

284
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,705
There's just giving in
to keep the peace.

285
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,220
So you just go along with whatever
I say to just shut me up,

286
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,848
and {\then you go }you do whatever you want,
no matter how much it's gonna hurt {\Oliver}him.

287
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,760
Look, I knew Oliver could handle it.

288
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:08,633
And I knew if I had waited for you
to sign off, things would never change.

289
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,892
So, Luke, do you feel
that there's no way

290
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:13,263
to discuss things with Bess
and come to a compromise?

291
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,391
Do you feel that she needs
to win every argument?

292
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,892
That's the way it works, yes.

293
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,154
And Bess, you feel that Luke
pretends to agree with and he just...

294
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,929
does whatever he wants?

295
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:28,750
Only this time it's worse because
he's using Oliver to cover for him.

296
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,875
You know what?

297
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:34,010
I think our job here is to find a way
for both of you to be straightforward,

298
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:35,435
with each other.

299
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,354
So that Oliver feels
he doesn't have to

300
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:41,082
hide things from either of you.

301
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,002
You figure that out, you're worth
a million times what we pay you.

302
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,145
Bess, would you like to join us?

303
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,315
I'd like to ask you
about a question.

304
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,717
When I was talking
to Oliver just now,

305
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:58,381
he told me that you've been planning
to adopt a baby.

306
00:16:58,506 --> 00:16:59,656
Is that true?

307
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:03,730
- He talked about that with you?
- Well, I was...

308
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,150
I was surprised neither of you
mentioned it before.

309
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,600
Because it was a terrible idea
right from the beginning.

310
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:10,025
That's not true.

311
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,906
He likes to rewrite history here.

312
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,532
The truth is, we've been talking about
having a{\nother} baby for years.

313
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,036
She actually thinks that was gonna solve
all of our problems.

314
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,706
Or maybe I wanted to give Oliver
the chance to be a big brother.

315
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:26,335
{\You know, }We had a really good life, and I wanted
to share that with another child.

316
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,504
I've wanted to adopt
for a very long time.

317
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,429
There are a lot of kids
who need a good home.

318
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,791
And, you know,
I didn't feel all the need

319
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,340
to go through pregnancy
and labor all over again.

320
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:40,266
Also you generally need to be
having sex for that to happen.

321
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,560
Can we go back to the adoption
for a moment?

322
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,313
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

323
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,245
I honestly believed
that Luke wanted this.

324
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,236
At least as much as I did.

325
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,655
We were fighting all the time,
I {\just }wanted to make her happy.

326
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,197
Well, can you tell me about
the adoption process,

327
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,172
what that was like for you?

328
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,829
For the last two years,

329
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,194
I was the one who did all the work.

330
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,030
She go crazy on me because
I filled up a medical report wrong.

331
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:09,629
I had spent a week on that thing,
and then I had to do it all over again.

332
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:12,540
The week before the social worker
came for the home visit,

333
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:13,865
she goes nuts.

334
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,010
She rehearses with Oliver
every night,

335
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,178
tells him what to say, she's terrified
that we're gonna be turned down.

336
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:21,685
But of course,

337
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,905
we passed with flying colors.

338
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,835
So when we got the referral,

339
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,884
the baby's medical records,
his little photo...

340
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,825
I showed it to Oliver,
we were so excited.

341
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:38,645
I was ready that night to get on a plane
to pick up the baby.

342
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:42,275
And then I gave the folder
to Luke to look at.

343
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,535
I took one look at that kid's face,

344
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,214
and I knew what a disaster
all this was gonna be.

345
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,445
The whole thing was just a band-aid.

346
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,387
And then now,
we were gonna fly to Africa,

347
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:04,125
and have some poor baby dropped
in the middle of our unhappyness?

348
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,438
No, I knew the kid
would find a better home.

349
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,107
We were already out 20 grand,
but I...

350
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,285
figured that's the price you pay.

351
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,495
There was no way
we were gonna fix this.

352
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,125
He comes into our room,

353
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,161
throws the folder on the bed
and says "I'm leaving".

354
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,965
So would you say then
that this adoption was the...

355
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,459
the final straw on your marriage?

356
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,170
Well, he just decided our marriage
was over, without even discussing it.

357
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,770
That's because it's impossible
to have a discussion with you.

358
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:38,995
If you had said any
of what you've just said today,

359
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,105
That would at least been something,
you know what I mean?

360
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,280
Once again, you felt that

361
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,505
Bess was pushing you.

362
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,825
And Bess, once again you felt like
Luke deceived you.

363
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:56,765
It seems to me like you've never...

364
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,660
really been able to figure out how
to work through your problems together.

365
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:03,510
- Would that be right?
- I would say that's pretty accurate.

366
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,970
And maybe that's the {\whole }reason
why we're not married anymore.

367
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,922
See, the thing about it is, that Oliver
needs you to find a way

368
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:10,947
to make decisions as a team,

369
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:12,755
and he needs you to...

370
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:18,100
He needs you to explain
things to him, clearly.

371
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,225
Otherwise,

372
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,485
he...

373
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,865
He fills in the gaps on his own.

374
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,655
I mean, for instance,

375
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,325
do you realize that he still
doesn't know whether or not

376
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,728
he's gonna have a baby brother?

377
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:38,555
What?

378
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:40,405
You never told him?

379
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:47,245
Can we bring him in here right now?
Can we just talk about this together?

380
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:51,555
And do you feel like you can both talk
to him about it in a way that will...

381
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:54,265
clear up his confusion?

382
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,345
I guess we owe it to him to try,
right?

383
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,431
I'll call him in, then.
