1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,842
He knew that Kate
was in Italy with another man.

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:06,172
He threw it at my face.

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:07,715
How dare you?

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,259
It's completly over
if that matters at all.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,095
Am I the first patient
to be in love with you, Paul?

6
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:15,181
You all right?

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,683
- I don't think I can do this.
- Do what?

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,604
Just don't think
it's leading anywhere.

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,022
- Where do you want it to lead, Alex?
- Some place sane, I miss flying.

10
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:27,116
We need to discuss
in a little greater detail

11
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,445
- your ending therapy.
- I'm finishing today.

12
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:32,432
- Tell 'em I'm ready.
- Let's just talk about

13
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:34,617
- wether you're ready or not.
- I need this.

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,685
You're putting me
in a very difficult position.

15
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,081
Never had a patient
died before in treatment.

16
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,002
- You're going out?
- I'm going to see Laura.

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,677
- You ever been in a patient house?
- You're not a patient.

18
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,045
- Are you over me?
- No, I'm not.

19
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:03,521
I saw Laura today.

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,428
I went to over there to
tell her that I love her.

21
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:09,103
- What happened?
- I had anxiety attack.

22
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:11,653
You had to take him apart,
didn't you?

23
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:14,128
Do you think that Alex's therapy here

24
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,766
had something to do woth his death?

25
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,905
Okay, all right,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

26
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,372
Who is it?

27
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,999
Delivery.

28
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,228
Mr. Prince.

29
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,365
What, you thought if you moved
to brooklyn I wouldn't find you?

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,540
Well, is...

31
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,213
is everything okay?

32
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,546
Okay? What, did you forget already?

33
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,026
No, of course I didn't.

34
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,627
How could I ever forget that?

35
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,817
No one wants to take responsibility.

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,259
You know, everybody thinks
they can just run away.

37
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,634
- Well, not anymore.
- I'm really confused.

38
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,709
It's been over a year.

39
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:22,182
- Has something happened?
- I got the report back from the navy.

40
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:26,262
There was no sign
of a mechanical malfunction.

41
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,107
I didn't know that.

42
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,735
But you knew my son
wasn't ready to fly.

43
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,621
You knew.

44
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:37,408
And you did nothing to stop him.

45
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:39,673
Now he's gone.

46
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:42,346
You still practicing?

47
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,455
Would you like to come inside?

48
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:47,166
Is this your new office
where you help people,

49
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,269
like you did alex?

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,395
I would...
I would never go in there.

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,570
Mr. Prince, Alex's death was...

52
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,426
a tragedy. I can't even begin
to imagine what you've...

53
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,137
I don't want you to imagine it, man.
I want you live it.

54
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,931
I understand your rage.

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,750
You understand nothing.

56
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:06,694
You want to understand
something, doctor...

57
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,665
maybe you will understand this.

58
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,890
What's this?

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,790
A lawsuit against you.

60
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,985
I told them I'd serve
the summons myself.

61
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,952
Can we talk about this, please?

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,516
Is that gonna bring him back?

63
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,603
No, obviously it's not
gonna bring him back.

64
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:27,936
Well, you know,

65
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:31,544
that's what killed Alex in
the first place... Talking with you.

66
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,013
I did not kill your son, Mr. Prince.

67
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,690
Tell that to his son.

68
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,432
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,825
That's not good enough.
You're gonna pay.

70
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:50,187
I want you to pay.

71
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,875
Mr. Weston, this way, please.

72
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,272
Thank you.

73
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,114
Paul.

74
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,497
It's been a while.
How are you?

75
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:32,867
I'm... I'm fine.
It's Mia, isn't it?

76
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,086
I wasn't sure you would remember.

77
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:39,761
Of course I remember.

78
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,298
I'm sure I've changed.

79
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,367
Well...

80
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,910
actually, I had an appointment

81
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,385
with a Mr. Ellis.

82
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,253
I know. Unfortunately,
he's stuck down in D.C.

83
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,778
He sends his apologies.
I'm covering.

84
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,711
Well, then maybe I should
wait for him to come back.

85
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:03,072
Oh, you can, but he
might be a while.

86
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,597
And I've already looked
at your file.

87
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:07,197
But still,

88
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,176
given our history...

89
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,644
God, please, Paul.

90
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:14,069
The first hearing is in eight weeks.

91
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,906
I think it's in your best
interest to get started.

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,876
Eight weeks?

93
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:20,242
- Is that enough time?
- Well, exactly.

94
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,535
Look, you're here.

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,060
Let's just do
the first consultation.

96
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,798
I will ask some questions.
You'll ask some questions.

97
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:27,922
And that's it.

98
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,855
Mr. Ellis can see you
next time if you'd like.

99
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,394
- Okay.
- Great.

100
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,737
Well, a beautiful view.

101
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,966
Yeah, all the trappings.

102
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:44,797
Right.

103
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,321
Have a seat.

104
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:52,786
I've handled a lot
of malpractice cases.

105
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,961
Malpractice?

106
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,588
I can imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

107
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,784
No I'm fine, really.

108
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:09,923
Malpractice?

109
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,705
How do we... how do we begin?

110
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,403
We'll start with some
personal information,

111
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,471
just to verify.
Is that okay?

112
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:19,596
Sure sure.

113
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:20,768
You're 53?

114
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:25,642
- You look great.
- Thank you.

115
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,467
Men are lucky like that.

116
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,644
God, it's annoying.

117
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:34,123
You have a B.A. And an M.S.
From Columbia university

118
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:36,206
and a phd from the New School.

119
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,440
- That's impressive.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,791
And then, after your
new york internship,

121
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,866
you just picked up and moved.

122
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,037
No, that was a few years later.

123
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,259
I actually went
to the Baltimore institute.

124
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,464
Right, in the summer of '88,

125
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,333
right before I started law school.

126
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,866
And now you live
and work in Brooklyn.

127
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,929
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

128
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,142
Well, I just actually
got back last summer.

129
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,225
I see.

130
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,596
And you're recently divorced?

131
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,593
Does it say that in my file?

132
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:10,935
From your insurance company
it's the first year you've

133
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,918
circled the "d" on the form.

134
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:14,912
Then I guess I am

135
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,490
d-vorced.

136
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,851
- And three children?
- Yes.

137
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,334
Are they with you?

138
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,745
All right, so I assume you understand
the basics of the lawsuit.

139
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,884
You know, to be
quite honest, I don't

140
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,952
really understand any of it.

141
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,165
Okay, let's start from the top.

142
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,365
You're being sued by
your ex-patient's estate.

143
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,341
They claim that you
should have understood

144
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,438
that Mr. Prince wasn't ready to fly.

145
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,316
And you should have alerted the navy
to his condition.

146
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,641
They're suing you for $20 million.

147
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:50,758
Fucking hell.

148
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,782
Only $3 million of which
is covered by your insurer.

149
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,863
Would you like some water?

150
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:01,276
- Please.
- Or maybe something stronger?

151
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:02,456
What?

152
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,334
It's a joke. It's just a bad joke.

153
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,921
Sorry I'm not at my most jovial.

154
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:10,328
Well, who would be?

155
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,834
In my personal opinion,

156
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,884
this lawsuit is without merit,

157
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,678
but we live in a litigious society.

158
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,947
So this... this first

159
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
hearing

160
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,941
- it could just get thrown out?
- It could.

161
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,799
And it should...

162
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,380
but the threshold to allow
a case to go to trial

163
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,031
is subjective. There's the law,

164
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:36,365
and then there's the judge you draw.

165
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,138
But you've been through a divorce,
so you must know that.

166
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:41,780
Yeah, but the law is
still the law, isn't it?

167
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,655
Yes, but your patient was

168
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,488
a young man, a father,

169
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,505
a war hero.

170
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,909
Yeah, well, to be absolutely honest,

171
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:54,284
I don't think that he would see
himself as a war hero.

172
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:57,971
Either way, a home-town judge
may want to give his family

173
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,431
their day in court.

174
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,707
But I thought...

175
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,310
- you said it wouldn't go to trial.
- It souldn't.

176
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:04,813
But if it does,

177
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,574
juries can let emotions
get in the way of the facts,

178
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:10,025
especially when it comes
to suicide cases.

179
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,238
What do you mean, suicide?

180
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,906
Are you telling me
that you think Alex killed himself?

181
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,826
That's not what i'm saying. But his
attorneys claim at he did,

182
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,098
and they're out there right now,

183
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,705
deposing everyone he knew.

184
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,473
And they will find people
who'll say that he seemed depressed

185
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,029
and not himself.

186
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:31,206
And the navy report...

187
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:34,022
well, of course the navy
are going to absolve themselves.

188
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,385
Of course they are.
That's not really a big surprise.

189
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,129
Well, we will be making that point
if it gets that far.

190
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:42,808
By then it becomes
a contest of experts.

191
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,520
We'll find people to testify that you
upheld the standard of care.

192
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:49,687
Right, and they'll pay people
to say I didn't.

193
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:53,395
I just don't understand
how this can be happening.

194
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:58,782
The point is, these things do happen.
And that's why firms like ours exist.

195
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,743
Your insurance company chose
this firm for a reason.

196
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,580
- Did you follow the Bolinger case?
- The surgeon

197
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,997
who operatedon the wrong side
of somebody's brain?

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,585
I mean, that guy was
completely incompetent.

199
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:13,364
The facts were against us.

200
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,158
But I was head counsel and we won.

201
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,760
So what you're saying is
that the insurance company

202
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,202
chose you because they think
I'm guilty and you get

203
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,285
guilty people off. Is that it?

204
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,324
No, that's not what i meant.

205
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,680
My point is

206
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:30,545
I've handled dozens of
negligence cases, many of which

207
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,107
seemed far worse than this one.

208
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,635
I'm confident that we can help you.

209
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:40,372
- I said no calls, Henry.
<i>- It's Mr. Nesky.</i>

210
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,488
Dad, i'm in the middle of a meeting.
Are you okay?

211
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,815
I'm so glad. And it fits?

212
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,128
I know mom hates green,
but I love you in it.

213
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,173
Okay, I have to go.
I love you. Bye.

214
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,487
No more calls.

215
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,454
- I'm sorry.
- My father. It's okay.

216
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,308
Since he sold the candy store,
he has some free time.

217
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,728
- A lot of free time.
- He must be very proud of you.

218
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,856
I've come a long way
from the Pulaski bridge.

219
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,637
Anyway, let's keep going.
Your session notes

220
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,446
you haven't sent those in yet.
We're gonna need those right away.

221
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,179
I don't have any notes.

222
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:24,714
- Really?
- I don't take notes.

223
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,538
That could be a bit of a problem.

224
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,541
What do you mean, a problem?

225
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,737
Lots of therapists don't take notes.

226
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:35,458
I mean, I start a session I'm in
it. I know everything

227
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,299
there is to be known about the patient.
I don't nee dto write it down.

228
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,720
Okay, well, maybe because of situations
like this, you should.

229
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,681
Process notes may not
be therapeutically

230
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,226
- important, but legally...
- so what are you saying?

231
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,712
A bad therapist who takes notes
is better than a good one

232
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,563
who doesn't take notes?
Is that?

233
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:55,690
I'm not saying that at all.

234
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:58,485
Am I some kind of criminal
because I never take notes?

235
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,603
I wouldn't say "never", Paul. I'm
pretty sure you took them with me.

236
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:06,462
Can we take a break?
I'll just be a minute.

237
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,016
Dad, no, i'm good.

238
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:20,923
Sorry.

239
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:25,197
My father doesn't quite understand the
concept of "she's in a meeting."

240
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,284
Those aren't mine, the children,
in case you were wondering.

241
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,076
- They're beautiful kids.
- My nieces.

242
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,414
Never married.

243
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:38,717
It's funny, a lot of women lawyers
are like shrinks. They don't put out

244
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,755
personal photos, but since
they're not my kids, i figured...

245
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,866
let's keep going. Where were we?

246
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,347
I think that you were
reminding me that

247
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,856
I took notes when I
was your therapist.

248
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,589
You haven't been
my therapist in 20 years.

249
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,479
I shouldn't have brought it up.
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

250
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:01,072
I was kind of uncomfortable anyway.

251
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:05,882
Everyone who comes in here
under these circumstances is.

252
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:08,197
Let's get back to solving this.

253
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,308
You didn't take notes.

254
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:12,903
Did you

255
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:17,139
consult with any colleagues about
Mr. Prince's treatment?

256
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:20,740
Well, yes, actually. I had
weekly sessions last year

257
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,365
with what we call...

258
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,408
a supervisor.

259
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:25,962
Great.

260
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,841
What is his or her name?

261
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,952
Gina Toll. Dr. Gina Toll.

262
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
That's a relief.

263
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,634
Is she in Maryland?

264
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:39,229
Okay, great. We'll have to get
a deposition from her.

265
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,659
Is that

266
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,524
absolutely necessary?

267
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:47,737
We need to affirm that you did
all you could for Mr. Prince.

268
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,131
Well, I don't...

269
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:51,206
i don't know if she'll do it.

270
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:53,899
Why not?

271
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,933
Well, because
our relationship has been a little

272
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:01,187
strained at times.

273
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,002
Over this.

274
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,005
Do you think she might believe

275
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:11,289
- you're in some way culpable?
- I, I...

276
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,485
i honestly don't know what...

277
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,160
what she might think.

278
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:18,711
- Is that a yes?
- I honestly don't know.

279
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,288
Look,

280
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,566
in the first place, Alex

281
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:35,312
- wasn't in treatment that long.
- Why not?

282
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,431
He...

283
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,833
the process of
separation is quite...

284
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,444
quite complex.

285
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:47,055
Did you refer him to someone else?

286
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:48,923
How did it end?

287
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,426
I don't see
what difference that makes.

288
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:54,038
Oh, it can make a lot of difference.

289
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,266
Why did the
treatment ends so quickely?

290
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,199
What do you mean by quickly?

291
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:02,308
Before the patient was better.

292
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,427
It was his choise to leave.

293
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:07,102
Why? What happened
in that last session?

294
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,029
He said that...

295
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,185
that he was...

296
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:16,112
ready to fly and he told me
not to screw up his life.

297
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:19,815
And you let him go.

298
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:23,953
Yes, I let him go.

299
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:26,752
His attorneys are going to claim
that he wasn't psychologically fit.

300
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:29,268
Suicides often seem better
before they kill themselves.

301
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:31,647
Upbeat and determined,
once they have a plan in place.

302
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,926
Because sometimes,
when people are actually doing better

303
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,012
they seem upbeat
and put plans into place.

304
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,139
So which was it with Alex?

305
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,962
I don't know I'm still trying
to figure that out.

306
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:49,507
Look, my patient died.
I'm human.

307
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,860
I have doubts.

308
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,030
- Do you want to talk about them?
- No Mia...

309
00:17:58,113 --> 00:17:59,333
I do not

310
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,375
want to talk about them.

311
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,475
This is...

312
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,464
- it's kafkaesque...
- Paul, we're in a battle here.

313
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,189
It's not like therapy

314
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,479
where you used to tell me
to look for the grey.

315
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:17,631
Not now.

316
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,439
The law is win or lose,
there's not subtext here.

317
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,058
Actually I think there's quite a bit
of subtext here.

318
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,310
I don't follow you.

319
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,732
You asked me if Alex's treatment
was too quick,

320
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,680
you asked me if I ended his therapy
before he was better.

321
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,568
That's just due diligence.

322
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,979
But it could also be

323
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,369
that the wires are getting
a little bit crossed.

324
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,021
It seems to me that you are expressing

325
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,346
some of the feelings that maybe...

326
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:52,504
- Bennett, I'm in a meeting.
- Yes, I know. Apologies.

327
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:54,094
I want to meet Dr Weston.

328
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,660
- I'm Bennett Ryan, managing partner.
- Pleased to meet you.

329
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:59,574
I just wanted to apologize
on behalf of Mr Ellis.

330
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,796
But I want you to know I was thrilled
when Miss Netsky grabbed the case.

331
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,429
You're in good hands,
but you know that.

332
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:08,552
I understand you two go back a ways.

333
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:10,886
Thank you, Bennett.

334
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,161
And if there's anything you need,

335
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,835
please, don't hesitate to call.

336
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,356
Thank you.

337
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,250
- Mia...
- Yes.

338
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:23,031
I have to rain-check our meeting, sorry.

339
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:25,910
No problem.

340
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,039
It's not what you think.

341
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,904
- What do I think? - He shouldn't have
walked in here like that.

342
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,529
- It's fine.
- Actually it wasn't fine.

343
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:41,067
I'm the head litigator.
He's the managing partner...

344
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,242
There was a lot of subtext
behind that performance.

345
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:46,687
There was?

346
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,687
It's OK, you don't have to worry
about it.

347
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:55,648
You know Mia... I think

348
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,491
we should stop now.

349
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,655
- When Mr Ellis comes back...
- What are you saying?

350
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,245
I just don't think
that we should work together.

351
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,416
That's funny...
Haven't we been here before?

352
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,557
How do you mean?

353
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,690
I was 22...

354
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,757
dealing with a crisis

355
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,217
and you just disappeared.

356
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:21,906
That's what you remember?

357
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,428
No, that's what happened.

358
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,161
You were there one week
and gone the next.

359
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,761
Obviously...

360
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:31,825
I'm not a perfect therapist,

361
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:35,027
but if you did feel abandoned,

362
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,875
- I appologize.
- Don't give me that

363
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,283
"I'm sorry if you feel" bullshit.

364
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:43,621
I felt abandoned
because you abandoned me.

365
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,222
I'm sure that we talked about that
in our sessions.

366
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,414
Did we?

367
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,851
Then how come that last day
I sat there on your couch,

368
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,419
devastated.

369
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:57,098
I was moving with my family
to Maryland.

370
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,439
I couldn't leave, you told me

371
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,092
I had to.

372
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:04,699
I gave you a gift that day,
do you remember?

373
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,813
- I'm not exactly... it's...
- No, yeah.

374
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:13,553
I never heard from you after I left.

375
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,674
It's not usual for therapists

376
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:19,059
to keep in touch with patients
when they...

377
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:20,251
Some do

378
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:24,482
- if the patient means something.
- Mia, of course you meant.

379
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,407
You know what?
Forget it.

380
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,857
This is stupid.

381
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,901
We can stop here, let's stop here.

382
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,242
- It's my turn, I'm throwing you out.
- Mia...

383
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:39,653
Bennett said that...

384
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,508
you grabbed my case
when Ellis got detained.

385
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:46,875
I'm just curious

386
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,138
why you think you did that?

387
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,038
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

388
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:53,485
The last time I saw you
you were just a kid.

389
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,743
I remember you were worried
that you wouldn't make it

390
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,688
through your first semester
of law school.

391
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:58,771
But now...

392
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,526
Look at you, Look at

393
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:02,862
where you are.

394
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,905
- Where am I?
- You're the head litigator.

395
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,880
A wall full of clippings.

396
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,428
I think that...

397
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,312
that you wanted me to see that,

398
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:18,045
to see that you are now

399
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,326
a success.

400
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,804
I'm a success?

401
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:23,604
Why?
Because I work in a tall building?

402
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,668
Or because I wear a Prada suit,

403
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,945
or because I summer in the Hamptons

404
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,170
and go to all the gala openings
at the fucking Met?

405
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,850
Yes, I made it through law school,

406
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,383
all the way to the top floor,

407
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:41,237
with the beautiful views
and the windows that don't open

408
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:44,164
and the fucking jackhammer
that never stop.

409
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,239
And you know what I do
when I win a case?

410
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,450
One of those hopeless ones,
that only I would take?

411
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:52,991
I go out and I get drunk
with my gay secretary

412
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:56,372
and then I stumble home
to my one-bedroom condo,

413
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,697
and I pray that I can fall asleep.

414
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:09,093
Were you hoping to show me

415
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:13,580
both how well you've done and...

416
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:17,528
how sad you are?

417
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:26,978
I see you sitting there and
all I can think... I can stop thinking.

418
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:29,907
It didn't have to be this way.

419
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:32,002
How do you mean?

420
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:35,597
Don't tell me you forgot that too.

421
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:41,498
No.

422
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:44,349
No, me neither.

423
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,850
This was a mistake.

424
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,229
I'll get your file to Mr Ellis,
he'll do an excellent job.

425
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,302
He's almost as good as I am.

426
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:06,179
I'll make sure
Ellis gives it top priority.

427
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:07,304
Thank you.

428
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:14,202
I really do have to kick you out,
I have a meeting with another client.

429
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:15,856
I understand.

430
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:20,307
Thank you.

431
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,708
Mia...
