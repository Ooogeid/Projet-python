1
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,804
Alex was my patient.

2
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,991
He understood as a...

3
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:18,994
As a pilot that…

4
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,938
civilian casualties were,

5
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:24,959
in his mind, inevitable.

6
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,479
It's my belief that he wasn't able

7
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:29,281
to forgive himself, no.

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,062
The therapy was ended by Alex.

9
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,657
Well, he felt that he was ready
to go back to active duty and that...

10
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:40,157
I became

11
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,334
aware

12
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:46,327
that he was involved
in a relationship.

13
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:52,207
Are you asking me
if I knew on a subconscious level?

14
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,417
That's an almost impossible
question to answer.

15

00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:16,110


17
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:21,687
- Was it difficult?
- Those people are like...

18
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:23,671
They're like vultures.

19
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,294
I can't believe anybody
actually does that for a living.

20
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:29,588
You wanna tell me about it?

21
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:33,133
About the deposition?
No, not really.

22
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:37,053
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- It's not even 4:00.

23
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,216
Coffee, I mean.

24
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,954
Sounds like we both had great days.

25
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:50,066
Marc was in one of those
black moods this morning

26
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:53,210
where he was yelling
at inanimate objects.

27
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:57,122
Toothbrush is in the wrong place,
the coffee's too hot as if...

28
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,332
the entire universe
were conspiring against him.

29
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:03,222
Is there a psychological word
for that?

30
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,275
I think it's called displacement.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,907
- Excuse me!
- Great.

32
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,434
And then I went over to the office
and Judy was in one of her rampages.

33
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,675
I've told you about Judy, right?

34
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,191
You did?

35
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,135
She's the one who acts like my boss

36
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,753
even though
she isn't really my boss.

37
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,180
God, does anybody work
in this place?

38
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,477
She searches for the lynchpin
of my project and then she pulls it.

39
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,587
Is it possible
that she wanna sabotage me?

40
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,262
Is it possible I could just
sit here for a minute and relax?

41
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:35,922
Yes, I'm sorry. You just said you didn't
wanna talk about the deposition,

42
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,710
so I was just trying
to tell you about my day.

43
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,930
Were you? Or do you want me
to just listen to your problems

44
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:44,016
and then interpret
your husband's behavior

45
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,291
- and then your boss's behavior?
- I wasn't trying to do that.

46
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,127
Sorry.

47
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,630
God, we got here fast.

48
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:00,336
Got where?

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,829
Blew right past being infatuated
with each other

50
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:06,454
and went straight
to feeling obligated.

51
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:09,688
Both of us.

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,250
I thought it would be easy to...

53
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,903
To see you and...

54
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,609
I thought it would feel...

55
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:21,492
Good.

56
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,973
Look,
I'll change my appointment at Gina's

57
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,153
so that you don't have to...

58
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:28,901
run into me.

59
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,276
I've already done that.

60
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:40,873


61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,307
Sorry.

62
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,422
Sorry I'm late.

63
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,729
Rosie kept me waiting
for half an hour.

64
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,841
She wanted to talk to me.

65
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,609
Turns out all she wanted
was the keys to the car.

66
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,654
- Did you give her the keys?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,418
- Was she happy?
- I don't think so.

68
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:09,967
I guess I wanted to feel close to her,
wanted to hear about school

69
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:14,256
and whether she has a boyfriend or not,
how she's doing with Kate.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,375
When you were all living together,
did she tell you those things?

71
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,985
She wouldn't have had to tell me
because I would have seen them.

72
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,724
I could overhear them
or Kate would tell me.

73
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,769
So you didn't have conversations
then either?

74
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:35,552
- Do you talk on the phone?
- We try.

75
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,362
But, you know, I can always tell

76
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,225
she's IMing her friends
on the computer.

77
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,969
So what can you do
to feel close to her?

78
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:46,386
I don't know. I don't know...

79
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,488
Do you remember a time
when you were living at home

80
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:52,243
and you felt close to her?

81
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,255
There was one time...

82
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,823
I took her. She broke her arm

83
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,592
and Kate was out of town so...

84
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,431
I got to take Rosie to the hospital.

85
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,941
A lot of sitting...

86
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,802
Emergency room, treatment room...

87
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,395
and we were waiting
for the cast on her arm to dry.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
And it was just...

89
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:16,944
Just me and Rosie.

90
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,449
All afternoon, just me and her.

91
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:20,937
I read to her.

92
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,533
I told her stories.

93
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,178
Played 20 questions and I spy.

94
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:30,592
That was a happy day.

95
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:35,259
Yeah, pretty sad, huh?

96
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,784
I missed so much.

97
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,329
What is it?

98
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,699
Nothing. I was just...

99
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,312
I took...

100
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,267
I took April
to the hospital this week.

101
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,089
- That's your patient who has cancer.
- Yeah.

102
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:02,578
Well, she wasn't...

103
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:06,412
She still wasn't telling anybody,
her friends or her family. She was...

104
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,617
She wasn't getting treatment.

105
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,583
So after our session, I just...

106
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,816
got up, I took my coat
and I just brought her to the hospital.

107
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,290
I know it was wrong.

108
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,399
But you see, the oncologist
had already made a treatment schedule

109
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:21,755
so all she had to do was get there.
So I took her there.

110
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:25,120
I waited with her
till she was finished

111
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,875
and then I took her home.

112
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:32,053
- Did you tell her stories?
- No, we were...

113
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,214
just quiet.

114
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,210
Were you reminded of the day

115
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,964
- you spent with Rosie in the hospital?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:47,641
You know, I'd give the last 10 years
of my life to...

117
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:50,598
To be back in the hospital with Rosie
that afternoon

118
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,623
waiting for her cast to dry.

119
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:01,011
I hate my life.

120
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:05,466
It's broken.

121
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,816
Every day,

122
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,233
it hurts.

123
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:18,396
I'm not getting anything
from my family,

124
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,410
so I try to get it from my patients.
I know it's wrong,

125
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,235
but who else do I have?

126
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,614
Who else do you have
to get what you need from?

127
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:29,868
Nobody.

128
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:33,185
But, okay, I have you.

129
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,261
But you can't

130
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,703
give me what I need.

131
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,500
It's not your job.

132
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,747
- Let's talk about what you need.
- Do you have any water?

133
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,391
You're supposed to have water
for your patients.

134
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:52,032
You're so convinced I won't have
any water for you, you don't see it.

135
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,680
It's sitting right there.

136
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:10,702
So,

137
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,458
can you tell me what you need?

138
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:18,012
I don't need anything special.
Just what...

139
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,970
- What everybody needs.
- Well, you have food.

140
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:25,003
- You have clothing, you have shelter.
- Well, sort of.

141
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:29,176
I have a den with no other bears.
Is that shelter?

142
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,510
You need some other bears?

143
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,397
I miss them.

144
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:45,157
You know what I'm talking about.

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,567
I know you do.

146
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,654
I do.

147
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,232
I miss dinner, you know?

148
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,579
I miss the after-dinner.

149
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,844
What do you do in Brooklyn
between dinner and bedtime?

150
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,753
Sometimes I go to...

151
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,225
the local bar.

152
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,901
They've got
the soccer from England on.

153
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,633
That's good, so...

154
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,276
Then I have... Have a drink.

155
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,276
Well, do you ever meet
any women at the bar?

156
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,771
I see them.

157
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,066
I don't know if they see me.

158
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,648
I'm like that... That lonely guy

159
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,756
in the Edward Hopper painting,
sitting at the bar.

160
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,651
Tell me about the women.

161
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:41,023
Some of them are pretty, you know?

162
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,161
They wear bracelets that jingle.

163
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:46,688
They go outside to smoke.

164
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:53,082
Like my patient Mia.

165
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,382
- I don't think you've mentioned Mia.
- She was a patient 20 years ago.

166
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:02,096
She came back this year.
She's... Well, it's complicated.

167
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,478
She's a lawyer
that works for the firm

168
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,090
that's handling the deposition.
The lawsuit.

169
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:11,215
We had a conversation about the case
then she came back as a patient.

170
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,592
What do you mean, "complicated"?

171
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,417
Complicated emotionally.

172
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:17,462
But...

173
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,440
she's really smart.

174
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,034
And she's...

175
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,593
- She's funny.
- Challenging?

176
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:28,377
I think you could throw that one
in there, yeah.

177
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,321
She's also the kind of woman that,

178
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,674
if she managed to work through
her issues,

179
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,814
she could conceivably...

180
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,420
be right for me.

181
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,132
I'm not in love with her.

182
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,706
But...

183
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,698
Could see myself
with somebody like her.

184
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:01,128
You've cheered up
just talking about her.

185
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:03,161
Well, I am drawn to her, yeah.

186
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,286
But after last year and Laura,

187
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:09,918
I don't think I'm going to fall in love
with another patient for a while.

188
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,436
Is that a relief!

189
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,972
But is she in love with you?
Is that why you mentioned her?

190
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:21,047
No I mentioned her because...

191
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,890
we're talking about things
that I need.

192
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:27,022
I need

193
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,022
a woman.

194
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,898
- For sex?
- Is that what women think that men...

195
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,986
really think that they want them
just for sex?

196
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,530
No, I was just asking you
if you wanted sex.

197
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,839
- Of course I want sex. I'm not dead.
- Okay, well... Then good.

198
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:45,322
That's something you need.
That's our subject... What you need.

199
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:48,255
- So you need sex.
- I need fun. I need release.

200
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,580
I need contact with another human.

201
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,776
- How are things going with Tammy?
- Not Tammy.

202
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:59,468
- Have you been seeing her?
- You know I have.

203
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,186
No, I don't know.
Actually, I don't know.

204
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,224
Well,

205
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:08,961
she and I had coffee.
Then we had drinks. Then...

206
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,154
We had a night at my apartment.

207
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,025
She was supposed
to be traveling away on business.

208
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:18,144
A furtive afternoon,
then it was over.

209
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,989
- You had sex?
- Yes, mother. Like bad children.

210
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,486
We had sex.

211
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,204
- Gee, I...
- You knew it would happen.

212
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,084
You made me promise not to.

213
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,250
I sound like a really tough
and jealous mother.

214
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:35,587
I won't let you have sex.
I make you ask me for water.

215
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,566
You dared me to see her.
You wanted to see

216
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,056
f I could

217
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,376
control myself.

218
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:47,949
I know how hard it is
to resist an old lover.

219
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:54,606
Too bad I didn't have more of them.

220
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:06,956
I'd like to come back to Tammy
in a little while, if that's okay.

221
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,389
I'd like to talk some more
about the bears.

222
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,598
- Have you seen your father?
- I...

223
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:16,086
I don't know how he is. Jesus, I...

224
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:20,267
- Did you go to see him?
- No, I didn't go to see him.

225
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,052
- I meant to, and...
- Why not? Is he better?

226
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,576
I don't know. He may have
taken a turn for the worse.

227
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:30,030
He fell a few times in the hospital
so they moved him into another room.

228
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:33,176
He might have a fever.
I'm getting all this...

229
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:34,868
from Patrick.

230
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,530
I was busy preparing this week
for the deposition.

231
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,885
- That was a treat, let me tell you.
- So you didn't go see your father.

232
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,896
No, I didn't. And if you don't stop
nagging me, I won't.

233
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,821
I'm not nagging you, Paul.

234
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,221
I'm reminding you

235
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,248
that bears do not live forever.

236
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:58,325
And this bear, with whom
you have very many unresolved issues,

237
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,257
- he's dying.
- My brother says he's dying.

238
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,515
That doesn't really mean
that he is dying.

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,778
Would you rather just get a call
that he's dead?

240
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:07,981
Let them call my fucking brother!

241
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:13,432
You may think that you don't care
about this, but you do.

242
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,440
If you didn't care, why would you have
reacted this way when I brought him up?

243
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,123
Paul, please sit down.

244
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:37,959
You say you're not getting what you need
from anyone, but it's worse than that.

245
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:40,116
It's as though you're a baby.

246
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,841
You woke up from a nap

247
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,612
and you started crying, but nobody
is coming in to see what you need.

248
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:49,528
And so you cry louder
and you shake the bars of the crib.

249
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,473
And still nobody comes.

250
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,317
The only problem
is your father is there.

251
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:55,936
He's in the room with you,

252
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:59,981
but your anger at him is so profound
that you can't see him.

253
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,895
My father can't help me now.

254
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,176
No, he probably can't.

255
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,146
But until you acknowledge
his presence in your life,

256
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,272
you're not going to understand
anything about him.

257
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,996
And you'll continue
to shake the crib.

258
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,088
- What? I'm a grown man.
- Of course you are.

259
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,670
But what you haven't been
is a grown son to your father.

260
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,298
And until you do that, part of you
is always gonna stay a baby.

261
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:29,440
Or at best, a teenager waiting
for your mother to die.

262
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,681
- My mother's already dead.
- That's right.

263
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,184
What you're afraid of,
it's already happened.

264
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,880
Neither you nor your dad
could stop it.

265
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,699
And the only thing you can do now is

266
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,868
hope to heal this wound
so then you can move on.

267
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:55,929
We both know

268
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:59,888
what it's like not to be there
at the end.

269
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,374
It's something you don't get over.

270
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:11,748
Ever.

271
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,815


272
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,070
Hi, dad.

273
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,252
I'm back.

274
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,517
Back again.

275
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,096
Sorry I didn't...

276
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,356
I didn't get here...

277
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:14,917
earlier.

278
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,516
What did you used to call me?

279
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:25,645
Rotten little shit.

280
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,138
Are you comfortable?

281
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:41,017
I can get them to up the morphine
if you want.

282
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,506
You've been lying so still all day.

283
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,756
Rosie and the boys are...

284
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,764
very upset about the DNR you signed.

285
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:09,058
They want me to...

286
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:12,598
To override it.

287
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,816
But I said,

288
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:17,902
"He's a doctor.

289
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,973
"He knows what he's doing."

290
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,387
Can you hear me, dad?

291
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:33,581
I'll read you the...

292
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:36,807
sports page.

293
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,506
I see

294
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,529
United are at the top
of their table.

295
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,005
Again.

296
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,980
But you'll be glad to know that...

297
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:56,505
that City are only
two points behind.

298
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:01,658
United are always
at the top of the table.

299
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,303
I guess I forgot
what it would mean to you

300
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:18,851
if I came.

301
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:22,545
No, I...

302
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,336
I knew what it would mean.

303
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,458
I was just too mad at you and...

304
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,938
It was stupid.

305
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,049
I'm sorry, dad.

306
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:53,663
I know it wasn't your fault,

307
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,594
what happened to mom.

308
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,987
You couldn't save her.

309
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,319
Neither could I.

310
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,431
It was just too much for both of us,

311
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:17,854
so I guess you found your way out.

312
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,252
It's like with Kate and me,
you know?

313
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:32,807
Anyway...

314
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,071
"Manchester United continue...

315
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,299
"Their winning form as...

316
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:55,929
"they...

317
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:58,911
"oust...

318
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,493
"league champions..."

319
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,332
Dad.
