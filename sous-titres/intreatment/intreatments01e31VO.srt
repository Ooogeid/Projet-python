1
00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:02,732
Previously on "In Treatment"...

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:06,154
Thanks for seeing me.
I had no one else to talk to.

3
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:08,591
I thought my hour
would be filled already.

4
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:09,382
No.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,333
I'm really glad that you called.

6
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:12,258
Really?

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,906
Losing a patient is such a big deal?

8
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:19,817
Losing you was a big deal.

9
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,255
I think it's time for you to know.

10
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:23,503
Know what?

11
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,616
That I have very deep feelings for you.

12
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:29,768
What are you talking about,
you're going away for a few days?

13
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:31,620
It's for a week, actually.

14
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,522
With him?

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,950
Where are you going?

16
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,126
To rome.

17
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:40,675
Daddy?

18
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,478
Hey.

19
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,646
Ian's being an asshole.

20
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:22,050
What?

21
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:24,965
Your son.

22
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,296
Asshole.

23
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,572
Come on, Rosie.

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,804
He's heading back to school in.
What? Two hours.

25
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,273
Don't you at least
want to know what he did?

26
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:38,038
Can you two not get along
for just one lousy weekend?

27
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,311
Is that not possible?

28
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:41,676
He washed my Ipod.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,312
I had some clothes just sitting on top
of the machine, he just dumped them in

30
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:47,544
with the rest of his
disgusting sports stuff

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,736
and my ipod was in one of my pockets.

32
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:51,318
- Jesus.
- I know.

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,377
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

34
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,807
Your brother's actually doing laundry?

35
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:06,407

38
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,905
You know it's not funny.

39
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,775
He didn't even offer to pay me back.

40
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:23,303
What am I supposed to do?
I can't live without my music.

41
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:27,791
What? Who's that?

42
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:39,999
Hello?

43
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,106
- Just.
- Just one second.

44
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,837
Okay. You were saying?

45
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:49,512
You what I love? That there's nothing
more important in your life

46
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,098
that a text message
doesn't take priority.

47
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:55,185
I think that my generation
might have a slightly

48
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,846
different relationship
with technology than yours does.

49
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,453
Why don't you try reading a book?

50
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,074
I'd actually rather die, but thanks.

51
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:05,145
Come on, dad. Give me a break.
It's a national holiday.

52
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:07,188
Okay.

53
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,517
How can anybody type so fast? I,

54
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,550
- here, let me see.
- No, dad, no.

55
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,072
I just want to see it.

56
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,823
- Dad, no. It's private.
- Okay okay okay, you're right.

57
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:28,916
What's "musm"?

58
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,358
It's m-u-s-m.

59
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,126
It means "miss you so much."

60
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,424
Okay.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,124
So who's

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,002
who's missing you so much?

63
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,345
I. I thought we were
having a conversation.

64
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,843
We really weren't.

65
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,215
So who's missing you so much?

66
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,806
Relax, dad.

67
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,806
- Just a friend.
- Boyfriend?

68
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,674
- A friend that's a boy.
- Okay.

69
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:57,791
So.

70
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,315
So what's his name?

71
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,345
He doesn't have a name.

72
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:04,577
- He doesn't have a name?
- Nope.

73
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:09,010
No, actually he believes that names
are anchors that weigh down the soul.

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,898
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- I'm kidding.

75
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:15,726
His name is Noah.

76
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:17,547
Noah.

77
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,414
Noah.

78
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:20,257
From school?

79
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,264
No.

80
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,288
Where from where?

81
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,870
Just from around, not from school.

82
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:28,638
Okay, we're progressing.
Where else is he not from?

83
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:33,036
- Does it really matter?
- Come on. Indulge me, Rosie, please.

84
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,656
I met him at the center,

85
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,257
and, dad,
he's the most amazing musician.

86
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,852
So he volunteers with you at the center?

87
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:45,836
No,

88
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,983
he met there with shelly a couple
of times.

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,317
And what was he being
treated for, talent?

90
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:52,594
Okay.

91
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:56,609
When he was 16 he had
a fight with his stepdad.

92
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:58,915
So...

93
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,585
So how old is he now?

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,663
He's 18.

95
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:04,747
Anyway,

96
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,730
he threw a rock through one window
of this guy's SUV.

97
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,429
And the asshole had him
arrested to teach him a lesson.

98
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,408
And so the court ordered him to go
to one of the counselors. And,

99
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:18,808
dad, honestly, shelly really helped
him to turn it around. He's like

100
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,995
the gentlest, sweetest guy and

101
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:24,076
he writes these amazing,
beautiful songs.

102
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,666
He just didn't know how to deal
with his feelings before but

103
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,604
now he turns them into lyrics.

104
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,155
18.

105
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,487
So is he.

106
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,523
Is he all done with school?

107
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,483
He works at kinko's,

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,409
okay? I know, really not great,
but I'm trying to get him a new job.

109
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:46,124
In fact, I saw this entry-level
job, in the classifieds today.

110
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,013
What?

111
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,005
You've always been really good at that.

112
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:53,968
Taking people under your wing.

113
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,061
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. It's

114
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,454
what I love about you.

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,635
Sometimes, though,

116
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,580
you can help the most by...

117
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,793
Establishing boundaries.

118
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:10,660
Boundaries?

119
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,250
Well, he might be in

120
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,103
more need of a good friend than say...

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,945
a girlfriend.

122
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,286
Okay.
I get it.

123
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,542
You're worried that
i'm sleeping with him.

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,827
No, I'm not worried that
you're sleeping with him.

125
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:31,347
Should I be?

126
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,829
Worried?
Should you be worried?

127
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,455
- No, you shouldn't be worried.
- Okay, fine. Okay.

128
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,985
The car window thing,
Does he have a record?

129
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,923
Dad, really...

130
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,747
It was years ago.

131
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:52,655
Tell me you never made a
stupid mistake when you were a kid.

132
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:56,233
No, I. I just wanted to be clear,
that's all.

133
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,147
Did, did he serve time
for the car window thing?

134
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,880
Okay, you know what?
I have to go because

135
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,632
Noah is robbing a bank this morning and

136
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,451
I promised him I would drive
the getaway car, so I'll see you.

137
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,588
Wait, Rosie.

138
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,300
No, seriously, dad, I've gotta go.

139
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,860
Rosie,
wait.

140
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:15,186
Please, Rosie, look.
Rosie, I'm sorry.

141
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,984
I just wanted to find
out who the boy is, that's all.

142
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,630
I don't think you do, dad.

143
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,486
You just want the basic facts,
the who, the what and the where.

144
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,477
Like that's all that matters.
You always do this.

145
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,395
You always ask all the wrong questions.

146
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,955
Okay
okay.

147
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,162
So
tell me:

148
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,337
what questions should I be asking?

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,229
"Is he nice to you?"

150
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,715
You know,
"can you talk to him about stuff?"

151
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,549
"Does he make you feel
better about your life?"

152
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,201
I was, I was hoping
we'd get around to that.

153
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:50,818
What, after the interrogation?

154
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,542
I want to be able to talk
to you about stuff, dad,

155
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:57,996
but not like this.

156
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:00,350
I mean, what's next?

157
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,534
I know:

158
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,958
the part where you say you just
don't want me doing something

159
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:05,617
- i'm going to regret later.
- But,

160
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:09,030
I don't talk like that, do i?
You make me sound like I'm some sort of.

161
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,076
Like I'm a grandmother or something.

162
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,549
Well, yeah, you do.

163
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,580
Do i?

164
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,805
If,

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,585
it's like if.

166
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,763
If you knew I was gonna
do something really stupid

167
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,564
with another guy

168
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,158
not Noah, you know,
some other guy, some Jerk...

169
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,977
...i mean, you would want
to stop me from doing it. Is that it?

170
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah, I'd try to help
you look at the risks, yeah.

171
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,418
Yeah.

172
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,038
You know, if.

173
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,587
Like, if I
was gonna

174
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:54,773
take off

175
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:56,272
with him...

176
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:00,414
You know, like

177
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,883
take off to rome.

178
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,533
What do you know about rome?

179
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,715
I called her cell phone.

180
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:27,335
She picked up,

181
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,473
and

182
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,435
I heard in the background
some guy say something like,

183
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:35,278
"where do you want
him to put the tray, babe?"

184
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,880
Then I heard her shushing him,
and

185
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:40,204
then her voice got all echoey,

186
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:43,231
like she went into the bathroom
to finish the conversation.

187
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:45,677
That was that.

188
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,213
He sounded really gross, like

189
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,709
he called her babe.

190
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,342
So much for "i just need a
little break from carpooling," right?

191
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:06,672
I mean, dad, here you are trying
to stop me from making a mistake

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,029
and she is sleeping
with someone that isn't you.

193
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,403
I don't understand why.

194
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,619
- Why is she doing that?
- Look, Rosie

195
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,657
We...

196
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,214
We are trying to work this out

197
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,212
- together.
- Dad, she is screwing another guy.

198
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:23,914
- Did this just happen out of the blue?
- Rosie, look.

199
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,001
It's taken a really long time for
your mother and me to get to this point.

200
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,261
What your mother did or didn't do isn't.

201
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,346
Wait. Are you saying
what she's doing isn't wrong?

202
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,372
No, what I'm saying is that it's.

203
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,754
It's a symptom, of something
else that's going on.

204
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,119
Okay okay.
Whatever it is, can you fix it?

205
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:47,270
- Rosie, I, I am trying to work on it.
- How hard?

206
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,081
Because this whole weekend

207
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,589
with ian home, it's like, "dum-de-dum.
Everything is fine.

208
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,012
Everything is normal."
Ian is completely oblivious.

209
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,112
Well, what do you want me to do,
break your mother's car windows?

210
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,283
Dad, it worked.

211
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:00,380
His stepdad never fucked
with him again that.

212
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,290
Well, it's, it's...

213
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,205
It's a bit extreme, don't you think?

214
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,918
Another man is taking your wife to rome.

215
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,664
Isn't that pretty extreme?

216
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,872
Why is she doing this to us?

217
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,031
Rosie...

218
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:27,331
Just

219
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,158
please tell me that you will fix it,
okay?

220
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,244
Please, tell me you'll fix this.

221
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,091
Hey.

222
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,479
Hey.

223
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:05,164
You know where the good down pillow
on my bed went? I wanted

224
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,977
to take it with me,
and mom said you might know where it is.

1
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,817
I sometimes nap down here.

2
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,288
Are you all set to go?

3
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:26,773
Yeah, pretty much.

4
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:33,231
Would you mind hanging out
for about 15 minutes

5
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:35,712
until your mom and Max get back?

6
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,722
She just called me
from the sporting goods store.

7
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,034
Definitely.

8
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:43,716
I've never heard anyone
so excited about getting to wear a cup.

9
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,287
He'd be really happy...

10
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,723
if you went to see him
in one of his games.

11
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,604
It'd mean a lot to him,

12
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,445
to have his brother come down
and watch him play,

13
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:59,073
even if you had to cut
out of school one friday.

14
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:02,108
You know you sound exactly
like mom, right?

15
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,631
How do you do that, anyway?
Her voice is coming out of your body.

16
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,855
It's like...

17
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:08,499
What you call it?

18
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,326
Ventriloquism.

19
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,531
So why no morning patient?

20
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,084
I thought everyone's always fighting
for those early slots.

21
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:21,589
It changes, you know.
They come, they go.

22
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,236
I've had a few patients

23
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,141
that have left.

24
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,939
Really? Cured?

25
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:29,886
Congrats.

26
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,327
- Is that weird?
- What?

27
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,857
You spend time with people,

28
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,028
helping deal with shit,
and now they're gone.

29
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,447
Is it like me
going off to college again?

30
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,907
"Goodbye,
good luck, don't be a stranger"?

31
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,327
You're forgetting I was the one
who encouraged you to go to college.

32
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,083
- Because of Chloe.
- Not because of.

33
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,236
It's cool.
You were right about her.

34
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:54,624
We weren't meant for each other.

35
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,716
- I couldn't see it.
- I don't remember it had anything...

36
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,180
I don't know if I even loved her.

37
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:06,580
Maybe I did.

38
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,260
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

39
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:13,397
I don't know the answer to that.
Do you ever talk to her?

40
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,503
She called once and left a message.
I left her a message...

41
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,379
Are you seeing anybody at the moment?

42
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,664
Lots of girls right now.

43
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,956
It's just not happening for me.

44
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:36,086
If I'm having a midlife crisis at 20,
I'm not going to live past 40?

45
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:39,139
It's not a midlife crisis, believe me.

46
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:41,209
You would know, wouldn't you?

47
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,931
How many girls are we talking about?

48
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,063
Come on, dad.

49
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,679
I just want a...
Like a...

50
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,499
Approximately, how many?
I'm curious.

51
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,792
I don't know.
Maybe, like...

52
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,075
- Four or five.
- Four or five.

53
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:04,612
You slept with five girls?

54
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,868
Is that just counting this year?

55
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,153
Look, five is nothing, okay?

56
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:15,241
Henry, my roommate,
he told me that if anyone asks,

57
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:16,844
to just round up.

58
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,630
- Apparently five is total loserville.
- Really?

59
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:22,883
The truth is I get bored.

60
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,470
Three months,
that's as long as they ever last.

61
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:31,132
Chloe was nine months,

62
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:33,323
but, I mean...

63
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:37,731
The last two didn't really count
'cause she was away and I was away.

64
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,191
And anyway, I was...

65
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:43,012
I was cheating on her with Maggie.

66
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,857
You remember Maggie,
right, the violin player?

67
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:47,871
You were cheating...

68
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,910
You were cheating on Chloe with Maggie?

69
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:56,333
What can I say, man?
There was a lot of beer involved.

70
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,012
Have you spoken to Rosie lately?

71
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,471
About what?

72
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,855
I think you should know that...

73
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,985
There's been some stuff
going on between...

74
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,593
Between your mother and me.

75
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,065
I thought maybe...

76
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,119
Maybe Rosie had mentioned it.

77
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,787
What kind of stuff?

78
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,408
I don't know.

79
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,994
We've been having problems.

80
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:44,798
You are always having problems.

81
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,134
Really?
You think so?

82
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,349
What else is new?

83
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,306
This stuff is new...

84
00:16:56,369 --> 00:17:00,188
It's something
that we really have to work on.

85
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,133
It sounds big.

86
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,376
You didn't sleep with someone else,
did you?

87
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:12,968
Did mom?

88
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,209
Is mom having an affair?

89
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,273
No, she's not.

90
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,900
It's me, actually.

91
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,097
I met somebody...

92
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:37,412
But we're not having an affair.

93
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:48,937
Do I know her?

94
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,621
I don't think so.

95
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,862
Is she a patient?

96
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,340
She's not.

97
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:12,386
Are you happy or are you miserable
about it? I can't tell.

98
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:14,793
I'm both.

99
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,488
I know it sounds crazy,
but there's a part of me

100
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,051
that wishes

101
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:23,706
I didn't feel the way I do,
and then there's...

102
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,482
Are you in love with her?

103
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,272
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

104
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,788
Are you splitting up?

105
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,154
We're trying to work it out
at the moment.

106
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,535
Maybe it's for the best.

107
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,601
You've been married a long time,
longer than I've been alive.

108
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:02,295
That's pretty good.

109
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:06,148
I'd say you're entitled
to have some fun.

110
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,358
Didn't I say that to you?

111
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,571
- When?
- When you first went to school.

112
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:14,980
About Chloe, I said:

113
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:18,792
"You're 18 years of age
and you're entitled to have some fun."

114
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,883
- Remember that?
- So what?

115
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,040
I told you.
You were probably right.

116
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,998
Why don't you take your own advice?

117
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,868
But that's a completely
different situation.

118
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,839
You were just a kid.
I've been married for over 20 years.

119
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:32,484
It's ridiculous.

120
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:35,115
You don't know
what you're talking about.

121
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,299
I'm sorry.
What do you want me to say?

122
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,222
"You're a total asshole shithead?"

123
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:41,742
Maybe you should say
I'm a total asshole, a shithead,

124
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:43,769
because that's what you're thinking.

125
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,589
Whatever, dad.
This is stupid.

126
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,862
I know when my parents split up...

127
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,132
I had to struggle for a long time.

128
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,609
- In some ways, I'm not even sure...
- Well, I'm not you, dad.

129
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,080
What do you want me to say?

130
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:04,822
"Please don't leave?"

131
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,377
"What are you doing to our family?"

132
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:10,349
Or maybe you just want me to stop you?

133
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,212
I get it, okay?

134
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:14,591
I get why you would want to be
with someone else.

135
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:18,014
I can understand how after 23 years
of marriage you could get tired.

136
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,517
All the nagging
and all those long-suffering...

137
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:25,013
Silent-but-deadly looks
she gives you when you let her down.

138
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:27,168
She does it to Rosie, to me...

139
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:29,665
Everything from some tone
you're using in your voice

140
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:33,582
- to leaving a wet towel on the bed.
- They're issues that you have with her.

141
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,652
They're not necessarily mine.

142
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,989
You think it's so different with you?

143
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:42,080
You don't feel like
she's always disappointed or something?

144
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,898
The woman has got a martyr complex.

145
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:47,368
I don't know how you can deal with it.

146
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:49,188
Martyr?

147
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:53,877
That woman put her career
on hold for 15 years for you.

148
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:57,315
She took you to baseball games,
to guitar lessons.

149
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,177
She was always there for you.

150
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:04,319
She's entitled to some kind of gratitude
along the line, don't you think?

151
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,795
I know.

152
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,700
I didn't mean to...

153
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,239
- Whatever.
- Don't say that word to me.

154
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,560
"Whatever."
God, I hate that word.

155
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:21,741
- It's such a cop-out.
- What do you want me to say?

156
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,580
I want you to have a little
respect for your mother.

157
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,288
Is that too much to ask?

158
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:29,875
I do, but is it so impossible
that I could be genuinely on your side?

159
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:34,044
But you don't have to take sides, Ian.
I'm not asking you to take sides.

160
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,261
Maybe it wasn't fair of me to...

161
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,639
- This is a lot for you to deal with.
- That's a cop-out, okay?

162
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:46,641
You can't have it both ways.

163
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:50,033
I'm old enough to tell,
but I'm too young to understand it?

164
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:53,066
- Don't patronize me.
- I don't mean to patronize you.

165
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:59,813
Something like this
takes a long time to process.

166
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:03,348
I know you have these feelings.
I just want us to be able...

167
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:05,285
To talk about them, you know?

168
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,821
This isn't about me.

169
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:12,500
It's not about what I feel
or why I feel it. It's about you.

170
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,937
What are you gonna do?

171
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:16,846
What do you want?
