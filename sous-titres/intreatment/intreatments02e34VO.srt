1
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:04,920
I came home from work a little late,

2
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:08,291
but I brought dinner, vegetarian,

3
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,480
and she wasn't there.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,913
Once again, Anita,
what you're saying is

5
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:16,432
that you got so caught up
in your work life

6
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:20,521
that Elaine couldn't help
but feel excluded.

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,783
And, Elaine... the moment
that you felt shunted aside,

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,526
you ran back to your family.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,780
Exactly.

10
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:33,531
It feels like you're kind of locked
in this cycle, that's very diff...

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,809
Walter, you're a little early,
and we're still in session.

12
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,494
Oh, jeez.
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,673
- I'll come back.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,424
So... I'm sorry, where were we?

15
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,401
Locked in a cycle.

16
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:19,016
I'm sorry about earlier.

17
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,314
It happens.

18
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,652
I didn't realize how many
fellow patients there were.

19
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,294
You're busy all the time,
aren't you?

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,256
So they...

21
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,440
finally released me
Monday afternoon.

22
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,393
Thank you for your help.

23
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,442
Connie and Natalie picked me up.

24
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,817
We headed straight out for the bay.

25
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,344
I have a few shacks there...

26
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:51,255
that Connie likes to call a compound...
on Shelter Island.

27
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,091
We drove up... a warm day,

28
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:58,382
first southerly wind
of the new year.

29
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,256
It was a beautiful day on Monday.

30
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,949
It's amazing when the cold finally

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,499
breaks.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,860
Everything was so muddy, though.

33
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:12,237
They're a few weeks
behind the city Weatherwise.

34
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,341
The snow had just melted

35
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,873
and the ground was just soaked.

36
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:21,082
I imagine it felt good to be...

37
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:26,228
outside,
especially after the last few weeks.

38
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,539
You could say that.
But...

39
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,110
it didn't?

40
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,140
Well, no, the air felt great.

41
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,615
It's just that...

42
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:41,847
Connie and Natalie...
They were just so...

43
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,291
tentative with me.

44
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:48,252
There's a separate studio
near the main house

45
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,077
that I've used as an office sometimes,
or sometimes just to...

46
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:56,282
for a little peace and quiet
when the kids were younger.

47
00:02:56,407 --> 00:03:00,030
I wanted to go there
but they kept asking me why.

48
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:03,461
Was there anything you needed
to do in your office?

49
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:07,251
Well, take care of some bills.

50
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,926
But mostly I just wanted
to be by myself.

51
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,541
I just wanted
to have a little peace.

52
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,897
That's unusual for you.

53
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,752
Well, Connie's a talker...
She's always been a talker...

54
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,881
and I guess over the years
I've learned how to tune it out.

55
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,068
But this time you didn't.

56
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,916
Something about her pitch...
It just bothered me.

57
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,136
So I went to the office,

58
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,056
 and a few minutes later I looked up

59
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,779
and there's Natalie spying on me
from her bedroom window.

60
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,428
She's still...

61
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,317
She's still on duty.

62
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,317
Yeah, like I was a little boy
that someone had to babysit.

63
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:48,742
You told me once

64
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,305
that when you were
a little boy yourself,

65
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:56,693
you were the one on duty
with your parents.

66
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:58,612
I didn't do that much,

67
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:02,449
just kept an eye on things. Really
it's nothing even worth talking about.

68
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,483
So what did you do
when you saw Natalie

69
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,290
keeping an eye on you?

70
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,450
I glared.

71
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:14,097
Then about minutes later
she brought me some tea

72
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,972
which I hadn't asked for.

73
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,948
And she asked
if she could just sit with me.

74
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,015
- And how was that?
- Brief.

75
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,765
She's my daughter.
I don't go to her with my problems.

76
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,949
You have a good relationship
with her, though.

77
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:30,818
You wrote to her almost every day
when she was in Rwanda.

78
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,515
I imagine she'd worry less
if you talked to her a little bit more

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,451
about what's been going on with you.

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,420
Well, I just didn't feel
like talking.

81
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,744
So I went to the shed

82
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,280
and got this immense pair
of clippers and,

83
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:51,044
I started hacking away at the brush
down by the water,

84
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:54,688
limbing the trees
and paring down the bushes.

85
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,194
God, tore my hands up
something terrible.

86
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,131
All that brush-clearing...

87
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,930
it's kind of like
what we've been doing in here.

88
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,079
You lost me on that one.

89
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:13,957
In the sense that we've been working
on clearing paths,

90
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:17,899
opening up your view
of how you got to where you are.

91
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,611
So when you mentioned
this week's thaw,

92
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,241
it made me think of the way
our last session ended.

93
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,768
You know,

94
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:34,708
between the pills and the therapists
I saw at the hospital,

95
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:37,356
I'm not sure
I even remember that one.

96
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,963
You really don't remember?

97
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:42,943
I find that striking,

98
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,844
given how emotional
a moment that was.

99
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:51,366
Well, I know we talked about
getting me out of the cuckoo's nest.

100
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,904
And I showed you my pot holder.

101
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,429
Then I got angry
about you bringing up Connie's rehab.

102
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,657
I meant after that, when we talked
about the two Walters...

103
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:07,259
the one who you knew
and the one you didn't know.

104
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,581
That's right.

105
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,329
You seemed quite moved

106
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:16,954
when we talked about reconnecting
to the lost Walter.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,950
Well, I might have teared up a bit,

108
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,083
but I was tired and there's been

109
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,259
a lot of stress.

110
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,147
I understand that,

111
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:31,255
but my memory is
that you didn't just tear up.

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
You were actually sobbing.

113
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,213
What is it, Walter?

114
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,373
Where did you go?

115
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,109
I just remembered
a dream I had this week.

116
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,877
Mr. Donaldson called me in
for a meeting.

117
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,792
Only it wasn't in an office.

118
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:53,389
It was...

119
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,294
It was in an old garage.

120
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:00,078
I went in,

121
00:07:01,156 --> 00:07:02,337
we shook hands

122
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,888
and he told me they'd traced

123
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:12,081
the source of the contamination and that
it wasn't anything we'd done wrong.

124
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,772
Some nut job deliberately tampering
with the product

125
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,605
and then putting it back on shelf.

126
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,204
Go on.

127
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,860
I felt vindicated.
And then,

128
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,736
the old man did something
he never did...

129
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,289
he apologized.

130
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,140
He said that letting go of me

131
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:41,658
was the biggest mistake
he'd ever made,

132
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:44,334
that he wanted me to take
my old job back.

133
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,910
You'd be Walter Barnett,
C.E.O. again.

134
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,483
I tried to answer,

135
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:53,470
but I couldn't speak.

136
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,679
I opened my mouth,

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,695
but I couldn't get any words out.

138
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,744
I woke up in a sweat.

139
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:12,573
I kept trying to dive back into
the dream, but I couldn't get there.

140
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,243
You wanted to finish
the conversation?

141
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,882
What did you make of that dream?

142
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,708
Well, I guess I still want to think
the whole mess never happened.

143
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,669
I want my old life back.

144
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:27,845
Do you?

145
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:31,980
Because you said
you couldn't get any words out.

146
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,881
Is it possible
that you weren't sure if you

147
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:36,597
wanted to go back?

148
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,770
Probably just bargaining.

149
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:44,534
Could be.

150
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,821
Or perhaps now
with a little distance

151
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,932
you have a greater sense
of the enormous strain

152
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,862
you've been under for so long.

153
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:55,074
- It never used to feel like a strain.
- That's right.

154
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,618
I think you genuinely
didn't feel it.

155
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,723
You've become exceptionally adept
at overriding your feelings.

156
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:05,048
That's what we were beginning
to talk about last week.

157
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:06,586
Do you remember?

158
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:09,793
Right,

159
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:15,300
how the weak Walter
couldn't handle the stress.

160
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,585
Did you think about that

161
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,057
Walter this week?

162
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:22,634
The lost boy?

163
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,425
No, not really.

164
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,896
- You did make me think about my father.
- Your father?

165
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,533
How did I do that?

166
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,345
Just before, when I came early
and I walked in on you,

167
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:46,376
you just had a look on your face
that reminded me of him.

168
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,986
In what way?

169
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,311
After Tommy...

170
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,112
after the accident,

171
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:57,545
he couldn't sleep nights anymore.

172
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,638
Insomnia?

173
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:03,810
Yeah, and he started
to work the graveyard shift.

174
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,680
And

175
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:09,101
when he'd come home
from the factory,

176
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,025
he didn't want to wake up my mother,

177
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,226
so he'd go to sleep on the couch.

178
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,417
And I'd come downstairs and I'd want
to talk to him, you know, about...

179
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,664
I don't know...

180
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,637
the day before,
what happened at school.

181
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,553
And there was that look.

182
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,726
Can you describe it?

183
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:38,470
"How the hell do I get rid of you

184
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,263
"without making you feel bad?"

185
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,476
Come on, listen, it's okay.
Really, you were busy.

186
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,773
If it had been my session and somebody
walked in, I would have been pissed off.

187
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:55,297
Still, you felt rejected,
even abandoned.

188
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:57,944
I was early.

189
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,389
Right, the same way you were
too early for your dad.

190
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,081
Work comes first.

191
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:04,443
That's life.

192
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,516
My mother didn't see
much of him either.

193
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,825
She got used to it.

194
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:16,843
She'd come home from the hospital...
she was a nurse...

195
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,545
and I'd fix her an old-fashioned.

196
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,258
We'd eat.

197
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:27,607
I'd fix her another.

198
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:32,446
I had to get the cherry
and the orange wedge just right.

199
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,150
Then she'd go in her bedroom.

200
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,462
I was always nervous that

201
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:42,803
she'd fall asleep
while she was smoking in bed,

202
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:45,968
so I'd check in on her

203
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:47,996
and make sure
all the ashtrays were out.

204
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:50,958
That's a lot of responsibility
for a young boy.

205
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,353
Listen, they were...

206
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:55,794
you can't blame her...

207
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,340
either of them.

208
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:02,468
- Their lives were ruined.
- There's any need to blame them

209
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:06,236
in order to understand
your loneliness.

210
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,685
They were too grief-stricken
to take care of me.

211
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,623
I had to put away
my childish things.

1
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:18,215
Actually, I think the verse is,
"When I became a man,

2
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,478
"I put away childish things".

3
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,847
You were still a boy.

4
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,291
A lot of kids had it worse.

5
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:27,955
Do you remember any good times?

6
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,951
Did the three of you
spend time together?

7
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,430
Not so much.

8
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:36,446
On weekends
he was always tinkering with his car.

9
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:38,879
That thing was a real money pit.

10
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,561
- Did you have a garage?
- Yeah.

11
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,413
I used to peek in on him.

12
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:46,930
- And he didn't let you in?
- After a while I figured out

13
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,617
how to stand on a garbage can
and look through the window.

14
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,024
It turned out...

15
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,773
most of the time
he wasn't working on the car.

16
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:57,217
He was...

17
00:12:57,636 --> 00:13:00,235
staring at a picture of Tommy
on the wall.

18
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,985
One time he saw me.

19
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,827
It was terrible.

20
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,379
You wanted to connect with him,
but you felt

21
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,524
he didn't want you there.
Is that it?

22
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,020
The boys used to spy on me
the same way...

23
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,788
when I worked on weekends.

24
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,395
They'd want to play or...

25
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,091
go swimming, and...

26
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:29,723
I always had work to do.

27
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,725
I probably gave them the same look.

28
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:36,828
Maybe that's why we don't have
anything to talk about now.

29
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,775
You know, it's not too late for you
to get to know them

30
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:41,896
and for them to get to know you.

31
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,402
I don't think they'd be interested.

32
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,008
Maybe they feel,

33
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,408
I don't know, intimidated by you.

34
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,536
Repairing those relationships is
something that we can work on in here.

35
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,795
I said I don't think
they're interested.

36
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:57,088
You were interested
in talking to your father...

37
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,002
about what you saw in that garage.

38
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,492
In fact,
you're still dreaming about it.

39
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,406
We never discussed it.

40
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,757
A few years later we moved...

41
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,024
to the next coal town over.

42
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:12,632
My mother didn't want to go, but...

43
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:14,896
my father thought it would be better

44
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,611
to start over again
in a new place without...

45
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,842
Tommy's presence
hovering over everything.

46
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,621
And how did you feel about it?

47
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,159
They didn't ask me.

48
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,113
It must be hard, as a child,

49
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,057
to know what your feelings are
when you're not asked about them.

50
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,731
For awhile there after we moved...

51
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:36,445
I'd run away...

52
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,531
back to the old home.

53
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,463
I'd get on my bike and...

54
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,535
I'd just go there, I don't know...

55
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:48,260
to check
if Tommy was waiting for us.

56
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,949
Go figure out a child.

57
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,433
What would you do when you visited?

58
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:58,223
Nothing.

59
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,770
I'd just sit there for hours,
waiting.

60
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,713
He never came back, of course.

61
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,245
I wonder if maybe...

62
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,376
Maybe you didn't go back...

63
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:15,706
just to look for Tommy. Maybe there was
someone else you were looking for.

64
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:17,955
Who?

65
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,727
The boy that you were
before Tommy was killed.

66
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe the old house was...

67
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,717
the only place
you could let yourself

68
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,535
feel your losses and...

69
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:34,674
find intimacy with something
that was gone, with your...

70
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,197
with your dead brother and...

71
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:41,022
your memories.

72
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,333
There was nothing there
for you, Walter.

73
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,236
And there was nothing
in the new home except...

74
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,834
duty, loneliness.

75
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,120
Don't worry.

76
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,194
I'm not gonna cry.

77
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,334
I know how uncomfortable
that made you.

78
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,449
Is that how you thought I reacted,
Walter, to last week?

79
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:13,678
Come on.

80
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:15,930
You don't need to pretend.

81
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,264
I know I've been
a basket case in here.

82
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:22,478
I know how that disgusted you.

83
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,856
Why would I feel like that?

84
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,210
I'm a grown man.

85
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,174
I'm not a six-year-old.

86
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,082
And... men don't cry.

87
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,335
Maybe they do now.
But...

88
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:39,787
when I became a man, they didn't.

89
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:42,832
- Was that what your father taught you?
- He didn't have to.

90
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:45,776
Where I grew up,
a boy wouldn't be caught dead crying.

91
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,478
How about when Tommy died?

92
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:48,953
Did you cry then?

93
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:50,819
I was upset.

94
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,039
I knew it was my fault.

95
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,200
Maybe I started to tremble.

96
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,975
Maybe I started to cry.

97
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,333
Because the old man, I remember,
picked me up and...

98
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,201
shook me... hard.

99
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,009
"Don't you dare", he said",

100
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:15,811
"in front of your mother.

101
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:17,607
"Don't...

102
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:18,882
"you...

103
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,059
"ever."

104
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:38,364
Do you think
that's when you started to maybe...

105
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,555
shut down a little?

106
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,628
You mean...

107
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,019
that other Walter of yours?

108
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:50,376
Maybe it's not really fair
to call him "the other Walter".

109
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,530
The truth is, he's a part of you.

110
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,263
A part of you that was split off
and neglected...

111
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,020
for a very long time.

112
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,303
I was doing fine without him

113
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,128
all this time, wasn't I?

114
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:06,749
You did more than fine.

115
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,169
You accomplished great things
in your life, Walter.

116
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,647
So, why is this split a bad thing?

117
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,818
It can be hard to live your life,

118
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,760
to be genuinely fulfilled,

119
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,713
when a part of your...

120
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,964
your true self is locked away.

121
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,939
I think that what happened
was that the other part of you

122
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,026
the part that took responsibility,

123
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,232
that shouldered all these burdens...

124
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:34,152
that's the part that got rewarded...

125
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,577
early and often.

126
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:40,400
The more you took on,
the more praise you got.

127
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:44,370
Your dad must have been relieved
not to have to worry about his wife.

128
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
And your mom, I can imagine...

129
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,208
how important you felt just knowing

130
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,419
that you were her lifeline.

131
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:55,693
She was tricky.

132
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,015
We were always walking on eggshells.

133
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,776
My father and I didn't even tell her
I was going to Vietnam until...

134
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,683
two or three days before I left.

135
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,539
And you were...

136
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,454
a hero in Vietnam as well.

137
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,052
James Donaldson was the hero.

138
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,241
I just did my part.

139
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,635
But I'm sure
you were a natural leader.

140
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,615
And... in the chaos of the war

141
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,705
people must have looked to you.

142
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,270
And they were right to do so.
You'd been trained

143
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:29,582
from an early age to step up.

144
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:33,630
- It helped me survive.
- It's always helped you survive.

145
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,323
Even thrive.

146
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,882
It's how you rose
to the top of your field.

147
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,430
Except that...

148
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,195
it wasn't really your field, was it?

149
00:19:44,928 --> 00:19:46,278
What do you mean?

150
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:47,983
It was James's.

151
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:51,763
Have you ever wondered
why you spent your working life

152
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:54,064
building
the Donaldsons' family business?

153
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,171
Was it just another rescue
that you took on, like...

154
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,844
the way you nursed your mother...

155
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:02,969
or...

156
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:04,792
or your wife?

157
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,220
See, that's the paradox...

158
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,242
You've been rewarded for so long
for your...

159
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,237
grace under fire that...

160
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,052
you just don't think
you're of any value to anybody

161
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,740
unless you're in that role.

162
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,584
Now that you've launched them,
your boys...

163
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,560
don't want to get to know you.
Natalie was done with you.

164
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,568
I don't want to see you at the door.

165
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,842
The only way to feel not rejected...

166
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,270
is to carry the weight...

167
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:37,687
and to keep carrying it,
even though your mind and your body

168
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,953
are screaming at you to stop.

169
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:55,136
I've stopped now, haven't I?

170
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:59,067
Walter Barnett, the C.E.O...

171
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:00,709
he's gone.

172
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,676
He came to you
with a sleeping problem...

173
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:09,371
and within weeks
his life was in shambles.

174
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,559
I think we both understand

175
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:16,071
that by the time you came to see me
there was no way to prevent the crash.

176
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:18,661
You knew I was headed for this?

177
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,454
The Walter you knew...

178
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:21,904
the hero...

179
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:25,155
he staved it off
as long as humanly possible.

180
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:28,195
If he could have
held it together this time...

181
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:29,910
he would have.

182
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:35,474
Well, it doesn't matter either way,
does it?

183
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:39,683
- We both know what you're telling me.
- What is that?

184
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:41,897
I missed it.

185
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,667
What did you miss?

186
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,154
My life.

187
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,685
Isn't that what you're saying?

188
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,019
I'm 68 years old...

189
00:21:57,603 --> 00:22:00,830
and I haven't lived
one moment of my life

190
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,025
for myself.

191
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,530
What the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

192
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:16,206
Are you going to say anything?

193
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,894
Just that I think that now
is the time

194
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:24,157
to stop taking care
of everybody else, Walter,

195
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:25,966
and start reconnecting...

196
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:27,687
to yourself.

197
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:32,117
Was this your plan all along?

198
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,554
To break me down
so that I'd become dependent on you?

199
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,709
This would not have been
my conscious choice for you

200
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,522
any more than it was yours.

201
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:45,609
But the defenses that held you together
your whole life...

202
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,701
They just finally wore out.

203
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,110
You have two choices now.

204
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,241
We can try to wrap you back up.

205
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,073
Work on simple behavioral changes.

206
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:01,439
And you and I can both talk
to your psychopharmacologist...

207
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:05,592
get you back to managing things
the way you always have.

208
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,069
It's a valid approach.

209
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,145
Or?

210
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,262
There's a more challenging route.

211
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,536
If we can keep going,

212
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:20,124
doing the work that we do,
even at this stage of your life...

213
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,021
I know that you can achieve

214
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,272
a new way of being...

215
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,769
with Connie,
with Natalie and the boys,

216
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:30,544
but most importantly...

217
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:31,869
with yourself.

218
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:36,176
And we can keep exploring
those parts of yourself

219
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,668
that we've just begun to discover.

220
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,857
- I'm an old dog, Paul.
- 70 isn't old.

221
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:47,938
It will take work...

222
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:49,549
genuine...

223
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:52,111
introspection.

224
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,637
And you'll have to come more often.

225
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:58,196
You really want to spend
a couple more hours a week with...

226
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:01,978
- an old man?
- I wouldn't offer it

227
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,896
if I didn't think
it was worth your time...

228
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:06,299
and mine.

229
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:08,610
Why is it worth your time?

230
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:13,031
Because you've rescued
so many others...

231
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:17,066
I want to be there
when you go back and...

232
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:19,094
rescue yourself.

233
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,426
Fine.

234
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,178
Fine.

235
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,005
When do we start?
