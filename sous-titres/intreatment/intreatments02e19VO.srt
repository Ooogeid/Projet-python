1
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:49,443
Hello?

2
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,804
Hi, Patrick.

3
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,927
Can you slow...
slow down for a minute?

4
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,901
What do you mean he f...

5
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,454
He fell?

6
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,009
But I didn't even know
Dad was in the hospital.

7
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,557
Okay okay, fine fine.
I'll...

8
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,242
I'll pay more attention to him.
Wait!

9
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:20,764
When did they transfer him?

10
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:25,823
But how long after he had the fever?

11
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:30,520
It's a fucking nursing home.
They should know that!

12
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,930
Okay, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,455
I'll be there on saturday.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,046


15
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,615
Synchro: So., mpm

16
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,048
You should be happy about one thing:

17
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,967
they took away my phone
and my blackberry.

18
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,788
I hated those things.

19
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:39,711
In my day an exec
never typed a note.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,610
Never took one.

21
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:43,386
Never carried anything.

22
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,327
I guess that makes me a dinosaur.

23
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:50,826
I'm glad you came.

24
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,938
I hope you don't feel
any pressure today.

25
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:59,063
I finally have the time to talk to you,
but it's too late for you to help.

26
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,770
How are you handling it?

27
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,959
I'm wonderful, Paul.

28
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,062
Aces.

29
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:11,358
I know you said
that you're past the point where...

30
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,475
where talking could be of help.

31
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,160
But long as you're here,
why don't we...

32
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:20,356
why don't we try?

33
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:24,724
Well, what is there to say?

34
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,564
I've lost my job, my name.

35
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,858
I can't leave the house.

36
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:32,868
There's a pack of reporters
on the street waiting

37
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:36,682
for me to come out so they can stick
microphones and cameras in my face.

38
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,165
So coming here today meant

39
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,478
you had to run a... run a gauntlet.

40
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:41,961
I can handle that.

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,606
I tell them the truth.

42
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,427
I did everything I was supposed to,

43
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:48,342
that I took the pages
straight from the playbook.

44
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,414
- What playbook is that?
- Johnson & Johnson,

45
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,514
the tylenol scandal.

46
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:56,190
Seven dead from product tampering

47
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:00,315
and the companywasn't concerned,
but they pulled every bottle nationwide.

48
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,600
It's still the gold standard
for crisis management.

49
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:07,111
At the first sign of trouble,
you do everything you can

50
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,168
to inform and protect the public
and protect your name long term.

51
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,446
So what do you think went wrong?

52
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:18,348
Here, Connie let me read
this one article...

53
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,917
in the journal.

54
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,983
They came flat out
and said I did everything right.

55
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,708
"Played by the rules."

56
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,847
The only thing is
the world's changed a lot since 1982.

57
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:36,807
It's more predatory.

58
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,403
The minute we assumed responsibility

59
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,275
the bloggers, the press,

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,750
the class-action lawyers
came after us.

61
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,867
Then the short-sellers hammered
the stock down and that's when

62
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,589
the parasites in my own company
saw this

63
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:54,469
as some fucking opportunity
for themselves.

64
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,746
And then the Donaldsons capitulated.

65
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,941
"A perfect storm" they called it.

66
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:04,710
When you read an article like this,
how does it make you feel?

67
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,548
Like an old man

68
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,627
who stayed too long in the ring.

69
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:17,526
You feel like a... like a boxer

70
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:19,725
taken a beating.

71
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:23,874
I dropped my guard, Paul.

72
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,215
I deserve everything I've gotten.

73
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:35,947
Are you eating?

74
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,076
Yeah, I eat when I have to.

75
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,484
Shredded wheat, chicken soup...

76
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,706
that's what I had today, okay?

77
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:46,627
- How about sleep, are you getting any?
- Are you a therapist or a pediatrician?

78
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,777
Yeah, I sleep.
The pills help.

79
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,935
Has your doctor written
any other prescriptions for you?

80
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,251
Well, under Natalie's name, yeah.

81
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,722
Any day now there'll be
a headline in <i>The Post</i>:

82
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,963
"Baby-killer C.E.O.
binges out on pills."

83
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:04,362
Baby killer?

84
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,835
Is that how you feel
that you're being depicted?

85
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,815
Well,

86
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,606
I don't know actually.

87
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:13,280
My wife isn't even letting me watch TV
except for old movies.

88
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,795
I'm in a bunker
with a remote control

89
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,038
and pills by my bedside.

90
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:23,895
What pills do you take?

91
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:26,313
It's called...

92
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,938
Kloni... klopi...
something like that.

93
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,880
Whatever it is, it helps me sleep.

94
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,882
And how many are you taking?

95
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,442
Well, it depends.

96
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,796
- Maybe three or four.
- A day?

97
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,888
Is that the dosage that Dr. Wells
has prescribed?

98
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,698
That's what I need to sleep.

99
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,726
But you have to let him know
how many you're taking.

100
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:48,939
I mean, you're not somebody
who's had a lot of exposure to pills,

101
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,733
so you may not have the tolerance
that other people do.

102
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,738
What's gonna happen, Paul?
I fall asleep and I don't wake up?

103
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,240
Is that what you want?

104
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,533
Take a pill, fall asleep,
not wake up?

105
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,408
No no, I want to wake up.

106
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:07,185
I want to find that the last two months
were just a nightmare,

107
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,734
that the pipeline didn't get
contaminated,

108
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,545
that the press didn't vilify me,

109
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,172
that the people underneath me
didn't lie to me.

110
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,545
That's what I'd like.

111
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,177
I can understand
that you might feel that way,

112
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:22,388
but since you know that
that's not the case,

113
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,766
have you found yourself

114
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,591
thinking that not waking up

115
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,856
might be a solution?

116
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:32,302
What do...

117
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,178
Come on, Paul!

118
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,467
I don't quit.
You know me better than that.

119
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,212
And I would never leave a mess like that
for my wife to clean up.

120
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:48,098
As it is, she can't even look at me
without bursting into tears.

121
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,978
That must be something
that neither of you are used to.

122
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,288
Well, the tears,
I've seen plenty of those.

123
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,825
Usually right before I cave in

124
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:59,343
and give her the second baby
or the third baby

125
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,720
or whatever else she's ever wanted.

126
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,273
But what is new is
this look of pity.

127
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,188
It's just god-awful.

128
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,603
I told her never to look at me
like that again.

129
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:11,319
You sure it's pity?

130
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,572
I mean, she's your wife.

131
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:18,826
You've been married for 44 years.
She loves you.

132
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,316
- When she spoke to me on the phone...
- That's another thing!

133
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,159
I told her never to do that again.

134
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,948
She felt that these were
extraordinary circumstances.

135
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,514
What? I got fired.
What's the big deal?

136
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,376
The whole country's getting fried...
fired... fired!

137
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:36,122
But all of a sudden

138
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,144
I get an orchestrated show
of compassion,

139
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,009
teams of people dropping in.

140
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,263
It's like an episode
of <i>This is your life</i>.

141
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,051
So it hasn't been a comfort for you

142
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,140
to know how much
you've touched these people?

143
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,054
It's been embarrassing.

144
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:51,196
I told her yesterday, "that's it.

145
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,215
"I don't want to see anyone else.
Tell them I'm sick."

146
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:58,068
I had to promise her I'd see you
before she'd go along with me.

147
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,284
So basically you used me
as a bargaining chip.

148
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,559
I don't mind.

149
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,684
Long as it got you here.

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,770
And now what?
What are you gonna tell me, Paul?

151
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,057
That life is beautiful?

152
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,932
That nothing happened?

153
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,747
That it could all be a blessing?

154
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:20,564
I don't think nothing happened.

155
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,489
On the contrary, I imagine

156
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,864
it might feel like you're going through
some kind of

157
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:27,680
crucible.

158
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:31,351
People give me all these nostrums,
this self-help garbage.

159
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,978
Not what you need to hear
right now, I'm sure.

160
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,226
An old friend of mine,

161
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,127
Dean Larue,

162
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:43,288
came by the apartment
all the way from Rochester.

163
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:46,052
I don't know what Connie told him
to get him there.

164
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,868
But he's my age.

165
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:51,694
We were R.O.T.C. buddies.

166
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,232
Two years ago

167
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:57,816
they fired him from a company
that he had built

168
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,207
from the ground up.

169
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,917
So he's somebody up here

170
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,621
who's gone through
what you're going through.

171
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:11,182
He tells me he's found a hobby.
He's started taking pictures...

172
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,508
landscapes,

173
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,770
old factories and fishing boats.

174
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,774
He prints them up and makes them into
books and gives them to his friends.

175
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:21,674
He gave me one...

176
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,137
a photographic essay of Centralia,
Pennsylvania.

177
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:28,162
Is that the coal town
with the underground fire?

178
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm sure you wondered
why he gave you that.

179
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,999
No... well, what do I care?

180
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:38,431
I don't care about that.

181
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:42,171
The point is, does he realize
how stupid he looks?

182
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,526
So you don't buy it?

183
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:46,426
If there's one thing
I can't stand it's people

184
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,174
who fool themselves,

185
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,265
lead fake lives,
become fake human beings.

186
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,611
Not always a choice, Walter,

187
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,509
so much as the way
the twig was bent.

188
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,315
I want to shake Dean and say,

189
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:04,122
"Don't you know everybody is laughing
at you, you old fool?"

190
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:07,389
I threw the book out
as soon as he left.

191
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:08,946
What the hell am I gonna do

192
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:12,870
with a picture of some smoldering meadow
where a town used to be?

193
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,622
What if he was really proud
of the book?

194
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:18,873
Do you think it might have given him
a different sense of accomplishment,

195
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:20,184
of achievement?

196
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:22,817
Or brought out a side of him
that maybe he...

197
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,775
You're smart.
You know better than that.

198
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,784
If that company called him back
right now and said,

199
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:32,357
"We made a mistake, Dean,
we'd like to have you back",

200
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:34,606
he'd go running in a heartbeat.

201
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,331
No, the truth is that...

202
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,546
he's outlived his usefulness.

203
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:42,629
I've got a couple of years left
to take photos

204
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,404
and lick stamps, but...

205
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:46,859
let's face it...

206
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:50,471
death is just the...
official acknowledgment.

207
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,126
The show's over.

208
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,050
So you don't want your family
to show concern.

209
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,659
You don't want friends or a therapist
to offer you support or...

210
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,859
nostrums.

211
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,483
Your life's over,

212
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,971
like Dean's.

213
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:11,656
Is that what you really think?

214
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,381
Why don't you tell me?

215
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:14,788
Better yet,

216
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,609
why don't you tell me
what you think of me?

217
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:21,395
The first time I walked in here,
what did you think I was?

218
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,538
I'll tell you what you thought.
You thought I was a piece of shit

219
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,319
who didn't care if his products
were killing infants.

220
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,338
You thought I was greedy,

221
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,283
insensitive, a son of a bitch.

222
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:36,705
You feel that I've judged you
from the beginning?

223
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,793
I told you I can't stand

224
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,040
fake fucking human beings.

225
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,960
Don't patronize me,
and don't lie to me.

226
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,432
I've had enough of that this week.
Just tell me the truth.

227
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,118
The truth is I'm angry.

228
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:54,488
I'm surprised at that reaction,
but I am. I'm angry

229
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:58,102
at what they did to you
and I'm angry at the way they did it.

230
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,427
I think you're a man of integrity.

231
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,938
I'm not going through
what you're going through, obviously.

232
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,706
But I can understand
your sense of anger,

233
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,252
your sense of...

234
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:09,844
betrayal.

235
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,937
I teach... or taught...

236
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,090
classes in business schools...

237
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,160
on corporate responsibility.

238
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,087
I guess those days are over.

239
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:31,457
They'd bring me in
as a guest lecturer and...

240
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,947
I'd look at all those kids
who'd all gone to biz school

241
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:36,675
for all the wrong reasons,

242
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,306
and I knew I had... an hour

243
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,066
to maybe reach one or two of them.

244
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:47,578
To try to get them to understand that
a company's name,

245
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,843
a product's reputation
is all that you have.

246
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,267
That... if you lose your name,

247
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,750
you've lost everything.

248
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,581
Do you feel
that you've lost that now?

249
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,428
I didn't lose it.
It was taken from me.

250
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,644
You mean by the Donaldsons?

251
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:12,179
You haven't mentioned
their part in all this.

252
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,601
What can you say?

253
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,411
Mr. Donaldson's old world, like me.

254
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:18,396
He got scared.

255
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,140
- I don't blame him.
- But isn't loyalty...

256
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,558
part of being... old world?

257
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,134
It's not just the old man now.

258
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,785
He still has his wits
about him, but...

259
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,441
the daughters are involved and
the grandkids and the fucking lawyers

260
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,359
and punks like Jace.

261
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,116
- You know, they put him in charge.
- But you said

262
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:43,084
that the family, I think,
has a majority interest in the company.

263
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:44,913
That's right.

264
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,628
So, it wasn't just the press
or the parasites

265
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,203
who forced you out.

266
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,336
The Donaldsons
had to go along with it.

267
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:53,964
They had...

268
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:56,301
credit market's drying up.

269
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,978
The stock was in the tank, well,
everybody's stock is in the tank now,

270
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,353
but this was...

271
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,806
carnage.

272
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,426
The minute they gave me up,

273
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,579
the stock gained it all back.

274
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,436
Have you spoken to them lately?

275
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:13,861
The old man, he could barely
look at me at the meeting.

276
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,349
I went over to him after...

277
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,689
afterwards and...

278
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:23,323
I thanked him for the opportunities
he'd given me and...

279
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,072
He said, "Good luck, Walter".

280
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,349
That was it.

281
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,501
How long have you worked
for this man?

282
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,213
35 years.

283
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,633
You know, when I came in,

284
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:39,448
his son James was...

285
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,940
He was reckless.

286
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,821
The old man asked me
to keep an eye on him.

287
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,596
James was his only son.

288
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,391
And a few years later,
James went West to...

289
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:54,147
look for some new markets.

290
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,726
And one night,
he drove his car into a tree.

291
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:02,723
Right away the sharks
started circling the company.

292
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,082
The old man was barely hanging on.

293
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,037
But I told him not to give in.

294
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:08,854
I promised him that

295
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,328
we would build something special,

296
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,503
and we did.

297
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:13,919
We did.

298
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:17,339
Are you saying you turned him into one
of the wealthiest men in the country?

299
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,676
I did okay too.

300
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,350
And after 35 years

301
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:23,745
all he has to say is good luck?

302
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,797
He said one other thing...

303
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,922
before he wished me good luck.

304
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,311
He said,
"They tell me Natalie's in Rwanda.

305
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,565
"What the hell
is she doing over there?"

306
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:39,236
- What do you think he meant by that?
- I think that was his way of saying...

307
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,394
that I'd dug my own grave.

308
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,764
How do you mean?

309
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:45,221
You said yourself last week:
in the middle of a crisis

310
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:48,954
I ignored my responsibility
to the Donaldsons and to the company.

311
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:52,319
I also remember saying
that there were two crises,

312
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,626
one with your daughter and one here.

313
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:58,687
And we talked about the way you
experienced your daughter's distance,

314
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,907
how that anxiety
might have colored your judgment.

315
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:03,789
So you're agreeing with me.

316
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,053
I misread

317
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,521
both situations.

318
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,003
My judgment was bad.

319
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,047
Perhaps your going away did contribute
to this situation exploding.

320
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,936
We know on some level that your body
had been trying to tell you

321
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,911
something was very wrong...

322
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:21,056
your insomnia to the panic attacks.

323
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:23,864
By going to Natalie when you did,

324
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,742
you were trying
to bring this crisis to a head.

325
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,226
It was already past that point.

326
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,637
Jace was a cancer
I should have cut out long ago.

327
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,754
I trusted the wrong people,

328
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,710
the wrong labs.

329
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,029
Under my watch...

330
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:50,764
this poison got into the pipeline
and onto the shelves.

331
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,643
But you issued a recall
the minute you found out.

332
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:56,875
The papers...

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
the ones
my wife won't let me read...

334
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,295
they're all saying kids died,

335
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,362
and it was my fault.

336
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,072
Is that what you think?

337
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,741
Natalie thinks so too.

338
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,422
When she emailed Connie you could tell
she thought I was some sort of...

339
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:13,997
corporate criminal.

340
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:18,960
You said I think you're guilty, the
papers too. Now you're saying Natalie...

341
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,080
It's not paranoia,
if that's where you're going.

342
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,374
Part of you believes
you did everything that you could

343
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,415
properly,

344
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,940
and part of you is punishing yourself
for not doing more.

345
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:40,927
I'm okay during the day, most days.

346
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,505
But at night I wake up
in a cold sweat, wondering...

347
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,130
how I missed it, what I could have done,
what I should have done,

348
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:51,963
how much hurt I've caused...

349
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,328
to families, to the company.

350
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,027
God, if you could see
the old man's face.

351
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,836
- He looked stricken.
- That must have made you feel terrible,

352
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,713
to disappoint the old man.

353
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,100
You seem to talk about him
as if he's...

354
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:15,613
- a father that you've let down.
- It's my fault, Paul,

355
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:16,808
not his.

356
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,571
I see you struggling

357
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,985
to understand what happened

358
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,045
and why it happened.

359
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,243
But as hard as you're working
to deal with this guilt,

360
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:28,018
this sense of betrayal,

361
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:32,420
it seems to me that you're working
just as hard to avoid looking at him

362
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:33,993
and his role in this.

363
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,212
Why do you keep harping on him?

364
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,122
He did the best he could.

365
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:40,741
You said
that when his son James died,

366
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:43,017
old Donaldson was ready to just...

367
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,213
give it all up.
But you wouldn't let him.

368
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,777
You took on the family business
for 35 years.

369
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,635
Their son was dead.

370
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,952
And did you feel guilty about that?

371
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,267
- I'd promised to keep an eye on him.
- And so for what,

372
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,998
some penance you took
on this enormous responsibility?

373
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,274
The same way that you took
responsibility for your parents' lives

374
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,193
- after your brother Tommy died?
- I had no choice.

375
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,153
Walter, you were just a boy.

376
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,739
- I had no choice.
- You were six years old.

377
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,175
You shouldn't have been
taking care of your parents.

378
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,035
They should have been
taking care of you.

379
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,688
It was my fault!

380
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,656
That's why I had no choice,
it was my fault.

381
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,535
What was your fault?

382
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,388
A hot summer night,

383
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,391
before air conditioning,

384
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,381
the air was dead still.

385
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:52,743
Tommy was just going to sneak out
to the quarry lake to cool off.

386
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,291
He came to my room...

387
00:20:58,332 --> 00:20:59,382
and said...

388
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:03,458
tonight was the night he was going
to jump off the highest cliff.

389
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:08,103
He was asking me, really,
more than telling me.

390
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:12,218
And what did you tell him?

391
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,501
I said, "Tommy, you can do it.

392
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,267
"You can do it, Tommy."

393
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,928
And I told him in the morning I'd...

394
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:25,105
brag about him to everyone.

395
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,823
Then he kissed me good night.

396
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:36,194
And he never made it back.

397
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,629
And you felt responsible
for your brother's death.

398
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:40,754
I was.

399
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:42,116
I am.

400
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,581
Walter, your brother

401
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,751
jumped.
You didn't push him off the edge.

402
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,007
He chose to jump.

403
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:50,766
And in a flash

404
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,705
a family was destroyed.

405
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,813
That's it.

406
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,743
It happens.

407
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,766
There are lots of them...

408
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,560
destroyed families.

409
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,333
Are you okay, Walter?

410
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:20,339
I have to go.

411
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,620
I know this week your sense of guilt
about all this,

412
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,598
it must feel like an avalanche.
I know you must...

413
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:27,222
feel overwhelmed,

414
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:30,169
but it's urgent
that we talk about this feeling

415
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,382
in here.

416
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:33,562
My wife's waiting for me outside.

417
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,837
Can we arrange something
for tomorrow morning?

418
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:39,430
Sometimes if I'm up all night,
I need the mornings to sleep.

419
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,612
What about Monday afternoon?

420
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm fine, fella.

421
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,210
Do you mind
if I call your doctor and...

422
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,517
- talk about those prescriptions?
- I said I'm fine.

423
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,420
I'll see you next week.

424
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,752
My wife's waiting for me outside.
