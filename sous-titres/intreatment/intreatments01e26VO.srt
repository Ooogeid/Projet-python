Previously on
"In Treatment"

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,164
David was my first.

3
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:08,080
Don't look at me like that.
I wasn't the victim.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,617
-I got him to his bed.
-I was a 40-year-old man, for Christ's sake.

5
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:14,137
Your father had no idea
what was going on?

6
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:17,568
-He was asleep in the next room.
-I think it's important

7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,142
that you talk to your father about this,

8
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,881
while it's still possible.

9
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:26,975
You know that this thing
with me and Alex is over.

10
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:29,670
I ended it.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,985
I can't continue, Paul.

12
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,848
Every minute here is tearing me apart.

13
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,107
Daddy?

14
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,403
In Treatment- Season 1
Episode 26- "Laura- Week Six"

15
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:58,917
Yes, hello?

16
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,310
No, I'm uh...
I'm on my way somewhere.

17
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,408
No, not to the ward.

18
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,322
No, absolutely not.

19
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,766
Because his temperature is slightly up,

20
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,103
and I don't want it to get out of hand.

21
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,778
Just... just tell them to take care
of him until I get there.

22
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:19,515
Just keep an eye on his fever.

23
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,121
In about 90 minutes.

24
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,879
Look, it's... it's important.
Can I count on you?

25
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,304
Okay.

26
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,490
Okay, bye.

27
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,080
-Hi.
-Hi.

28
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,197
Here, for you.

29
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,342
-What is it?
-There's a...

30
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,096
a farmer's market across
the street from the hospital.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,475
Maple syrup.

32
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,134
Vermont's finest.

33
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:49,358
-Thanks.
-Sure.

34
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,790
Your kids eat pancakes, right?

35
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,001
Yeah.

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,181
Come on in.

37
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,550
Thanks.

38
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,804
Thanks for seeing me.

39
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:12,063
When I was dialing your number
this morning, I thought,

40
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:15,078
"Shit! It's not even 8 o'clock. 
I probably woke everybody up."

41
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,485
Please, this place is a circus by 8 o'clock.

42
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,539
I had no one else to talk to.

43
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,757
I even called Andrew, but you know,
he never called me back.

44
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,750
Anyway, thanks.

45
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,745
I thought my hour would be filled already.

46
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,581
Your hour isn't filled.
How is your dad?

47
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,851
-Is he still in I.C.U.?
-Yes.

48
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:45,526
His... temperature went up.
They wanted to move him to the ward, but...

49
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,879
I want him kept there as long as possible,

50
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,600
you know, where he's got
one-on-one nursing care.

51
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,843
He looks so small, you know?

52
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,585
So tiny.

53
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:07,871
He looks lost in that huge bed.

54
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,493
Could barely see his body under the sheets.

55
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:21,122
Looks like E.T.

56
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:27,372
You think I'd be more resistent, huh?

57
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:31,614
I've already seen people shrink
to little... gremlins.

58
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,519
But not my father.

59
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,340
I took your advice.

60
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,906
I told him about David.

61
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,145
When I left here last week,
I called him on the way home.

62
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:55,495
He was so happy to hear from me.

63
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:59,163
It's been a month
since we'd seen each other.

64
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:03,238
So I went around to his house
and he ordered takeout.

65
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,863
My dad never orders takeout.

66
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:10,058
He doesn't know how. I swear he ordered
half the menu. I'm not exaggerating.

67
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:17,833
Well, he means well,
but I don't think he knows what I like.

68
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,794
Do you know what your kids like?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,753
You mean apart from pancakes?

70
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,261
When I told him about David,
he said:

71
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,453
"I thought so."

72
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,259
We were sitting in the kitchen,
surrounded by takeout containers,

73
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,961
about 20 of them and...

74
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,874
he was just pushing his eggroll
from one side of the plate to the other,

75
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:47,227
dipping it in the hot mustard
without looking up at me

76
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,187
and said "I thought so".

77
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:59,866
Did you tell him the full story?

78
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,472
Yeah, well...

79
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,370
More or less. I told him
I slept with David at our house and...

80
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,491
he asked me if it continued later.

81
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,191
I said: "No, it was just...

82
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,303
a passing thing,"

83
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:15,184
that nothing happened to me,
and he didn't need to worry,

84
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,922
that it came up in therapy,

85
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,692
and I should talk to him about it.

86
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,832
It doesn't sound to me that your father was...

87
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,256
Doesn't sound like he was surprised.

88
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,807
How do you feel about that?

89
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,240
That he might have known all along
and that...

90
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,518
that he didn't do anything about it?

91
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:39,553
I didn't take it that way.

92
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:43,193
Look, Paul, the pain, you know
the shock of it was so bad

93
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:46,664
he immediately had to act
as if he'd known all along.

94
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,922
As if to deflect the shock of it to...

95
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,767
Old habits die hard, huh?

96
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,404
You can take the girl out of therapy,

97
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,371
but you can't take a therapy
out of the conversation.

98
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:15,559
It's funny.

99
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:17,774
Things are so different.

100
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,845
It feels like I haven't been here for a year.

101
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,154
Are those new shoes?

102
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,862
These? No.
I found them in the closet,

103
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:35,443
forgot about them. I used to
wear them before...

104
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,408
before I was married.

105
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:39,142
- They're nice.
- You think so?

106
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,929
I'm really glad that you called.

107
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,936
Really?

108
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,948
What, did you miss me?

109
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,103
Yes, I did.

110
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,418
Even after that dramatic exit last week?

111
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:07,918
Yeah.

112
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:10,836
Really?

113
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,307
Yeah.

114
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,365
I guess the prospect of...

115
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,482
of not seeing you again kind of...

116
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,125
kind of scared me.

117
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,391
Losing a patient is such a big deal?

118
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,463
Losing you is a big deal.

119
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,280
Does it bother you that I said that?

120
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,527
No, I just don't understand
why you're saying it. 

121
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,327
I mean why now?

122
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,286
- Is this a trick?
- Why...

123
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,289
Why would I be tricking you?

124
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:54,568
I just don't understand why you're saying it.
To be honest,

125
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,379
I... I don't really believe you.

126
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:58,219
It's the truth, Laura.

127
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,092
I'm trying to say how I feel about you.

128
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,887
I think you deserve to know.
I think it's...

129
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:08,732
I think it's time for you to know.

130
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,752
Know what?

131
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,490
That I have very deep feelings for you.

132
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,634
I... I keep thinking about you all the time.

133
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,429
I really miss you sometimes, it's...

134
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,690
No.

135
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,776
Not sometimes.

136
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,091
Often.

137
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:29,973
I miss you... often.

138
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,708
Okay, so what now?

139
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:54,067
I mean if I say:
"Yes," then what? It will happen?

140
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,904
What? This isn't therapy,
so it's okay all of the sudden?

141
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:01,095
You know what? This whole thing
doesn't seem right. It...

142
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,339
- it feels weird.
- What? That I...

143
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,311
That I said that I had feelings for you?

144
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,901
You're testing me.
Are you testing me, Paul?

145
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,360
No.

146
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,407
Okay.

147
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:30,387
Okay, good.

148
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:43,921
You know we never...
sat on the same couch before.

149
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,199
So what now?

150
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,848
I... I don't know, Paul.

151
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,290
Can I...

152
00:11:03,348 --> 00:11:07,344
I mean, listen to us. It's not supposed
to be like this. Everything is so polite.

153
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:12,165
With Andrew, two hours after I met him
I was... I was in his bed.

154
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,052
Lucky it was dark. If I'd seen
the condition of his apartment,

155
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,223
I probably wouldn't have slept with him.

156
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,649
No, actually I would have.

157
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,519
'Cause that's how it is with me, I...

158
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,402
- act on impulse.
- You think this is acting on impulse?

159
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,640
This isn't impulsive.

160
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:30,669
This is the longest foreplay
I've ever experienced.

161
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,892
A year of just getting to know you.

162
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,575
What do you know about me, Laura?

163
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,380
Specific, you mean?

164
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:51,730
I know some things.

165
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,015
I know you have children.

166
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:57,636
Yes, I do. Max, Rosie,
Ian, yeah. What else?

167
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:12,641
Once or twice you haven't worn
your wedding ring.

168
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,684
I noticed that.

169
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,197
It's because...

170
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,264
sometimes when I'm washing
the dishes, the...

171
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,764
the dishwash gets under the band and...

172
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,916
irritates the skin.

173
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,330
What are you thinking about now?

174
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,767
Just you.

175
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,798
I remember once when I was...
when I was 14.

176
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:08,149
I... had a crush.

177
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,965
No, actually...

178
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,676
I didn't have a crush, I...

179
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,473
I fell in love with...

180
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,760
my... my biology teacher.

181
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:20,252
- Oh yeah? Well.
- She must have been about 33, 34.

182
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:22,310
And...

183
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:25,029
I used to write these big, long poems,

184
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,994
and I would put them in my homework.

185
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,264
And I remember...

186
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,011
saying to her one day:
"I'm not interested in girls my age.

187
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:38,706
They don't get me, they don't understand me,
they don't know who the real me is."

188
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,324
What I really wanted was...

189
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,066
was her.

190
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,661
So, one day...

191
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:53,497
I found myself alone in the lab,
a science lab, with her.

192
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,750
And I heard myself say... that...

193
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,078
that I just had to kiss her.

194
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:04,141
And what happened?

195
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,155
She turned off the lights,

196
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:12,284
and she came right up to me,

197
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,515
and she was facing me 
in complete darkness.

198
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,986
And... I remember the sound
of her breathing,

199
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,337
and the smell of her perfume.

200
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:27,325
It was like I...
I was drunk or something.

201
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:29,786
She looked me straight in the eye

202
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,966
and she said really quietly:

203
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,304
"Go on."

204
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:36,910
"Do it."

205
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,394
"Just do it."

206
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,260
You know what happened?

207
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,620
What?

208
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,139
I got the hell out of there.
Ran away.

209
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:53,018
Did you ever think what would have
happened if you hadn't run,

210
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,635
if you had kissed her?

211
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,318
I used to think about that all the time.

212
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:01,620
But now when I think of it, I...

213
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:03,905
I thank her for it. I do.

214
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,261
- For what? For scaring you?
- No.

215
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,072
I guess she showed me that what I felt
or that what I thought I felt,

216
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:15,380
even though it was real
and genuine to me, was...

217
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,770
was really just a fantasy.

218
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,652
It wasn't real.

219
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,810
And... that she had
the compassion to let me go.

220
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,485
back to my... to my future.

221
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,151
David didn't turn out the lights.

222
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,576
He said he wanted to look at me.

223
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,903
That my body was amazing,
that I was beautiful.

224
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:58,270
He went on and on about that.

225
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:04,233
I can't believe how naive I was.

226
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:09,184
What I thought was gonna happen
when I walked into his room, I...

227
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:14,589
God, isn't it crazy, all the things you imagined
what sex would be when you're young?

228
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,882
Well, I had very romantic thoughts.

229
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:24,096
I imagined an angle would come
and when we're in bed she'd touch me,

230
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,635
and erase my former life.

231
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,903
He told me how proud he was of me.

232
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:41,796
When I was in California,
he told me I was ripe for this,

233
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:43,741
that I was a woman.

234
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:46,226
He said that I was ready.

235
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,838
And he started whispering to me,
he said:

236
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,290
he never had such a hard-on in his life,

237
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,940
and he said, "See what you did to me?"

238
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,054
And he undressed,

239
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,924
and stood in the middle of the room,
showing me what I did to him.

240
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,935
Then he undressed me.

241
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,800
He was very professional.

242
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:18,318
I remember he... spit...

243
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,799
into his hands...

244
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,990
in order to wet his...

245
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,847
It was disgusting.

246
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:31,352
I think that was the minute that I...

247
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:35,430
I wanted to run away, but it was too late
because he said that I was ready.

248
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,540
Listen to me, Laura.

249
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,627
It's really important that you understand...

250
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,287
that none of this was your fault.

251
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,759
You were 16 years of age.

252
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:51,177
You didn't.... How could you have known
was what's gonna happen?

253
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,975
How could you know what to expect?

254
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,020
I wanted him to hold me, Paul.

255
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,859
to take me away from the house,

256
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,596
to take me away
from the death of that house.

257
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,802
I just wanted him to help me get away.

258
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,819
I never wanted him to fuck me.

259
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,596
Oh, Laura.

260
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:31,526
Fuck, I ruined it.

261
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:32,902
- No.
- You don't want me anymore.

262
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:35,803
No, no... It's not true, Laura.
Please.

263
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,291
Listen to me.

264
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,578
I really care about you.

265
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,210
I really care about
what happens to you.

266
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,074
And...

267
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:49,539
I will not do anything in the world
to hurt you, I promise.

268
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,101
Look...

269
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,178
I think the real damage that David did,

270
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,087
he destroyed your ability
to communicate with men

271
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,213
- from a non-sexual place...
- No, it's not true.

272
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,665
- Yes, I think it is true.
- You make me sound like I'm so terrible, Paul.

273
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,763
There is nothing terrible
about you to me, Laura.

274
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,459
You know, if you don't wanna fuck me?

275
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,111
Don't fuck me. I'm a big girl.

276
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,599
I can take it. Go on.
Say it to my face. Go on!

277
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,635
Laura, listen to me.

278
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:13,203
I think you feel that
if I don't sleep with you,

279
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,327
I'm not gonna be interested in you,

280
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,244
in who you are.

281
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,420
But I am not willing to betray you.

282
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,428
I am not going to disappoint you.

283
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,232
I will not be another David.

284
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,423
There's something going on
between us, Paul.

285
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:30,001
Something more, and you know it.

286
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,590
You're just too fucking afraid.

287
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,992
It's my brother.

288
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,160
Hi, Olie.

289
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:43,900
Great.

290
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:47,717
You know what, tell them not to move him
until I get there. I'll be right there, okay?

291
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,314
Okay. Bye.

292
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,574
Well, his temperature's normal.

293
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:55,344
Good.

294
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,926
That's good news.

295
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,114
It'll be okay.

296
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:07,262
I promise you.

297
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,056
It will be okay.

298
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:24,519
Okay.

299
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,898
Hi.
