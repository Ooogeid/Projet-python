<i>Previously on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:12,765
- She went to finalize the abortion.
- I don't know if I want another baby.

3
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:16,811
I don't think the issue is as clear-cut
as both of you...

4
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:21,174
You're talking to two people who spent
5 years in fertility treatments.

5
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:25,268
It seems to me that
you're not really talking about a child.

6
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:28,740
You're really talking about
your inability to accept each other.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,627
You haven't helped us to decide
whether to abort or not,

8
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,062
but you've done a great job getting us
to fight. Yes to the pregnancy or no?

9
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:37,831
To have an abortion or not?
Just fucking say it already.

10
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:41,251
- You want me to give you an answer now?
- Yes. I want a yes or a no.

11
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,226
I think you should have an abortion.

12
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:46,586
Really?

13
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:19,746
- Smoking?
- No.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,950
- Not even a drag?
- Maybe just a puff.

15
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,721
What about our baby?

16
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,254
I didn't inhale.

17
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,564
What are you doing?

18
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,877
I've got to admit,
I love your smoky smell.

19
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:43,996
- Really?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,278
I have a pain.

21
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:51,633
Just here.

22
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:54,555
- She'll get over it.
- She?

23
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,273
Yeah. Lillie.

24
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,287
- Thomas.
- Katherine.

25
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,083
- Andrew.
- Alicia.

26
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,680
Sloan, for my grandfather.

27
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,033
Don't start with family names.

28
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:08,175
Remember my grandfather's name?

29
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,545
Otis... Otis...

30
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,228
Behave. You're on probation.

31
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:14,916
It's gone.

32
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:16,821
It is?

33
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,020
The problem is, now I've got it.

34
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:21,952
- What?
- Pain.

35
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,532
- Your stomach hurts?
- I don't know. Feel for yourself.

36
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:29,778
It's not exactly my stomach, but...

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,094
- What then?
- Somewhere like...

38
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,383
Maybe it's in my pancreas
or something, maybe.

39
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:37,953
- Near your spleen?
- Yeah, it's in that general vicinity.

Jake and Amy Week two (1x09)

44
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,529
I didn't keep the appointment
with Dr. Kornreich.

45
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,938
I decided to wait.

46
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,622
I mean, you said last time that

47
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,187
I decided without thinking it over.

48
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,373
So now I'm thinking it over.

49
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,268
And when we left here last time,

50
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:18,021
Jake didn't say a word about it.
Even later, we didn't talk about it.

51
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:22,206
And that night we went to bed for the
first time in a long without fighting.

52
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,608
We were watching tv and I said,

53
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,688
"I don't think this pregnancy's
worth fighting over."

54
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,558
And I said,
"I think I might want this baby."

55
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,776
Then I said,
"think about it some more

56
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:36,829
"because I pity a child born
to a mother who doesn't want him."

57
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:40,194
And I said, "I just said
I think I might want this baby."

58
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,564
And that was it.

59
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,552
And we laughed.

60
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:50,325
And I woke up the next morning...
It was late, actually.

61
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,127
He'd left for work already
and taken Lenny to school.

62
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,697
And I just decided
to take the day off.

63
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,497
I was just lying in bed thinking
and I was enjoying myself,

64
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:00,034
enjoying my thoughts.

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,770
I thought about giving birth.

66
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:06,170
And for the first time I wondered
whether it was a boy or a girl.

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,840
And I just somehow knew
that it's a girl.

68
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:12,464
and I could imagine Lenny
pushing some kid

69
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,448
who tried to take her bike.
It was sweet.

70
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,118
Violence turns her on.

71
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,636
And then I got dressed and the waistband
in my pants was a little tight,

72
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:23,725
which I didn't love,
but I didn't get upset about it.

73
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,721
So
you haven't seen Dr. Kornreich since?

74
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,649
And I assume you've discussed this?

75
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,078
Well, not really.
Jake asked what happened at the doctor's

76
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:39,907
I said I didn't go and that was it.
We didn't talk about it anymore.

77
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,577
I mean, we have time,

78
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,825
you know?

79
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,480
So what do you think?

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,750
Well, first of all I'm
really glad that you came back.

81
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,276
You both seem

82
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,988
much more relaxed than...

83
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,735
than last week.

84
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:01,016
and since a week has gone by,

85
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,663
you actually
have less time to decide.

86
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:07,311
But that doesn't... It doesn't seem
to be bothering either of you.

87
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,713
Less time? What...
Are you pressuring me now?

88
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,615
I mean, we have at least two weeks.

89
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:17,703
I don't know, I...

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,990
I think we've said everything
that we need to say.

91
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:27,426
I think what Amy's trying to say is
this is gonna be our last session.

92
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,128
No, not necessarily. I... I just think

93
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,677
- we shouldn't talk about it so much.
- He'll get over it, believe me.

94
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,547
No, but let's hear Paul out.

95
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,218
- But we talked about it.
- But let's just hear what he says.

96
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,788
Yes, but we decided.

97
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:46,764
I think it's too soon.

98
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,405
Told you.

99
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,749
Both of you now have more
than one opinion about the pregnancy.

100
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:55,219
It's not so black and white as it...
as it was last week.

101
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:57,524
And...

102
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,684
I think that's got a little to do with

103
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,393
you both coming here.

104
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,653
What do you think, Amy?

105
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,484
Maybe.

106
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,433
I mean...

107
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:26,179
I still want my career.
I don't want to give it up.

108
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,373
I just feel like I might be able

109
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,743
to manage everything. I don't know.

110
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:36,257
I'm young enough and the
world's full of working mothers.

111
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:39,165
And maybe I'll just take
on less clients. I just...

112
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:42,033
I don't know if I'd ever
be able to get pregnant again.

113
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:45,448
And I really don't want to
do something that I'd regret later.

114
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,080
I think I can handle it,
especially when I think

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,750
of what a younger brother or
sister² would do for Lenny. I just...

116
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,932
I'm not saying it's final,
I just want to think about it

117
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:58,318
and I will make a decision soon.
I just... I don't want...

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Sorry.

119
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:12,472
Amy?

120
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:21,955
Baby?

121
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,179
What's happening? Let me in.

122
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:28,457
Amy, let me in.

123
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:56,696
Kate!

124
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:00,595
Kate!

125
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,330
Kate, can you come here a minute?

126
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:08,576
What is it?

127
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:12,079
How do I get this bloodstain
out of the sofa?

128
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,964
- What do you mean blood?
- Blood.

129
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,443
How do I get it out?

130
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:19,813
What happened?

131
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,799
The couple who were here...
She's... She's pregnant.

132
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,923
What, she had a miscarriage?

133
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,293
No, she was... She was sitting here,

134
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,974
She got this pain.
She went to the bathroom, she came back.

135
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,769
- And there was this blood.
- Are you okay?

136
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,339
- You look a little pale.
- No, I'm... I'm fine, I'm just...

137
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,320
It's blood, it's...

138
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:48,447
For God's sakes, Paul, don't.

139
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:52,479
- I'll take care of it. Don't touch it.
- But I don't want it to dry okay?

140
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,049
I know. just don't touch it, all right?

141
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:01,384
Fuck.

142
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:04,653
This shampoo gets out bloodstains, but,

143
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,885
- How do you know these things?
- You've forgotten how much I know.

144
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,508
I'm going to try
hydrogen peroxide first.

145
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,732
Hydrogen peroxide.

146
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,433
That poor woman. What week was she in?

147
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,730
I don't know... Seventh, eighth.

148
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,401
Did anything happen?
Did anything happen during the session?

149
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:33,945
A fairly normal session.

150
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,179
They've been trying
to get pregnant forever.

151
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,523
Are you sure
that's not gonna leave a stain?

152
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:43,493
Well...

153
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,891
When's your next session?
It's gonna have to dry.

154
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:48,965
Everyone who comes in is gonna say

155
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:50,476
"What is it?"

156
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,058
You have no idea how sensitive
some of my patients can be.

157
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,640
Right, your patients are sensitive.
Not you.

158
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,170
You're right.

159
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,192
You're right.

160
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,779
Okay, well...

161
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,760
We'll have to see after it dries.

162
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:15,178
- I'll clean up here for you meanwhile.
- No no, it's okay. Leave it.

163
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,248
It's fine.

164
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,337
Thanks for doing that anyway.

165
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:25,279
Well, maybe now you'll agree
to replace this filthy old couch.

166
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,711
You know, you could make this
room a bit more pleasant in general.

167
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,675
Why are you so concerned
about this room? I thought you hated it.

168
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:37,393
I don't hate this room.

169
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,847
I'm just still jealous of it.

170
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:48,973
Come on.

171
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,478
I'll make you some tea
before the next session.

172
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:57,913
I suppose not everything that happens
in here is as dramatic as this, right?

173
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,147
No, it isn't, Kate. It's just an office.

174
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,017
Really. Come on, let's go.

175
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,498
You know, Paul...

176
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,737
You call me down here
for all your little emergencies,

177
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,545
for your toilet and your sofa,

178
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,714
but you can't wait to get me
out of here.

179
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,483
Kate, do me a favor.
What do you want from me?

180
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:15,712
Nothing.

181
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,850
I'm tired.

182
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,395
I'm tired. That's all.

183
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,865
It's not big deal.

184
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,399
I...

185
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,927
I went back to see Gina.

186
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:45,491
Gina? When?

187
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:48,712
Last week.

188
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,342
I just felt I needed somebody
to talk to, you know?

189
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,323
- What, to Gina?
- Yes, Gina.

190
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:04,809
I don't understand.
I thought you despised that woman.

191
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,428
Aren't you exaggerating
just a little bit?

192
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:08,698
"That woman"?

193
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:11,566
Me? With all the crap
she wrote about you. I thought...

194
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,986
Well, I had to talk to somebody.
I can't talk to you about...

195
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:17,203
No, of course you can't talk to me.

196
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,034
You know what I mean, Kate.

197
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:21,130
It's easier for me to talk to Gina

198
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,830
than to somebody who...
Who doesn't know me.

199
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,280
Gina. Jesus.

200
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:31,026
Why is Gina such a threat to you, Kate?
Tell me.

201
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:36,393
Don't talk to me like one
of your patients. You want me out? Fine.

202
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,551
But don't talk to me
in that condescending

203
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,966
psychological tone
because I can't bear it.

204
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:43,264
Jesus Christ.
Can I do anything right?

205
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,767
What? I'm sorry,
is that supposed to be me?

206
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,069
Because you're the one
walking around this house

207
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:51,109
like me and the kids are invisible!

208
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,604
Because I don't want Max

209
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:55,652
to go to a school for
"gifted" children means I don't see him?

210
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:59,050
No, Paul, you're not seeing
what he's going through.

211
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:01,784
And what is he going through, Kate?

212
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,830
Don't you hear the way he talks
about school?

213
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,289
Don't you see that he has no friends?

214
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,357
No! You're off in your own little world,

215
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:12,688
but I'm the one left
dealing with this house.

216
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,573
And if I've raised
your children till now...

217
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,873
Sorry, what do you mean,
"raised my children"?

218
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:21,230
What's that supposed to mean,
you raised my children?

219
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,365
Don't you see that he's home all day?

220
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,066
That he never goes to friends',

221
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:32,021
that no one ever comes to see him?
Doesn't that worry you?

222
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,899
So how did you decide
²he's not having a good time at school?

223
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,582
I didn't decide.

224
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:38,704
He told me.

225
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,324
And you, you're so confident...

226
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,587
you're so definite telling me, you know,

227
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,430
that he's not going to a class
for gifted children.

228
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,100
What the hell do you know about
what he needs or doesn't need?

229
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:53,017
Paul, he has no friends!

230
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:54,607
None!

231
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,258
He says he's only willing
to hang out with Malcolm.

232
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,350
Malcolm.

233
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:05,689
I asked him
if he goes outside during recess

234
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,807
and he said that he hardly does

235
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,129
except maybe with Malcolm,
his one barely friend.

236
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,327
I asked him, "all right,

237
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,608
so, sweetheart, how do you feel
about school in general?"

238
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,740
And he says he hates school.

239
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,503
Every kid hates school.

240
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:22,573
He's bored with school, Paul.

241
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,158
He's bored.

242
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:27,628
- He hates his teachers.
- All his teachers he's hates?

243
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,422
Yes, Paul, all of his teachers.

244
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,649
They're all stupid to him and

245
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,117
he's bored with all of them
and he hates all of them.

246
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:40,631
And then after he tells me this,

247
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,594
You know what the most important thing
he had to tell me was?

248
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:45,728
What?

249
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,692
That I shouldn't tell you.

250
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,847
Your son has no friends,
he hates his school,

251
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:55,122
but the most important thing
is that I not tell you.

252
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:59,514
Because in your own warped way, Paul,
you've made him understand that

253
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,741
it's not as important as what happens
here. Just like you've done to me.

254
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,966
You know...

255
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,614
For a long time,
you've not made me feel like

256
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:22,050
I was the most important thing to you.

257
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,521
Not me, not the kids,
not compared to what happens in here.

258
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,154
Is that it?

259
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,495
Tell me when did you become
such an asshole.

260
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:53,921
I sit in this house
and I say "Goddamn it.

261
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,241
"What is this punishment?"

262
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,544
You are so impatient with the kids

263
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,003
And it pisses me off,

264
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,581
it pisses me off that you are
energetic and alive in this room

265
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:09,887
and you're an old man at home.
You're an old, anemic man, Paul!

266
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,016
You're always tired!

267
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,108
You're always tired for us.

268
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:18,822
Okay.

269
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:25,994
Maybe I haven't noticed.

270
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:32,061
Maybe things have gotten worse for Max.

271
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,624
I'll talk to him.

272
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:41,324
Okay?

273
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,684
So how's Rosie?

274
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,763
How's she? How's she doing?

275
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,716
Rosie, yeah, she's fine, why?

276
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:06,960
I was just thinking about that thing
at the youth center.

277
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,240
You really think Rosie can help

278
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,659
recovering drug addicts?

279
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,580
I mean...

280
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,209
We don't even know what she does there.
We don't even know

281
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,860
who she sees there.

282
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,965
Why don't you ask her?

283
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,467
You could try talking to her.
She would...

284
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,837
She would like that. She needs that.

285
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,723
Are you saying now
that I don't talk to Rosie?

286
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,478
First, I don't talk to Max.

287
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,285
Now I don't talk to Rosie.
Is that what you're saying?

288
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,073
I walk around the house
like a blind man?

289
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,359
Do I disgust you?

290
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,780
'cause that's what it feels like.
It feels like I disgust you.

291
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,266
Don't be ridiculous,
of course you don't.

292
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,236
What are you talking about?

293
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,653
Why don't we ever talk? We never talk.

294
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:01,416
I don't understand that.

295
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:13,712
Okay.

296
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,123
We've got a few minutes, let's...

297
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:18,792
Let's talk.

298
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:31,456
Okay.

299
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,419
I'm seeing someone.

300
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:42,664
- What do you mean, you're...
- What do you think I mean?

301
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:54,888
Who is he?

302
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,973
Someone I'm seeing.

303
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:58,988
Who the fuck is he?!

304
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:03,973
- What difference does it make?
- Don't tell me that! 

305
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,607
Who the fuck is he?

306
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,431
- He's divorced, he has a son.
- Divorced.

307
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,176
- He's 40 years old.
- 40!

308
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,321
At least you can't say
he's an anemic old man.

309
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:17,023
- He runs an employment agency.
- Manages an employment agency.

310
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:20,036
- Where do you meet this guy?
- What difference does it make?

311
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:23,123
Don't keep saying to me
what difference does it make!

312
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:25,151
Where the fuck do you meet him?!

313
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,061
At his place.

314
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,712
At his place.
What do you do at his place?

315
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:30,843
Come on.

316
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,632
No, come on. I want to know.

317
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,967
You meet him at his place
and what do you do?

318
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:37,037
Use your imagination, Paul.

319
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,305
Tell me yourself, you fucking liar!

320
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:42,975
You've been lying to me, what is it?
Two months, six months, a year?

321
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,467
I want to know what you do
when you meet this guy.

322
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,762
- Stop it, just...
- I want to understand

323
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,360
what it is that you do
when you go to his place.

324
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,791
I want detail! I don't wanna be left
sitting alone to imagine what it's like.

325
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,785
- You fucking tell me.
- What do you want to hear?

326
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:01,352
He leaves work, I meet at his place.

327
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,237
And it doesn't take us
more than an hour.

328
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,291
Is that what you wanted to hear?

329
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,744
He moves differently.

330
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:15,553
He does everything differently

331
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,793
and that is what made it so exciting.

332
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,463
Is that what you want to hear?

333
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,982
And that I can't stop thinking
about the way he looks at me

334
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,066
or the way he touches me.

335
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,960
He knows I'm married
and that's what turns him on.

336
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,922
Is that what you wanted to hear?
You know what amazes me?

337
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,492
What really gets me

338
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,182
is that you can go to this guy's place

339
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,504
and then you can come home here all

340
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,016
wet and flushed and excited and horny

341
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,761
and you can sit down with our son
and do his homework.

342
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,421
How does that make you feel?

343
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,491
I just want to know
how does that make you feel?

344
00:21:05,102 --> 00:21:06,952
It makes me feel like shit.

345
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,318
And a week later I go back²
and I do it all over again.

346
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,780
I hope that's not too complicated
for you to understand, Paul.

347
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:25,543
Happens every day, doesn't it?

348
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,407
You know, you...

349
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,750
You know, you have the gall

350
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,030
to accuse me of neglect,

351
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,226
of letting you down,

352
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,294
of letting down our kids, our family.

353
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,641
Whatever I did, whatever I did,

354
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,500
it was not intentional.

355
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,639
But what you did was deliberate.

356
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,363
You made a choice...

357
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:50,061
A deliberate choice to betray me...

358
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:51,877
... and our kids.

359
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,874
Congratulations.

360
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:26,074
You've made sure to ruin any chance
of saving this marriage.

361
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:28,108
Me ruin it?

362
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:33,746
Oh, it was ruined already.

363
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:38,728
What... what I haven't been able
to understand...

364
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,199
Is how you have not
been able to see that.

365
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:48,294
And what's hurt me the most
is that you haven't had a fucking clue.

366
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:52,075
You so didn't suspect anything...

367
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:56,547
Because it never even crossed
your fucking

368
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:59,797
preoccupied mind
that I could do anything like this.

369
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,750
Is it over?

370
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,738
Are you gonna keep on seeing him?

371
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,115
It's up to you.

372
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:38,144
Please leave.

373
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:49,789
Hello.

374
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:00,154
I dreamt about Becca again.

375
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,504
- Same dream?
- Yeah.

376
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:07,458
I'm in a boat.

377
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,260
she's in the water, I see her drowning.

378
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,761
I say to myself, "just... just jump in.

379
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:18,544
"Save her."

380
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,489
Something's holding me back.
