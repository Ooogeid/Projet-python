1
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:10,429
Hello, Mia.

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,350
So how have you been?

3
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,075
Quiet.

4
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,425
I hadn't heard from you.

5
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,580
Did you get my message?

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,598
Yes.
Thanks for your call.

7
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:45,185
- And how are you feeling?
- How do I look?

8
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,965
That's a lawyer technique, right...
answer a question with a question?

9
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,319
Well, I thought I'd hit bottom

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,236
at the end of the last session,

11
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:03,057
but it went downhill from there.

12
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,232
I did figure something out, though.

13
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:08,588
I'm stopping therapy.

14
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:33,588
I appreciate what you've done.

15
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,869
I know I'm a tough case.

16
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:37,857
But if every time
you go to the doctor,

17
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:41,132
you end up feeling worse,
then it's time to move on.

18
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:46,095
And I could have called, but I wanted
to come in and say goodbye

19
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:48,970
and wrap things up.

20
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,096
I understand.

21
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,869
You're not going to
try to convince me to stay?

22
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,997
Is that what you'd like me to do?

23
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,667
I just assumed you'd be all over me...
"therapy this, therapy that."

24
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:09,302
You want me to hard-sell you

25
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,298
like a guy selling you
a vegetable peeler on the street?

26
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,548
Jeez, Paul,

27
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,922
don't I get to be
the angry one here?

28
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:21,497
You mad because I want to
leave or has something happened?

29
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,185
You look like you want
to take your ball and go home.

30
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,291
Maybe you're right.

31
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:30,066
If therapy hasn't helped,

32
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,395
the last thing I want to do
is keep you here, make you feel worse.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,270
That's what happened
after the last session.

34
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,265
I felt like shit.

35
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:51,044
And I went home and I called my dad,

36
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,548
thinking that I should get
to the bottom of everything.

37
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:58,358
He came over
and I started asking questions

38
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,795
about my childhood,
all the things we'd talked about.

39
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,988
He turned it on me...

40
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:12,654
why was I creating problems,
bringing up ancient history?

41
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:16,375
Maybe he felt threatened.

42
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,498
Especially when I asked him
if it was his idea to sell the piano.

43
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,076
He lost it...

44
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:25,441
I shouldn't blame him;
I should be grateful;

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,792
I wouldn't be alive without him;

46
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:32,134
that I was impossible
from the day I was born,

47
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,588
and maybe that's why
my mother went nuts.

48
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:38,229
So it was all your fault.

49
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,944
Yeah and he went on...

50
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,969
it's no surprise
that I can't find a man;

51
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,519
who would want

52
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,726
a woman like me?

53
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:51,515
And then he walked out,

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,575
saying that he didn't want
to talk to me again.

55
00:03:56,871 --> 00:04:00,250
So therapy isn't the only
reason you had a bad week.

56
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,105
I never would have confronted
him if I hadn't been talking to you.

57
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,273
So thanks to all of this, I have...

58
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,000
lost my father.

59
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:13,356
You haven't lost your father.

60
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,693
He's still in your life,

61
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:20,661
but you did lose the father
that you thought you had.

62
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,371
He didn't refute
your mother's version of events.

63
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,275
He just chose not to answer.

64
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:32,019
And that confirms a lot of the things
that we've been talking about in here.

65
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:33,647
Okay, Paul, I get it.

66
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,763
I didn't have the perfect dad.

67
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,153
You're right and I'm wrong.
Is that what you want?

68
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,226
So put that in today's session notes,
which I hope you keep now...

69
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,604
"successfully shattered patient m's

70
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,688
"romanticized image
of her narcissistic father."

71
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:51,373
Actually what I would write is

72
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,212
"Mia, born to a depressed mother,

73
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,870
"idealizes her father
so as not to feel completely alone.

74
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:03,119
"And this week,
after finally confronting him,

75
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:07,923
"she can see her dad
for who he really is."

76
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,500
It is shattering,

77
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,816
but if you can now move beyond
that connection to your father

78
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,869
it may open the possibility

79
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:22,542
of finding love elsewhere.

80
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:28,808
You mean, if I stay in therapy.

81
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,225
That's one way.

82
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,096
It's certainly not the only way.

83
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,389
Good, because I really am done.

84
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,419
In fact, maybe I should get going.

85
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,619
You can, of course.

86
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:45,091
But since you're here,
maybe we can at least work on...

87
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,216
closure.

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,799
I know you were unhappy
about the last time

89
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,631
that we ended therapy.

90
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,669
I'd like to do
a better job this time.

91
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,063
How long does that take?

92
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,882
Well, that's up to you.

93
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,954
If this is your last session,
we'll use the time that's left.

94
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:07,158
And I'll be honest, you be honest.

95
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,575
How's that?

96
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,439
Okay, last session.

97
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:16,834
What do we do?

98
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,440
You haven't told me what
happened after your father left.

99
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,096
That's how we do closure?

100
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,590
Couldn't we just burn
some sage or something?

101
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,562
I enjoy your humor a lot, Mia.

102
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,926
But sometimes I feel
it's a way of...

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,790
It's a way of hiding.

104
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,674
After dad left,

105
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,674
I pretty much stayed home all week

106
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:53,901
in bed.

107
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,833
And I know that sounds bad,
but I'm here now,

108
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,860
so I got through it.

109
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,525
Did you get out of bed at all?

110
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:11,188
Bathroom trips, kitchen trips.

111
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,265
I answered the door for deliveries.

112
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,434
Did you talk to anybody?

113
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:17,939
My trusty assistant Henry,

114
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,397
who threatened to come over
and cook for me.

115
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,067
- You didn't want to call me?
- What would I have said...

116
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,986
"I'm under the covers 'cause
I'm afraid of the living room"?

117
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,120
If that's how you felt, then yes.

118
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,120
Have you been feeling
a little hopeless?

119
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,970
I'm not suicidal, Paul, don't worry.

120
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,605
I am pretty tough.

121
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,173
Does being tough mean you have to
suffer through things like this alone?

122
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,504
I just felt like the bed was safe

123
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,501
and the living room

124
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,667
was scary.

125
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,503
So you took to bed

126
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,740
like your mother did.

127
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:01,805
She had post-partum.

128
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:04,888
What's my excuse... post-non-partum?

129
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,237
I wouldn't belittle what
you've been through, Mia.

130
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,943
You wanted a child.

131
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,508
You thought you were having one.

132
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,233
That's a painful loss.

133
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,567
And on top of that,
when you were vulnerable

134
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:22,920
and need your father the most,

135
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,184
he wasn't there for you,

136
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,759
maybe the same way
he wasn't there for your mother

137
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:33,386
when she couldn't get out of bed.

138
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:44,256
This is exactly why
I'm done with therapy.

139
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:46,835
Every time we talk, I feel like

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,210
I need to see a therapist
just to get through the day.

141
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,300
Okay, I hear you.

142
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,325
- No more dad. No more mom.
- Is this how closure works?

143
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,647
You remind me
of my miserable family life,

144
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,581
and then my love life, and then what?
Global warming?

145
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:07,421
So what would you
like to talk about?

146
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,989
I was thinking about
getting a parrot

147
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,299
as a pet,

148
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,718
instead of a boyfriend
or a therapist.

149
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,343
I could name it paul

150
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:21,769
and I could teach it
to say things like,

151
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,729
"what would you like to talk about?"

152
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,147
Or "is it me or is it your father?"

153
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,722
But then I found out
that parrots live for about 80 years.

154
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,321
And I don't think I could
stand anybody for that long.

155
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,087
So you want to go,
but you also want to keep me around,

156
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,662
or at least you want
to keep my voice.

157
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,359
Look, paul,

158
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,266
I like you

159
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,344
I like you as a person.

160
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,377
I mean, that's pretty obvious.

161
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,220
If we were friends,

162
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,130
that would be great.

163
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,386
But we're not.

164
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,369
And I don't imagine you're
going to become my friend.

165
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,018
That's against the rules.

166
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:07,554
Unless, of course,
my name were laura.

167
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,901
- You're still angry about that.
- Maybe I'm just an angry person

168
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,177
and I should just accept
myself for who I am.

169
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:16,657
- No, you're specifically angry at me.
- No, I said I like you.

170
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:19,094
And you want me as a friend
but not as a therapist.

171
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,119
You want what I can't give you.

172
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,314
What else is new?

173
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,998
Maybe the question isn't
why you're leaving, mia,

174
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,959
but why you came back
in the first place.

175
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,171
You clearly knew that I was
being sued for malpractice. And

176
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,986
you believed that I had
failed you 20 years ago.

177
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,343
Think about it.
What kind of choice was that?

178
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,411
It wasn't a really good one.

179
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,739
Or maybe it was perfect,

180
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:44,309
if you were trying to choose
a therapist in the same way that

181
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,639
you choose the men in your life

182
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,079
look for someone who's
likely to let you down,

183
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,190
do everything you can
to drive him away,

184
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,612
and when he fails you,
which he must inevitably,

185
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,029
then you get to rage against him.

186
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:04,798
Nicely done.

187
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,961
You've even doubled back to dad,
without having to mention him.

188
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,378
Look, mia,
of course you're free to leave

189
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:12,589
therapy,

190
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,872
but my guess is,
until you untangle those

191
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,344
crossed wires,

192
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:22,077
the next man, and the one after that,
and the one after that

193
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,890
they're going to disappoint you too.

194
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,912
That's my lifelong pattern

195
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,001
because I've been

196
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,734
too attached to bad dad?

197
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,267
Why didn't you tell
me this 20 years ago?

198
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,368
- I mean, what the fuck?
- Are you saying it's my fault?

199
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,132
Maybe I would have had a decent
life if I had known that.

200
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,788
It's a little late now.

201
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,693
Would you have even heard me
if I'd said it that back then?

202
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,284
So you waited?

203
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:56,840
And while you waited,
I hit perimenopause? Great.

204
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:58,967
- You're doing it again, mia.
- What?

205
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,849
Blaming me for not giving you
what you need when you needed it.

206
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:02,971
Now I get it

207
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,433
closure is you telling
me that it's all my fault

208
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,202
and that I set you up.

209
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,562
That way we can both
have what we want-

210
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,565
I can be mad at you,
and you can be done with me.

211
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,874
Here's where you tell me how relieved
I'll be when you walk out the door.

212
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,527
And then you're going to say

213
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:23,556
that you're like a knife in my neck,
that it'll feel good when you're gone.

214
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,320
That how it goes, isn't it?

215
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,339
See, this is your specialty, ia.

216
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:30,469
And if you want to keep repeating
that pattern, that's fine. Go ahead.

217
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:33,283
But if you want to make
a change in your life,

218
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,938
I suggest that you stay in therapy.

219
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:40,032
And it doesn't even
need to be with me.

220
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,111
Can we talk about your patterns?

221
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,614
My patterns?

222
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,157
Like what?

223
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,560
How you like to have
a woman on the couch

224
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,979
who thinks she's in love with you,

225
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,959
how you get off on that.

226
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,733
Get off on it?

227
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,237
I've seen how you look at me.

228
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,071
You hold up that

229
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,551
neutral face pretty well,
but I see when it slips

230
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,246
and you're looking at my neck

231
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,636
or my legs

232
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,370
or my breasts and you're
wondering what it would be like.

233
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,509
Come on, paul,
you said you'd be honest.

234
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,749
How about you drop the act?

235
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:28,306
You know you'd rather have
me as a patient ten some

236
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,224
hedge fund guy whose
bonus has been reduced.

237
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,985
Don't tell me you haven't
had fantasies about us.

238
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,508
Crazy chicks are hot in bed, right?

239
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:50,003
What's the matter?
Am I making you uncomfortable?

240
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,042
Why don't we just go in
the bedroom right now and fuck?

241
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,219
Or how about on the kitchen counter?

242
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:03,467
I bet you never did that with laura.

243
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:08,469
So there's nothing to
be learned from therapy,

244
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:10,794
so let's just go fuck? Is that it?

245
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,544
At least we'd get some relief

246
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:20,873
from our miserable lives.

247
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,487
So that's your version of closure?

248
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:28,977
It would make us feel better,
instead of pretending that this

249
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,202
talking nonsense actually helps.

250
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:35,499
What would it be like if you
broke all the rules for me?

251
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:37,622
You mean if I said

252
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:38,934
yes?

253
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,519
So you want to?

254
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,239
What if I do?

255
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,185
What would happen?

256
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,810
What are you saying?

257
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,441
Would you finally
feel special enough?

258
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,721
Would it fix everything,
to win like that?

259
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:56,311
Or would you just blame
me for crossing the line?

260
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,689
You're a lawyer, for chrissake.

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,900
You know what it would mean.

262
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,843
Then I would be truly
guilty of malpractice.

263
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,573
You've probably represented
doctors like that.

264
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:11,963
Hell of a way to get out of therapy,
I have to say

265
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:15,036
- turn me into one of your clients.
- That's not what I'm doing.

266
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,332
Isn't it? Then I would need you.

267
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:19,515
You would be in control.

268
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,369
And that would be much
more comfortable for you,

269
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:25,871
to have me back in your office.

270
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Maybe

271
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:40,232
maybe that's why you really do it.

272
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:41,522
What?

273
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,817
- Your job.
- You're changing the topic.

274
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,635
Are you getting scared?

275
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,871
I'm trying to help you.
That's my job.

276
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,664
What's yours, mia?
What do you do at work every day?

277
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,232
You know as well
as anyone what I do.

278
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,338
How is your case going?

279
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,956
I wasn't in last week.
Don't you have a hearing coming up?

280
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:11,152
So they tell me.

281
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:14,968
But you're right, you
weren't in last week.

282
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:19,811
If you had gone in, what cases
would you have been working on?

283
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,922
No trials.
I was supposed to meet a new client

284
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,736
a pediatrician who

285
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,545
misdiagnosed some nine-year-old kid,

286
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,297
almost killed him.

287
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,322
No wonder you stayed in bed.

288
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,535
I don't judge my clients, paul.

289
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,830
I protect them.

290
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,447
And how many of
your clients are powerful men

291
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:44,051
who fail to protect
the vulnerable and the innocent?

292
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:45,629
They're being sued, paul,

293
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,298
just like you.
That doesn't mean they're guilty.

294
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,258
And how long have
you been doing that?

295
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,569
17 years.

296
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,795
How often do you call in sick?

297
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:58,852
Since I got there?

298
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,626
Five days, four.

299
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:03,449
In 17 years?

300
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,190
And vacations?

301
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,455
You don't lose the weeks
if you don't take them.

302
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,279
I see. But last week,

303
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,636
after confronting your father,
you didn't go in.

304
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,806
According to you, I was depressed.

305
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,086
I think you were.

306
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:21,060
But I don't think it's a coincidence

307
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:24,985
that suddenly you didn't want to
defend somebody whose negligence

308
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,602
had harmed a child.

309
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,471
Look, I'm not saying
they're all guilty,

310
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:34,302
but every time you stand in
that courtroom to defend a client,

311
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:39,029
I think you're actually defending
your father to everybody,

312
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,808
especially yourself.

313
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,449
Shit.

314
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,613
How long have you known that one?

315
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,723
Does it make sense to you?

316
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:06,428
I never made the connexion...

317
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,021
and now I'm stuck with it.

318
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,290
I felt like I had nothing before.
Now I have less than nothing.

319
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,835
I know it feels scary

320
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:23,058
but maybe that's a good thing.

321
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:26,146
It's a good thing
that I have nothing?

322
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,434
Thank you.

323
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:32,303
Thank you. You've helped me
to realize that I've made

324
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,166
poor choice after poor choice
my whole life.

325
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:39,458
But you also have to realize, Mia,

326
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,786
that you're at a critical juncture
in your life,

327
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,911
that now you do have
the self-knowledge

328
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,133
to make different, better choices.

329
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:50,950
Don't give me any of this
Pollyanna shit.

330
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,166
And sometimes when you're
on the verge of real change,

331
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,138
that's when you fight the hardest.

332
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:02,040
When you first came back
I tried to ask you

333
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,945
about your connection to your father

334
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,497
and you shut me down. You didn't want
to know anything about it.

335
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,773
This past week you confronted him.

336
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,027
Yeah, look how well that worked out.

337
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,649
I'm not saying it was easy.
But maybe it's worth it.

338
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,778
To finally take off the blinders,

339
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:23,717
even if you don't like what you see.
Because what is the alternative?

340
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:27,242
Put them back on again
and wander around in the darkness?

341
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:31,930
Did you have to take them off?
I didn't do it. You did.

342
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,217
What are you thinking?

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,889
Nothing.

344
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:46,561
What am I going to do
with the rest of my life?

345
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,720
I want...

346
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:54,234
the same things I wanted
when I came here two months ago...

347
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,995
a man, a home, a family.

348
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,029
I'm no closer to getting them.

349
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,149
Do you really think that getting married
is going to make it all better?

350
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:11,216
Do you have any idea
of how many married people,

351
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:15,324
how many parents feel
as empty as you do?

352
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:18,550
Let me ask you...

353
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:22,412
when was the last time
you felt real happiness?

354
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,267
A couple weeks ago when I thought
that I was pregnant.

355
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,991
And what about
that made you feel good?

356
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,593
That it wasn't just me,
that my life had meaning,

357
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,446
that there would be

358
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,669
this other person, always.

359
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:46,881
Have you ever considered that maybe
it's not about a child, Mia,

360
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:48,943
or a husband?

361
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,438
Maybe that's just a picture
in your head

362
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,537
from your family, from your friends,

363
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:58,725
from the culture.

364
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,384
Not everyone needs that

365
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:04,616
to live a full and contented life.

366
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:11,120
Maybe what you really want, Mia,
is to feel connected,

367
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,612
authentically connected

368
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,222
to somebody or something else.

369
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,899
And we both know
that I can't have that.

370
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:22,771
- Why not?
- An authentic connection? Me?

371
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:26,696
- I've never had that. I'm incapable.
- Are you sure?

372
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,601
What about in here?

373
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,257
Are you kidding me?

374
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,682
I'm a mess in here.

375
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:37,684
I attack you. I've dumped on you.
I've tried to seduce you.

376
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,632
- I've been a train wreck.
- Okay, at times you have acted out.

377
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,907
But if you hadn't,
how could we examine it?

378
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:49,656
It's been your way of communicating
to both of us what you need.

379
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,477
You've also been honest,

380
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,302
caring.
You've made yourself vulnerable.

381
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,831
You've shown me who you really are.

382
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,180
And you haven't walked away.

383
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:04,989
Yet.

384
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,409
We both know
that you really want to change.

385
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,955
That's the real reason
you keep coming back.

386
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,416
Yes, of course you want
intimacy in your life.

387
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,584
And I know...

388
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,105
I know that you're capable of that.

389
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,496
- Because we've had it.
- When? Name one time.

390
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,627
Now.
Right now.

391
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,880
Our time is up, right?

392
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,559
Thank you, Paul.

393
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:17,353
It was a good session.

394
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,489
Goodbye, Mia.

395
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,148
So...

396
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,546
I guess I'll see you next week.

397
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:47,666
I'll be here.
