2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:06,493
Are you saying that I pushed Kate
into this situation?

3
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,054
That I created this environment
at home

4
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,724
so that Kate could go
fuck an insurance agent

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,748
because really I'm in love
with Laura?

6
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,658
I think we should just discuss
the possibility

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,733
that Laura's better off
with a different therapist.

8
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,344
I am not sending Laura
to another therapist.

9
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:25,917
End of story.

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,867
If I remember correctly, you were faced
with the same scenario yourself.

11
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:32,997
Don't forget I was the one
who referred Charlie to you.

12
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,874
You know that he never ever got
over you?

13
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:39,945
You failed the same test yourself,
but you abandoned a patient.

14
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:09,244
- How are you, Paul?
- I'm fine.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,938
- Why, do I not seem fine?
- No, you seem...

16
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:17,539
antsy.

17
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:22,250
I just keep needing
to go to the bathroom.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,981
You remember where it is?

19
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,035
- The door on your right...
- No, I mean, all the time.

20
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,276
It's a...

21
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:31,829
- A urinary thing.
- Oh, I see.

22
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:35,586
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yeah. It's getting better.

23
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,621
But, it's still a terrible sensation.
You go to the bathroom,

24
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:40,626
you're staying there, you...

25
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:43,236
will it to happen, nothing. Not a drop.

26
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,833
So uncomfortable.

27
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:47,945
This and the stress you're under.

28
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:50,973
What?

29
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,026
Jesus.

30
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:57,173
- You think it's psychosomatic?
- No, not at all.

31
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,578
- A symbolic urinary infection.
- Symbolic how?

32
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:03,245
My head's telling me one thing,
my body's telling me another,

33
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:07,572
my precise issue manifesting itself,
as a physical malfunction of the...

34
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:11,595
Yes?

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,661
You said it was on the right?

36
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,266
Excuse me for a moment.

00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,311
There's no soap in there.

41
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,295
Really? I thought I saw soap.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,347
Are you angry?

43
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,743
It feels like you're angry tonight.

44
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:04,354
Let's say
that's a fairly accurate assessment.

45
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,690
- You wanna tell me why?
- Actually...

46
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:08,607
I'm angry at myself.

47
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,054
For taking your advice.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,156
Even though... I knew better.

49
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,368
- My advice?
- Taking your advice like a novice,

50
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,077
like a naive intern.

51
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:23,165
Ignoring every cell in my body,
and listening to you, instead.

52
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,167
What happened?

53
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,067
I met with Laura, and we talked about
ending our sessions.

54
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,691
A total disaster.

55
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,245
Did the opposite of what you predicted.

56
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,255
It was just... destructive.

57
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,206
It sabotaged a year of therapy.

58
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,032
How?

59
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:48,189
Because it undermined her faith in me

60
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,692
and in the work
that we've done together.

61
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:53,589
She asked me
if I was ending our sessions because...

62
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,076
I'm in love with her.

63
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,874
That...
Well, that what she heard me say.

64
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:01,200
What she heard was:
"I'm in love with you so...

65
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,346
"I can't see you anymore."

66
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,624
How did you put it exactly?

67
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,762
Are you suggesting that
I handled it badly?

68
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,009
No.
I just want to hear what you said.

69
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,318
You know, I said we should discuss
the options of...

70
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:16,931
Of ending therapy.

71
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,254
You didn't just drop it on her
out of the blue?

72
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:21,515
Of course, I didn't. I built up to it.

73
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,883
She came in late.

74
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,792
I thought that was important.

75
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,149
Like it was her way
of telling me something.

76
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,825
I'm not following.

77
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:35,143
I said I thought that her being late
was her way of saying

78
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:38,202
that she was angry at me.
That she was...

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,778
ambivalent about her therapy.

80
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,866
Of course, she threw it back
and she asked if...

81
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,553
She does have a point, she asked

82
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:50,664
if she wasn't the first person ever
to fall in love for her therapist.

83
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,383
And then, she told me to deal with it.

84
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,324
Meaning, you know, this is my job.

85
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,718
She's right.

86
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:04,642
She said, "You are an experienced
therapist, just deal with it."

87
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:09,268
Are you surprised to the reaction?
You put it on her and she threw it back.

88
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:11,011
How was I supposed...

89
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:14,631
You hammered me about this last week.

90
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,555
You went on and on about what I...
I knew it was a bad idea.

91
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,368
And now, I'm coming to you
with this mess... And all you...

92
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,467
You're not an intern. Far from it.

93
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,206
Don't play the intern.

94
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,668
If you think something is a bad idea,
you don't do it because I suggested it.

95
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,941
I said we should talk about it.
You were furious.

96
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,309
Like I was trying to take Laura
away from you.

97
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,302
Two days later, you abruptly tried
to stop her treatment.

98
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,848
You said that ending the therapy
was the best good solution.

99
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,642
I said it might be necessary
for her sake.

100
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:50,729
When you say "good solution", I think
you mean a solution to your problems.

101
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,524
- Is that what I mean?
- I'm assuming you acted hastily

102
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,643
because you thought it was necessary.

103
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:59,098
That it had to be dealt with quickly.

104
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,317
What do you want, Gina?
Do you want to...

105
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,984
What do you want to hear?
Do you want me to talk about Laura?

106
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,463
Do you want us to have
a "Laura" session?

107
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:09,206
What do you want me to say,
that I sit opposite her and say:

108
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,061
"Oh, what if?"

109
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,347
Well, I do.

110
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,219
You think I'm in denial about it?

111
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,845
I'm not.

112
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:24,651
Laura is...

113
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,447
She's attractive.

114
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,980
Anybody who is a therapist knows that...

115
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:38,068
Look, I know all the ways in with her,
all the doors I could open

116
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,680
- if I wanted to...
- Do you imagine opening them?

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,807
Yes I do.

118
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,635
I fantasize

119
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,747
about Laura.

120
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:00,748
Look, it's like a gynecologist.

121
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,344
It's easier for women to believe
that their male gynecologist

122
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:07,442
doesn't have any sexual desire
for them.

123
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,889
Of course, they want him to find
their bodies attractive as well.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,852
- Don't they?
- Don't even try

125
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,976
to break down a relationship
between a woman and her gynecologist.

126
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,318
That's a deep end.

127
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:27,369
Anyway, last week, I...

128
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,080
I got this...

129
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:35,835
sharp... kind of pain...

130
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,204
So I went to the urologist and,
on Monday, and I thought:

131
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,022
"This is...

132
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,698
"This is really scary."

133
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,419
And then this random thought
comes into my head

134
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,960
because it's so cold in the room,
and I think:

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,262
"My dick is shrinking", and I don't want
the doctor to think that, you know,

136
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:57,941
that's the real size.
Never mind... It was just...

137
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:09,998
You know, there is no connection
between a gynecologist office and...

138
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,638
the intimacy
between therapist and patient.

139
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,957
What do you think the connection is?

140
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,748
What I'm saying is that...

141
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:21,834
As a male therapist, sitting across
from a beautiful patient, I...

142
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,208
I know exactly...

143
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:28,296
How to engage her.

144
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,702
I know exactly what it would take to...

145
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,351
To turn her on.

146
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,521
- You know what turns her on?
- Yes, I do.

147
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,812
- What?
- Any number of things.

148
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,025
But I could manipulate her
to do anything I wanted.

149
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,983
I know that. And I doubt if it's only
male therapist who have those thoughts.

150
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,408
Do you know what I'm talking about?

151
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:54,761
For example, if a male doctor performs
an examination on a female patient,

152
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,619
there'd be a nurse present, right?

153
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,292
- I mean, that's for a reason.
- Am I the nurse?

154
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:03,920
I keep you from crossing the line.
Is that why you came to me?

155
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,503
Let me tell you what worries me.

156
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,729
You have boundaries too,

157
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,851
and just like you,
this woman knows how to cross them.

158
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:18,904
All I'm saying is that the temptation
is there for any therapist.

159
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,099
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:27,363
I mean, if I were a gynecologist,
and I were performing an examination,

161
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:31,412
- I wouldn't accidentally start to...
- Listen to yourself.

162
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,528
You know, you say you have no problem
discussing Laura.

163
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:37,971
And then, I bring her up,

164
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:42,128
and suddenly, it's...
It's all about genitals.

165
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:46,132
Gynecologist, and urologist, and...

166
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:50,918
You know,

167
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:53,858
it seems to me
that you're taking all of this

168
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,463
to an extremely intimate realm.

169
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,257
And you're saying to me...

170
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,564
I'm extremely vulnerable, here.

171
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,564
Help me here...

172
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,023
Where it hurts.

173
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,121
You know what?

174
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,428
What gets to me is that...

175
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,056
I lay it out for you.

176
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:23,699
All I want is for you to give me...

177
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,326
the Gina treatment,,

178
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,471
to get in there with your cold,
analytical scalpel,

179
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,968
and get some perspective. Say:

180
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,033
"Try this, Paul, try that!"

181
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:35,483
What I didn't expect was that...

182
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,316
That you give up on me,
telling me to find her

183
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:40,509
- a new therapist.
- Give up on you?

184
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,392
You suggest a course of action.
When that fails, you say to me:

185
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:46,253
"Hey, you did it,
don't come blaming me."

186
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,770
Do you really believe I convinced you
to do something destructive?

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,197
Let's talk about that.

188
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:55,402
It seems like a distraction from talking
about your feelings about her,

189
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:59,593
but okay, let's start by looking
at how you're conducting her therapy,

190
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,999
which seems to me impulsive,

191
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:05,211
unorganized, and if I'm honest,
very problematic.

192
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:08,767
- Really, is it now?
- Whenever I try to talk about this,

193
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,062
you unleash all this aggression

194
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,844
to show me this area is off limits.

195
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:18,051
- Touch this, I'll burn it down.
- All right, we'll deal with it.

196
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:23,187
Right... Right.

197
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,360
You remember I was talking about Alex,
the fighter pilot?

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,862
- God, listen to yourself!
- What?

199
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,945
You say "Let's talk about Laura",
and then you bring up Alex,

200
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,821
or anything you can think of,
so long as it's no Laura.

201
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,480
This is about Laura.

202
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,194
Alex, the fighter pilot...

203
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,560
met Laura.

204
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,473
- How?
- After a session

205
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,632
we had this talk
about stopping therapy.

206
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,095
The session ended
and she wouldn't leave.

207
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,414
She wanted extra time, I told her
I couldn't, I had an appointment with...

208
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:00,933
- urologist.
- You didn't tell her that?

209
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,850
No. I said I had an appointment.

210
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,875
Anyway, she stormed out,
and lo and behold, who does she meet?

211
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:10,478
He was there and you had
a conflicting appointment?

212
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:13,453
He was a day early by mistake,
which is weird,

213
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:17,072
because this guy
is such a military perfectionist.

214
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:21,412
A machine. He can probably tell the time
by triangulating the stars

215
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,373
or something.
Anyway, he forgot what day it was.

216
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:28,822
So he comes back the next afternoon,
tells me that they met, and now...

217
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,505
They're dating.

218
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,363
You think it's funny?

219
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:41,747
Because I don't.

220
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,227
It's not funny.
It's curious, I guess.

221
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:49,235
What's so...
What's curiously funny about it?

222
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,566
I don't know.

223
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:54,730
Just give me a minute and let me
figure out what I'm thinking....

224
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,573
It made me smile, I don't know why.

225
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,700
- They're dating.
- Dating?

226
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,460
She went out with him to get back at me.
I pushed her into it.

227
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,132
You don't see that?

228
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,139
I reject her unequivocally.

229
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,378
And the next minute,
she's hitting on the nearest guy.

230
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,194
I mean, a guy literally
on my own doorstep.

231
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,806
That's not a reaction to me?

232
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,540
Why would it be?

233
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:30,064
Because she knew Alex would tell me.

234
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:33,850
Well, first of all, isn't that
a reaction against her boyfriend,

235
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,778
the man she's going to marry?

236
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,409
Why are you the betrayed man, here?

237
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,525
Which would be the worse situation?

238
00:13:57,122 --> 00:14:00,511
If you realized that you were
the center of Laura's life

239
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:04,234
and that she was dating
another man to get at you,

240
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,213
or...

241
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,296
If... the transference simply faded,

242
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,307
and she was back to viewing you
as a therapist.

243
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,441
She thought about you
during sessions, that's it.

244
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,780
Do you think I'm an egomaniac?

245
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,159
No, I'm asking
which would be the worse situation.

246
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,644
I don't get off on being worshipped
by my patients,

247
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:28,670
if that's what you mean.
It's not like I'm in some kind of...

248
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,337
- Some kind of a cult.
- If her feelings were to change,

249
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,097
you wouldn't have a sense of loss?

250
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:39,425
Pretty clear,
how you want me to answer this.

251
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:45,118
Do you not get that I'm concerned
about the right and the wrong of this,

252
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,293
as it affects all my patients?

253
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:50,126
You're very concerned, I can tell that.

254
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:51,959
But you know,

255
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:56,625
sometimes, helping a patient
view the world differently

256
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,778
it's a powerful experience.
It's a little addictive.

257
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,995
It's a powerful experience
because it contributes

258
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,950
to somebody's well being.

259
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,953
It's not about an inflated sense of...

260
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:11,243
Power.
Do you think I'm addicted to power?

261
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,036
How...

262
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,238
- How does Laura see you?
- What do you mean?

263
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,821
When she looks at you,
what does she see?

264
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,582
- Why?
- Bear with me.

265
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,609
What does she see?

266
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:31,772
She sees...

267
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,051
a man, obviously.

268
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,070
A lot older than she is.

269
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,947
An authoritative strong man.

270
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,061
She thinks if she could
get close to him,

271
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,226
that she could maybe take on
some of his strength.

272
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:54,365
At the same time,
she's waiting for him to disappoint her,

273
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,316
because, somewhere down the line,
inevitably,

274
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,839
that's her story with men.

275
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,698
What else?

276
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,770
She thinks I won't be interested in her
unless she offers herself sexually.

277
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,903
She associates
concern for her as a woman

278
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,022
with sex.

279
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,468
For her, sex is...

280
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,417
a currency that she uses to pay for...

281
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,234
emotional protection from men.

282
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,570
Don't analyze. Just describe.

283
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,684
- Where is this going?
- No, just stay with it.

284
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,608
She thinks I'm a coward,
which is a bit of a turn off.

285
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,508
She believes that I'm totally
in love with her, that...

286
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:39,454
I think all the rest of my patients
are a drag and...

287
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:41,807
that I can't wait for her session.

288
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,851
I assume she...

289
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,789
I assume she finds me attractive.

290
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,135
Otherwise, why would she...

291
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,471
- Isn't this enough?
- Now,

292
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:58,825
you describe her, how you see her.

293
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:01,536
I would say...

294
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,808
- An hysterical disorder...
- Don't analyze. Describe.

295
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,422
Did you mean what does she look like?

296
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,745
If one had to pick her out of a crowd,
I'd say...

297
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:15,247
No, if <i>you</i> had to pick her
out of a crowd.

298
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,750
God, you're such a stickler.

299
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,209
She's thirty.

300
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:22,171
She's...

301
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,048
beautiful.

302
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,562
Great smile...

303
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:32,763
Inquisitive look in her eyes.
Really sharp...

304
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,061
Very smart...

305
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,325
She's got this great laugh that just...

306
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:44,560
Just bubbles up out of her.
It comes from nowhere, like quicksilver.

307
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:49,682
She's childish I'd say.
No, not childish,

308
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,988
childlike.

309
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,247
Vulnerable.

310
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,196
It makes you want to...

311
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,073
hold her.

312
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,418
She's fascinated with sex.

313
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:05,005
Well, with the power of sex,
as if she were a teenager

314
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:07,753
who's just discovered it.

315
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,971
Always, always makes reference to it.

316
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,936
Vivid, sexual experiences that,

317
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:18,248
I got to say,
are very poetic, sometimes.

318
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,679
She told me about a summer
after her mother died.

319
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,329
She was 15.

320
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:33,002
And she went to live
with this couple in San Diego,

321
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,337
friends of her father.

322
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,889
And she fell in love with this guy,
much older than her.

323
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:44,247
It was an escape, I think,
from her father who was...

324
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,629
really...

325
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:47,339
depressed and sad,

326
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:49,883
after the death of his wife.

327
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,571
That can be pretty horrible, you know?

328
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:57,353
A child taking care of a parent.

329
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:00,060
Like you did
after your mother's breakdown.

330
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,132
Nothing worse than a kid...

331
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,084
playing parents...

332
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,708
to a father or mother...

333
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:12,928
It's unnatural. It reverses
of the order of things, it's like...

334
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,077
kind of death, I suppose.

335
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,162
For you, it was after
your father ran off with his patient.

336
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:20,247
You keep coming back to that.

337
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:22,708
I try to find the roots
of your connection to Laura.

338
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:25,140
It's got nothing to do with my father.

339
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,029
Laura's the one re-enacting, not me.

340
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,624
Laura's re-enacting this...

341
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:32,864
escape.

342
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,114
Because that's what I am to her.

343
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,015
Escape from what?
Her boyfriend, her wedding?

344
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:41,113
I've tried to explain it to her that...

345
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,553
She's really making me into...

346
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,315
another David.

347
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,819
Not your David but...

348
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,929
The older guy from that couple,
that took her in.

349
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,552
She wants me to be that guy...

350
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:55,949
again.

351
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,869
- You're sure?
- Well, God forbid...

352
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:02,539
I should say anything you agree with,
no matter how clearly I lay it out.

353
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:06,816
Her attraction to me,
her wanting to run away with me,

354
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:09,183
there's something bigger that's...

355
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,146
that's driving that impulse.

356
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,969
Maybe you wanna run away?

357
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,095
- What?
- Escape from Kate, from your work.

358
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:21,891
God, you're so fixated
on your pet theories.

359
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:23,688
Everything has to...

360
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:31,828
Did I tell you that...

361
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:38,659
That Kate is going to Rome next week
with her insurance-agent boyfriend?

362
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,628
She's the one that's running, not me.

363
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:44,670
I told her:
"Fine, just get the hell out.

364
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,438
"I don't wanna, I...

365
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,403
"I don't want to look at you."

366
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,217
We don't live together, anyway.

367
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,863
- What do you mean?
- I sleep in the office.

368
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,137
During the day,
we act like everything is fine,

369
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,569
but at night, I'm...

370
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,732
- I'm on the couch.
- Since when?

371
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,793
Last four nights.

372
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:15,024
I brought in my blankets and my clothes.

373
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,781
How are the kids taking this?

374
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,808
Rosie didn't come home on Tuesday.

375
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,288
Said she'd be back late, but...

376
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:26,825
In the morning, she wasn't there.

377
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,168
She said she slept over
at some friend's.

378
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,673
Ian had a week off from college.
He didn't even call, didn't come back.

379
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:37,726
Got back after work yesterday
and Kate announced that...

380
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,588
you know, "Hey, I'm going out".

381
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,410
I said, "Fine, do whatever you want."

382
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:46,323
So...

383
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,379
I went to make dinner and...

384
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,939
There's no food in the kitchen.

385
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,449
I went to the fridge, I look in...
Nothing. Not even an egg.

386
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:00,915
Max and I ordered pizzas,
then I put him to bed.

387
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,457
I was gonna sleep in the office,
then I thought:

388
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:06,967
"What if something happens?"
You know?

389
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,527
He's upstairs by himself,
he's all alone. I...

390
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:14,241
couldn't bring myself
to sleep in that bedroom.

391
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:16,077
Not even for his sake.

392
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,183
I find that bedroom kind of...

393
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:22,671
repulsive.

394
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:27,713
I was asleep for while.
I don't know what time it was, and...

395
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,498
I wake up and I hear this voice saying,

396
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,386
"Daddy".

397
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:38,028
And Max is there, you know,
just standing at the door.

398
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:40,975
He asked me if I could sleep with him
and...

399
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,385
I said, "Sure".

400
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:47,246
He hasn't done that
since he was 5 years old.

401
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,553
My guess, that's the answer
to your question:

402
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:53,616
is the kids know everything.

403
00:22:57,537 --> 00:23:00,160
Anyway, she's leaving in 3 days,

404
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:01,824
and...

405
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:06,807
- Probably for the best, really.
- How is it for the best?

406
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,672
It's not for the best.

407
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,432
It's a nightmare.

408
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:13,992
It's painful.

409
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:16,733
But in a way, you're free...

410
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,904
to go through...
whatever it is with Laura.

411
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,296
I wanted my wife to leave me
for a salesman?

412
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,392
Maybe not, but it's convenient.

413
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:30,791
Convenient? She's flying to Rome
to fuck an insurance salesman,

414
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,301
for Christ's sake!

415
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:34,487
- Is that really what he is?
- I don't know.

416
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,047
He's a... runs an employment agency
or something.

417
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,631
What am I supposed to do?
Chain her to the bed?

418
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,787
Track every move she makes,
like that guy I have in therapy, Jake?

419
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,132
Or Alex who, you know,

420
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,852
whose wife grinds her teeth
in her sleep and...

421
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,561
wakes up the next day and says,
"The marriage is over, I'm leaving".

422
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,674
You keep bringing patients into this.

423
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,705
My wife is running off but...

424
00:23:56,865 --> 00:24:00,495
apparently, it's not my wife,
really it's me. According to you.

425
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,738
Since I'm my father, it must be me.

426
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,795
I've been trying to understand
since our first session

427
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,975
why you came to me. Me, specifically.

428
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,015
I remember, on our first visit,

429
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:22,112
you said that you felt
like you were cutting corners.

430
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:26,512
"You have no patience for your patients"
that's what you said.

431
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:30,800
And that, if they knew
what you really...

432
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,467
thought about them,
they'd stop coming.

433
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:36,771
I'm wondering if maybe, that's
what you want, for them to stop coming.

434
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:38,148
Why would I want that?

435
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:40,567
Not literally, on an unconscious level.

436
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,589
"Unconscious..."

437
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:46,393
Maybe you want to transfer
your patients to me.

438
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,534
Where did that come from?

439
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,393
It's not a real option. It's a wish.

440
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:56,178
You could dump your patients on me...
your problems.

441
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,140
When I suggested that we find
another therapist for Laura,

442
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,884
you immediately assumed
that I would treat her.

443
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,007
And then, you went down the list.
You described each patient.

444
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,255
But isn't that
what the sessions are for?

445
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,737
No. It felt like you were preparing me
metaphorically...

446
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,978
for the day when you hand them over,
when you say "Here,

447
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,427
"their problems are not my problems.

448
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,931
"I have to leave."

449
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:21,723
Yeah, I'm gonna run off
to the Caribbean and...

450
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:25,351
I'm gonna be sipping cocktails
with Laura, and scuba diving.

451
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:29,156
I mean, what on earth are you on about?
I just took on 3 more new patients.

452
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,502
You said you did that to prove
to yourself that everything's OK.

453
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,621
That couple, you said you don't care
if they ever come back.

454
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,757
You don't like the navy pilot.

455
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:44,214
And sometimes, it seems
you're not that upset about Kate.

456
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,165
What?

457
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:47,884
Not always.

458
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:49,424
Sometimes.

459
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,020
Maybe all these things that...

460
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,399
should be bad are really okay.

461
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,812
And then, there's me.

462
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:09,348
You're using me as your accomplice.
Not in a practical way.

463
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:12,900
But emotionally,
to help you move on from them.

464
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,203
That way you're free to be with Laura.

465
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:23,304
You know,
I don't even want to say to that.

466
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,328
I mean, what... are you doing?

467
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:30,496
Is this what you call help?
'cause that's why I came here.

468
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:34,379
I came here for you to help me.
I keep saying this.

469
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,093
But through some misguided line
of reasoning,

470
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,202
through some narcissistic...

471
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:43,681
need of yours to save the day, to put
yourself at the front and the center,

472
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,423
we've ended up here.

473
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:47,498
In this same place...

474
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:51,221
just to confirm that you, Gina,
are right.

475
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,438
As always.

476
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:04,113
Maybe I misjudged you, I don't know.

477
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:06,765
I thought you were better than this.

478
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:13,094
You know, I've got to say you really
sometimes are so infuriating.

479
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:16,889
The way you keep coming back
to your pet theories. My father...

480
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,545
Kate...

481
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:33,215
I guess I'd better go.

482
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:36,815
- Have a good week, Paul.
- You too.
