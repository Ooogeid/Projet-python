1
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:33,783
I know I'm early,
but it's cold in the waiting room.

2
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,678
- Can I come inside?
- Sure.

3
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:40,173
I have to leave this on.

4
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,487
Daniel might call
and if he does, I'll have to go.

5
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:09,957
How are you feeling?

6
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,112
I'm fine.

7
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:15,511
Good.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,440
So how did the conversation go
with your mother?

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,166
I told you I'd call you
after it was over.

10
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,941
I didn't hear from you.

11
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,956
You didn't have the conversation?

12
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,737
She was driving
when you called her, right?

13
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:32,873
Right.

14
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,552
Did she call you back?

15
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:36,971
Did you answer?

16
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:39,515
Of course I answered.
Don't I always answer?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
I couldn't tell her.

18
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:44,854
Why not?

19
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,530
I wasn't in a place
where I could talk.

20
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,589
Where were you?

21
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,297
The lobby of Sloan-Kettering.

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,936
I just went to see
how it would feel.

23
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,250
And...

24
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,982
How did it feel?

25
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,360
Like going to a hotel.
Like checking into

26
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:11,210
one of those fancy airport hotels
in a city where nobody actually lives.

27
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:15,415
There was this girl behind the desk.
She was like my age.

28
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,694
She smiled at me and...

29
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,232
she was like, "Can I help you?"

30
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:24,605
And I know that's just something
you say to people, but...

31
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:28,529
I sort of took her at face value
in the moment and...

32
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:32,316
I was like, "Can she help me?

33
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,881
No, probably not.
I mean,

34
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,365
she doesn't know
how to cure cancer."

35
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,033
But still,
she deals with it every day.

36
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,747
The minute she looked at you,
she must have known.

37
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,999
- Are you telling me that she didn't...
- {\Well, }My mom,

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,944
just she called back
and I had to leave to get reception.

39
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:55,299
She was like,

40
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,675
"Where are you?
You sound funny."

41
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:59,613
And I was like,

42
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,090
"Well, mom, I'm...

43
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:06,163
I'm actually a little sick."

44
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:09,856
So she started to lecture me
on how I don't take care of myself.

45
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:12,514
I don't wash my hands when
I get off of the subway

46
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:16,422
and I need to stop biting
my nails because I'm a grownup.

47
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,658
- She was really stressed out.
- Why was she stressed out?

48
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,991
Daniel tried to kill himself...

49
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,414
Again.

50
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,375
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,536
Last week
you said he was doing better.

52
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,892
I should've realized
that that was a warning sign.

53
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,769
- What happened?
- He tried to jump off the roof.

54
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,568
Anyway he's meeting now
with one of his old teachers, this...

55
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,503
this miracle worker... Mr. Heath.

56
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,604
He's the Anne Sullivan
to Daniel's Helen Keller.

57
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:01,694
He teaches at this special school
for autistic boys.

58
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,528
My parts sent Daniel there
when he was 10.

59
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:08,858
They took out a second
mortgage to pay for it,

60
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,133
because things had gotten so bad.

61
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,881
Daniel had

62
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,707
these two bald spots on either side
of his head from hitting himself.

63
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,580
The hair just stopped growing in.

64
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:29,143
And what was it that this Mr. Heath

65
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:31,049
did for Daniel?

66
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,524
He got Daniel to wear
a helmet for a while.

67
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,594
And daniel thought the...

68
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:41,238
helmet gave him special powers.

69
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,953
He thought it made him...

70
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,076
What?

71
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,785
It made him what, April?

72
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,027
Just stay with the thought.
It made him what?

73
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,478
He thought it made him smart.

74
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,581
Anyway...

75
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,464
He's supposed to...

76
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,569
He's supposed to call me
after the meeting's over,

77
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:15,564
so I might have to go pick him up.

78
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,441
Well, can't your mother do that?

79
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,712
She's busy?

80
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:21,965
No, she...

81
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,467
She can't deal with him...

82
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,664
Not when he's this bad.
Not when he wants to die.

83
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,242
Did he actually say that?
"I want to die"?

84
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,749
No, he says

85
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:36,866
he wants to turn into a cloud
and float away,

86
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,866
but he knows what would happen to him
if he stepped off a building.

87
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,006
He's not stupid.

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,616
He just... He gets so tired
of everything feeling so strange.

89
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:52,858
Well, right now the world must seem

90
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,729
pretty strange to you as well.

91
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,609
And you're going it alone,

92
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,206
without any Mr. Heath

93
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,239
to save you.

94
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,075
Isn't that supposed to be your job?

95
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,592
Yes, it is.

96
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,818
But if you don't let me in,
I can't help you.

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,499
And that scares me,
because I'm afraid that if you don't,

98
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,253
we'll waste the little
time that we have left.

99
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:22,688
Jesus.

100
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,426
Kind of blunt today, aren't you?

101
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,395
I think I'm depressed.

102
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,319
Okay.
Tell me why.

103
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,187
Probably because I have cancer.

104
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:38,723
Right.

105
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:44,484
But can you tell me
what you're feeling?

106
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,775
I'm not feeling anything.

107
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,404
I'm just sort of sick

108
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,440
and tired and just...

109
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:00,194
I don't know,
just kind of disgusted with everything.

110
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,596
I'll be brushing my teeth
and I'll look at myself in the mirror

111
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:09,566
and suddenly I'll look so ugly,

112
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,886
just awful. And...

113
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,194
And before I know it
I'm on the bathroom floor,

114
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:20,176
just starting at the lint
in the bath mat, and I...

115
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,316
I have no idea how
I'm going to get back up again.

116
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,794
That sounds like depression.

117
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:34,836
It also might be
what happens when you feel

118
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:38,469
that things are slipping
out of your control.

119
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:40,602
It's horrible.

120
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,296
When you're feeling like that,
I want you to call me.

121
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,965
- Why?
- Listen to me.

122
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,165
I don't care what time of the day
or night it is, you call me.

123
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,221
Do you understand?
That's what I'm here for.

124
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:55,822
You want to talk to me
when I'm on the bathroom floor?

125
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:56,947
Any time.

126
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:11,156
I saw my mom last week
for the first time in a while.

127
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,992
She took me to brunch.

128
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,879
And what did you talk about?

129
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:19,831
My brother.

130
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:23,810
Did she notice how...

131
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,713
How tired you look?

132
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,446
I put on some makeup...

133
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:32,070
A lot of makeup, actually.

134
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,571
So you didn't want her

135
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,765
to not see you at your best.

136
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,630
I always try to look good
when I see her.

137
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:41,670
- Why?
- It makes her feel better.

138
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,337
But this last time
I could've lost an arm

139
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,776
- and she wouldn't have noticed.
- Because of Daniel.

140
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,209
Sort of.

141
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,767
Also...

142
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,908
she wants to leave my father.

143
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,676
Did she tell you that?

144
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,496
{\I mean, }It's not a big deal.

145
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,582
She's been saying that
for as long as I can remember.

146
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,201
"Life would be so much
easier without your father.

147
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:08,755
Never marry a workaholic."
Blah blah blah.

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,682
The fucked up thing is she doesn't
actually want to leave him.

149
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,511
She's crazy about him.

150
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,032
She is.

151
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,391
But she said she wanted to leave.

152
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,758
Do you think it's possible that

153
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:26,045
what she wants to leave is Daniel?

154
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:32,117
You know, I think your mother passes
a lot of her anxiety on to you.

155
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:35,307
But I don't think
the relationship is balanced,

156
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:38,202
because you don't pass
your problems back to her.

157
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,079
I'm sorry I brought her up. It's...

158
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,878
You don't talk about your dad
a lot in here.

159
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,008
I know.

160
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,326
I don't have that much
to say about him.

161
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:01,026
He's never around.
He's always at the hospital.

162
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:04,259
For a while when we were young...

163
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,291
Daniel kept forgetting who he was.

164
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,561
He'd call him mister,
like, "Hey, mister."

165
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:15,864
But Daniel kept getting worse as he got
older and my dad couldn't handle it 

166
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,515
- and he just checked out.
- On both of you?

167
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,789
He and I have our own relationship.

168
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,375
I used to wait up for him

169
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,218
until he came home.

170
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:30,734
I'd sit with him
while he ate his dinner.

171
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,436
He'd talk abouhis day, his patients.

172
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,854
So he treated you like an adult.

173
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:40,634
- It was nice.
- It sounds like he understands you.

174
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,628
But he didn't raise me.

175
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:46,024
He just got to sweep in
at the end of the day

176
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,970
and talk to the healthy
child for 15 minutes.

177
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:51,280
She was with Daniel
day in and day out.

178
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,213
Do you think part of the reason
{\that }you treasured those moments

179
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,913
was because your dad was talking
about something other than Daniel?

180
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,152
She needs to talk to someone.

181
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,653
Of course. I understand that,
but why couldn't she tell a friend?

182
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,747
It wasn't anybody else's business.

183
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,414
It's okay, paul.

184
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,198
I could handle it.

185
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:12,246
I wanted to handle it.

186
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,299
She gets overwhelmed.
She needs to vent.

187
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,257
So after she vents and she puts
the stress, the disappointment

188
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:20,982
and the worry of her own life
on your shoulders,

189
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:22,681
who do you turn to?

190
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:27,119
Or do you just carry it with you,
your burden and hers?

191
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:28,604
Are we out of time?

192
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,161
No, we don't have to worry
about the time.

193
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,706
You know, I've been...

194
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:39,024
I've been reading up on autism

195
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,022
and it seems like
there's some pretty

196
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:43,961
promising research coming out.

197
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:48,160
- There's never gonna be a cure.
- You seem pretty certain about that.

198
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:49,697
It's not a disease.

199
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,668
If it's not{\ a disease}, there can't be a cure.

200
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,201
Actually, some scientists seem to
be reconsidering that assumption.

201
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:58,856
Well, that's because they're being
funded by rich, desperate people.

202
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:02,763
Autistic children don't get better,
they just get older.

203
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,404
I'm sorry if that sounds cynical.

204
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,779
No, it doesn't.

205
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,964
But you're right. Those children
eventually become adults and their... 

206
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:14,858
Their parents die.

207
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:19,344
And when that happens it falls on
somebody else to take care of them.

208
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:23,376
In Daniel's case,
that would be you, April,

209
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,750
for the rest of your life.

210
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm a horrible person.

211
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,135
Why would you say that?

212
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,458
Because I don't want to do it.

213
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:47,057
He ruined their lives.
He ruined their marriage.

214
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,768
You can't... You can't
give Daniel what he needs

215
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,729
and have any space for anyone else.

216
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,899
Well, your mother couldn't,
but you're not your mother.

217
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,295
- You can make different choices.
- She didn't make any choices.

218
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,333
- She gotstuck.
- She did, April.

219
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,950
But every life is...
It's a constellation of choices.

220
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,133
Nobody escapes making them.

221
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:10,502
You mother made choices
that kept her locked into Daniel.

222
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:13,591
- You can choose differently.
- He's my brother.

223
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm not suggesting
that you abandon him,

224
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:19,132
but you don't know what the future
holds for either of you.

225
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,438
You don't know
what sort of innovations

226
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,854
are gonna come along
in the treatment of autism.

227
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,887
You're not psychic, april.

228
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,178
You can't predict the future.
You can't control it.

229
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,316
The only thing you can do

230
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:33,944
in relation to the future now

231
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:37,713
is to decide whether or not
you want to be in it.

232
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,956
- I look like such shit right now.
- Okay, that's enough.

233
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:56,638
We have to start talking now
about chemo.

234
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,813
Hi, Daniel.
How was your meeting?

235
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,381
You didn't see Mr. Heath?

236
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:09,563
Where are you?

237
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,311
I'm going to call you back
in just one minute.

238
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,929
Will you pick up the phone?

239
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,097
Promise?

240
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,432
Okay, bye.

241
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,366
Mr. Heath.
Hi, it's April.

242
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,203
Yeah, I know.
I just spoke to him.

243
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:34,154
No, he's fine.
He's in Central Park.

244
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,796
He's at the sailboat pond.

245
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:37,548
He likes it there.

246
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,541
But if I go and get him right now

247
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,370
could I still bring him
to see you today?

248
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,862
Do you still have time?

249
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,785
I'm in Brooklyn now,
so it'll take me a few hours.

250
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,022
Thank you so much.

251
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,012
Damn it, pick up.

252
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,435
Come on, pick up.

253
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,778
I'm gonna come and meet
you in about an hour,

254
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,782
but I want you to stay
right where you are.

255
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:10,783
Okay, will you do that?
Will you stay?

256
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,777
All right, I'm gonna see you soon.

257
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:24,745
What happened?

258
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,208
You fainted!

259
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,677
What?

260
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,556
- No way.
- Yes way.

261
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:31,992
You are sick

262
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,057
and you're not taking care
of yourself. Sit down!

263
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,530
You need to eat.

264
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,913
You need sugar in your system.

265
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,582
You don't have to do that.

266
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,942
You're not calling
the shots now, I am!

267
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,944
Now you stay there
and you don't move!

268
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,197
I just stood up too quickly. I have
really low blood sugar. I'm used to it.

269
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,773
- I'm fine. Really.
- Do you see what you're doing?

270
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,286
You're treating me just the way
you treat your parents.

271
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,167
Can we talk about it next week?

272
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,540
Are you so afraid
that I won't be able to help you?

273
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,817
Yeah, I have to go.

274
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,817
2 minutes ago you were
passed out on the couch,

275
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:04,493
- now you're off to save the world.
- I'm not going to save the world.

276
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:07,022
- I'm going to save my brother.
- Call your mother.

277
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:08,983
Tell her to go get him.

278
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:11,068
- Why not?
- Because I can do it.

279
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,252
There has to be another option.

280
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:19,352
You can't take care of everything
and everybody all the time.

281
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,396
Listen.
It's okay if you can't handle this.

282
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:23,097
What?

283
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:25,358
I saw how you panicked there.
I get it.

284
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,153
It's scary what I have,
what I'm going through.

285
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,407
I don't have to come back here
if you can't handle it.

286
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,951
Is that what you think I was doing?
You think I was panicking?

287
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,996
- Come on, you freaked.
- Okay, let's say I freaked.

288
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,940
- What does that mean?
- That means I can't come back here.

289
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,440
- Why not?
- Because you can't handle me.

290
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:47,238
It's possible to live in a world
where people panic,

291
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,814
where people let each other down,

292
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,677
where they disappoint each other
but still help each other.

293
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,785
I will get sicker and sicker.

294
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,092
I'm gonna keep passing out
on your couch.

295
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,632
I'll probably vomit on your couch.

296
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,057
And then eventually

297
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:07,859
I'm gonna die on your couch.
Is that really what you want?

298
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,779
No! I want you
to go to chemotherapy!

299
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,492
Do you even know what chemo is?!

300
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:16,113
It is poison that they administer
directly to your heart!

301
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,372
They put this big pump
right to your heart.

302
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,694
And do you know why?

303
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,378
Because if they just gave you a shot
and some of it got under your skin,

304
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,943
- it would melt your fucking flesh!
- That is not gonna happen to you!

305
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,674
You don't know that.

306
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,410
You don't know anything.

307
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,481
You can't stop what's
gonna happen to me.

308
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:39,872
The nausea and the pain,

309
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,560
my hair.

310
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,060
You'll tell me

311
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,899
that life is beautiful
and I have to be brave

312
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,860
and I'll say,
"yes yes yes," blah blah blah.

313
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,043
But I'll be lying
and you know that I'll be lying.

314
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,820
And one morning
you're gonna wake up and...

315
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:00,890
say to yourself,

316
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:06,121
"I just wish that fucking girl...

317
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,104
I just wish that fucking girl
would leave me alone

318
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:12,757
so I can be happy again."
You won't be able to handle it.

319
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,243
You won't.

320
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:20,953
So to help someone is... is torture.

321
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,602
It's unbelievably painful.
It's hell.

322
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,099
Yeah?

323
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:30,539
If you let me help you,
I will hate you for it.

324
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,850
Yeah?

325
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,488
And I'll probably fail you anyway.

326
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:38,975
Yeah?

327
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,844
Hi, mom.

328
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,827
No, he didn't.

329
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:07,854
I don't know what happened. He...

330
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,112
He's in Central Park.
I was...

331
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,070
I was gonna go and get him,
but I got stuck somewhere.

332
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,864
Well, I'm in Brooklyn now.

333
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,002
Could you go get him?

334
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:27,443
Because I can't leave.

335
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,744
No, I can't.

336
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:32,381
I can't.

337
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,268
I ca... I can't, mo...

338
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:41,964
She hung up.

339
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,492
- Our time is up.
- Can you wait a minute?

340
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:51,987
- Just sit down for a minute.
- Don't you have another patient?

341
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:54,855
No, I want to say something to you.
Sit down.

342
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,044
Listen.

343
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,531
If we had more time,

344
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,701
we could find a way to tell your mother
and see if she could handle it.

345
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,473
But you don't have time.

346
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:09,363
Do you understand that?

347
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:12,205
And, April, I'm not going
to sit here week after week

348
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,105
and watch you just slip away.

349
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,916
We have to begin
treatment today, now.

350
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,720
I tried. I told you I went there.
I couldn't do it.

351
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,752
Last week you said that the things
we discuss in this room make sense

352
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:29,037
while you're here, and then
when you leave everything changes.

353
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:32,730
What is it about this room

354
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,361
that makes things seem...

355
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:38,820
Different?

356
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,355
I don't know.

357
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,421
The isolation, the detachment.

358
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:55,806
You.

359
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,197
What if I come with you
to the hospital?

360
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:09,964
Would you?

361
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,311
Yes.

362
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,515
Now?

363
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,381
Yes.

364
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:19,746
Right now.
