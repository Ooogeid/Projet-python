1
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:26,859
April?

2
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,509
Sorry, should I sit?

3
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,087
If you want to.

4
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:08,605
Nice bones.

5
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:11,160
I just...

6
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:13,633
I like to take in a space
when I enter it.

7
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:15,967
I'm studying architecture
and they...

8
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:20,332
sort of train us to always be aware
of our surroundings so that...

9
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,537
Am I talking too much?

10
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:24,971
What?

11
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,420
People don't usually ask
that question in here.

12
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,987
I really like your office.

13
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,387
Thank you.

14
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:35,428
- D.I.Y.?
- I'm sorry?

15
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,865
Did you do it yourself or
did you use an interior decorator?

16
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:42,764
I...

17
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:44,513
So this is all you?

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,894
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

19
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:03,780
So, April...

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,241
Well, maybe you can tell me
a little bit about yourself.

21
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,146
What...
What specifically?

22
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,633
Well, whatever you think
I should know.

23
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:17,077
I'm 23,

24
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,157
I go to Pratt,
I'm studying architecture...

25
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,448
I already told you that...

26
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,610
And urban planning.

27
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,146
It's a three-Year program.
I'm in my 2nd year.

28
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,741
My parents are both alive
and still married to each other.

29
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,966
I have a brother...

30
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:37,445
Daniel.

31
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,398
He's a year and a half younger.
We're pretty close.

32
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,407
I'm single...

33
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:46,573
recently.

34
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:48,460
Very recently.

35
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,858
We were together since
the first week at Pratt.

36
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,100
So is...

37
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:58,677
Is that what you've come
to talk about?

38
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,017
My breakup?

39
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:05,810
I wish.

40
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,067
No, my breakup was...

41
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,171
really fine, totally amicable.

42
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:20,589
Kyle was really incredibly civil
about the whole thing.

43
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,907
We're still good friends.

44
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,745
And his new girlfriend's just...

45
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,460
delightful.

46
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:33,809
And her father owns five buildings
on Park Avenue,

47
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,140
so... that's nice.

48
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,071
I'm sorry, I'm really bad
at talking about myself.

49
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,516
You're gonna have to ask me
questions or something.

50
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,595
Are you that kind of shrink?

51
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,353
I can be.

52
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:53,018
I found your name online...

53
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,046
Pratt listserv.

54
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,267
I wanted somebody close to school

55
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,852
who actually takes my health plan.

56
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:05,286
Nobody had commented on your page.

57
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,331
There's a space where patients
can recommend or not recommend.

58
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,275
Yours was empty.

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,795
That's probably 'cause I've just
recently moved to the area.

60
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,069
I assumed it was a new practice.

61
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,125
I thought you'd be younger.

62
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,373
Would you prefer
a younger therapist?

63
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,057
No, actually.

64
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:28,893
You seem great.

65
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,064
How's business?

66
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:35,549
Hard?

67
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,215
Why'd you move?

68
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,581
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,248
Well, I just can't help but notice

70
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,786
that this is the third time
that you have...

71
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,039
That you've apologized to me.

72
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:53,491
I'm not really sorry.

73
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,462
- I was just being polite.
- OK, I just want you to know that

74
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,915
you don't have to apologize
for anything in here...

75
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,081
Anything that you say.
You can't...

76
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:04,261
You can't offend me.

77
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,290
- I can't?
- Well, of course you can, but...

78
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,139
I can take it.

79
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,846
What I mean is you don't have
to censor yourself

80
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,857
to spare my feelings.

81
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:24,448
So is this your first time meeting
with a psychologist?

82
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,078
No, I saw somebody at school.

83
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,354
They give you 9 weeks for free
over the course of the school year{\, so}...

84
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,695
Nine weeks,
that's... that's not long.

85
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:37,628
It would've been plenty if she hadn't
been such a fucking idiot.

86
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,089
First of all,

87
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:41,630
Jennifer...

88
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,846
was barely older than me.

89
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,909
One of those girls who...

90
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,366
You could just tell
she became a therapist

91
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,796
because she didn't know
what else to do with her life,

92
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:54,954
like she woke up one morning
and thought,

93
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,967
"I look like I'm a good listener

94
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,132
"and I have nothing really to say.
I know! I'll be a therapist."

95
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:06,365
- No offense.
- That's fine. That's fine.

96
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:11,192
She was just waiting for some...

97
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:14,003
rich doctor in a bad marriage

98
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,924
to crawl into her office
and fall in love with her

99
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:19,236
so she could give up
the whole charade.

100
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:23,202
I could {\just }tell wen I was sitting there
in front of her she was thinking,

101
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,524
"This girl is a complete
waste of time."

102
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,647
And what told you that?

103
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:29,388
I don't know.

104
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,645
It was just this feeling
I had, this...

105
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:35,687
polite glaze in her eye.

106
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,740
Also, she told me

107
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,274
the same story twice,
which was pretty disheartening.

108
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,959
In the same session?

109
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,610
No, two different sessions.

110
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,487
So you went to see her again?

111
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,299
Yeah, I figured I owed it to her.

112
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,521
How do you mean
that you owed it to her?

113
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,993
She was a nice person.

114
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:52,815
She was trying.

115
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,550
So what was the story,
the one that she told you twice?

116
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:01,101
It's not significant.

117
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:05,257
I mean, It's not even a story.

118
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,849
It's more of a joke.

119
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,081
You probably know it.

120
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:10,643
Maybe not.

121
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,014
Try me.

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,836
It's the one about the hick
who comes to New York...

123
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,634
and...

124
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,931
Everyone's moving really fast.
Nobody gives him the time of day.

125
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,410
Taxis cut him off.

126
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,552
People try to pick his pocket.

127
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:31,696
And all he wants to do is get
to the museum of Natural History

128
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,285
to see the dinosaurs,

129
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,227
but he can't find it.

130
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:37,298
You know, he...

131
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,123
He can't find it,
he's walking in circles.

132
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:44,065
So finally he walks

133
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,152
right into the middle
of Times Square,

134
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,621
taps a cop on the shoulder and says,

135
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,887
"Excuse me, officer.
Can you tell me how

136
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,598
to get to the Natural History museum,
or should I just go fuck myself?"

137
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,679
I've heard it, yeah.

138
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:57,912
It's a...

139
00:07:58,982 --> 00:07:59,937
It's a classic.

140
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,666
Well, she told it to me twice,

141
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,526
and it wasn't funny the first time.

142
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:09,383
When I didn't go back,
she called me like...

143
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:10,948
87 times.
I was like,

144
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,663
"Take a hint, lady."

145
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,696
Do you think it's possible
she didn't know

146
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,058
that you had chosen to stop therapy?

147
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,207
How many phone calls does
a person need to ignore

148
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,781
before you realize
they don't want to talk to you?

149
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,964
So you never spoke to her again after
you decided not to continue therapy?

150
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,911
I didn't have anything
to say to her.

151
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,561
I just didn't want
to come back to therapy.

152
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:35,432
I just wonder why you felt
that you couldn't just...

153
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,192
just tell her.

154
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,436
I didn't want to hurt her feelings.

155
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,330
The... Okay.

156
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,641
First of all, the woman was
borderline stalking me.

157
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,482
I've had friends who've gone
to therapy at school and...

158
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,234
And if you quit,
they're supposed to call you once,

159
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,087
send you a letter and that's it.

160
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,912
Jennifer was

161
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:02,224
way over the line.
Second of all, she was an idiot.

162
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,384
And third of all,

163
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,338
do you know her or something?

164
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,214
No, I don't think so.

165
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:10,437
Why?

166
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,911
Because you seem really invested
in my relationship with her

167
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,155
and the whole reason I came to you

168
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,009
was because I didn't think that

169
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:19,120
you knew anybody that I know.

170
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,584
Well, I'm trying
to understand what...

171
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:25,647
you're trying to tell me
when you tell me this story.

172
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,427
Dude, back up.
I wasn't trying to tell you anything.

173
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:31,803
You're the one Who brought her up.

174
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:33,423
Can I ask you if...

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,817
If anything else happened

176
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:37,951
in those sessions that might have

177
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:40,204
disturbed you?

178
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,580
Oh my god.

179
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,710
I just told you the woman

180
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,803
had oatmeal between her ears.

181
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:47,888
She barely noticed me.

182
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,259
I mentioned that
my brother was autistic,

183
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,389
that he took up a lot
of my mother's time, and...

184
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:55,388
she was like,
"That must've been hard for you.

185
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:57,833
Do you think you're angry
at your brother?"

186
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,113
And I was like,

187
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,894
"I love my brother,

188
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,227
but I could throw you off
a bridge right now, bitch."

189
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:09,592
I don't understand you people.

190
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,963
I thought I could come here and...

191
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,334
you know, somebody might
actually listen to me

192
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,515
and instead...

193
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:20,390
All you want to do is waste my time
talking about my first shrink

194
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,679
and what a fucking disaster she was.

195
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:26,124
I don't think
we've been wasting our time.

196
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,557
Of course you don't.

197
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:30,893
All right, look.

198
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,637
It may seem to you like
I'm a bit slow on the uptake,

199
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:36,987
but I really have been listening.

200
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:40,177
And I think I know a little
bit more now about...

201
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,058
what's important to you.

202
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,145
You've told me
not to tell you things twice,

203
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,980
not to feed you platitudes,
not to waste your time.

204
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,279
You've told me that you're
fiercely loyal to your family

205
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,027
and if I fail to engage you,

206
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:56,193
you'll disappear on me,

207
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,742
Even if I call you 87 times.

208
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,792
It wasn't really 87 times.

209
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:15,025
So...

210
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:18,343
So what have you come here
to talk about?

211
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,840
How many people
come to you with like

212
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:26,529
a really big problem?

213
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,435
Like what?

214
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,263
I don't know...

215
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,029
A death, a rape.

216
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:35,179
I don't know.

217
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:38,528
Anything that you tell me
I can handle.

218
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,911
I wasn't raped.
Don't worry.

219
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,102
I'm trying to tell you.
I just...

220
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,154
I can't get the words
out of my mouth.

221
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,551
Can I write it down?

222
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:00,836
Of course.

223
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,169
How do you feel?

224
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:17,391
Tired.

225
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,060
What type of cancer is it?

226
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,830
You know what? I...

227
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:37,503
I don't really want
to talk about it.

228
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:41,273
I just wanted to tell someone.

229
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,823
I have so much other shit
on my mind right now.

230
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,819
This project is due in two weeks.

231
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,813
I have so much drafting to do,

232
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:53,663
not to mention the model,
which I haven't even started.

233
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,097
I'm so fucked.

234
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,271
Are you sleeping?

235
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,965
Not really, no.

236
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,780
I wake up in these cold sweats.
They're pretty awful.

237
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,048
The whole bed is soaked.

238
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,469
Night sweats are apparently
a very common symptom...

239
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:16,952
of lymphoma.

240
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,227
And other things
you never wanted to know.

241
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,322
So how long have you known?

242
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,752
Five weeks.

243
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,001
And...

244
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,332
how did you find out?

245
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,829
I had a cough.

246
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,373
It was totally minor,
but it wouldn't go away.

247
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,840
And it was embarrassing to be sitting
in class coughing all the time.

248
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:50,046
So... I went to the health center

249
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,816
and they gave me antibiotics.

250
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:54,493
But they didn't help,

251
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,174
which is not really a surprise
because the health center is total shit.

252
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,643
We have this joke that

253
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,215
you could go in there
bleeding profusely from your head

254
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,071
and if you're a woman,
they'll give you a pregnancy test.

255
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:08,503
So...

256
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,434
you know,
I figured I'd suck it up

257
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:14,371
and whenever I finally talked to my dad
he'd tell me What to do.

258
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,747
Is he a doctor?

259
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,434
In the army.

260
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,152
He's supposed to be retired, but...

261
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,964
Now he's working With the V.A.,

262
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,046
and they're so understaffed,
it's impossible to get him on the phone.

263
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,611
Anyway, where am I?

264
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,182
You were talking about your cough.

265
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,050
Right.

266
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:39,182
So I couldn't reach my dad

267
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:40,670
and then...

268
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,286
I started having
these awful night sweats,

269
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:49,077
so I went back to the center
and guess what they did.

270
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,626
- What?
- Accused me of taking diet pills...

271
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:56,564
or cocaine.
The doctors couldn't agree

272
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,207
on what controlled-substance abuse
I was keeping from them,

273
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,210
so that was awesome.

274
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,662
Finally someone
had the bright idea to...

275
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,544
send me to Brooklyn Hospital
to get a chest X-ray,

276
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:13,979
and then...

277
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,266
Well, the rest is history.

278
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,246
I have a big mass

279
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,986
behind my spine.

280
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,201
Don't ever get
a bone-marrow biopsy, okay?

281
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:37,998
Just tell them to find another way.

282
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,645
They do it in front of
10 medical students,

283
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,331
and they're all flirting
with each other,

284
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,528
as if you're not even
in the room, you know?

285
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,508
As if you're already dead

286
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,180
and it's an autopsy.

287
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,846
It sounds horrible.

288
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:59,030
Primary mediastinal large B-cell,

289
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,769
non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

290
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,359
You've met...

291
00:17:04,843 --> 00:17:06,524
You've met with an oncologist?

292
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,510
Yeah, the same day I was diagnosed.

293
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,600
Were you alone?

294
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,306
You didn't want anybody
to go with you?

295
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,235
- Like who?
- A friend.

296
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,085
- Or parent.
- Hell no.

297
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,458
How did your mom and dad react
when you told them that you were sick?

298
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,343
I haven't told them.

299
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,800
So who have you told?

300
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:34,748
You.

301
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:36,634
Me.

302
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,261
Anybody else?

303
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,800
A construction worker.

304
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,491
One of my biggest Pet peeves is

305
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,505
When I'm walking down the street,
and some asshole at a building site

306
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:54,918
tells me to smile.

307
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:57,806
You know?
Like, "Smile, sweetheart.

308
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,278
"It ain't that bad."

309
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,172
So...
You know, I've always wanted

310
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,599
to say something back
that would really shut those guys up.

311
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:08,561
So the other morning
I was walking to school, and...

312
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,649
this guy yells out,

313
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,839
"Hey, doll face, smile will you?

314
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:15,557
It's a beautiful morning."

315
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:18,412
And I shouted back, "I have cancer!"

316
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,393
It was awesome.

317
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:32,135
Not really.

318
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,017
So the only people that you've told

319
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,701
about this are...

320
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,900
this construction worker and me?

321
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:46,248
I wanted to talk to
someone who was...

322
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,617
objective,

323
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,568
someone who doesn't care
what happens to me.

324
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,560
You care I'm sure, because you're
a human being, but you won't like...

325
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:58,837
get hysterical If I tell you that...

326
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:01,548
I don't know. That maybe
I don't want to get treatment.

327
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,092
You know, like if I tell you
maybe I want to die right now,

328
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,701
right here, on your couch,
you're not gonna...

329
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,029
I don't know...
Jump out The window, right?

330
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,139
I just...

331
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:20,514
need to think about all this
for a moment...

332
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:25,071
Maybe see an herbalist,
an acupuncturist or something,

333
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:28,140
figure out what my options are
before I start telling everyone

334
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,389
and managing the hysteria.

335
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:34,130
Who would become hysterical
if you told them?

336
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,052
Your mother?

337
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,061
Your father?

338
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:48,513
And your brother?

339
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:52,513
Daniel doesn't get hysterical.

340
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,985
- Violent, but not hysterical.
- Violent against whom?

341
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:57,234
What?

342
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,633
No, nobody.

343
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,994
Himself.

344
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,742
Don't worry about it...

345
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,995
You seem to me to be really...

346
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,121
independent.

347
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,418
And I can imagine
that the idea of...

348
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:16,258
accepting treatment...

349
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,020
putting yourself
in somebody else's hands...

350
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,889
I can imagine that
that would be kind of scary.

351
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:28,561
I just told you I want to explore
my options... Meditation, yoga...

352
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,145
These are good Stress-Relievers,

353
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:35,749
but they're not gonna stop
the progress of this disease.

354
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:38,563
Not according to Western medicine.

355
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:40,946
Did you come to me

356
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,983
looking for somebody
to tell you that it's okay

357
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,035
not to get treatment?

358
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:52,961
Do... Do you smoke?

359
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,481
What?

360
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,487
Socially, a bit.

361
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,549
This isn't lung cancer.

362
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,813
There's an old adage...

363
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,663
A saying that...

364
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,758
the reason that smokers don't believe
a cigarette can kill them

365
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:15,908
is because a cigarette
has never killed them before.

366
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:18,855
I don't understand.

367
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,442
I'm wondering If you really

368
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:24,507
believe...

369
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:27,118
that you have cancer.

370
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:32,040
I know I have cancer.

371
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,751
Yes, but do you believe
what you know?

372
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,586
What else did
the oncologist tell you?

373
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:55,396
She said that I was at stage three
and I should start chemo immediately.

374
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,438
- Do you trust her?
- No.

375
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:59,432
- Why not?
- I just don't like her.

376
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:03,690
Could that possibly be
because she was telling you

377
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,448
that you do have cancer?

378
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,950
I just told you I want to look
into alternative medicine,

379
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:10,400
maybe a homeopath.

380
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:13,011
Do you see any pattern
between going to different therapists

381
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:15,124
and going to different doctors?

382
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:20,964
Did you tell the other therapist
about your disease?

383
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:22,918
Why not?

384
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,247
{\Because }I could tell
she wasn't really interested in me.

385
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:28,930
- And how could you tell that?
- She told me the same story twice.

386
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,114
You know, I've been thinking
about that story.

387
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:35,179
The man who needs assistance...

388
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:38,531
He refuses to ask
and refuses to ask, and then...

389
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:42,653
when he finally has no other choice
he goes up to the cop, but...

390
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:45,483
instead of asking for help,

391
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,408
he assumes
the cop is going to insult him,

392
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:50,928
so...

393
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:54,318
he insults himself before the cop
has a chance to say a word.

394
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:58,042
I think it's really
the story of a man

395
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,571
who's undergoing
an intense internal conflict,

396
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,625
a man who has a hard time

397
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:06,287
trusting other people.

398
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,461
It was just a joke.

399
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,663
But I'm just wondering
if she told it twice for a reason{\, April}.

400
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:17,145
Is it possible, do you think,
that she really was listening to you?

401
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,279
- She was a moron.
- That might be true,

402
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,566
but she may have been trying
to tell you that

403
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,293
it's okay to rely on other people,

404
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:29,198
that it's okay to ask for help.

405
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,510
- This is ridiculous.
- Everybody at some point

406
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,287
in their lives needs help,
and I think that

407
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:37,165
- you need help now.
- You haven't heard a word I've said.

408
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:40,960
I think you need to have a conversation
that takes place outside your own head.

409
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,390
I think that you need to talk
to your oncologist.

410
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:46,507
I think you need to tell her that you're
considering alternative therapies.

411
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,635
I think you need to ask her
how she thinks you should proceed.

412
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,406
- And you do need to tell your parents.
- Just stop it.

413
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,099
- You're at stage three.
- Stop it. Stop it.

414
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:56,570
Stop it.

415
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,855
How dare you tell me what to do?
You do not know me.

416
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,400
What, did you formulate your little
theory as soon as I walked in?

417
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:07,570
"Young girl, cancer...
This is an easy one."

418
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,977
You have no idea
what I am capable of.

419
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:11,755
You're right, I don't.

420
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,337
- Would you like to tell me?
- You know, I...

421
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:18,009
I have to go...
Our time's up.

422
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:20,801
April, I'm sorry that you felt
I was telling you what to do

423
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,914
before I've gotten
to know you, but...

424
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,296
but I do think that
we should schedule another session.

425
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,065
Let me think about it.

426
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,835
How is friday... Friday afternoon?

427
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,433
You know, I actually...
I don't have my schedule this week.

428
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,680
I'll call you when I get back
to the dorm.

429
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,402
When do you think that will be?
I don't know.

430
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,312
This time is very crucial.

431
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,814
- So I hear.
- So...

432
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,854
- What about the session?
- I'll call you, okay?

433
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:47,027
Thank you.
