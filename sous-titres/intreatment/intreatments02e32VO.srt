1
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:27,060
<i>Paul, it's April.</i>

2
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,907
<i>I, uh, I got the test results.</i>

3
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,883
<i>I'd like to come in for one last session.</i>

4
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,407
<i>I'll see you this afternoon.</i>

5
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:39,556
April?

6
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:46,850
<i>Paul, it's April.</i>

7
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>I, uh, I got the test results.</i>

8
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,533
<i>I'd like to come in for one last session.</i>

9
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,005
<i>I'll see you this afternoon.</i>

10
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,001
In Treatment, S02E32
April: Week Seven

11
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,759
It's the hat, isn't it?

12
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,236
Looks... looks nice.

13
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,212
It looks ridiculous.

14
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:37,214
So... so your message, you...
you, you got the results?

15
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,898
Well, it itches like crazy.

16
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:43,020
- You can take it off if --
- No.

17
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,000
- Daniel gave it to me.
- Oh.

18
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,526
- I didn't realize that you told him about --
- I didn't. My mother did.

19
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,300
I was afraid to.

20
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,529
Afraid of how he might react?

21
00:01:57,306 --> 00:02:00,680
I was afraid that he wouldn't react.

22
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:07,903
I was afraid he would walk away, rattling off
baseball statistics or something.

23
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:12,999
When our dog died, he didn't seem to notice.

24
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,134
And he loved that dog.

25
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:19,500
But then, like three months later,
he turned into the kid from "The Exorcist"

26
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,164
and started telling everyone he met
that they were gonna die.

27
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,289
Did you tell him before or
after the tests came back?

28
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,880
Right afterwards.

29
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,437
They came over.

30
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:36,321
My mother brought me a cake,
and Daniel gave me this hat.

31
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,677
It was like my birthday.

32
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:42,728
So, you're saying that you
have something to... to celebrate?

33
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,559
It's working.

34
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:49,016
The mass behind my spine is shrinking.

35
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:52,438
So, that means: the prognosis is good.

36
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,621
Yes. Yeah.

37
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,233
Wow. That's great news.

38
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:02,478
I'm just so... so relieved.

39
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:04,291
What do you feel?

40
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,290
I don't know.

41
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:13,838
- You don't know? That's, that's not like you.
- Yeah, it's weird.

42
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:16,822
When they first told you, were you surprised?

43
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,978
Did you, did you believe them?

44
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,979
Are you alone here?

45
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:26,129
- Yes.
- But don't you have children?

46
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,730
- I mean, you told me you have children.
- I do.

47
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,687
Where are they?

48
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:36,186
They... they live with their mother.

49
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:41,168
Hm... so you couldn't make it work either,
and you're a therapist.

50
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:46,103
Maybe this is why therapists
don't talk about their personal lives.

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,064
Kyle and Sienna broke up.

52
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:55,625
- When?
- Last week, I guess.

53
00:03:56,323 --> 00:04:01,196
He took me out to dinner,
and he gave me this necklace.

54
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:05,662
It's a wishbone or something,
on a silk chain.

55
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,791
Which is apparently supposed to brake

56
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:12,815
and, when it does,
you're supposed to make a wish.

57
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:15,918
And what are you gonna wish for?

58
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:19,730
We went out for two years,
and he never gave me any jewelry.

59
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:24,042
To what... what you make of that?

60
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,335
I guess he feels guilty.

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,729
That's a possibility.

62
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:34,232
He'll probably tell me that he cares about me
and he's trying to express himself.

63
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:38,230
That's... that's another possibility.

64
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,199
It's too late.

65
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,261
Why?

66
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:49,013
I'm gone.

67
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:55,479
You mean... you're "gone" beyond an emotion?

68
00:04:55,514 --> 00:05:01,464
I mean, the girl he loved,
the girl he thinks he loves...

69
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,407
she doesn't exist any more.

70
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,552
Even if my hair grows back
and I go into remission,

71
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:12,424
from now on anybody that I meet, I'm...

72
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:16,385
- I may have to tell them I had cancer.
- Why?

73
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,812
Because it's true.

74
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,817
So, are you saying that
your cancer has erased everything

75
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:25,480
that came before, that your old self
is just, is just gone?

76
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:30,107
I was sitting across the table from Kyle...

77
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,065
and I knew I could take him home with me,
even now, with no hair.

78
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:39,815
I miss him.

79
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,000
But the idea of getting into bed with him,

80
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,878
taking my clothes off and
letting him close to me, letting him...

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,666
It's disgusting. I mean,
I don't want it, ever again.

82
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,303
This is just what you're feeling now, April.
That will change.

83
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,287
What kind of person doesn't want sex?

84
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,742
You see what I'm saying?

85
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,895
- I'm dead, I'm gone.
- You're not gone, April.

86
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,473
You, you are... you are recovering.

87
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:11,434
And you've only got enough strength for one
thing right now, and that's to get better.

88
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,652
You're right.

89
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:19,038
- What?
- Don't think I ever heard you say that before.

90
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,382
Consider it a parting gift.

91
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:28,559
Is that your way of reminding me
why you said in your message...

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,246
that you want this to be your last session?

93
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,006
Yes.

94
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:36,877
And, please, don't try to convince me to stay.

95
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:42,780
It's just that it's important for your recovery
to talk about everything else that's going on.

96
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:43,963
I don't want to.

97
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:47,130
I know you don't want to,
but isn't that your pattern, April?

98
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,009
- Stop it.
- That's what we've been working on:

99
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,800
your pushing me away.

100
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,869
- Just let me help you.
- I can't!

101
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,755
Of course you can.

102
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,178
What I want to do is,
I want to schedule some meetings

103
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,070
for your parents, bring them into therapy.

104
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:02,675
- Maybe we could bring in Daniel --
- Stop it! I said no!

105
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,819
- Your mother and Daniel --
- Stop it, you fucking asshole!

106
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,913
Is everything okay?

107
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,695
I had to go scratch my head.

108
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,290
- I'm sorry.
- No apologies.

109
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,302
Why don't I have to apologize?
Is it because I'm sick?

110
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,866
Because I'm your therapist.

111
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,519
So what? You're not a human being?

112
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:51,382
Someone calls you a "fucking asshole"
and you don't care?

113
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:56,944
I told you the day we met that I didn't want
you to be taking care of my feelings.

114
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,367
What's the point of therapy, then?
Teaching people to be self-obsessed?

115
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:05,415
Do you really think I need
more help in that department?

116
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,602
Do you wanna sit down?

117
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:32,266
I understand that maybe you reacted
because a part of you wants to leave,

118
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,935
but maybe you reacted so strongly because,

119
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,865
well, part of you wants to leave,
another part of you realizes

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,619
that something valuable is actually
happening in this room.

121
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:46,367
I could be a perfect person.

122
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,228
I could reach nirvana.

123
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:54,093
And I could wake up tomorrow
with a lump in my breast.

124
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:58,403
- So you're saying, "What's the point"?
- Yes.

125
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:00,852
What's the point?

126
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:07,696
Why don't you just take it off?

127
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,444
I don't want to.

128
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,978
And I don't wanna talk about why not or,

129
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,478
or why Daniel gave me the wrong hat

130
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:24,230
or why I can't let you see me bald.

131
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,137
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

132
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,979
You're right.

133
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:39,774
I dropped out of school.

134
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,465
When?

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,220
Last week.

136
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,053
Is it because of the chemo?

137
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:51,604
But you're almost done.
Don't you want to graduate?

138
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,793
I'm never gonna get a job
as an architect anyway.

139
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,758
- Why do you say that?
- You saw my work. It's shit.

140
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,620
- I don't agree with that.
- It doesn't matter any more.

141
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:04,761
I'm so far behind, you know,
there's no way I could catch up.

142
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:08,210
Well, actually, you haven't missed
that much time at all.

143
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm sure the school would work with you.

144
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,823
I wasn't even going for me.

145
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,695
I was going for my mother.

146
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,844
She got so nervous when I was graduating
college because I didn't have a plan.

147
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:26,200
She wanted me to get an advanced degree
so she wouldn't have to worry about me...

148
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,108
because I was on a "path to success".

149
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:36,296
She used to say, "A mother is only
as happy as her least happy child."

150
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:40,323
Then she would look over at Daniel and sigh.

151
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:46,005
And I would think,
"You're staring at the wrong kid, lady."

152
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,900
Well...

153
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:58,985
Okay, let's, let's... let's say
that you did wanna take some time off.

154
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,310
Why wouldn't you just take,
like, a leave of absence?

155
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,809
I won't go back.

156
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,949
So, you're not just gotten tired of me,

157
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,460
you're actually gotten tired with everything.

158
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:13,900
What am I supposed to do?
Go sit in a classroom,

159
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:19,302
suck up to my teachers?
Snort Ritalin with my friends, really?

160
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,523
I have cancer.

161
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,054
I'm 23 and I have cancer.

162
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,173
How the fuck am I supposed to top that?

163
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:31,012
Where the hell do I go from here?

164
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:35,769
April, if you could go anywhere you want
and anywhere at all, where would you go?

165
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,665
Back.

166
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,328
- You mean, home?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:53,213
But isn't... isn't your home
so long ago and so far away?

168
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,964
You remember that?

169
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:04,841
There are these organic farms
all over the world.

170
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:09,213
And they give you free room
and board for your labor.

171
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:13,029
I was thinking about just
going from one to another.

172
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,124
For how long?

173
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,185
I don't know.

174
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,089
Until I forget my own name.

175
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:27,852
Well, unless you develop amnesia, the chances
of that happening are slim to none.

176
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,714
There is a girl in chemo with me...

177
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,700
um, she was about my age...

178
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:40,936
Her name was Lyric. Lyric Merriman.

179
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,273
That was such a beautiful name.

180
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,999
She didn't make it?

181
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,800
No. She died.

182
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,090
Sorry.

183
00:12:54,808 --> 00:13:00,581
Last time I saw her, we were sitting
side by side, attached to our drips.

184
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:05,125
It looked like she was doodling
in her notebook, just doodling.

185
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,654
And so I leaned over, uh,
to look at it, and...

186
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:17,534
She was writing her name...

187
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,555
over and over...

188
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:26,681
in all different scripts... just her name.

189
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:31,363
Maybe she was afraid of being forgotten.

190
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:36,646
It's difficult to be the one who survives.

191
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,187
I don't want to.

192
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:43,449
Survive?

193
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:51,155
Just... seems so hard.

194
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,643
Living?

195
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:58,842
Did living seem hard before you got sick?

196
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:00,168
No.

197
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,855
There used to be this path...

198
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,777
and it was... like... it was steep,

199
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:16,626
it was tiring, but it was,
you know... well lit.

200
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:20,966
- It's not there any more?
- It's completely gone.

201
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:28,825
- Did I make it all up?
- No. You just got rerouted.

202
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:35,540
Your life's path has changed...
without your consent.

203
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:41,875
It must be so hard to handle.

204
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,428
April, what you're feeling is normal.

205
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:49,245
It makes, it makes perfect sense.

206
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,778
But you are going to grow older...

207
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:57,311
you're gonna fall in love again,
you're gonna have children if you want to.

208
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:01,059
You'll have adventures, you'll know such joy.

209
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,989
You don't know that, and I don't know that.

210
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:05,338
No, no, no, of course we don't.

211
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:10,202
But sometimes, we just have to
act as if we do.

212
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,527
It's not gonna work.

213
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,433
Look, you've gone through the worst of it,

214
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:19,265
you've already started a climb
out of the hole, you can't see that yet.

215
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,331
Are you okay?

216
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:50,896
I think I'm gonna be alone my whole life.

217
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,473
Why would you say that?

218
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:58,085
That's just a... feeling I have,
like a... premonition.

219
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,090
I can't imagine loving anyone ever again.

220
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:06,370
I don't know how I did it once.

221
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,743
Looks exhausting.

222
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,148
I know what you mean.

223
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,247
I have cancer. What's your excuse?

224
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:22,352
I'm... no longer 23.

225
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,683
I went on your page again last night.

226
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,135
My -- my what?

227
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,104
Your page. You know, online,

228
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,800
where people can comment
on you as a therapist.

229
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:42,281
Ah yes, my sad, empty, little web domain.

230
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,006
So, it's not empty any more.

231
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:49,491
Someone wrote a comment,
someone named, uh, Sophie.

232
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,982
Was she a patient of yours?

233
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:58,509
Actually, I, I can't, uh,
I can't discuss my other patients.

234
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:02,919
- Not even with me?
- No.

235
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:08,560
She says you saved her life.

236
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,864
You should go look at the page.

237
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:17,321
She has a lot of nice things
to say about you.

238
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:21,566
She's in college. She sounds happy.

239
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,822
Well, I will.

240
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:28,561
Thank you. Thanks for telling me.

241
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,073
You've really helped me.

242
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:41,154
April, I, I really didn't do that much.

243
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,851
I took you to chemo. I told your mother.

244
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:48,289
- The rest, you did yourself.
- Let me thank you.

245
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah, but it's important that you see
how you took responsibility for yourself,

246
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:54,620
by coming to see me.

247
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,635
Let me thank you.

248
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:01,635
And then let me leave.

249
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,631
Are you... are you sure?

250
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:10,293
I mean, we have, we have accomplished
so much in this room.

251
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:15,292
You are not the same person
who came in here two months ago.

252
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,994
Came in with cancer, I'm leaving with cancer.

253
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,321
That's not what I'm talking about, April.

254
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:23,416
You were so angry when you got here.

255
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:26,990
- I'm still angry.
- Yeah, I know, but now you can talk about it.

256
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:31,308
When I first met you, you couldn't
acknowledge that anything would hurt you.

257
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,733
Now everything hurts me.

258
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:38,381
The rain hurts me.
I feel like I have no skin.

259
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:44,092
Well, therapeutically, that's...
that's a good thing.

260
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:50,892
I mean, you've learned so much
about yourself, about trust and acceptance,

261
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,324
about not needing to be perfect all the time.

262
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,750
I mean, I know it's hard to see that now, but

263
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:01,824
the great thing about self-knowledge is
that once you have it... you have it.

264
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:07,386
And you can't help but put it into use.

265
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,824
Okay.

266
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,583
You still have challenges ahead of you,
that's why I think

267
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,185
you really need to keep talking to somebody.

268
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,826
Maybe... but not you.

269
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:20,398
That can't be you.

270
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,504
'Cause I'm the guy who took you to chemo?

271
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,782
You're the guy who saved my life.

272
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,933
Do you want me to refer you
to an other therapist?

273
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,794
Maybe later.

274
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:41,757
Not now. Right now...
I just wanna breathe, and get well.

275
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:45,723
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

276
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:49,031
People do survive without therapy.

277
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:52,178
It's very hard for me to hear that, but...

278
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,924
I guess you're right.

279
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,223
Can you hold on for a second?

280
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:25,285
This, uh... this might be
easier on your head, it's...

281
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,858
- It's made of leather.
- It's beautiful.

282
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,196
It was my father's.

283
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,895
- Then you should keep it.
- No. It's for you.

284
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,873
Are you sure?

285
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:39,201
Hm-hmm.

286
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:46,263
- Can I try it on?
- Sure.

287
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,052
Okay.

288
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:06,848
Wow.

289
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,315
Oh, my mom's gonna love this.

290
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,950
She really rocks the whole
Amelia Earheart look.

291
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:19,077
Silk scarfs and leather jackets
are kind of her thing.

292
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,577
- I thought Cuba was her thing.
- Well, she's complicated.

293
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:31,035
- Not everything's black and white, Paul.
- I'll try to remember that.

294
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,764
Thank you.

295
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,688
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
