2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,134
- Dude, where did that come from?
- Locke.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,982
What if he's trying to
get us killed each other?

4
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:07,219
--do nothing!

5
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,523
You have to trust me

6
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:09,818
Sorry, doc, I don't.

7
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:13,436
Sayid!

8
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,731
Go! I'll get her free.
No, we can do this!

9
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:22,282
Just go! Save Sawyer!

10
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,171
I won't leave you.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,578
I love you, sun. I love you!

12
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,385
What about Jin and sun?

13
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:17,164
Morning.

14
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:18,739
Morning.

15
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:19,851
I made breakfast.

16
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,763
You know, technically,
opening a box of cereal

17
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,172
Is not making breakfast.

18
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,172
So you're coming to the
concert tonight, right?

19
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:30,947
Absolutely.

20
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,987
Is your mom coming, too?

21
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:34,763
Yeah.

22
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:37,916
Why?

23
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,508
You're not gonna get all weird,
are you? Why would I get weird?

24
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,515
Just don't get weird.

25
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:44,965
I won't.

26
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,508
Morning.

27
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:53,203
Morning. Morning.

28
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:57,019
You want some cereal?

29
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,491
Um, sure. Thanks.

30
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:09,708
How you feeling?

31
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:10,779
Uh, pretty good.

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,179
I mean, he kicks like
crazy at night, so...

33
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,955
Jack Shephard.

34
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:23,435
hello, Mr. Shephard.

35
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,995
Uh, this is oceanic
airlines calling

36
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,635
To inform you that we've, um,

37
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,379
We've located your
missing cargo.

38
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,620
My father's coffin-
you found it?

39
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,220
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,412
It'll be arriving in Los
Angeles by the end of the day.

41
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,891
That's, uh, that's great news.
Thank you.

42
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:41,933
Of course, sir.

43
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,500
We at oceanic are very
sorry it's taken so long.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,939
Good day, sir.

45
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:12,388
This was the best I could do,

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,036
And it's gonna hurt a bit.

47
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:28,795
The bullet went,

48
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,900
But if I don't do this,
it's gonna get infected.

49
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,404
okay. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,124
They had a little girl,
you know.

51
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,467
Her name was...

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,659
Ji yeon.

53
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,883
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

54
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,372
Locke did this to them.

55
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,228
We have to kill him, Jack.

56
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,253
I know.

Lost - 6x16 "What They Died
For" Aired on may 18, 2010

59
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,876
We should get going now.

60
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:22,219
Go where?

61
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,644
Before Sayid died,
he said that Desmond was in a well.

62
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,756
If Locke wants Desmond dead,
then we're gonna need him.

63
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,060
Welcome back, Mr. Locke.
It's good to see you.

64
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:51,324
Thank you. You, too.

65
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,788
Hey! Don't you dare.

66
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,948
It's him! The guy
who hit Mr. Locke!

67
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,316
Somebody call the
police right now!

68
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,084
I saw what you did. I'm making a
citizen's arrest. Do not get in my way.

69
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:09,844
Don't you--

70
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,261
I will not let you hurt Mr.
Locke again!

71
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,292
I'm not here to hurt him.
I am here...

72
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,459
To help him let go. Who are you?

73
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:25,765
You wanna know who I am?

74
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,108
You sure this is
a shortcut, huh?

75
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,301
I lived in these houses
a long time, miles.

76
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:02,780
I think I can remember
how to get there.

77
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,379
Well, I lived in these houses
30 years before you did--

78
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,243
Otherwise known as last week.

79
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,973
And I have no idea where the hell we
are. Guess it's a good thing you're
following me.

80
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:13,220
You mind if I ask

81
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:15,467
How much explosive you
have access to, Ben?

82
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,755
More than enough to destroy
the plane ten times over

83
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,371
And keep it from ever
leaving this island.

84
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,627
Been a long time.
You sure it's still there?

85
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,108
It's c-4, Richard.
I put some thought into hiding it.

86
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:27,740
Let me guess--cookie jar.

87
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,203
Don't be ridiculous.

88
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,772
It's in my secret room
behind the bookcase.

89
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,499
What's wrong?

90
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,012
It's just, I, you know,
I get wonky around dead stuff.

91
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,741
Do you have something you
wanna share with us, miles?

92
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,291
I-I don't think--

93
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:07,692
What is it? It's Alex.

94
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,300
It's your daughter.

95
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,740
After you left, I buried her.

96
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,163
Thank you, Richard.

97
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,285
What's that? A secreter room?

98
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:09,412
It's where I was told I
could summon the monster.

99
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:13,443
<i>That's before I realized that it
was the one summoning me.</i>

100
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,332
Okay. Richard, it's your idea.

101
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,932
Are we looking to cripple the
plane or blow it to hell?

102
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:34,860
Blow it to hell.

103
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,540
Then we'd better take it all.

104
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,316
Don't move!

105
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:56,579
Show me your hands.

106
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,388
Calm down. It's--it's okay.

107
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,052
Who the hell are you?

108
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,163
She's with me.

109
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,163
Hello, Benjamin.

110
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:09,995
May I come in?

111
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,529
What are you doing here?

112
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:21,912
Put the gun down, Benjamin.

113
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,193
Go to the dock.

114
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,952
Take out equipment from the
outrigger and then sink it.

115
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,857
You got it. She's not going anywhere.
If you don't answer me,

116
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,296
I swear I'll-- if you shoot me,

117
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,409
Then your last chance of
survival will be gone.

118
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,288
Go. He won't do anything.

119
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,202
What are you doing here,
Richard?

120
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,033
We're getting explosives

121
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,473
To destroy the plane
on the other island.

122
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,770
Why would you want to do that?
None of your damned business.

123
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,120
I've had that plane rigged with
explosives since I got here.

124
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,898
As usual, Benjamin,
I'm three steps ahead of you.

125
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,017
How did you get back here,
Charles?

126
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,673
Jacob invited me

127
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,610
That's a lie. You've
never even seen Jacob.

128
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,481
I most certainly have.
He visited me,

129
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,409
Not long after your people
destroyed my freighter.

130
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,482
He convinced me of
the error of my ways

131
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,945
And told me everything
I need to know

132
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:16,738
For this exact purpose.

133
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,521
What purpose?

134
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:22,537
Charles?

135
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,096
Yes.

136
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,496
It's Locke. He's coming.

137
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,504
Has he seen you? No,
I don't think so.

138
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,818
Our boat is still there.
I didn't have time to--

139
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,530
Run. Get back here
as fast as you can.

140
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:38,673
If you don't want to die,
we need to hide.

141
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,553
This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.

142
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,057
<i>It's Dr. Linus, actually.</i>

143
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,305
I'll go get you an ice pack.

144
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,610
Dr. Linus?

145
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:09,025
Are you all right?
I heard there was

146
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,496
A--an incident in the parking lot.
Yes, I got into a fight.

147
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,338
A fight? With who?

148
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,729
I saw the man that ran
you down, Mr. Locke.

149
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,642
He was back. I approached him,
and he just...

150
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,401
Attacked me.

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,649
And then the strangest
thing happened.

152
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,450
While he was beating me,

153
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:30,593
<i>I think-- I think I
saw something.</i>

154
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,185
What are you doing?

155
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:34,738
I'm calling the police.

156
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,449
You may not want to do that.
Well, why wouldn't I want to?

157
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:41,417
The man told me that he
wasn't trying to hurt you.

158
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,369
He told me that he was
trying to get you to let go.

159
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,161
l.A.P.D.

160
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,865
And for some reason,
I believed him.

161
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,513
Hello? L.A.P.D.

162
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,201
Do you have any idea what he
was talking about, Mr. Locke?

163
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,081
Does that mean something to you?

164
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,058
Hello? L.A.P.D.

165
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,289
Excuse me.

166
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:11,793
Um...

167
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,120
I'd like to see a
Detective, please.

168
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,657
What's with the getup?
Somebody die?

169
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,137
The benefit at my dad's museum?

170
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,442
The concert I've been
telling you about all week?

171
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:25,377
Ring a bell? Yeah,
it's all I've been thinking about.

172
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,554
You can still be my date if you want
to. That red-headed chick that hates me
gonna be there?

173
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,385
Charlotte. Yeah.

174
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,288
Yeah, pass.

175
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:36,289
Detective Ford, this guy's
got somethin' to tell ya.

176
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:37,449
Yeah?

177
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,313
Um...

178
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,201
There was a hit and
run a few days ago

179
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:44,873
At Washington
Tustin high school.

180
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,752
And then this morning

181
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,113
One of the teachers there was--

182
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:54,026
Was beaten badly by the-
by the same suspect.

183
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,058
Yeah? And?

184
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,978
I'm the suspect.

185
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:11,938
Thanks for saving the
taxpayers the trouble

186
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:13,953
Of hunting you down.

187
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,241
You're welcome.

188
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,417
Good afternoon.

189
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,003
And how are you doing today?

190
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,226
Terrific.

191
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,457
Any idea exactly
where this well is?

192
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,928
Sayid said it was
close to our camp.

193
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:48,208
We're about an hour away.

194
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,425
If Locke wanted Desmond dead,
y didn't he just kl him?

195
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,505
Who knows? Maybe it's
one of his rules.

196
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,202
The bomb on the sub.

197
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:05,385
You said he couldn't kill us.

198
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,601
I've been wrong before.

199
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:17,641
I killed them, didn't I?

200
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:21,248
No.

201
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,145
<i>He killed them.</i>

202
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,209
You all right?

203
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,289
Yeah. I'm fine.

204
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,185
Okay.

205
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:02,585
Aah!

206
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,514
Give me the ashes.

207
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,762
What? Who are you?

208
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,610
Give me the ashes you took from
Ilana's things after she died.

209
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,089
I know they're in your pocket.

210
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,752
Why? Because they're mine.

211
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,105
What do you want 'em for?

212
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:20,225
Hey!

213
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,252
Hello, Hugo.

214
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,075
Dude.

215
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,028
I've been waiting for you to show up.
Where you been?

216
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,851
Doesn't matter. I'm here now.

217
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,852
Did you see a kid run
by here with your ashes?

218
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,515
My ashes are right
there in that fire.

219
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,034
When it burns out,
you'll never see me again.

220
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,579
Uh, what?

221
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:07,980
You should get your friends.

222
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,171
We're very close
to the end, Hugo.

223
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,867
Charles, let's go.

224
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,931
There's no time.
Linus has a hidden room. Come on.

225
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,540
What are you waiting for?
I'm not interested in hiding.

226
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,562
He's gonna find me
sooner or later anyway.

227
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,220
I'd rather have it over with. These are
both great plans, but I'm gonna go with
surviving.

228
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,810
If you need us, we'll be
running through the jungle.

229
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:51,810
Miles, wait.

230
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:55,067
Give me your
walkie-talkies. Why?

231
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:56,195
Because I asked.

232
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:04,051
Thank you. In case I need you.

233
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:05,354
He's gonna kill you.
You know that.

234
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,354
Then I guess this is good-bye.

235
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,635
Care to join me outside while
I wait for the inevitable?

236
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:21,178
I-I'm gonna talk to him.
I know this man.

237
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,035
All he wants is for
me to join him,

238
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:24,301
And if I can get him
to leave with me,

239
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,434
Maybe that'll give the rest of you
a chance. Good luck with that.

240
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,178
Just the man I was looking for.

241
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,218
Well, you found me.

242
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,427
Can I get you a
glass of lemonade?

243
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,811
I need you...

244
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:06,299
To kill some people for me, Ben.

245
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,138
And why would I do that?

246
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,930
Because once I
leave this island,

247
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,258
You can have it all to yourself.

248
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:18,875
All right.

249
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:20,843
Good.

250
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:25,067
Now... Whose outrigger
is that down at the dock?

251
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,635
I believe it's
Charles Widmore's.

252
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:31,602
And do you know where
I might find him?

253
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,195
He's hiding in my closet.

254
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,266
Oh, my god. Hey, Dr. Linus.

255
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,435
Hello, Alex.

256
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:55,802
Oh, my god. What happened?

257
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,178
I found myself
confronting someone

258
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:58,700
That had a bit of
a temper. What?

259
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,779
<i>Why would someone want
to hurt you?</i>

260
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:05,292
You're, Li, the--the nicest guy ever. I
guess they had me confused with
somebody else.

261
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,138
Well, you shouldn't be driving.

262
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,899
My mom's waiting
for me over there.

263
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,083
Let us give you a ride home.

264
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:14,714
Oh, no, I'm not going
to be any trouble to you

265
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,283
Dr. Linus, please.

266
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,867
You've got one hand.
You look like napoléon.

267
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,011
Excellent point.

268
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,547
Hey, mom!

269
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:29,355
Is it okay if we give Dr.
Linus a ride home?

270
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,594
of course.

271
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,956
After everything you have
done for my daughter,

272
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,955
A ride is the least we can do.

273
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:39,843
I'm Danielle.

274
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,722
Benjamin Linus.

275
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,844
Hey, mom, can Dr.
Linus come over for dinner?

276
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,635
It's coq Au Vin night.

277
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,970
Oh, that's really not necessary-- oh,
no, no, we insist,

278
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:51,620
Even if we have to kidnap you.

279
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,459
Here, please.

280
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,003
do you mind getting that plate?

281
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,483
Dr. Linus...

282
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:05,851
Thank you.

283
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,554
It's so nice to be able
to cook for someone

284
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,035
Other than Alex.

285
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:15,282
If you don't mind my asking,
where is her father?

286
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,930
He died when Alex was 2.

287
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,124
oh.

288
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:23,362
That's probably why she's
so attached to you.

289
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:26,995
Excuse me?

290
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,730
All the interest
you've taken in her,

291
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,826
All the help you've given...

292
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,299
You're the closest thing
to a father she's ever had.

293
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,049
Are you...

294
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,354
Are u all right?

295
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,369
I'm fine. I'm sure
it's the onions.

296
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,954
Oh. I'll put in less next time.

297
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:11,001
(chuckle

298
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,177
After you.

299
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,954
Charles and his lady
friend are in here.

300
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,393
She's armed,

301
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:36,554
But I'm guessing that's
not a problem for you.

302
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,067
Mm.

303
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,209
Wait out here.

304
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:45,234
<i>You don't need to see this.
I want to see this.</i>

305
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,050
Sorry, Charles.

306
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,178
What a pleasant surprise.

307
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:14,810
How nice to be able to talk

308
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:16,562
Without those fences between us.

309
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,275
And who might you be?

310
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:23,745
Zoe. My name is Zoe. I--

311
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,561
Don't talk to him.
Don't say anything.

312
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,362
why would you do that?

313
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,729
You told her not to talk to me.
That made her pointless.

314
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:36,722
Now, Charles,

315
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,770
It's clear you're
not afraid to die.

316
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,241
So there's only one
way to motivate you

317
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:42,753
To tell me what I want to know.

318
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:49,745
Soon, this will all be over.
I'll get what I want.

319
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,664
And I'll finally
leave this island.

320
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:55,178
And when I do, the first
thing I'm going to do

321
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,457
Is kill your daughter.

322
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,090
Penny.

323
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,019
You'll kill her whether
I talk to you or not.

324
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:06,825
No, I won't. I give you my word.

325
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,330
And I'm supposed
to take your word?

326
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:14,130
You tell me why I
came back here,

327
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,586
And I won't hurt your daughter.

328
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:22,674
I brought Desmond Hume back here

329
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:26,137
Because of his unique
resistance to electromagnetism.

330
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,234
He was a measure of last resort.

331
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:34,753
What do you mean, "last resort"?

332
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:36,513
I'm not saying any
more in front of him.

333
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:47,169
Well, then whisper to me.

334
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:51,585
Hmm?

335
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:08,001
<i>He doesn't get to save
his daughter.</i>

336
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,323
Ben... You never
cease to amaze me.

337
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:21,762
Fortunately, he had already
told me what I needed to know,

338
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:24,249
So... No harm done.

339
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:26,449
Good.

340
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:32,258
Did you say there were
some other people to kill?

341
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:50,914
Hello, Kate.

342
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:53,074
James.

343
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,762
Jack.

344
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,914
He's right there by the fire.
He says hello-- I heard him.

345
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,689
What, you can see him?

346
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,746
Yeah, I can see him.

347
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,874
Kate? Sawyer? You, too?

348
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,610
So you're the one who wrote
our names on the wall.

349
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,025
I am.

350
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,874
Sun and Jin Kwon
and Sayid Jarrah--

351
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:25,338
You wrote their names
on the wall? Yes.

352
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,265
Is that why they're dead?

353
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,282
I'm very sorry.

354
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,650
you're sorry?

355
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,786
Kate. No, I wanna know why.

356
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,610
I wanna know that sun
and Jin and Sayid

357
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,314
Didn't die for nothing.

358
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:51,177
Come and sit down

359
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,010
And I'll tell you
what they died for.

360
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,178
I'll tell you why
I chose them...

361
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,785
<i>And why I chose you.</i>

362
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,978
And then I'll tell you
everything you need to know

363
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,058
About protecting this island,
because by the time

364
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,466
That fire burns out,

365
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,138
<i>One of you is gonna have
to start doing it.</i>

366
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:39,818
You got a minute?

367
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,906
Mr. Locke. Yes.

368
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:43,906
yes, come on in.

369
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,186
Is that your son?

370
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,874
Yes. That's, uh,
last Thanksgiving.

371
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:57,802
He looks just like you.

372
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,018
<i>Don't tell him that.</i>

373
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,890
So what can I do for you,
Mr. Locke?

374
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,851
Dr. Shephard, you and I were
on the same plane from Sydney.

375
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,929
You gave me your card, and...

376
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,155
Next day, I threw it away.
No offense.

377
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,580
None taken.

378
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,346
Anyway...

379
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:26,801
Then a few days later,
I get hit by a car.

380
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:28,930
And of all the doctors
in Los Angeles,

381
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,257
I ended up with you.

382
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:34,505
Then a-after you saved my life,

383
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,674
You still wanna fix me,
and I still...

384
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,826
Don't wanna be fixed.

385
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:42,457
Okay.

386
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:43,658
Then...

387
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:47,146
The man who ran me down

388
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:50,282
Shows up at my
school today again.

389
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,106
He beat up a teacher
in the parking lot.

390
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,067
But do you know
what he said to him?

391
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,666
He said that he wasn't
there to hurt me.

392
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,946
He was there to
help me "let go,"

393
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,938
<i>Which is exactly the same thing
that you said to me</i>

394
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:07,001
The last time you and
I saw each other.

395
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:11,442
I'm sorry. Are--are you saying

396
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,849
That I sent this man
to run you down?

397
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,610
no. No, no. No, no, no.

398
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,385
But--but what if all this...

399
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,546
Maybe this is happening
for a reason.

400
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,289
<i>Maybe you're supposed
to fix me.</i>

401
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:31,642
Mr. Locke, I want to fix you,

402
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:35,745
But I think you're mistaking
coincidence for fate.

403
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:38,169
You can call it whatever you want,
but here I am,

404
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:40,089
And I...

405
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,002
I think I'm ready to
get out of this chair.

406
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,369
I don't really know
where to start.

407
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,929
How about with why you
brought us to the island?

408
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:07,994
I brought all of you here
because I made a mistake.

409
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:12,770
A mistake I made a
very long time ago,

410
00:31:12,978 --> 00:31:14,113
And now because of that,

411
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,769
<i>There's a very good chance that
every single one of you</i>

412
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:19,786
And every you've ever cared
about is going to die.

413
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,497
What mistake?

414
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,426
You call him "the monster."

415
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:30,890
But I'm responsible for
what happened to him.

416
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,809
I made him that way.

417
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:36,546
And ever since then,

418
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:38,842
He's been trying to kill me.

419
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,786
It was only a matter of time
before he figured out how,

420
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:46,562
And when he did,
someone would have to replace me.

421
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,506
And that's why I
brought you all here.

422
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,154
Tell me something, Jacob.

423
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,075
Why do I gotta be
punished for your mistake?

424
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,241
What made you think you
can mess with my life?

425
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:01,314
I was doin' just fine

426
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,130
Till you dragged my ass to this
damn rock. No, you weren't.

427
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,482
None of you were.

428
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:14,242
<i>I didn't pluck any of you out
of a happy existence.</i>

429
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,107
You were all flawed.

430
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:24,514
I chose you because
you were like me.

431
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,289
You were all alone.

432
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:29,457
You were all looking
for something

433
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,417
That you couldn't
find out there.

434
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:35,091
I chose you because
you needed this place

435
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:36,850
As much as it needed you.

436
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,106
Why did you cross my
name off of your wall?

437
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,770
Because you became a mother.

438
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,170
It's just a line
of chalk in a cave.

439
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:48,235
The job is yours if
you want it, Kate.

440
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,098
What is the job?

441
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,146
There's a light at the
center of the island.

442
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:03,146
You have to make sure
it never goes out.

443
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,337
That's how you protect it.

444
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,770
Your monster friend said there
was nothing to protect it from.

445
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,074
<i>You have to protect
it from him.</i>

446
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,410
You must do what I couldn't...

447
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:21,314
What I wasn't able to do.
You want us to kill him.

448
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,297
Is that even possible?
I hope so,

449
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,122
<i>Because he is certainly going
to try to kill you.</i>

450
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,586
So...

451
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,082
How you gonna pick?

452
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:45,186
I'm not going to pick, Hugo.

453
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:49,786
I want you to have the one
thing that I was never given--

454
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:51,858
A choice.

455
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,209
And if none of us chooses it?

456
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:56,802
Then this ends very badly.

457
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,641
I'll do it.

458
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,530
This is why I'm here.

459
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,425
This is...

460
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,105
This is what I'm supposed to do.

461
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,330
Is that a question, Jack?

462
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,714
No.

463
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,074
Good.

464
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:35,122
Then it's time.

465
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:48,049
And I thought that guy
had a god complex before.

466
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,090
James.

467
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:51,422
Yeah, I know.

468
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:56,185
I'm just glad it's not me.

469
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,530
Do you remember that
bamboo field you woke up in

470
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,890
When you first got here?

471
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:05,345
Yeah.

472
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,049
Beyond that field,
across a ridge,

473
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:09,601
Is the heart of the island.

474
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,066
That's where the light is.

475
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,129
That's where he's trying to go.

476
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:19,330
And that's what you
have to protect.

477
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:21,002
Past the bamboo?

478
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,298
There's nothing out there.

479
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,089
Yes, there is, Jack.

480
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:28,305
And now you'll be
able to get there.

481
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:37,897
Do you have a cup?

482
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,857
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.

483
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:06,941
Drink this.

484
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,908
How long am I gonna
have to do this job?

485
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,405
As long as you can.

486
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,469
Now you're like me.

487
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,461
All righty.
Here's Jarrah and Hume.

488
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,717
This little lady
next door is Austen.

489
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,352
It's been real nice
having y'all...

490
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:18,615
But you're shipping
off to county,

491
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:21,672
<i>So best of luck and
vaya con dios.</i>

492
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:28,977
you could still let me go.

493
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:30,840
why the hell would I do that?

494
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,984
Because I told you
I was innocent,

495
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:36,480
And you believed me.

496
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:37,640
Doesn't matter.

497
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,047
Still can't let you go.
I'm a cop.

498
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,232
You don't seem like a cop to me.

499
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:46,719
Nice knowing

500
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,069
1-f-21 responding.

501
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,070
I think it's time to leave.

502
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,428
What? I said,
I think it's time to leave.

503
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,406
Are you ready to
get out of here?

504
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:13,045
I'm sorry. Who are you? He's a
crazy person who turned himself in.

505
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:16,477
What'd you turn yourself in for?
I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.

506
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,260
You see what I mean?

507
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,773
All right. I'm crazy.

508
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:23,852
But do you want to get
out of here or not?

509
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:27,253
So, what, are you just gonna
tell the driver to stop?

510
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:30,061
The driver already knows where to stop.
But when that happens,

511
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:31,668
You're gonna have to
give me your trust.

512
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:34,525
Our trust? That's right.

513
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,437
Because after I set you free,

514
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,749
I'm gonna ask each of
you to do something,

515
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,741
And you're gonna have to
promise me that you'll do it.

516
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,772
So what do you say? Oh,
absolutely, I promise.

517
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:51,173
How about you?

518
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:52,701
Okay. Sure.

519
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:53,773
All right, then.

520
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:08,780
Who's Hume?

521
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:11,526
That's me. Where's your
friend with my money?

522
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:12,611
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to say

523
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,118
I shot all of you trying to escape.
Don't worry. He'll be here.

524
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,021
Oh, here he comes.

525
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,693
Sorry I'm late, dude.
Don't worry about it.

526
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:46,526
Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana Lucia
was gonna be here. Do I know you, tubby?

527
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:49,637
Oh. No. We never met.

528
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,933
Anyways, here's your money.

529
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,412
125 grand, right?

530
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:54,725
Yeah, that's right.

531
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,597
Nice not knowing you.

532
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:03,492
She's not coming with us? No,
she's not ready yet.

533
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,908
I brought you my camaro.

534
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:05,893
The keys are under
the floor mat.

535
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,101
Everything you need's is in the trunk.
All right, good.

536
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:09,828
Um, you know where
you're taking 'em, yeah?

537
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,189
Absolutely. All right, well,
we should get going.

538
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:18,685
Okay, you're with him, and you're with
me. What do you mean, I'm with you?

539
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:20,901
We...

540
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,861
Are going to a concert.

541
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:33,668
Let's go.

542
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:42,325
hey, can I ask you something?

543
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,606
Shoot.

544
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:48,076
If you can turn yourself
into smoke whenever you want,

545
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,141
Why do you bother walking?

546
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:53,190
I like the feel of my
feet on the ground.

547
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,557
Reminds me that I was human.

548
00:40:57,526 --> 00:40:58,510
We're here.

549
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:09,933
Are you thirsty?

550
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,430
This is the well I threw
Desmond Hume into.

551
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:18,572
What's the matter?

552
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,902
I sent Sayid to kill Desmond.

553
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,708
Obviously, he didn't.

554
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,156
Looks like someone
helped him out.

555
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,446
<i>No, Ben. Someone helped me out.</i>

556
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,982
What did Widmore say to you?

557
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,140
He said Desmond was a fail-safe.

558
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:51,252
Jacob's last resort in case,
god forbid,

559
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:53,660
I managed to kill all of
his beloved candidates--

560
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,253
One final way to make sure
that I never leave this place.

561
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,261
Then... Why are you happy
that he's still alive?

562
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:04,717
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

563
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:07,725
And when I do,
he's gonna help me

564
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:10,893
Do the one thing that I
could never do myself.

565
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,508
I'm gonna destroy the island.
