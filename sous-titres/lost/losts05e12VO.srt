<i>Previously on "Lost"</i>

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,745
- Is that Benjamin Linus?
- We need you to save his life.

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,780
If I take him,
he's not ever gonna be the same again.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,345
He will always be one of us.

5
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:20,180
Get your ass out here right now,
or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,045
I stole her as a baby
from an insane woman.

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,615
She means nothing to me.
So if you want to kill her,

8
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:27,515
go ahead and do it.

9
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,615
This guy is dangerous.

10
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:32,080
Sun, that boat I came here on
was filled with commandos

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,200
whose only mission was to get him.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,500
And how'd that work out for everyone?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,760
- You know him?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,860
He's the man who killed me.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,245
What have you done, Richard?

16
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,409
Calm down. Calm down.
This has nothing to do with you.

17
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,359
So it's true?

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,230
You actually brought
one of them to our temple?

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,915
He's just a boy, and he was dying.

20
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,680
Then you should've let him die.

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,500
Jacob wanted it done.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,315
The island chooses
who the island's chooses.

23
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:29,860
You know that.

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,530
Yes. yes, of course.

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,400
What's his name?

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,480
Hello, Benjamin.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,945
What happened?

28
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:06,245
You were injured.

29
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,415
How?

30
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,745
You don't remember?

31
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,745
Where am I?

32
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,015
You're among friends.

33
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,480
We're going to take care of you.

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,680
My dad. Is he here?

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,845
You'll be back to him soon enough.

36
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:25,815
No. No, I don't want to go back.

37
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:27,815
- Okay, easy. Easy.
- Oh!

38
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,500
I don't want to go back.

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,845
I wanna stay.

40
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,415
I wanna be one of you.

41
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:41,680
Just because you're living with them

42
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,745
doesn't mean you can't be one of us.

43
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,780
You should be dead, Benjamin.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,180
But this island...

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,260
it saved your life.

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,245
Who are you?

47
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,145
I'm Charles.

48
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,730
Charles Widmore.

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,000
Ben.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,345
Hello, Ben.

51
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,100
Welcome back to the land of the living.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,915
My God.

53
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,515
You're alive.

54
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, I am.

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,180
I knew it.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,815
I knew that this would happen.

57
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:44,445
Then why are you so surprised to see me?

58
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:49,045
Because it's one thing
to believe it, John.

59
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:52,545
It's another thing to see it.

60
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:56,015
Then why were you trying
to run away to the main island?

61
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:59,545
I broke the rules, John.

62
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,415
I came back to the island.

63
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:05,145
I was going to answer for what I'd done.

64
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,015
I was going back...

65
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,300
to be judged.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,260
Judged?

67
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,680
By whom?

68
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,680
Well, John,

69
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,445
we don't even have a word for it,

70
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:30,000
but I believe you call it the monster.

71
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,931
Lost Season 5 Episode 12:
"Dead is Dead"

72
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,715
Morning.

73
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,515
Hello.

74
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,445
What's in the crate?

75
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:06,915
Just some stuff we need to get moved.

76
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,715
Need a hand?

77
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,200
No, thanks. We got it.

78
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,200
Okay. Have a great day.

79
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,915
How're you feeling, my friend?

80
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:33,300
Like someone hit me
with an oar, but I'll live.

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,030
- What do you make of him?
- I'm not sure.

82
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,545
What has he told you?

83
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,615
When you were out cold,
he was watching over you.

84
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:48,280
And he said you killed him.

85
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,445
I killed him?

86
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,660
Really?
'Cause he looks fine to me.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,515
You know, I don't really
remember him from the plane.

88
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,700
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

89
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,815
What if...

90
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:15,480
he was already here,
before we crashed?

91
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,380
If he thinks I killed him,
then he's insane.

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,445
We may be dealing with a man
who's dangerously deranged.

93
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:25,215
Then the question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

94
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't worry, my friend.

95
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,500
I have your back.

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Caesar.

97
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,130
Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. I'm Ben.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,230
You want me to do it?

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,280
I can do it if you want me to, Ben.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,680
Shut up!

101
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,000
And stay here, Ethan.

102
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,530
Don't! Don't do it.

103
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,600
You're the one who
infected us, aren't you?!

104
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,845
No!

105
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,400
- Give me my baby.
- It's okay. It's okay, baby.

106
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,915
Please, don't take my Alex!

107
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,515
Do you want your baby to live?

108
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:23,560
Why are you taking her?

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,945
Be grateful you're still alive.

110
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,580
Now you listen to me.

111
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,980
If you try to follow me or
if you ever come looking for me,

112
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll kill you.

113
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,680
And if you want your child to live,

114
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,000
every time you hear whispers,
you run the other way.

115
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,730
What's that?

116
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Just something sentimental.

117
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,930
So this is your old office, huh?

118
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,245
I never pictured you
leading your people

119
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,245
from behind a desk.

120
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,680
It seems a little...

121
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,560
corporate.

122
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,129
Was there something that you needed, John?

123
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,140
Well, Ben, I was hoping
that you and I could talk

124
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,230
about the elephant in the room.

125
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,845
I assume you're referring
to the fact that I killed you.

126
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah.

127
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,245
It was the only way to get you
back to the island,

128
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,280
along with as many of those
who left as possible.

129
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,815
You do remember, John. That's why
you left in the first place,

130
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,315
to convince 'em to come back?

131
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,780
But you failed.

132
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,670
And the only way to bring them together
was by your death,

133
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,845
and you understood that.

134
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,315
It's why you were about to kill
yourself when I stopped you.

135
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:31,880
If all I had to do was die,
Ben, then why did you stop me?

136
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,845
You had critical information
that would've died with you.

137
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,600
And once you'd given it to me...

138
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,365
Well, I just didn't have time
to talk you back into hanging yourself.

139
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,080
So I took a shortcut.

140
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,245
And look at you, John.
I was right.

141
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:55,080
You're here. you're back.
So are the rest of them.

142
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know where yet exactly,
but they came. It worked.

143
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,645
And that's why I did it,

144
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,030
because it was in the best
interests of the island.

145
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,530
I was just hoping for an apology.

146
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,830
I've decided to help you, Ben.

147
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,145
Help me do what?

148
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:30,445
<i>Do what you say you are
on your way to do.</i>

149
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,480
Be judged.

150
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,045
That's not something
you want to see, John.

151
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:35,415
If everything you've done

152
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:38,380
has been in the best
interests of the island,

153
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,160
then I'm sure
the monster will understand.

154
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,060
Let's go.

155
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,245
- What are you doing?
- We're taking a boat.

156
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,515
Where?

157
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,680
Over to the main island.

158
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,445
I don't think so, my friend.

159
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,315
Are these your boats?

160
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:15,980
Are they yours?

161
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,115
Caesar, right?

162
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:21,315
I was under the impression
these were found here.

163
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,915
So I'm just gonna borrow one.

164
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:25,745
I'm happy to leave the other boat for you
in case you want to follow us.

165
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,645
"Us"?

166
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,215
Are you going with him?

167
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,660
He didn't really give me a choice.

168
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,645
I'm sorry, but I'm calling the shots here

169
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,845
and I say you are not taking anything.

170
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,945
What you are going to do is to sit down

171
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,678
and tell us how you know so much
about this island, my friend.

172
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,498
You're in the habit of
calling people "friends"

173
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
but I don't think you mean it.

174
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,481
Step away from the boat.

175
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,380
No, I'm not gonna
step away from the boat.

176
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,745
I'm gonna take it,
and you're gonna let me, my friend.

177
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,188
You're not taking anything.

178
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:04,830
You looking for this?

179
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,515
This gentleman and I are taking a boat.

180
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,860
Does anyone else have
a problem with that?

181
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,430
Consider that my apology.

182
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,645
Home, sweet home.

183
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,930
Looks like we're not the first
ones who decided to tie up here.

184
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,845
That would be Sun and Lapidus.

185
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,545
I showed 'em where the boats were,

186
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:15,715
and Sun thanked me by smashing me
on the head with a paddle.

187
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:18,645
Oh. Is she the one that hurt your arm?

188
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,580
I noticed you were favoring
it on the way over.

189
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,115
No.

190
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,215
Someone else hurt my arm.

191
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:31,080
You just make friends
everywhere you go, don't ya?

192
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,980
Well, I've found sometimes

193
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,780
that friends can be significantly
more dangerous than enemies, John.

194
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,880
Is that why you shot
an unarmed man in the chest?

195
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,580
The man was unarmed
because I'd stolen his gun -

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,545
the gun he was going to use to kill you.

197
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,515
I couldn't let that happen.

198
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,615
No sense in me dying twice, right?

199
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:52,130
You're welcome.

200
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,515
We're going to your old house, aren't we?

201
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,215
Yes.

202
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,015
It's the only place I can summon it.

203
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:02,845
The "monster."

204
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,700
Once it arrives,
I'll either be forgiven

205
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,780
or I won't.

206
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,945
I think you're lying.

207
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,780
Lying about what?

208
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,145
That you want to be judged
for leaving the island

209
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,580
and coming back
because it's against the rules.

210
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,630
I don't think you care about rules.

211
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,080
Then what do I want
to be judged for, John?

212
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,900
For killing your daughter.

213
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,315
Did you do it?

214
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,630
We had a... complication.

215
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,630
I'm sorry. Is that a... baby?

216
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,745
Your orders were to
exterminate that woman.

217
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,780
Why? she's no threat to us.
She's insane, Charles.

218
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,745
Besides, you didn't
tell me she had a child.

219
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,380
What was it I was supposed to do?

220
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,615
Kill it.

221
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:22,800
It's not an "it." This is a child.

222
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,080
You might find this difficult
to understand, Benjamin.

223
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Every decision I've made
has been about protecting this island.

224
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:39,530
Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?

225
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,960
Then here she is.

226
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,530
You do it.

227
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,080
So whose idea was it
to move into these houses?

228
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,145
Excuse me?

229
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,145
Well, your people were
living in the jungle.

230
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:47,115
And then after you murdered
the Dharma folk,

231
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:48,780
you relocated here.

232
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,830
I just wondered if it was your idea.

233
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,140
Do you disapprove, John?

234
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,080
It just doesn't seem like something
the island would want.

235
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,980
You don't have the first idea
what this island wants.

236
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,460
Are you sure about that?

237
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,480
That was your house, wasn't it?

238
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,445
Yes, and that's Alex's room.

239
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:19,160
Well, I suppose you better go
over there and check it out.

240
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,200
Sun?

241
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,880
What are you doing here?

242
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,915
This used to be my house.
I saw a light turned on.

243
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,300
What are the two of you doing in here?

244
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,345
That was taken in 1977.

245
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:34,280
Are you trying to tell me that your
friends were in the Dharma Initiative?

246
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,680
You don't know about this?

247
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,445
Of course not.

248
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,645
Where did you get this?
Who gave this to you?

249
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,780
We met some crazy old man outside.

250
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,445
He said his name was Christian.

251
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:49,044
He told us to come in here and wait.

252
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,180
Wait for what?

253
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,745
He said if I ever wanted
to see my husband again,

254
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:55,045
I had to wait here for John Locke.

255
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,215
But considering he's dead,
we ain't holding our breath.

256
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,460
Well, you might want to look outside.

257
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,280
What you're saying, it's...

258
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
Impossible.

259
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,080
But here I am.

260
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,780
I don't know how,
I don't know why,

261
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,980
but I'm sure there's
a very good reason for it.

262
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,980
As long as the dead guy
says there's a reason,

263
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,515
well, then I guess everything's
gonna be just peachy.

264
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,380
And forget about the fact
that the rest of your people

265
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,380
are supposedly 30 years ago.

266
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,345
Now the only ones who are here to help us

267
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,445
are a murderer and a guy
who can't seem to remember

268
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,080
how the hell he got out of a coffin.

269
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,700
Sun, please,

270
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,945
let's just go back to the plane,

271
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,515
see if I can fix the radio,

272
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,100
and maybe we can get some help.

273
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,730
If you leave with him,
you'll never find your husband again.

274
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,645
I'm all the help you need.

275
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,780
Are you saying you know
how to find them?

276
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,445
How to find Jin?

277
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:12,880
I have some ideas.

278
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,045
I'm sorry to say,

279
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:17,215
but I'm leaving with or without you.

280
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:20,780
If there's any chance
of finding my husband,

281
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,945
then I have to stay.

282
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:25,430
All right.

283
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,260
For god's sake, watch your back.

284
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,780
All right.

285
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,945
How do we find Jin?

286
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,930
Ben has something to do first.
Isn't that right, Ben?

287
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,345
Yes, John. That's right.

288
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,100
Better get to it then.

289
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,600
I'll be outside.

290
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,815
Again, daddy! Again!

291
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,080
- Okay, okay.
<i>- Wow, Alex!</i>

292
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,660
Any higher, and you're gonna
fly right off the island.

293
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,345
The sub's about to leave.

294
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,380
Higher, daddy, higher!

295
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,515
All right.

296
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,980
You don't have to see him off, Ben.

297
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
Yes, Richard, I do.

298
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,600
Higher! Higher, daddy!

299
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,060
Charles!

300
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,615
I came to say good-bye.

301
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,945
No, you didn't.
You came to gloat.

302
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:31,045
No, don't act as if I wanted this.

303
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,650
You brought this on yourself.

304
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,745
Are you quite certain
you want to do this, Benjamin?

305
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:38,560
You left the island regularly.
You had a daughter with an outsider.

306
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,215
You broke the rules, Charles.

307
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,800
And what makes you think
you deserve to take what's mine?

308
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,545
<i>Because I won't be selfish.</i>

309
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,145
Because I'll sacrifice anything
to protect this island.

310
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,815
You wouldn't sacrifice Alex.

311
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:54,130
You're the one who wanted
her dead, Charles, not the island.

312
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,015
I hope you're right, Benjamin,

313
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:00,480
because if you aren't,

314
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,480
and it is the island
that wants her dead,

315
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,080
she'll be dead.

316
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,080
And one day, you'll be standing
where I'm standing now.

317
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,615
You'll be the one being banished,

318
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,580
and then you'll finally realize

319
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,600
that you cannot fight the inevitable.

320
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,560
I'll be seeing you, boy.

321
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,380
Where did John go?

322
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,345
He said he had something to do.

323
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:52,380
Did he say what it was?

324
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,830
No, I didn't ask.

325
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,115
Jack must have lied.

326
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:02,615
- Excuse me?
<i>- About Locke being dead?</i>

327
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:05,915
I don't know why he would,
but that's the only explanation.

328
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,915
Jack didn't lie.
John was dead.

329
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,580
Just because he was in a coffin

330
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,345
doesn't mean that he couldn't
have faked his dea--

331
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,330
Trust me. I'm sure.

332
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,845
So you knew this would happen to Locke

333
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:25,645
if we brought him back here?

334
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,715
Sun, I had no idea it would happen.

335
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,315
I've seen this island
do miraculous things.

336
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:34,780
I've seen it heal the sick,

337
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,930
but never once has it done
anything like this.

338
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,480
Dead is dead.

339
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,945
You don't get to come back from that,

340
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:47,980
not even here.

341
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,745
So the fact that John Locke is
walking around this island...

342
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,730
scares the living hell out of me.

343
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,615
You may want to go inside.

344
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,180
Why?

345
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,180
Because what's about to come
out of that jungle

346
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,160
is something I can't control.

347
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,545
Any luck?

348
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:27,515
It hasn't shown up yet.

349
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:30,580
Last time we didn't have
to wait this long.

350
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,115
It's not a train, John.
It doesn't run on a schedule.

351
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,180
Well, if it's not gonna
come to us, then...

352
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,080
I suppose we'll have to go to it.

353
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,430
It doesn't work that way.
I only know how to summon it.

354
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,430
I don't know where it actually is.

355
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,430
I do.

356
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,545
It's weird for me, too.

357
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:03,115
Excuse me?

358
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,280
I realize how strange this all is.

359
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,245
Me, here.

360
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,315
But I assure you, Sun,

361
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm the same man I've always been.

362
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,880
Are you ready?

363
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,230
Lead the way.

364
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,980
<i>Hello?</i>

365
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,445
Charles? It's Benjamin.

366
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:38,545
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

367
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:40,945
Doesn't matter. What matters is,

368
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:43,015
I'm going back to the island today.

369
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:45,880
The island won't let you
come back, trust me.

370
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,215
I've spent almost 20 years
trying to return.

371
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:52,280
Well, Charles, where you failed,
I'm going to succeed.

372
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,645
Just as soon as I do one thing.

373
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,845
And what's that, Benjamin?

374
00:28:58,245 --> 00:28:59,760
Kill your daughter.

375
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,415
In fact, I'm looking at
"Our Mutual Friend" right now.

376
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:07,745
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:10,105
It's the name of the boat that Penny's on.

378
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:11,645
Don't you dare.

379
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:14,360
Good-bye, Charles.

380
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,815
May I ask you a question, John?

381
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,315
Shoot.

382
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:30,960
How is it that you know
where you're going?

383
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,745
I just know.

384
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:36,345
I mean, how does that work, exactly?

385
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,970
- How does what work?
- The knowing.

386
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,715
I mean, did it come upon you gradually,

387
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,280
or did you wake up one morning,

388
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,980
suddenly understanding the
mysteries of the universe?

389
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,815
- You don't like this, do you?
- What?

390
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:50,245
Having to ask questions
that you don't know the answers to,

391
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:52,215
blindly following someone
in the hopes that

392
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:55,780
they'll lead you to whatever
it is you're looking for.

393
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,080
No, John, I don't like it at all.

394
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,800
Well, now you know
what it was like to be me.

395
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,015
We should keep moving.

396
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:15,030
Yes, we should.

397
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,680
I think I know where
we're going now, John.

398
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,315
Do you?

399
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:26,680
It's the same place
they brought me as a child.

400
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,830
It's where the island healed me.

401
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,860
Let's hope it's as
generous this time around.

402
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,415
What is it?

403
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,330
It's the wall around our temple.

404
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,900
What temple?

405
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,915
About a half mile from here.

406
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:59,380
We built this wall to keep people
like the two of you from ever seeing it.

407
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,800
We're not going into your temple, Ben.

408
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,600
We're going under it.

409
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,960
After you.

410
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,315
I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.

411
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,965
If you can ever get off this island,
find Desmond Hume for me.

412
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:46,845
Tell him I said I was sorry.

413
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:50,760
Sorry for what?

414
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,430
He'll know.

415
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,360
What are you doing here?

416
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,560
Desmond!

417
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,345
Desmond!

418
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:41,645
Des?!

419
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:42,880
Don't move.

420
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,430
Not another word.

421
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,180
Hello, Penelope.

422
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,515
My name is Benjamin Linus.

423
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:54,215
I'm sorry that you're caught up
in the middle of this thing,

424
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,230
but your father--

425
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,040
My father and I have absolutely
no relationship whatsoever,

426
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,930
- so whatever--
- Your father is a really terrible human being.

427
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,945
He's responsible for the
killing of my daughter.

428
00:33:04,045 --> 00:33:05,445
That's why I'm here.

429
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,360
Mommy!

430
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,445
Charlie, go back inside, babe.

431
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,494
Go back inside.

432
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:14,980
Please.

433
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,780
Please, whatever you do,
don't hurt my son.

434
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,940
Please don't hurt my son.

435
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,395
Mommy? Mommy?

436
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:23,230
Charlie, go inside!

437
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,845
<i>Captain Lapidus!
Captain Lapidus!</i>

438
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,980
You're back.
Thank God.

439
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,145
They found guns.

440
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,195
What are you talking about?
Who found guns?

441
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,380
Ilana and three of the others.

442
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,780
They said they were in charge now.

443
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,160
Where are they?

444
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,760
Ilana!

445
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,145
What's going on?

446
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,415
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

447
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:28,515
What?

448
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:30,360
Answer the question!

449
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,360
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

450
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,500
I have no idea what the--

451
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,345
Get everyone else.
Tell them it's time.

452
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:49,530
And tie him up.

453
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,130
He's coming with us.

454
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,745
You know, you were right.

455
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,245
About what?

456
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:33,245
Why I need to be judged.

457
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:35,245
When Charles Widmore's men came,

458
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,330
they gave me a choice.

459
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,160
Either leave the island
or let my daughter die.

460
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,345
All I had to do was walk out
of the house and go with them.

461
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,180
But I didn't do it.

462
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,180
So you were right.

463
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,030
John, I did kill Alex.

464
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,760
And now I have to answer for that.

465
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,445
I appreciate you showing me the way,

466
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,530
but I think I can take it from here.

467
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,600
You got it.

468
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,360
I'll meet you outside, if I live--

469
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,760
Ben!

470
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,580
Are you all right?

471
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,315
Never better.

472
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,880
Hang on. I'll find something
to get you out of there.

473
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,500
John, wait!

474
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,245
<i>You didn't tell me
that she had a child.</i>

475
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:32,815
<i>What was it I was supposed to do?</i>

476
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:35,615
<i>- Kill it.
- It's not an "it." This is a child.</i>

477
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,780
<i>Higher! Again, daddy! Again!</i>

478
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,515
<i>Higher! Higher, daddy!</i>

479
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:44,415
<i>I hate you!</i>

480
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:46,800
<i>I hate your guts!
I wish you were dead.</i>

481
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,115
<i>These people.</i>

482
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:52,745
<i>You said they're dangerous.</i>

483
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:54,445
<i>More dangerous than you?</i>

484
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:57,880
<i>Dad, they're serious.</i>

485
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,415
<i>They killed Karl and my mother.</i>

486
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:04,415
<i>Please, dad.</i>

487
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,615
<i>Help me!</i>

488
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,980
<i>She's not my daughter.</i>

489
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,945
<i>She means nothing to me.</i>

490
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:15,930
<i>So if you wanna kill her,
go ahead and--</i>

491
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,530
<i>Daddy?</i>

492
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,845
Alex.

493
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:47,115
Hi, dad.

494
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:50,430
Oh, Alex.

495
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm so, so sorry.

496
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,160
It was all my fault.

497
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,030
I know.

498
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,395
Listen to me, you bastard!

499
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:21,445
I know that you're already
planning to kill John again,

500
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:25,015
and I want you to know that
if you so much as touch him,

501
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:28,845
I will hunt you down and destroy you.

502
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:33,080
You will listen to every word
John Locke says,

503
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,245
and you will follow his every order.

504
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,360
Do you understand?

505
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,980
Say it!

506
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,745
Say you'll follow him.

507
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:44,860
Yes, I will. I'll follow him.
I swear.

508
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,830
<i>Ben?</i>

509
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,960
Ben!

510
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,500
Ben?

511
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,800
What happened?

512
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,460
It let me live.
