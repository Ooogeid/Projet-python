00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:01,773
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,832 --> 00:00:03,851
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,977
I want you to want to save my life.

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,619
Just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

5
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:11,913
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,732
I would like for you
to go back in there,

7
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:15,768
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

8
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,065
And why would I want to do that?

9
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,948
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

10
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,715
What, you wanna turn steering?

11
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:53,499
We have to go back.

12
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:55,026
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,658
Turn the boat around, I mean it.

14
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,489
Have you lost your mind?
We just got away.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,490
Just do it.

16
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:03,000
- You give me one good reason to turn...
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

17
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:10,374
Yes, we can, Freckles...

18
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,304
'cause that's what he asked us to do.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,772
I mean, think about it…
We go back there,

20
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:19,131
what do you think captain bunnykiller's
gonna do if he catches us?

21
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:20,639
He'll kill you.

22
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,835
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

23
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,902
Thanks for the input.

24
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,121
Sorry, kiddo...

25
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:39,835
Jack's on his own.

26
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,437
Time to get up.

27
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,191
We're moving you.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,390
Moving me where?

29
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,785
Someplace else, Jack.

30
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,146
Why?

31
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,624
So this is it, huh?

32
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:04,382
"It"?

33
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,200
You just helped me save his life.

34
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,756
If you're gonna kill me, please,

35
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:10,928
at least show me the respect
of not calling it "moving."

36
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,318
Now why would we kill you?

37
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:16,441
Because you're done with me.

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,576
What kind of people do you think we are?

39
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:19,958
I don't know, Tom.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,900
The kind of people that would take
a pregnant woman...

41
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:26,306
would hang Charlie from a tree...

42
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,763
would drag our people
out of the jungle...

43
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,543
would kidnap children…

44
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:34,371
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

45
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,493
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

46
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:51,966
How 'bout I get you some stones?

47
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:01,057
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

48
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:51,206
Sync by Sixe. 

49
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,130
www.swsub.com

50
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,460
Dr. Jack? Hey, Dr. Jack?

51
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,075
Dr. Jack want soda?

52
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:39,099
You know I can't understand a word
you're saying, right?

53
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:44,204
You're welcome.

54
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:57,421
Thank you.

55
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:58,831
Thank you very much.

56
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,253
You're not from around here, are you?

57
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,951
No. No, I'm not.

58
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,853
I'm... Jack.

59
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,585
Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.

60
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,234
Achara...

61
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,510
Juliet grilled these for me.

62
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,381
Who's that woman?

63
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,339
That'd be the sheriff.

64
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,455
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally.

65
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,172
Why are you moving Juliet into my room?

66
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:51,652
'Cause she's in trouble.

67
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:58,602
Now don't try anything stupid.

68
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:00,613
You stay put in this cage, okay?

69
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,840
You say that like you're not watching me
from that camera right there.

70
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,435
Oh, right.

71
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,486
Ben told me you got into
the surveillance room.

72
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,033
Let me ask you something.

73
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,571
You risk your neck to cut them loose,

74
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,737
and they run away
and don't ever look back...

75
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,149
Thanks for the sandwich.

76
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,053
Never thought I'd be glad
to get back to this rock again.

77
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,325
What are you doing?

78
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,715
What's it look like?
I'm heading into shore.

79
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,111
Why? If we just keep going,
we can circle round.

80
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:51,070
Sooner or later we'll get to camp
and tell Locke and Sayid what happened.

81
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,091
Oh, we will?

82
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,721
You got a map you ain't showing me,
Magellan?

83
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,382
We got no food, no water,
and I can't steer in the dark.

84
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,830
Then I'll steer.

85
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,605
You'll come ashore,
and we'll make camp.

86
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:08,462
You want to contribute?

87
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,592
You can build a campfire
while I carry the kid.

88
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,582
Glad we agree.

89
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,847
Sure you ain't hungry?

90
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:30,642
No, James, I ain't hungry.

91
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:34,040
You shouldn't fight.

92
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,384
When the hell did you wake up?

93
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,855
You shouldn't fight
because you're lucky to be alive.

94
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,535
Golly! I think he's got a point!

95
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,869
That island we were on...
Is that where your people live?

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,041
Just where we work.

97
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:54,952
Work on what?

98
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,426
Projects.

99
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,697
Oh, sure, like the "steal the kid
off the raft"
project?

100
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,545
That was a humdinger.

101
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,757
So you don't actually live
on that island?

102
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:05,796
Do you live here...

103
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,159
on this island?

104
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,092
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,103
And what did you do with the people
that you took...

106
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,957
- the kids?
- We give them a better life.

107
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:21,055
Better than what?

108
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:23,889
Better than yours.

109
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,074
There's not gonna be any moon tonight.

110
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,076
It'll be dark.

111
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,132
Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard
at night,

112
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,309
make up names for the constellations.

113
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:42,856
You can't see it yet,

114
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,224
but right there will be
"Ursa Theodorus"...

115
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,045
the teddy bear.

116
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:50,862
You have backyards?

117
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,869
Well, ain't that quaint?

118
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,149
<i>Warning!</i>

119
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:29,906
I thought you were locked up.

120
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,730
They let me out to examine Ben.

121
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,850
His vitals are low, and he has a fever.

122
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,014
I took this about ten minutes ago.

123
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,352
It's of his stitches.

124
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,017
They're infected, aren't they?

125
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,473
- Yes.
- Will you come look at them?

126
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,162
I'm not asking you for them... or him.

127
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,748
I'm asking you as a personal favor
to me.

128
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:01,019
You... want me to help him again?

129
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,684
Yes.

130
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,404
Are you sure about that, Juliet?

131
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,725
Yes... I'm sure.

132
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:11,806
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

133
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,039
It's because I'm in trouble.

134
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,331
- Trouble? For...
- I just killed someone.

135
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:26,653
That's why they put me in your room.

136
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,034
Who?

137
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,613
It's complicated.

138
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,445
Well, then, let me simplify it for you.

139
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,036
I'm not gonna help him...

140
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,508
and I'm not gonna help you.

141
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,909
Special Thai dish for you. You try.

142
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:23,863
Very brave, very brave.

143
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,713
My brother likes you.

144
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,995
Well, I'm a very likeable guy.

145
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,044
So, Jack...

146
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,819
tell me something.

147
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:40,839
Shoot.

148
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,659
Why is it you don't know
how to fly a kite?

149
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:47,220
Just never learned, I guess.

150
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,332
That's very sad.

151
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,212
Well, my dad worked a lot.

152
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:55,433
He wasn't exactly the kite-flying type,
anyway.

153
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:56,971
I mean, we never really...

154
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:00,504
I have no interest in your father.

155
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:02,898
Well, that's a relief,

156
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,392
because I'm pretty tired
of talking about him.

157
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,009
Some things are personal.

158
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:18,414
So you're in Phuket to...
"find yourself"?

159
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,661
Why would you say that?

160
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:22,865
You're an American.

161
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,530
I have... a gift.

162
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:48,787
Must be one hell of a gift.

163
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,494
I was just reading your tattoos.

164
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:22,411
The "five" and the stars are very cute,

165
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,071
But the Chinese I find...

166
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:28,912
a bit ironic.

167
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:31,418
You find what ironic?

168
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,541
What it says.

169
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,439
You do know what it says?

170
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,230
Yeah, I know what it says.

171
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,335
Are you sure?

172
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,484
Chinese is a very complicated language.

173
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,886
It's fairly common for some things
to get lost in translation.

174
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,130
I know what it says.

175
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:54,881
All right, then.

176
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:02,434
My name is Isabel.

177
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,982
If you'll come with me,

178
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:10,262
I'd like to talk to you and ask you
a few questions.

179
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,514
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart?

180
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,044
I know he'd appreciate it.

181
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:42,767
Please, have a seat, Jack.

182
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:47,263
As you may have gathered,
we don't live on this little island.

183
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,581
In fact, most of us
don't really even like coming here.

184
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:53,304
There's been an incident
that I'm investigating,

185
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:55,425
and I need to ask you some questions,

186
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:58,466
so I was hoping you may help me clear up

187
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:02,024
a few of the... inconsistencies.

188
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,364
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

189
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:08,453
but you said, in the midst
of a surgical procedure,

190
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,737
Jack made several comments indicating

191
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:13,750
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

192
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:17,784
Yeah. That's right.

193
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,291
Is that true, Jack?

194
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,738
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

195
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:26,935
The question's simple.

196
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,361
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

197
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:39,907
No, I was lying.

198
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,212
I would've done anything
to get my friends out,

199
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:45,195
and turning you people
against each other

200
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:47,094
was my best chance of creating chaos.

201
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,066
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

202
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,329
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

203
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:27,457
Who's there?

204
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,415
Who do you think?

205
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,039
What time is it?

206
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,342
It's late.

207
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,203
Salty.

208
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,083
I went for a swim in the ocean.

209
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,692
Washing the day off of you, huh?

210
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,542
Is there something
you'd like to ask me, Jack?

211
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,912
No, not at all.

212
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,179
I mean...

213
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:10,846
it might be nice...

214
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:15,072
after a month of you coming and going
whenever you want,

215
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,213
to find out something about you.

216
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,977
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

217
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:36,975
Like your gift?

218
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:40,127
Yes...

219
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,138
like my gift.

220
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,769
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

221
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:11,434
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:14,849
Then stop ask questions.

223
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,341
Let's have fun.

224
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,331
What?

225
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:50,981
Do I...

226
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:53,503
do I know you?

227
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,005
815. You're...

228
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,370
you were the stewardess.

229
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:03,463
Cindy.

230
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:09,701
What are you doing here, with them?

231
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,633
I thought you were taken.
You were... You were captured.

232
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,466
They're not... it's not that simple.

233
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,238
What are they doing here right now?

234
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,709
What are you doing here?!

235
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,320
We're here to watch, Jack.

236
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,602
Watch what?

237
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,008
What is it, sweetheart?

238
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,368
She... wants to know
how Ana Lucia's doing.

239
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,451
- Are you serious?
- What?

240
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:52,609
If you've got something to watch,
Cindy, go watch it!

241
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:27,407
- What?
- Sawyer, wake up.

242
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:31,606
He's gone.

243
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:33,603
Karl's gone.

244
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,010
Where?

245
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:50,207
I got it.

246
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:51,667
No, let me talk to him.

247
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:52,782
No, I got it.

248
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:54,787
Boys only.

249
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,125
What the hell was that for?

250
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,336
So you'd cowboy up.

251
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,121
Crying in the jungle.

252
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:17,443
I thought you
people were supposed to be tough.

253
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:19,445
I am tough.

254
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:22,881
Sure you are, Bobby.

255
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,883
Bobby? "The Brady bunch"?

256
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:30,214
What the hell's "The Brady bunch"?

257
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:35,486
Anyway, look...

258
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,988
I’ve been with a lot of girls...

259
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,020
some of them worth the trouble...

260
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:49,597
some not.

261
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:52,990
Every now and again...

262
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,951
there's one...

263
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,267
one you name dumb stars with.

264
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,352
So this girl, Sally Slingshot...

265
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,774
Alex.

266
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,294
You love her?

267
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:19,566
More than anything.

268
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,800
Then go back
to wherever the hell your...

269
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,572
yards are, and get her back.

270
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:33,909
If I get caught,
they'll kill me this time.

271
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,464
Well...

272
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,047
at least it'll be worth it.

273
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,210
I wanna ask you something.

274
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:08,227
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

275
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:13,607
Ben...

276
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:15,879
Why'd you save his life?

277
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:18,521
All this time...

278
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,315
After all he did to you
and your people...

279
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:21,492
you should hate him,

280
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:24,805
But you still fixed him up,

281
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:27,857
even after your friends got away. Why?

282
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:30,258
You're his daughter.

283
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,760
Answer the question.

284
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:36,893
I'll answer your question
if you answer one of mine.

285
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,990
Where's Juliet?

286
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,793
She's with the rest of them.

287
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,168
They're gonna read her verdict.

288
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:45,681
Her verdict?

289
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:47,689
And we all know what it's gonna be.

290
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,494
We're pretty strict
about killing one of our own.

291
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:55,222
Eye for an eye.

292
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,130
Who? Who did she kill?

293
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,850
The man who was gonna murder
your friends.

294
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:09,180
No wonder you're so worried about her.

295
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,061
If it wasn't for you,
she never would have done it.

296
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:15,539
That was three questions.

297
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:17,927
Your turn, Jack.

298
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,805
I saved your father
because I said I would.

299
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:34,982
Is he still in charge?

300
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:37,696
- What?
- Ben, your father...

301
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:38,895
Is he still in charge?

302
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,753
Will that woman Isabel do what he says?

303
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,262
Get me out of this cage.

304
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:48,709
I wouldn't do that.

305
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,586
The cavalry has arrived at last.

306
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,197
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

307
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:18,098
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

308
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:21,937
His name was Ethan.

309
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,433
You have a very serious infection, Ben.

310
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:30,034
That infected tissue
needs to be re-incised, debrided,

311
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:33,679
and you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

312
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:39,042
There might be nerve damage
or any number of other complications.

313
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:41,954
You might not walk again.

314
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:47,316
Your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired.

315
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:50,905
Well, then,
it's too bad you're stuck with me.

316
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,870
- Am I?
- You need a doctor,

317
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,388
someone to stay with you

318
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,685
bring you back to good health.

319
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,459
And here we go again.

320
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,494
I've already given you
a ticket off this island.

321
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,639
What's it gonna cost me this time?

322
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,700
Right now your people are in a room

323
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:20,004
deciding whether or not
to execute Juliet.

324
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,134
You're gonna stop it.

325
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,978
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

326
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:33,838
Doesn't matter what she's done,

327
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,764
No matter what you think...

328
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:40,956
she's one of us.

329
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,870
Do we have a deal or not?

330
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:56,366
Does Isabel have a walkie?

331
00:27:58,398 --> 00:27:59,948
They're already in the meeting.

332
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:09,273
Then get me something to write on.

333
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:26,104
You following me.

334
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,625
What is all this?

335
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,249
This is where I work,
and you shouldn't be here.

336
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:44,874
This is a...

337
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,390
a tattoo parlor.

338
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:48,946
This was your big secret?

339
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,065
The envelopes... your gift?

340
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:55,327
I am not a tattoo artist.

341
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:04,579
I'm able to see who people are.

342
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,519
My work is not decoration...

343
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:10,648
it is definition...

344
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:14,588
and this...

345
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:16,591
this is my gift.

346
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,253
So...

347
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,015
you see who people are.

348
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:23,739
Yes...

349
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,704
and I mark them.

350
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:31,143
So tell me who I am.

351
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,274
No.

352
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,291
- Why not?
- You are an outsider.

353
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,059
So you can sleep with me...

354
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:41,532
I'm not allowed.

355
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,574
Do you see who I am, Achara?

356
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:48,495
Yes.

357
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:51,409
Who am I?

358
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:55,489
You are a leader, a great man.

359
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:58,412
But this...

360
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,981
this makes you lonely...

361
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,730
and frightened..

362
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:08,685
and angry.

363
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:19,596
Good.

364
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,595
Now put it on me.

365
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,006
Put it on me.

366
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,380
No. This...

367
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,044
this is against my people.

368
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,075
There will be consequences, Jack.

369
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,034
There always are.

370
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:13,744
Wait. No,

371
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,235
you shouldn't be here.

372
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:16,378
Just stand back.

373
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:18,174
Don't say anything.

374
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:28,610
Alex, you...

375
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:35,652
What the hell
did you bring him here for?!

376
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,828
Let him go, Tom.

377
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:40,808
What's going on, Alex?

378
00:32:43,151 --> 00:32:44,151
This is from Ben.

379
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:57,208
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

380
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,470
Execution is off the table.

381
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:01,760
He says the rules don't apply.

382
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,684
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

383
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:46,789
Hey, where you going?

384
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,582
Hey, I know you.

385
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,169
I'm Achara's friend from...

386
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,409
...Chet's. Jack from the restaurant.

387
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:15,190
Let go of me, man.

388
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,845
You will get off our beach!

389
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,321
You leave this country!

390
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,053
Do you understand me?

391
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:50,158
I heard you only liked them grilled.

392
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,821
I missed the toothpicks, too.

393
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,429
Let me see.

394
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,206
They marked you.

395
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:09,531
Let me see it.

396
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,587
Break a branch off that aloe plant
over there...

397
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,575
Please. Please do it.

398
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,300
All right, turn around.

399
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:18,928
Why did you help me?

400
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,504
He told you he was gonna
let you go home.

401
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,693
He told me the same thing.

402
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,463
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word.

403
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,902
And how are we going to do that?

404
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:32,721
Together.

405
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:48,854
They'll be coming for you
in a few minutes...

406
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:50,457
All of them.

407
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,160
Your friends know where we are,

408
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,446
so we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

409
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:58,521
Go where?

410
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,899
Well, Ben calls it "home."

411
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:09,181
Where's Karl?

412
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:10,986
I let him go.

413
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,498
- You what?
- I let him go.

414
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,203
He could have led us back
to where they live.

415
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,919
What, you think I cut him loose
'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

416
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,213
The kid's a target.

417
00:38:23,654 --> 00:38:25,974
Ben ain't never gonna stop
looking for him, so as long…

418
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,377
All Ben wants is that kid
as far from his daughter as possible.

419
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:31,965
Let's get back to camp.

420
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:38,981
Are you coming or not?

421
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,822
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

422
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,719
You're so good at telling me what to do,

423
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,046
I can't think for myself anymore.

424
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:49,517
Don't take it out on me
'cause you feel guilty.

425
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:50,703
I don't feel guilty.

426
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:51,853
The hell you don't!

427
00:38:51,854 --> 00:38:53,145
We had to leave Jack behind.

428
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,104
- I didn't have a choice...
- I'm not talking

429
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,492
about leaving Jack behind.

430
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:05,054
I'm talking about you and me.

431
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:15,820
I know you did it 'cause you thought
I was a dead man...

432
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:19,888
so don't beat yourself up
'cause the doc's left behind.

433
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,946
I'm not beating myself up.

434
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,135
'Course you're not.

435
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:36,563
So now that we got that out of the way,
let's go.

436
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:06,686
"He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us."

437
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:08,857
Your tattoos...

438
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:10,661
That's what they say.

439
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:17,477
That's what they say.

440
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,957
It's not what they mean.
