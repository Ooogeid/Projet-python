2
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:05,955
Hello, Ben.

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:07,980
You're alive.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,300
Yes, I am.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,010
You know how to find them?

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,471
- How to find Jin?
- I have some ideas.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,832
So you knew

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,225
this would happen to Locke
if we brought him back here?

9
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:19,768
Dead is dead.

10
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,397
You don't get
to come back from that.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,521
The Dharma folks at the Swan work site,
they're gonna drill into the ground

12
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:31,126
and accidentally tap
into a massive pocket of energy,

13
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:35,034
and that will cause your plane,
Oceanic 815,

14
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,827
to crash on this island.

15
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,456
I think I can negate that energy.
If I can,

16
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:45,211
then that hatch will never be built,
and your plane will land

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,840
just like it's supposed to.

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,341
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

19
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,842
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

20
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,935
Where's the bomb, Richard?
Where is it?

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,604
The hydrogen bomb that I told
your people to bury. Where is it?

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,781
Listen to me. Lower your gun,
and we'll talk. Okay?

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,403
Nobody has to get hurt here.
Just put the gun down.

24
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,910
I'm gonna give you three seconds.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,330
- One...
- Don't do this.

26
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,102
What's he doing down there?

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,586
- Jack, he's crazy.
- Is he?

28
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:31,382
What if this is why we're here?

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,658
What if this is our one chance

30
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,041
to put things back
the way they're supposed to be?

31
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,216
- What the hell are you doing?
- They shot him! I'm gonna go help.

32
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:47,732
We have to go, Jack.
We have to go now.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,043
Don't you move!

34
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,660
Don't move.

35
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,842
Just who the bloody hell
might you be?

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,976
DANIEL, NO MATTER WHAT,
REMEMBER I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.MOTHER

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,983
What happened?

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,664
This man walked into camp
and put a gun to my head,

39
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,083
and Eloise... Reacted.
Where'd you find them?

40
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,462
Crouched in the bushes...
like rats.

41
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,672
Did you two come here with this man?

42
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:02,431
Put them in my tent.

43
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,604
Would you care to tell me, Eloise,

44
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,065
why the Dharma Initiative
seems to have declared war on us?

45
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,569
These people aren't
from the Dharma Initiative, Charles.

46
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,034
Then where the hell are they from?

47
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,770
Thirty Years Later

48
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:55,901
He's here.

49
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,376
I brought dinner.

50
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,214
Hello, Richard.

51
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,744
It's been a while.

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,972
It's been three years.

53
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:30,853
- What happened? Where were you?
- I'll explain on the way.

54
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,772
On the way where?

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,430
It's gonna be night soon.

56
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,235
You and I have an errand to run,
and we don't have a lot of time.

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,699
What's wrong?

58
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,077
Something different about you.

59
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,671
I have a purpose now.

60
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,781
What's he doing here?

61
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,386
He helped me get back.

62
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:14,313
Why did Locke say these were his people?
I thought they were yours.

63
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:17,024
When I left the island,
John stepped in.

64
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,151
He's the leader now.

65
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,195
Who's that man he's talking to?

66
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,948
His name is Richard Alpert.

67
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:25,709
He's a kind of...

68
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,170
Advisor.

69
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:34,108
And he has had that job
for a very, very long time.

70
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:41,915
Sun? What are you...

71
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:46,773
Were you here in 1977?

72
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:49,677
Excuse me?

73
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,810
These people...
Jack Shephard,

74
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,020
Kate Austen, Hugo Reyes.

75
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,980
They were here with my husband,
Jin Kwon.

76
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,183
Were you here?

77
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:04,905
Do you remember them?
Any of them?

78
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,952
Yes, I was here 30 years ago.

79
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,830
And I do. I remember these people.
I remember

80
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,416
meeting them very clearly,
because...

81
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,454
I watched them all die.

82
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:42,609

83
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,456
Drink of water?

84
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,800
Do you think it's true?

85
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,543
They're all dead?

86
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,964
I don't think we went through all this
for nothing, Sun.

87
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,257
I'm ready, John.

88
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,512
You still have
that compass I gave you?

89
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,270
A little rusty,
but she can still find north.

90
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:22,149
Ben, I'd appreciate it
if you'd join us.

91
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,671
What, John, don't you trust me
here with my former people?

92
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:27,780
Afraid I'll stage a coup?

93
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,574
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

94
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,783
- Well, in that case, I'd love to come.
- Good.

95
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:39,868
Stay here.

96
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,183
We'll be back in a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can find out.

97
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,436
But whatever happens, Sun,
you have my word...

98
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,082
If there's a way for you and Jin
to be together again,

99
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:49,676
a way to save our people...

100
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:53,523
I'll find it.

101
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,888
Take it easy on her.

102
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,977
Don't talk. Understand?

103
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,667
Are you okay?

104
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,303
Before we were caught...

105
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,144
You said that we needed to put things
back the way they were supposed to be.

106
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,858
What did you mean by that?

107
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,866
If we can do what Faraday said...

108
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,105
Our plane never crashes...

109
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,285
Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.

110
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,944
And everyone we lost
since we got here...

111
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,210
They'd all be alive.

112
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,459
And what about us?

113
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:14,052
We just go on living our life

114
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,815
because we've never met?

115
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:21,177
All the misery
that we've been through...

116
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:23,353
We'd just wipe it clean.
Never happened.

117
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:26,273
It was not all misery.

118
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,348
Enough of it was.

119
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,152
The man I shot...

120
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:47,920
What did he need the bomb for?

121
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,761
I need you to tell me
why he wanted the bomb.

122
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,348
I don't think
you'd believe me if I did.

123
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,653
When I was 17 years old,

124
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:12,027
I took a young man to the bomb.

125
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,373
He proceed to tell me
that if we buried it underground,

126
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,282
then things
would work out splendidly.

127
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:20,235
When I asked him
how he could be so sure...

128
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,498
He said that he was from the future.

129
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,702
And then he disappeared,

130
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:32,547
right in front of my eyes.

131
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:38,122
Ten minutes ago,
I shot that man in the back.

132
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,946
And before he died...

133
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,982
He told me that he...

134
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,981
He said he was my son.

135
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,100
Explain to me...

136
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:57,990
And you have my word
I will believe you.

137
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,164
How is this my handwriting
if I don't remember writing it?

138
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,882
Because you haven't written it yet.

139
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:18,927
I know this is hard to understand,

140
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:20,552
but...

141
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,415
what you just did...

142
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,629
It was an accident,

143
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,896
and I think that there's a way
for you to take it all back.

144
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,066
What?

145
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:36,942
Your son came back here
because he had figured out a way

146
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:39,114
to change things.

147
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,327
He doesn't have to be dead.
You don't have to have killed him.

148
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,579
If we do what's written
in that journal...

149
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,792
None of this will have happened.

150
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,006
Does he know
what he's talking about?

151
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,241
He thinks he does.

152
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:11,646
All right then,
I'll take you to the bomb.

153
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,209
Just...

154
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,358
One small issue, however.

155
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,406
We secured it
over 20 years ago underground.

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,650
But since that time,

157
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,328
it appears that someone's built
an entire village over it.

158
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,128
The Dharma Initiative?

159
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,633
However...

160
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:38,154
It appears that you two have been
passing yourselves off as members, so...

161
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,967
I suppose coming and going
will be relatively simple.

162
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,680
It might be a little bit
more complicated than that.

163
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,447
That woman, where is she now?

164
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,576
Call my lawyer.

165
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,791
- Stuart! What the hell are you doing?
- I'm getting answers. Where is she?

166
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,804
Stop! Damn it, stop.

167
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,574
That is an order.
I'm still in charge here.

168
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,749
No, you were in charge, Horace.

169
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:28,601
But if we're gonna protect our people
and all the work we're doing here,

170
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,601
you don't have the stomach
for what happens next.

171
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,566
Okay, Jim, last chance.

172
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,424
You tell me where she is...

173
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,366
Or so help me God, I will kill you.

174
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:08,346
You ready to talk now?

175
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:12,702
Nope.

176
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,253
Believe me, I'm gettin'
tired of this too, Jim.

177
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,729
So why don't you tell me
where your girlfriend took the boy?

178
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,902
She bring him to the hostiles?

179
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,744
You know where they are?

180
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,475
Stop, please!

181
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:36,583
You want me to stop?
Then tell me what I want to know!

182
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,942
Stuart, please!

183
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,466
We have known each other
for three years.

184
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:46,712
We are not bad people!
We are not here to hurt you!

185
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,237
Don't.

186
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:57,504
Whatever you tell 'em,
they ain't gonna believe you.

187
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,815
It's only gonna get
more people hurt.

188
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,070
What are we doing, man?

189
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,948
Beating him is pointless.

190
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,507
- Okay? He's not gonna talk.
- I can make him talk.

191
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,851
- Son of a bitch!
- Easy.

192
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:25,549
- Easy.
- You're a dead man, Phil.

193
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,845
I'm gonna kill you.

194
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,472
Mr. Radzinsky?

195
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,849
There's still no sign
of Miles or Jin.

196
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:38,979
But the recruits from last week...
I got their sub's manifest from Amy.

197
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,207
There were 3 last-minute add-ons.

198
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,875
They were the 2 people that shot at you,
Shephard and Austen,

199
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,945
And one guy we can't track down.
He's gotta be a part of this.

200
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,366
Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?

201
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:53,535
He's the fat guy.

202
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,907
- So what's the rescue plan?
- Rescue plan?

203
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,727
We're going to the beach.
Why do you think we sent you for food.

204
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,902
But they got Sawyer and Juliet.

205
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,915
And there are 30 of them,
and they all have guns.

206
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,407
We can only rescue ourselves,
so let's go.

207
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:46,588
We gotta do something.
Sawyer would never leave us behind.

208
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,390
Dr. Chang?
What are you doing here?

209
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,688
I could ask you the same question.

210
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,152
But we asked you first.

211
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:08,068
Your friend Faraday said
that you were from the future.

212
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,225
I need to know
if he was telling the truth.

213
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,176
Dude, that's ridiculous.

214
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,129
What year were you born?

215
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,161
- What year?
- 1931?

216
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:22,471
You're 46?

217
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:27,623
- Yes, I am.
- So you fought in the Korean war?

218
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:30,965
There's no such thing.

219
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
Who's the president
of the United States?

220
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,141
All right, dude,
we're from the future. Sorry.

221
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:46,376
It's true then?

222
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,234
You are my son?

223
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,198
Yeah, it's true.

224
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:00,781
Your friend, the physicist,

225
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,415
He also told me to evacuate
everyone I could off the island.

226
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,919
He said there was going to be
a massive accident at the Swan.

227
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,168
Now is that true?

228
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,363
He's been right
about everything so far.

229
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:16,469
If Faraday said
get people off the island...

230
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:21,349
I'd do it.

231
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,508
Well, then let's hope
he knows what he's doing.

232
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:36,506
Tell me something.

233
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,012
Why is it that this man looks...

234
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,662
Familiar to me?

235
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:47,460
You and Erik are coming with me.

236
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:49,618
Going with you where?

237
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,553
You can untie them.

238
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,797
And...

239
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,091
Would you mind giving us a moment?

240
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,565
- I'm taking them to the bomb.
- What?

241
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,839
Are you insane?

242
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:16,849
I'm worried about you.

243
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,201
Not in your condition.

244
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:25,783
Who is he?

245
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,504
The man you're asking about
is Charles Widmore.

246
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,049
He and Eloise are...

247
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,095
Let's just say
love can be complicated.

248
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:49,776
All right. Let's move out.

249
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:56,682
So, John...

250
00:19:57,151 --> 00:20:01,101
You, uh, you ready to tell me
where you've been the last three years?

251
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
You really don't know?

252
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:08,649
Well, I know that on the day
that Ben here turned the wheel,

253
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,855
that you and I
were sitting on a log.

254
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,053
There was a bright light.

255
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,790
There was a loud noise,
and then you just...

256
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,215
You disappeared.

257
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,518
Well, Richard, you're just about to see
where I disappeared to.

258
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,680
And after we're finished,
I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.

259
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,352
That's... Not how it works, John.

260
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:33,022
Is that true, Richard?
Is this gonna be a problem?

261
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,734
You just got back, John.
There's no reason to rush into...

262
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,402
I am the leader now.

263
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:40,085
Right?

264
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:43,780
Yes, John. That's right.

265
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:47,214
Good. Then I would like you
to take me to Jacob. Can you do that?

266
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,869
- Yeah, of course.
- Fantastic.

267
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,604
Let's keep moving.
We're almost to the plane.

268
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:56,997
What plane?

269
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,467
It's a Beechcraft

270
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:21,487
used to smuggle heroin.
Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here.

271
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,877
Richard, listen very carefully

272
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,869
because you're only gonna have
about 3 minutes to get this right.

273
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:29,523
Get what right?

274
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:31,789
A man's about to walk
out of the jungle.

275
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,936
He's been shot in the leg.

276
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,939
You'll need this
to get the bullet out.

277
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,631
- Uh, I'm sorry, John. I'm not...
- Listen. This is the important part.

278
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:49,091
You're gonna need to tell him
that he has to bring everyone who left

279
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,666
back to the island.

280
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:53,186
And when he asks how to do that...

281
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,522
You tell him he's gonna have to die.

282
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,245
Who is that man, John?

283
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Me.

284
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:49,659
What is happening?

285
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,411
What's happening
is that you're bleeding to death.

286
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:54,615
Okay, here.

287
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,307
I need to get the bullet out.

288
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,986
How did you know there was a bullet
in my leg, Richard?

289
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:10,761
- Because you told me there was, John.
- No, no. No, I didn't.

290
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:13,704
Well... You will.

291
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,939
This must be quite
the out-of-body experience.

292
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,100
Something like that.

293
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,937
Your timing was impeccable, John.

294
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,405
How did you know when to be here?

295
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,984
The island told me.

296
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,411
- Didn't it ever tell you things?
- No, John.

297
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:38,958
And it hasn't told you where Jacob is
or you wouldn't need Richard.

298
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,521
You've never seen him.

299
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:42,412
- What?
- Jacob.

300
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,922
You've never seen him, have you?

301
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,449
What just happened?

302
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,897
- Where did you go?
- To give Richard his compass back.

303
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:10,073
You want the bullet?

304
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:11,947
Keep it.

305
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:16,717
- Everything go all right?
- You seemed pretty convinced,

306
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,085
especially when I said
you were gonna die.

307
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,674
I'm certainly glad
that didn't have to happen.

308
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,319
Actually, Richard, it did.

309
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,195
We better get back to camp.

310
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,572
You need to evacuate the island
of all nonessential personnel

311
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,069
and you need to do it...

312
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,241
- What the hell is going on here?
- Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan?

313
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,677
We're supposed to break ground
in less than 20 hours.

314
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,852
We're under imminent threat!
If we start drilling,

315
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,766
there's a high probability
of a cataclysmic accident.

316
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,991
We are drilling and on schedule.

317
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:08,741
- Horace, you're in charge.
- He's not in charge anymore.

318
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:12,738
This is my decision,
and it's been made.

319
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,160
- We keep working.
- Put us on the sub.

320
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,472
He's right. It ain't safe.

321
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:28,837
Put the women and children on the sub
and get 'em the hell out of here.

322
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:37,129
And if you put me and Juliet
on the sub with 'em...

323
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,912
We'll tell you anything
you wanna know.

324
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,296
You okay with that, sweetheart?

325
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,890
Absolutely.

326
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,933
You want on that sub, Jim?

327
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,635
Draw me a map.

328
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:03,871
I wanna know exactly
where the hostiles are.

329
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,703
You two know how to swim?

330
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:23,888
- Why don't we just go around it?
- No, dear, we need to go in.

331
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:27,298
We have to swim under the pond
to get to the tunnels.

332
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm not going.

333
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,263
What?

334
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,795
I'm gonna go back
and find everyone else.

335
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,546
I can't go any further with you.
Not this time.

336
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:40,139
You can't go back there now.
They know about us.

337
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,451
They... They tried to kill us.

338
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,669
And what are you trying to do?

339
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:52,693
- You're not going anywhere.
- Don't do that.

340
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,946
We're not used
to telling our secrets to strangers

341
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,777
- then just letting them saunter off.
- I don't care about your secrets.

342
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:00,703
- I just wanna leave.
- Put the gun...

343
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,411
- Move!
- If she wants to leave,

344
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,266
- she can leave!
- I said stop!

345
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,185
What are we doing here, Eloise?

346
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:29,104
That man just killed
one of our own people and you're acting

347
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,634
like it doesn't matter.

348
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,216
If these people are right
about what they're about to do,,

349
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,570
- it won't matter.
- And what are they about to do?

350
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,784
So you're telling me you're going
to erase the last 3 years of our lives?

351
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,537
- We can change things.
- I don't know if you're aware of this,

352
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,596
but I've already changed things.

353
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,268
I killed Benjamin Linus,

354
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,670
- and we're all still here.
- It's because you didn't kill him.

355
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:56,299
Sawyer and me took him to the Others
so they could save him.

356
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,027
- Why did you do that?
- Why did I do that?

357
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:07,668
Since when did shooting kids

358
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:10,187
and blowing up hydrogen bombs
become okay?

359
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:13,740
The 3 of us disappeared
off that plane and ended up here,

360
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:16,902
ended up now, because this is our chance
to change things.

361
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:20,440
And if you're wrong,
then everyone on the island dies.

362
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,696
- Do you understand that?
- I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it.

363
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,471
This is why we're here.

364
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:32,778
- This is our destiny.
- Do you know who you sound like?

365
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,882
Because he was crazy, too, Jack.
You said so yourself.

366
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:41,954
- Well, maybe I was wrong.
- No, you were right.

367
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,782
I'm going back
to find the rest of our people

368
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:49,518
because if I can't stop you,
then maybe they can.

369
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:00,696
<i>The submarine departs in 30 minutes.</i>

370
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,776
<i>All evacuees,
please proceed to the dock.</i>

371
00:29:07,072 --> 00:29:08,572
Come now, Charlotte.

372
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,425
Stay with me.

373
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,618
This is ridiculous.

374
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:17,296
- I can help you.
- No, Lara, you can't. Go over there.

375
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,793
I want you to leave

376
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,260
- now!
- Why is he yelling at her, dude?

377
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:28,766
It's the only way
he can get her to leave.

378
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,910
Sorry, man.

379
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:35,398
- We'd better get moving.
- Wait a second!

380
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:38,442
It's Jim and Juliet.

381
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,274
Why the hell are they...

382
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,280
Putting them on the sub?

383
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,037
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

384
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,039
Sawyer always has a plan, right?

385
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,838
We'll buy Microsoft.

386
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,561
Excuse me?

387
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:04,639
Then we'll bet the Cowboys
in the '78 Super Bowl.

388
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:06,663
We're gonna be rich.

389
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:10,661
Look, I'm sorry.

390
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:14,870
I should've listened to you
and get on this sub 3 years ago.

391
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,107
I'm glad you talked me out of it.

392
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:26,532
Come on, LaFleur. Get in.

393
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,058
Ladies first.

394
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:52,403
Good riddance.

395
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:13,340
If I don't see you the other side,
I won't blame you.

396
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:20,774
Now take a deep breath
and follow Richard under.

397
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:25,132
There's an opening in the bottom
of the rocks at the far side.

398
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:18,236
That was a lot further
than I thought it was.

399
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:21,146
Where are we?

400
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,407
The tunnels.

401
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:29,290
You wanna tell me how we're gonna
get a bomb out of here?

402
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:31,325
The same way we brought it in.

403
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,842
I assume you don't mean
through the pool.

404
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,526
It's a 12-foot long,
40,000-pound hydrogen bomb.

405
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,401
No, not through the pool.

406
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,822
I didn't think you'd come.

407
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,391
Well, if this works,
you might just save us all.

408
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,821
And if it doesn't? At least,
you'll put us out of our misery.

409
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,042
All right. Let's get started.

410
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,185
I'll have a tent
prepared for you, John.

411
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,949
- We'll get going in the morning.
- I thought we could leave right now.

412
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,845
Now?

413
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,470
I'm eager.

414
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,372
We can do whatever you want, but maybe
we should go to my tent and...

415
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:20,847
Is this everyone?

416
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:24,292
There's another group
at the temple, but...

417
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,622
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk
to everyone here now.

418
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:32,152
Of course. Be my guest.

419
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:40,995
Hello, everyone.

420
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,122
My name is John Locke.

421
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,016
I've been told that...

422
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:50,254
For some time, you all have been
accepting orders from a man named Jacob.

423
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:54,758
And yet, oddly enough, it seems
that no one has actually seen him.

424
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,156
Now I'm sure
there're very good reasons

425
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,927
why his existence and whereabouts
are secret.

426
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,569
I just don't know what they are.

427
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,295
And to be honest with you,
if there's a man

428
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,943
telling us what to do,
I want to know who he is.

429
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,497
This man, Jacob?

430
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:20,902
Can he tell us how to bring Jin
and the rest of our people back here?

431
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:22,077
Absolutely.

432
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:29,752
Richard has agreed to show us
where we need to go.

433
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,716
So I'm gonna go
and see Jacob right now.

434
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:39,845
And I'd like all of you
to come with me.

435
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:54,610
I'm starting to think John Locke
is gonna be trouble.

436
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:57,696
Why do you think
I tried to kill him?

437
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:15,104
We're shovin' off in two minutes.

438
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:17,611
Appreciate it
if you didn't cause us any trouble.

439
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:20,131
Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.

440
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,524
What are we gonna do
when we get to Ann Arbor?

441
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:28,873
- We ain't going to Ann Arbor.
- What do you mean?

442
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:31,580
These guys ain't cops.
They got no authority over us

443
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:33,355
back in the real world.

444
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:37,277
So once we dock wherever we dock...

445
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:39,845
We're free.

446
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,782
"Real world."

447
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:48,065
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

448
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,876
Hey, come here.

449
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:01,918
Whatever happens,
I got your back, remember?

450
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:05,389
I love you.

451
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:11,061
- I love you back.
- Hold on! - Don't close the hatch!

452
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,857
Horace wants her off the island, too.
We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.

453
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:19,049
Actually caught her
coming back into town.

454
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,598
Cuff her over there with the others.

455
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,749
<i>Clear the bridge.
All personnel, lay below on the double.</i>

456
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:00,777
We're away.
Engineering, take your stations.

457
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,071
Boat is clear for sea.

458
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:06,229
<i>All hands to your stations.
Prepare to dive.</i>

459
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:10,273
<i>Clear the bridge.
All hands below.</i>

460
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:13,751
- Stand by main vents.
- Diving position.

461
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,652
Stand by on ballast tanks.

462
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:21,798
<i>Ship has been cleared for dive. Repeat,
ship has been cleared for dive.</i>

463
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:23,654
<i>Stand by for dive. Ship to dive.</i>

464
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,762
<i>Clear engines two and three.
Test two and three.</i>

465
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:54,889
I'm sure it's occurred to you
that this woman's motivation

466
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:57,218
in helping us
detonate a hydrogen bomb

467
00:38:57,549 --> 00:39:00,279
is only to annihilate
the Dharma Initiative.

468
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,256
- Yes, but I still trust her.
- Why?

469
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,020
30 years from now,

470
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,595
she's the one who'll tell us
how to get back to the island.

471
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,866
And that makes you trust her?

472
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,409
Well...

473
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,188
Now what?

474
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:39,794
Beautiful day, isn't it?

475
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:41,365
Yes, so far.

476
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:45,618
Richard had some concerns

477
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,316
Concerns about what?

478
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,776
This pilgrimage to Jacob
makes him uncomfortable.

479
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,218
He's expressed

480
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,704
reservations about whether or not
you know what the hell you're doing.

481
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,710
I appreciate you bringing this
to my attention, Ben.

482
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:07,848
I know we got our differences
in the past, John.

483
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:10,023
But I'm here to follow you now.

484
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:14,012
So if you need Jacob to help you reunite
with your people, I'll do whatever...

485
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,473
I'm not interested in being reunited
with my people.

486
00:41:18,784 --> 00:41:20,227
What ? You told Sun...

487
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,358
I know what I told her.
That's not why we're going to Jacob.

488
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:26,149
Then why are we going to Jacob?

489
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:29,206
So I can kill him.
