00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:01,474
<i>Previously on "Lost"...</i>

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:03,152
The Dharma folks at
the Swan worksite--

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,154
they're gonna
drill into the ground

4
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:07,590
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

5
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,007
And <i>that</i> will
cause your plane--

6
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:12,218
Oceanic 815--
to crash on this island.

7
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:16,193
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

8
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:17,967
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

9
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,669
Morning.

10
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,705
Mornin'.

11
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,041
Mind if I join you?

12
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:58,409
Please.

13
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,115
Want some fish?

14
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:08,118
Thank you. I just ate.

15
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:10,487
I take it you're here
'cause of the ship.

16
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,723
I am.

17
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,729
How did they find
the island?

18
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:21,698
You'll have to ask 'em
when they get here.

19
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,268
I don't have to ask.

20
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:27,137
<i>You</i> brought them here.

21
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:31,142
Still trying to prove
me wrong, aren't you?

22
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,309
You <i>are</i> wrong.

23
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,211
Am I?

24
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,281
They come. They fight.

25
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,250
They destroy. They corrupt.

26
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,686
It always ends the same.

27
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,388
It only ends once.

28
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:49,059
Anything that happens
before that is just progress.

29
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:02,306
Do you have any idea
how badly I wanna kill you?

30
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:04,641
Yes.

31
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,679
One of these days,
sooner or later...

32
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,381
I'm going to find a loophole,
my friend.

33
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:14,251
Well, when you do,
I'll be right here.

34
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:20,390
Always nice
talking to you, Jacob.

35
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,427
Nice talking to you, too.

36
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:14,839
Are you gonna do it?

37
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,108
Unh-unh. <i>You</i> do it.

38
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:20,011
Fine. I'll do it. But you're
gonna be lookout, okay?

39
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,479
Okay.

40
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:30,455
The crops came in
pretty good this year.

41
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:33,758
Hey you hear? Frank bought
the old...

42
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,360
Yeah, I hear
he's gonna farm the land

43
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:39,197
all the way out to Ames road.
- Yeah, I hear that, too.

44
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:45,069
<i> # two cigarettes</i>
<i>in an ashtray #</i>

45
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:47,105
<i># my love and I #</i>

46
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,440
There's nothing
he would like less.

47
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:54,278
<i># in a small cafe #</i>

48
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,981
What you kids got there?

49
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,916
Open your bag.

50
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,356
Mm-hmm.
Where'd you get this?

51
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,092
Got it over there.
- I know you.

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,634
You're Diane Austen's girl.
What's your name?

53
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:12,163
Katie.

54
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,565
Well, Katie, I'm calling
your mom, then the cops,

55
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:18,503
because I don't tolerate
stealing here. You understand?

56
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,838
No need to do that.

57
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:23,207
I'll pay for it.

58
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,309
I hope this is enough.

59
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,214
Well, long as somebody
pays for it,

60
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:33,017
guess there's no harm done.

61
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,987
But I don't wanna
see you in here ever again

62
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,189
without your parents.
You understand me?

63
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,927
Thanks, mister.

64
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,729
You're welcome.

65
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,966
You're not gonna
steal anymore, are you?

66
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,874
Be good, Katie.

67
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,547
<i> Welcome aboard, everyone.</i>

68
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,582
<i>We will be doing some</i>
<i>system checks offshore here</i>

69
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,251
<i>before heading out</i>
<i>into the open ocean</i>

70
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,353
<i>and submerging to</i>
<i>our operational running depth.</i>

71
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,923
<i>You should be receiving</i>
<i>your sedatives,</i>

72
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,393
<i>and then we will escort you</i>
<i>to your sleeping berths.</i>

73
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,029
Have a nice rest.
See you on the other side.

74
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,834
We have to get out of here.

75
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,403
"Out of here"?

76
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,405
We're underwater.

77
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,064
What the hell are you doing here?
How'd you get caught?

78
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,175
I came back to get you.

79
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,678
Came back to get me for what?
- Where's Jack?

80
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,648
Jack is on his way
to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

81
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:41,652
Why the hell would he do that?
- Does it matter? We have to stop him.

82
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:49,894
Sorry, I'm gonna pass.

83
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:51,896
Did you hear
what I just said?

84
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:54,932
Yeah, I heard you.
You just don't get it, Kate.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,703
We were happy in Dharmaville
till y'all showed up.

86
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,839
But now that's all over.

87
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:04,308
So we're gonna
drink our O.J.

88
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,777
and take our chances
in the real world.

89
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,813
Jack wants
to blow up the island?

90
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,884
Good for Jack.

91
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:17,355
Is there anything in there
about how we're supposed to move

92
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:19,857
a 10-ton bomb
across the island?

93
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,193
Actually,
it's 20 tons.

94
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:24,495
Fortunately,
it seems that Faraday

95
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,931
never intended to freight
the device in its entirety.

96
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:27,965
What?

97
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,268
He left
detailed instructions

98
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,870
on how to remove
the Plutonium core...

99
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,574
and how to detonate it.

100
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:38,676
Faraday told me
that we needed to wipe out

101
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,678
some kind of pocket
of energy.

102
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,614
Is only part of the bomb
gonna be enough to do that?

103
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:46,183
The core itself is
a thermonuclear weapon.

104
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,654
It'll be more than enough.

105
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,225
Hey! Hey! Wait.

106
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,193
We sealed that thing up
20 years ago,

107
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,762
and we put it underground

108
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,264
because it was
emitting radiation.

109
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:01,149
Does this sound like a
good idea to you, Eloise?

110
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,366
Richard--

111
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:03,342
You're pregnant.

112
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:06,804
Which is exactly why we have
to help them see this through.

113
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,040
Once the core is removed,

114
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,107
then what?

115
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,076
Then we have
approximately two hours

116
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:15,279
to take it to the Swan site.
- Two hours?

117
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,749
When Faraday
returned to the island,

118
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:22,720
he was very explicit
about his timetable.

119
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:25,690
Well then...
we'd better get movin'.

120
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:40,938
Who stopped the damn drill?!

121
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:42,673
I did.

122
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,242
Why?
- Because when we passed 70 meters,

123
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,211
the drill temp went up
60 degrees,

124
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,213
and I didn't want it
to melt.

125
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,982
Well, Pierre, that's why we have
a truck full of water.

126
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,318
So cool it down
and turn it on.

127
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:56,354
Stuart, we've just
evacuated the island

128
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:58,289
of all nonessential
personnel.

129
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,291
We're in the midst
of a possible insurrection.

130
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,259
Do you really think
this is the ideal time

131
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,485
for your experiments?

132
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:06,297
I've been working on
this project for six years--

133
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,666
designing a station
that'll be able

134
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,901
to manipulate electromagnetism
in ways we only dreamed of.

135
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,037
Have you thought
about the consequences

136
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,106
of drilling
into that pocket?!

137
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,088
We have no idea what
we are going to--

138
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,243
If Edison was only worried
about the consequences,

139
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,612
we'd all still
be sitting in the dark.

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,447
I came to this island
to change the world, Pierre.

141
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:25,683
That's <i>exactly</i> what
I intend to to.

142
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,018
Let's get it started!

143
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,522
Take five, everybody.

144
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,358
We still got a ways to go
to get to Jacob's.

145
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,027
Who's Jacob?

146
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:12,630
He's in charge
of this island.

147
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,598
You said John was in charge.

148
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,067
No, I said
he was the leader--

149
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,837
a title that I've discovered
is incredibly temporary.

150
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,906
But everyone answers
to someone,

151
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,375
and the leader
answers to Jacob.

152
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:26,076
What's he like?

153
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,348
I don't know, Sun.
I've never met him.

154
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,795
You've been staring for
the last ten minutes, Richard.

155
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,631
Is there something
you would like to ask me?

156
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,802
Ben told me that...
he strangled you.

157
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,206
That is my recollection,
yes.

158
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:57,208
He said he was sure
you were dead.

159
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:59,410
He saw your coffin
loaded onto that plane

160
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:02,112
that you came back on.
How are you alive?

161
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,114
Well, you've been
on this island

162
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,550
much longer than I have,
Richard.

163
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,752
If anyone should have
an explanation,

164
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,054
I'd think it would be you.

165
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,189
Yeah, I -I have been
here a long time, John,

166
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,492
and I've seen things
on this island

167
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,494
that I can barely describe.

168
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:18,963
But... I've never seen someone
come back to life.

169
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,633
And I've never seen anyone
who doesn't age.

170
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,635
It doesn't mean
it can't happen.

171
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:27,705
I'm this way
because of Jacob.

172
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,707
And if I had to guess,

173
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,276
he's the reason you're not
in that coffin anymore.

174
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,245
I agree completely,
Richard.

175
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:37,982
That's why I'm doing this--
so I can thank him.

176
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,951
And once I've done that,
we're gonna need to deal with

177
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,521
the rest of the passengers
from the Ajira flight

178
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,489
that brought me here.

179
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,792
What do you mean, "deal with"?
- You know what I mean.

180
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:53,230
Let's go!

181
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,424
Untie the crates.

182
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,031
Why'd we even bring this yahoo?
- Because we might need him.

183
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:30,434
For <i>what?</i> He didn't know
the answer to the question.

184
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,937
That doesn't mean
he's not important.

185
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:35,039
What, you think
he's a candidate?

186
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:41,645
He's awake.

187
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,952
How long you been
listening to us?

188
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,655
Long enough to wonder what
the hell I'm a candidate for.

189
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:58,028
Who the hell are you people?
- We're friends.

190
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:00,931
So you smack all your friends
in the face with a rifle,

191
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,367
shove 'em in a boat
and kidnap 'em?

192
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,402
Only the ones we like.

193
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,708
Let's go.

194
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,382
What's in the box?

195
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:24,655
Your call.

196
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:31,562
Open it.

197
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,446
Terrific.

198
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,707
Need a pen, son?

199
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:47,046
Yeah. Thanks.

200
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,184
There you go.

201
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,919
You can keep it.

202
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,826
I'm very sorry about
your mother and father, James.

203
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:18,277
Come on, Jimmy. We gotta get
to the cemetery, okay?

204
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,647
What you writin'?

205
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:23,049
Nothin'.

206
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:31,223
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,

207
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,360
"you don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

208
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:36,462
and I know what you done."

209
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,705
Listen to me, Jimmy.

210
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:47,340
I know you're angry

211
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:50,309
at the man that did this
to your mama and daddy.

212
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:53,412
And hell,
you got every right to be.

213
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,248
But you gotta move on, boy.

214
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,017
They're gone,

215
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:02,521
and there ain't nothin'
you can do to change that.

216
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:06,325
What's done is done.

217
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,365
Now promise me you're not gonna
finish that letter.

218
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,002
I promise.

219
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,138
Good.

220
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,909
Come on.
Let's go say good-bye.

221
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,791
Let me get this straight.

222
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:42,528
Jack sets off a nuke,
which somehow resets everything.

223
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:45,698
So flight 815 never crashes.
It just...

224
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,734
lands in L.A. safe and sound,
and none of this never happens.

225
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,703
Sawyer, if Jack does this,

226
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,272
he could kill everyone on the island.
- Yeah, I heard that part.

227
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,742
And you're okay with that?
- You ain't hearing me, Kate.

228
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,247
I made a choice,
and I'm sticking to it.

229
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:04,049
I decided to leave,
and I'm leavin'.

230
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:06,218
Alright,
here's your sedatives.

231
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,591
What the hell
did you just do?

232
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,595
<i>We</i> decided to leave
this island, James. <i>We</i> did.

233
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:19,398
And now we're going back.

234
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:22,768
You serious?
- We can't just let those people die.

235
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,405
You want out?

236
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,408
You wanna stay here
and whine about it?

237
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,681
Unlock the damn cuffs.

238
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:37,650
"Galaga" to Base.
The system check is complete.

239
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,386
We're locked on
departure bearing

240
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,388
and ready to leave the island.

241
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:44,356
Roger that, "Galaga."
have a safe trip.

242
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:46,325
See you on the return.

243
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,297
Give me your gun.

244
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:57,036
Appreciate that, captain. Now we
need you to surface the sub.

245
00:17:57,103 --> 00:18:01,407
What? I can't take this sub--
- Oh, I think you can.

246
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,310
Once we're gone, proceed
on course. Whatever you do,

247
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,112
do not take those people
back to the island. Understand?

248
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,081
And what if Horace
tries to contact me?

249
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,484
What am I supposed to say?

250
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,887
You ain't home.

251
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,191
Go.

252
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:34,006
Sayid...

253
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:36,108
Is this big enough?
- That'll do.

254
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,948
Are you done with Faraday's journal?
- Take it.

255
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:12,111
Can I ask you a question?

256
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:13,612
Sure.

257
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,315
Over, uh, 20 years ago,

258
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,350
a man named John Locke...

259
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,154
he walked right into our camp,

260
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:25,157
and he told me that he was
gonna be our leader.

261
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:29,161
Now I've gone off the island
three times since then

262
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,430
to visit him.

263
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:34,800
But he never seemed, uh,
particularly special to me.

264
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,936
You said you had a question.

265
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,438
You <i>know</i> him? Locke?

266
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,510
Yeah.

267
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:46,278
Yeah, I know him.

268
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:51,517
And if I were you,
I wouldn't give up on him.

269
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,001
Why haven't you
told him yet?

270
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:10,703
Told who what?

271
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,541
Richard. Why haven't you told
him about my plans for Jacob?

272
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:18,510
If by "plans" you mean
murdering him, John,

273
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:21,880
I assume you'd want
to keep that a secret.

274
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:25,551
When did that
ever stop you?

275
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:28,020
Well, I started thinking
differently about things

276
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,489
when my dead daughter
threated to destroy me

277
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,791
if I didn't do
everything you said.

278
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:35,394
Whoa. W-w-wait. Wait.

279
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,396
Where did this happen?

280
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:40,032
In that cavern
beneath the temple,

281
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,968
when we went
to see the monster.

282
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,704
So...

283
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,673
You're willing to do
whatever I say

284
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,708
No matter what it is?

285
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,646
Yes.

286
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:56,882
Well, then...

287
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,885
I guess I won't have to
convince you after all.

288
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:04,857
Convince me to do what?

289
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,094
I'm not gonna kill Jacob,
Ben.

290
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,431
<i>You</i> are.

291
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,618
Paris or Rome?
- No.

292
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,087
Florence?
- It doesn't matter, Sayid...

293
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,356
Yes, it does.
- As long as we're together.

294
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:36,306
It's our anniversary.
We have to find the perfect place.

295
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:37,693
I would settle for
finding my sunglasses.

296
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:43,865
Excuse me, sir?
Could you you help me?

297
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:47,469
I'm sorry. I think I'm lost.
Are you from Los Angeles?

298
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,105
What are you looking for?
- I found them.

299
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:57,245
Nadia?

300
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,353
Nadia?

301
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,990
Nadia?

302
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:50,665
Time is short. Let's go.

303
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,068
Ok, stand back.

304
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,320
It's one of the Dharma houses.

305
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,689
I'll go first.

306
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:50,492
Jack, don't misunderstand
who's in charge here.

307
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,027
<i>I'll</i> go first.

308
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:54,629
Because if someone
at that house is a threat,

309
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:57,165
you might hesitate...
But I won't.

310
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,668
All right. Okay, Eloise, go on.
After you.

311
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,703
Once we give you
the "all clear,"

312
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:05,340
<i>then</i> you bring the bomb.

313
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:08,076
We don't want any acci--oh!

314
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,212
What the hell are you doing?

315
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,681
I'm protecting our leader. Get back.

316
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,585
She's gonna be angry
when she wakes up,

317
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:19,020
but that's a lot better
than being dead.

318
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,989
She ordered me to help you.
We helped you.

319
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,958
Now you're on your own.

320
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:26,661
And I'm taking her out
the way we came in.

321
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,130
After you.

322
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,626
<i> all residents,</i>
<i>we are in a code black.</i>

323
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,261
<i>Report with your weapons</i>

324
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,396
<i>to your security assignments</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

325
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:06,434
<i>If you come into contact</i>
<i>with a hostile,</i>

326
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:09,204
<i>you are authorized</i>
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

327
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,474
How the hell are we gonna
get out of here?

328
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:17,646
Go! We don't have time!

329
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,614
We hide in plain sight.

330
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:29,958
Set up a perimeter
around the barracks first.

331
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:33,061
You gonna go over there
by the gate. You get two...

332
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:40,502
So you guys go.
You go to pylons.

333
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,138
We're gathering
over there.

334
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:56,518
Hey.

335
00:25:56,586 --> 00:25:58,053
Hey!

336
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,288
You're the son of a
bitch who shot my kid.

337
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,459
Don't fire that weapon!

338
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:07,362
I'm carrying a nuclear device.

339
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,232
It's the hostile!

340
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:23,245
Hey!
Let's go!

341
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:50,772
Get in!

342
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:54,542
Drive!

343
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,352
From the looks
of the sun,

344
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,688
I'd say that's
the north shore over there.

345
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:19,525
Sun's over there.
That's gotta be the west coast.

346
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:22,795
Really? What, you got a compass?
- No. Do you?

347
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,118
Thank you.

348
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,986
For what?

349
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:50,622
For backing me up
at the sub.

350
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,091
No problem.

351
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:56,695
I got no idea
where the hell we are.

352
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,967
Vincent! Come here! Hey!

353
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:03,469
Hey! Hey!

354
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,104
How you doing, boy?

355
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:06,772
I haven't seen you

356
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,108
since the flaming arrows three years ago.
- Hi!

357
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,077
How you doing?
- How did he survive alone out here?

358
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:14,947
Oh, hell, no.

359
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:20,085
Bernard!

360
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:30,195
They found us.

361
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:35,567
Son of a bitch.

362
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:42,841
Is that a bomb?!

363
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:44,877
Try not to move.
I need to stop the bleeding.

364
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:47,130
What's going on back there?
Is Sayid okay?

365
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,147
Does he look okay?!

366
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:51,450
Just keep your eyes
on the damn road!

367
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:52,338
Should I pull over?

368
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,453
Yeah, let's pull over
and get shot! Just drive!

369
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:57,022
I don't know where we're going.
- The Swan site. Head for the Swan.

370
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,892
Why do you want to go there?
If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we--

371
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,460
Hurley, if you want to save
Sayid, take us to the Swan.

372
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:02,362
The Swan it is.

373
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,883
Jack, what's at the Swan?

374
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:06,366
I think I found a way to
get you back to your wife.

375
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:13,438
So hold on.
You're telling me

376
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,908
you've just been living
out here in the jungle

377
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:18,710
for the past three years, by yourselves?
- Uh-huh.

378
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,146
Well, I'm sorry y'all
got left behind.

379
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:23,615
Didn't you hear me shout out,
"meet at the creek"?

380
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:26,118
You mean with flaming arrows
raining down around us,

381
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,921
killing everyone we knew?
Oh, sure, we heard ya.

382
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,123
Well, we spent all sorts of time
looking for ya.

383
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:34,359
I had Jin out searching
the island grid by grid.

384
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:36,328
Yeah, we know.

385
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:38,664
You know?

386
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, sure, you guys all joined up
with the Dharma Initiative.

387
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:43,735
Well, damn, I could've
brought both y'all in.

388
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:46,380
Why didn't you find a way
to tell us you were out here?

389
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,439
Because we're retired.

390
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,714
So y'all been
scavenging food

391
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:58,650
and living out in a hut by yourselves.
- People try their whole lives

392
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:01,620
to get themselves a nice,
quiet place near the ocean

393
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:05,023
where they can live in peace.
And we did it.

394
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:06,992
That's what we made
for ourselves.

395
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,028
Well, I hate to rain
on your parade, but...

396
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:12,097
your condo's
about to go ka-blooey.

397
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:13,899
Jack has a bomb.

398
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,000
Who cares?

399
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:16,668
Excuse me?

400
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:19,004
It's always something
with you people.

401
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,506
Now you say
Jack's got a bomb.

402
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:24,910
And what, you guys are all
gonna try to stop him, right?

403
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:26,378
Yeah, that's right.

404
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:28,280
We traveled back
30 years in time,

405
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:31,717
and you're still trying to find
ways to shoot each other?

406
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:35,053
Rose, we just need to know

407
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:37,522
which way the Dharma barracks
are from here

408
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,658
so we can stop Jack,

409
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:41,660
or you're gonna be dead.

410
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:43,228
We all will.

411
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:45,497
So we die.

412
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:47,599
We just care
about being together.

413
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,774
That's all that matters
in the end.

414
00:31:01,948 --> 00:31:05,217
The barracks
are 5 Miles that way.

415
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:11,156
Bernard.
- Sawyer.

416
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,457
Rose.

417
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,192
Thank you.

418
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,029
Let's go.
Bye.

419
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:19,498
You sure don't want
some tea?

420
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:26,438
Maybe another time.

421
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:41,820
I wish you'd never showed me
what was in this damn box.

422
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:43,855
What the hell you gonna
do with it anyway?

423
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:45,857
We need to show it
to somebody.

424
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:47,392
What for?

425
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,494
So they'll know
what they're up against.

426
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,431
What exactly are they up against?
- Something a hell of a lot scarier

427
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:55,400
than what's in this box,
Frank.

428
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:59,838
Don't worry, though. As long
as you're with us, you're fine.

429
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:02,808
That's be reassuring if
I knew who you were, "friend."

430
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,477
We are the good guys.

431
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:08,313
In my experience, the people
who go out of their way

432
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:11,149
To tell you that the good guys
are the bad guys.

433
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,288
We're here.

434
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,437
Look at the ash!

435
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,044
Wait here.

436
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,945
I'm here
because I need your help.

437
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:54,553
Can you do that?

438
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:00,392
Will you help me, Ilana?

439
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,896
Yes.

440
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,484
What happened?

441
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:02,120
He isn't there,
hasn't been in a long time.

442
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,356
Someone else
has been using it.

443
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:09,227
Burn it!

444
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,333
I'm no tree hugger
or anything,

445
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:18,637
but that's a pretty good way
to torch the whole jungle,

446
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,739
don't you think?

447
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:22,607
So what now?

448
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,151
Well, I guess we know
where <i>we're</i> going.

449
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,551
Oh! Oh, my god!

450
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,130
Oh, my God! Call 9-1-1!

451
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:40,133
Is he all right?
I don't know!

452
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:52,178
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be all right.

453
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:59,118
I'm sorry
this happened to you.

454
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:26,946
This is our old camp.

455
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,481
Home sweet home.

456
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,052
All right, everyone,
Richard tells me

457
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,088
we should get to where
we're going by nightfall.

458
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,057
So why don't you all
take this opportunity

459
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,026
to rest up
and catch your breath?

460
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,029
Considering what I have planned
for ya, you're gonna need it.

461
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:56,108
Everything all right?

462
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:59,011
I <i>was</i>
enjoying some alone time.

463
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,316
You see what's behind you?

464
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:10,490
It's a door. How about that?

465
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:12,458
It's not just a door, Ben.

466
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:15,661
It's the door to the hatch
where you and I first met.

467
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,632
You mind if
I ask you a question?

468
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,268
I'm a Pisces.

469
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:25,104
What happened
that day at the cabin,

470
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:28,040
when you first took me
to meet Jacob?

471
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:33,513
Well, you clearly
already know

472
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,015
that I was talking to
an empty chair, John...

473
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:40,486
that I was pretending.

474
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:43,956
Which is not to say that I
wasn't as surprised as you were

475
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:47,460
when things started flying
around in the room.

476
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,929
But why would you go
to all the trouble

477
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,164
to make something
like that up?

478
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:57,737
I was embarrassed.

479
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:01,407
I didn't want you to know
that I had never seen Jacob.

480
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:07,547
So, yes, I lied.

481
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:11,717
That's what I do.

482
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,992
All right, then.

483
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,729
Why do you want <i>me</i>
to kill Jacob, John?

484
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,734
Because...

485
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:31,571
despite your loyal service
to this island,

486
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:33,439
you got cancer...

487
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:37,243
you had to watch
your own daughter gunned down

488
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:40,580
right in front of you.

489
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,648
And your reward
for those sacrifices?

490
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,216
You were banished.

491
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,486
And you did all this

492
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,690
in the name of a man
you'd never even met.

493
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,860
So the question is, Ben,

494
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:58,297
why the hell
<i>wouldn't</i> you wanna kill Jacob?

495
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,293
How much further?

496
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,295
Uh, we're about five minutes
away.

497
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:19,398
You can't stop the bleeding.

498
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:21,667
I need fresh dressings.

499
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:25,604
Jack, so this bomb is supposed
to what, blow us back in time?

500
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,772
We're not going back in time.

501
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,375
Right, because that
would be ridiculous.

502
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:31,310
I need to modify the bomb.

503
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:34,246
I can rig it
so it detonates on impact.

504
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:37,850
Jack, we need to be there
at the moment of the incident.

505
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,319
Or all of this
will be for nothing.

506
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:44,156
Why the hell are we stopping?

507
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:45,591
<i>That's</i> why.

508
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:12,487
What is it?

509
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:15,023
Why are we stopping?

510
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:16,725
You'll see.

511
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:39,681
Well, it's a wonderful foot,
Richard,

512
00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:44,019
but what does it have to do with Jacob?
- It's where he lives.

513
00:44:59,502 --> 00:45:02,237
What's going on, Kate?

514
00:45:02,305 --> 00:45:03,707
Do we gotta talk.

515
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,757
You wanna talk?
Then get in the van.

516
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:08,974
We don't have time--

517
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:10,778
I ain't gettin' in the van.

518
00:45:10,546 --> 00:45:12,814
I need five minutes,
that's all.

519
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:14,816
I'll say what I gotta say,

520
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:17,886
and then you can do whatever
the hell you want to.

521
00:45:17,954 --> 00:45:21,489
But you're gonna listen.
You owe me that much, Jack.

522
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:26,761
Five minutes.

523
00:45:57,526 --> 00:45:59,628
Dr. Shephard?
You all right?

524
00:45:59,695 --> 00:46:02,330
The dural sac--I cut it.

525
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,168
Give me some suction.
Calm down. It's all right.

526
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:09,437
The fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't--
- Look at me.

527
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:11,539
Give me some suction.
Yes, doctor.

528
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,408
Jack... <i>look</i> at me.

529
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:18,413
Count to five.
- What are you talking about?

530
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:20,849
I'm talking about
you stitching up the sac

531
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,818
so this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

532
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:28,089
And the only way you're gonna
do that is not to be afraid.

533
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:31,393
So close your eyes,
count to five,

534
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,995
and then fix her, Jack.

535
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:39,334
Or I'll have to fix her
for you.

536
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:49,878
One...

537
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:52,147
Two...

538
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:53,848
Three...

539
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:57,085
Four...

540
00:46:57,153 --> 00:46:58,320
Five.

541
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,425
Sutures.

542
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:26,781
Hey, kiddo.
Girl's in recovery.

543
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,217
She's responsive
to stimulus below the waist,

544
00:47:29,285 --> 00:47:32,087
so... no paralysis.

545
00:47:32,154 --> 00:47:33,488
Good.

546
00:47:35,391 --> 00:47:38,093
Something wrong, Jack?

547
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,261
You embarrassed me.

548
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,797
Did I?

549
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:45,233
You know, it's bad enough

550
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,202
that everybody
in this hospital thinks

551
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:49,738
the only reason
I got this residency

552
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:52,207
is because you're my father.
But then you...

553
00:47:52,274 --> 00:47:55,110
you put me in a time-out
during my first major procedure,

554
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:57,746
in front of my entire team.

555
00:47:57,813 --> 00:48:01,850
Dad, I know
you don't believe in me,

556
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,052
but I need them to.

557
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,187
Are you sure <i>I'm</i> the one

558
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:09,758
who doesn't believe in you,
Jack?

559
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:19,267
One of these yours?

560
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,140
Machine got stuck.

561
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,410
I guess it just needed
a little push.

562
00:48:45,628 --> 00:48:47,529
Take a load off, Doc.

563
00:48:47,596 --> 00:48:49,564
No, thanks.

564
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:52,233
Sit down, Jack.

565
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:02,710
My folks died
when I was 8 years old.

566
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:04,879
I ever tell you that?

567
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,549
No.

568
00:49:07,616 --> 00:49:10,318
Con man took my dad
for everything he had.

569
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:14,022
He didn't handle it
too well, so...

570
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:19,027
he shot my mom,
then he blew his own head off.

571
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:21,496
I was hiding under the bed
when it happened.

572
00:49:21,564 --> 00:49:23,598
I heard the whole thing.

573
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,469
I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

574
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:32,073
That was a year ago.

575
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,042
What?

576
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,178
Right now it's July 1977,

577
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:40,348
which means that happened
last year.

578
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:43,084
So I could've
hopped on the sub,

579
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:45,453
gone back to the States,

580
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:48,356
walked right in my house

581
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:51,259
and stopped my daddy
from killing anybody.

582
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:53,394
Why didn't you?

583
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:57,298
Because, Jack...

584
00:49:57,366 --> 00:49:59,968
what's done is done.

585
00:50:03,472 --> 00:50:06,207
It doesn't have to be
that way.

586
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:09,310
What did you screw up so bad
the first time around

587
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:11,346
you're willing to blow up
a damn nuke

588
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:13,815
just for a second chance?
- That's not what this is about.

589
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:16,151
Then <i>what</i> is it about?

590
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:21,489
Three years ago,

591
00:50:21,557 --> 00:50:25,193
Locke told me that all this
was happening for a reason,

592
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:27,996
that us being here
was our destiny.

593
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:30,632
I don't speak "destiny."

594
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:33,601
What I do understand
is a man does what he does

595
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:36,337
'cause he wants something
for himself.

596
00:50:39,942 --> 00:50:44,279
What do you want, Jack?

597
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:54,155
I had her.

598
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:59,060
I had her, and I lost her.

599
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:03,064
Kate.

600
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,732
Well, damn, Doc,

601
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,702
she's standing right on
the other side of those trees.

602
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,171
You want her back,
just go and ask her.

603
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,941
Nah, it's too late
for that.

604
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:19,914
Your five minutes is up.

605
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:22,884
Jack...

606
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:25,153
If what you're doin'
even works,

607
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,155
you and Kate
will be strangers,

608
00:51:27,223 --> 00:51:29,123
and she'll be
in damn handcuffs.

609
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:32,360
If it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

610
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:37,265
Well, I guess
there's nothing I can say

611
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,468
that's gonna change your mind.
- No, I guess there's not.

612
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:44,439
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

613
00:51:55,517 --> 00:51:57,852
You think you can come here

614
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,288
and do whatever the hell
you want?

615
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:02,624
I had a <i>life</i> here!

616
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:09,764
Sawyer...

617
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:26,180
Will you stop?

618
00:52:26,248 --> 00:52:28,650
Will you stop?!
- No.

619
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,354
Aah!

620
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:36,057
James!

621
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,559
Let him go.

622
00:52:38,627 --> 00:52:41,329
He wouldn't listen. I had to.
He won't stop!

623
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:43,965
That's because he's right.

624
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,800
What?!

625
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:47,402
He's right, James.

626
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,370
We <i>have</i> to do this.

627
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:51,639
What are you talking about?!

628
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:54,575
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

629
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:56,444
What happened?!

630
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:01,349
I changed my mind.

631
00:53:10,278 --> 00:53:13,547
Girls...
Your dad and I have something

632
00:53:13,615 --> 00:53:15,949
we need to talk
to you both about.

633
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:18,052
Are we moving again?

634
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,487
No, stupid.
They're getting a divorce.

635
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:22,222
Rachel--
- Well, <i>aren't</i> you?

636
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,060
Yes.
- But...

637
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:28,062
We need you both
to understand

638
00:53:28,129 --> 00:53:30,497
that your father and I...

639
00:53:30,565 --> 00:53:32,466
we still love each other.

640
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:35,002
Just because two people
love each other,

641
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,538
doesn't always mean
they're supposed to be together.

642
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:40,040
But what if you <i>are</i>
supposed to be together?

643
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:42,509
We're not, Honey.

644
00:53:42,577 --> 00:53:45,012
But how can you know for sure?
- We just know.

645
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:49,249
And when you're a grown-up,

646
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:51,251
you'll understand.

647
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:54,888
I don't wanna understand!

648
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:56,757
Juliet, wait!

649
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:58,659
I don't wanna understand!

650
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:01,628
Stop! We gotta talk about this!
- There's nothing to talk about, James.

651
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,764
We have to let Jack do
what he came here to do.

652
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:06,567
Well, maybe you shoulda told me
you had a change of heart

653
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:08,285
before I brought him out in
the jungle to kick his ass.

654
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:08,937
Would that have stopped you?

655
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:09,742
No.

656
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:12,774
Well, then I'm glad you
finally got it out of your system.

657
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,976
Hey! Hey!
- You, don't.

658
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,346
I need you to tell me
where all this is coming from.

659
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:22,649
I mean, one minute, you're
leading the great sub escape,

660
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,086
and now you're on board
with blowing up the damn island?

661
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:29,389
I got a right to know
why you changed your mind.

662
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:35,295
I changed my mind
when I saw you look at her.

663
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:38,899
Don't. Don't.

664
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,567
Don't. Don't.

665
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:43,137
I don't care
who I looked at.

666
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:44,872
I'm with you.

667
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:49,409
And you would stay with me
forever if I let you,

668
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:52,279
and that is why
I will always love you.

669
00:54:52,347 --> 00:54:52,921
You don't--

670
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,215
What we had, it was
just for a little while.

671
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:57,184
And just because
we love each other,

672
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,153
it doesn't mean
that we're meant to be together.

673
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,989
I mean, maybe we were <i>never</i>
supposed to be together.

674
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:04,958
So if Jack can make it that--
that none of you ever come here,

675
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:06,994
then he should.

676
00:55:08,496 --> 00:55:12,065
Why you doing this, Juliet?

677
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:18,372
I...

678
00:55:20,842 --> 00:55:26,280
if I never meet you,
then I never have to lose you.

679
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:42,196
Radzinsky!

680
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:43,864
What is it now?!

681
00:55:43,932 --> 00:55:46,967
The gauss readings
has jumped off the charts.

682
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:49,536
Let me see.

683
00:55:49,604 --> 00:55:52,573
This is it!
We're on top of the pocket!

684
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,541
If we keep drilling
and hit that pocket,

685
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:57,578
all hell is gonna break loose!
Radzinsky, are you there? Over.

686
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,381
Stuart, come in!
What do you want, Phil?

687
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:03,784
That hostile that shot the kid?
He came back.

688
00:56:03,851 --> 00:56:06,453
What the hell
are you talking about?

689
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:08,422
Here at the barracks.
He--he attacked us

690
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:10,390
and then got rescued
by some of the other recruits.

691
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:12,659
They stole a van and took off.
- Took off where?

692
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:14,361
I don't know,

693
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:16,363
but Roger said
that one of them had a bomb.

694
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:19,800
That hostile knows
about the Swan!

695
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,768
Get some men and some guns,

696
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,137
and get your asses
out here right now!

697
00:56:24,205 --> 00:56:27,407
If they're coming here,
we're gonna be ready for 'em.

698
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:30,844
Come on!
Keep it on the ground!

699
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:34,648
Jack? What happened?

700
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,817
Uh...

701
00:56:36,884 --> 00:56:39,286
Yeah, my talk with Sawyer
didn't go so good.

702
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,856
Does it hurt?

703
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:44,825
Ah, it's okay.
- Okay.

704
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:55,569
Do you remember when I sewed
you up? When we first got here?

705
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:57,738
Yeah.

706
00:56:57,805 --> 00:56:59,706
Seems like
a million years ago.

707
00:56:59,774 --> 00:57:02,276
Or 30 years from now.

708
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:15,989
Kate, why'd you make me promise
to never ask about Aaron?

709
00:57:20,328 --> 00:57:23,530
Because I was...

710
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:27,567
so angry with you
for making me come back here.

711
00:57:27,635 --> 00:57:31,138
Is he why you came back?

712
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:34,908
I came back so he could be
where he belongs--

713
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:36,843
with his mother.

714
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,146
If this works, Claire will
never come to the land,

715
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:41,148
and they'll always
be together,

716
00:57:41,215 --> 00:57:42,683
just the way they're meant to be.

717
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:44,685
She was gonna give him
up for adoption, Jack.

718
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,687
Well, you don't know
what she would do.

719
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,889
And whatever it is,
it would be her choice.

720
00:57:48,956 --> 00:57:53,060
If you wanna save Claire?
This is the only way to do it.

721
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:58,532
Nothing... <i>nothing</i> in my life
has ever felt so right.

722
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,368
And...

723
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,204
I just need you
to believe that.

724
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:12,913
Go!

725
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,248
Keep going!

726
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:20,654
Keep the drill going!

727
00:58:20,722 --> 00:58:23,023
It's about to happen.

728
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:29,763
Are you with me on this?

729
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:37,003
Yes.

730
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,305
Then let's go.

731
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:48,018
Copy that.

732
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:50,820
One wallet.

733
00:58:50,888 --> 00:58:55,892
$227 cash.

734
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,962
One ballpoint pen.

735
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,897
One fruit roll-up.

736
00:59:00,965 --> 00:59:02,866
Sign here.

737
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:05,335
You don't understand.
This is a big mistake.

738
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:07,637
I killed a bunch of people.

739
00:59:07,705 --> 00:59:09,940
You see this?

740
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:12,309
This is a discharge form.
You've been cleared.

741
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:15,712
So take your stuff and go.
- Look, dude...

742
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:19,115
there are men
with tranquilizer guns

743
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:21,084
hunting me down
like an animal.

744
00:59:21,152 --> 00:59:23,720
They wanna bring me somewhere
against my will.

745
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:26,656
There's a cab stand
right out front.

746
00:59:33,464 --> 00:59:36,232
Oh. Sorry. I didn't see
it was taken, dude.

747
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,151
Actually, I'm only going a
few blocks if you wanna share.

748
00:59:39,152 --> 00:59:40,036
Cool. Are you sure?

749
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:42,472
Come on in.

750
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:49,946
You want some?

751
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:51,448
Cherry.

752
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:52,916
No thanks.

753
00:59:54,618 --> 00:59:56,219
So what were you in for?

754
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,188
Excuse me?

755
00:59:58,255 --> 00:59:59,422
Jail.

756
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,025
I was there
'cause I killed three people.

757
01:00:02,093 --> 01:00:05,295
But I didn't really.
I guess they figured it out.

758
01:00:05,363 --> 01:00:06,896
What about you?

759
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:10,100
I wasn't in jail.

760
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:13,770
Well, then what were you doing
sitting outside a prison?

761
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:15,638
In a cab?

762
01:00:15,706 --> 01:00:18,842
I was waitin' for you,
Hugo.

763
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:21,444
Oh.

764
01:00:21,512 --> 01:00:23,380
Then you must be dead.

765
01:00:23,447 --> 01:00:25,048
I'm definitely not dead.

766
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:29,586
Well, what do you want
from me?

767
01:00:29,653 --> 01:00:33,056
I wanna know why you won't
go back to the island.

768
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:41,364
'Cause I'm cursed.

769
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:43,433
Is that so?

770
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:45,435
Uh-huh.

771
01:00:45,503 --> 01:00:49,039
That's why the plane crashed,
my friends died--

772
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:51,207
Libby, Charlie.

773
01:00:51,275 --> 01:00:53,343
Now they visit me,

774
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:55,311
and I can't make it stop.

775
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:58,915
Well,
what if you weren't cursed?

776
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:00,884
What if you were blessed?

777
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:03,553
How do you mean "blessed?"

778
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:07,157
Well, you get to talk
to people you've lost...

779
01:01:07,224 --> 01:01:09,626
seems like a pretty wonderful
thing to me.

780
01:01:09,693 --> 01:01:11,594
Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful,

781
01:01:11,662 --> 01:01:14,130
except for the part
where I'm <i>crazy.</i>

782
01:01:14,198 --> 01:01:16,166
I've got
some news for you, Hugo,

783
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:19,135
and you're just gonna have to
take my word on this.

784
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:22,238
You are <i>not</i> crazy.

785
01:01:26,377 --> 01:01:27,977
Who <i>are</i> you, dude?

786
01:01:28,045 --> 01:01:31,247
I'm just up here
on the corner.

787
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:35,351
Ajira Airways flight 316
out of L.A.X.

788
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:37,320
Leaves in 24 hours.

789
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:39,522
All you have to do
is get on that plane.

790
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,858
It's <i>your</i> choice, Hugo.

791
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:45,228
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

792
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:52,001
Wait!
You forgot your guitar.

793
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:55,004
It's not my guitar.

794
01:01:57,108 --> 01:01:59,042
Don't worry, dude.

795
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:03,079
Everything'll be fine
when Jack changes the future...

796
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:05,181
or the past.

797
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:06,850
One of those.

798
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:10,086
I don't think your bud's
gonna make it.

799
01:02:10,154 --> 01:02:11,788
He'll make it.

800
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:15,992
Dude, what happened
to your face?

801
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,760
Nothin'.

802
01:02:17,828 --> 01:02:20,230
We were just up on a ridge

803
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:23,266
where we could look down
into the Swan site.

804
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:25,268
something just happened down there.

805
01:02:25,336 --> 01:02:28,938
They hit something.
- It's time for me to go.

806
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:30,874
It's all set to go.

807
01:02:30,941 --> 01:02:33,243
Remember, be careful.

808
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,211
It's rigged to explode
on impact.

809
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:37,514
According to Faraday's plan,

810
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:39,983
you must get the bomb
as close as you can

811
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,951
to the source
of electromagnetism.

812
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:46,556
Sayid, this is gonna work.

813
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:48,458
And it'll save ya.

814
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:51,895
Nothing can save me.

815
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:43,880
See ya in Los Angeles.

816
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:18,248
Are you sure
you need to do this?

817
01:04:18,315 --> 01:04:21,417
If you waited, Jacob would
eventually come to you, John.

818
01:04:21,485 --> 01:04:25,021
I'm tired of waiting.
Where is he, Richard?

819
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:35,031
What happened
to the rest of the statue?

820
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,569
I don't know. It was like that
when I got here.

821
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:42,739
Do you expect me
to believe that?

822
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:47,644
Not really.

823
01:04:47,711 --> 01:04:49,279
All right, Ben, let's go.

824
01:05:00,658 --> 01:05:03,026
W-what are you doing?

825
01:05:04,662 --> 01:05:06,562
John wants me to join him.

826
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,865
You can't bring him in.
- Why not?

827
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:10,867
Because only our leader can
request an audience with Jacob,

828
01:05:10,934 --> 01:05:13,848
and there can only be one leader
on the island at a time, John.

829
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:14,804
I'm beginning to think

830
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:17,774
you just make these rules up
as you go along, Richard.

831
01:05:17,841 --> 01:05:20,743
Ben is coming in with me,
and if that's a problem,

832
01:05:20,811 --> 01:05:23,246
I'm sure Jacob and I
can work it out.

833
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:56,879
Tell him I said hello.

834
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:32,782
Will you be able
to do this, Ben?

835
01:06:34,585 --> 01:06:36,719
I know it won't be easy,

836
01:06:36,787 --> 01:06:39,856
but things will change...
once he's gone.

837
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:46,596
I promise.

838
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:18,009
Can I ask you something,
LaFleur?

839
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:21,546
There ain't no more LaFleur,
Enos. Go ahead, shoot.

840
01:07:21,613 --> 01:07:24,515
Has it occurred to any of you
that your buddy's

841
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,885
actually gonna <i>cause</i> the thing
he says he's trying to <i>prevent?</i>

842
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:34,292
Perhaps that little nuke
<i>is</i> the incident?

843
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,761
So maybe the best thing to do...

844
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:38,896
is nothing?

845
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:45,036
I'm glad you all
thought this through.

846
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:50,975
What's going on?

847
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:52,443
It's Phil.

848
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:55,013
That's the road to the Swan.

849
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,548
If they see Jack,
they're gonna kill him.

850
01:07:57,616 --> 01:08:00,284
What do you think, Blondie?

851
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:06,891
Live together, die alone.

852
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:22,707
Good for you. You got here fast.
- Any sign of 'em yet?

853
01:08:22,775 --> 01:08:24,975
No, not yet. You got time
to set up a perimeter.

854
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,411
You called these men to the site?

855
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,161
You, rear ridgeline.
You, top ridgeline.

856
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:30,214
We need to be getting
people <i>away</i> from here!

857
01:08:30,282 --> 01:08:32,850
You, top of the scaffolding.
Go now!

858
01:09:06,718 --> 01:09:08,219
There!

859
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:20,098
Get him!

860
01:09:22,267 --> 01:09:24,936
Flank him! Get him now!

861
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,310
Who's this?!

862
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:41,586
Uhh!

863
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:10,781
Aah!

864
01:10:10,849 --> 01:10:13,251
Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man!
- Okay, okay.

865
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:16,387
Tell 'em to put their guns down.
Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

866
01:10:19,224 --> 01:10:21,292
All right,
you can come out now, Doc!

867
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:31,702
Hurry up
and do your business.

868
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,808
Turn that damn thing off!

869
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,782
What's the matter?!

870
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,951
It won't shut down!

871
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:48,085
Why not?!

872
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:50,087
Something's
pulling the drill down.

873
01:10:50,155 --> 01:10:51,622
We hit the pocket!

874
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:04,969
Hurry up, Doc! What are you
waiting for?! Drop it!

875
01:11:58,056 --> 01:12:01,292
This don't look
like L.A.X.

876
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:33,024
Aah!
- Dad!

877
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:36,227
Aah!

878
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,298
Uhh!

879
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:41,699
Jack!

880
01:12:42,801 --> 01:12:44,735
Dad!

881
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:55,279
Get away from here! Get as far
away from here as you can!

882
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:58,015
Get in!

883
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,651
What the hell's going on?!
- Get out of here!

884
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:01,986
Come on!

885
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:08,259
Go! Go! Go!

886
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,368
Hey, LaFleur!

887
01:13:26,845 --> 01:13:29,480
Aah! Help!

888
01:13:29,548 --> 01:13:32,216
Help!
- Juliet!

889
01:13:34,686 --> 01:13:36,987
Ah, come on!

890
01:13:37,055 --> 01:13:39,457
Sawyer! Help!
- Juliet!

891
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:42,560
Sawyer!

892
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:44,562
aah!

893
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:45,629
Uhh!

894
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:47,531
Aah!

895
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,538
Where do you think
you're going, Blondie?

896
01:13:56,842 --> 01:14:01,078
Aah!
- Kate! Help me get those chains off!

897
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:06,751
Hold on! You hold on!

898
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,753
I can't.
I can't get it off.

899
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,189
I got you.
I can't...

900
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,460
Aah! Juliet!
- No!

901
01:14:18,463 --> 01:14:21,332
I can't reach her.
- You hold on!

902
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,801
Aah!
- No!

903
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:28,873
I got you.

904
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,775
Sawyer!

905
01:14:35,447 --> 01:14:37,415
Don't you leave me.

906
01:14:37,482 --> 01:14:39,316
It's okay.

907
01:14:39,384 --> 01:14:41,685
<i>Don't</i> you leave me!

908
01:14:41,753 --> 01:14:44,088
I love you.
- No, you don't let go!

909
01:14:44,156 --> 01:14:46,056
I love you, James.
- Don't let go.

910
01:14:46,124 --> 01:14:48,392
I love you so much.
- No!

911
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,628
No, don't let go!
- Aah!

912
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:51,896
Juliet!

913
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:54,064
<i>No!</i>

914
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:17,221
Water?

915
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:19,323
Do you have any alcohol?

916
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:23,160
No. Sure wish I did.

917
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,305
Don't shoot.

918
01:15:34,372 --> 01:15:36,040
It's okay.

919
01:15:36,108 --> 01:15:39,376
It's all right.

920
01:15:46,551 --> 01:15:48,519
Which one of you
is Ricardus?

921
01:15:57,162 --> 01:16:00,464
It's Richard, actually.

922
01:16:00,532 --> 01:16:03,467
What lies in the shadow
of the statue?

923
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,709
<i>Ille qui nos omnes servabit.</i>

924
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:17,281
Richard...

925
01:16:17,349 --> 01:16:20,317
I'm Ilana.

926
01:16:20,385 --> 01:16:22,853
I have something
you need to see.

927
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:25,189
Open it up.

928
01:16:25,257 --> 01:16:27,958
It--it's okay. It's okay.
Let them.

929
01:16:58,857 --> 01:17:00,758
Where did you find him?

930
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:05,563
In the cargo hold
of the plane we came here on...

931
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,932
in a coffin.

932
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:14,939
I don't understand.

933
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,942
If this is Locke...

934
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,643
<i>Who's</i> in there?

935
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,404
You like it?

936
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,576
I did it myself.

937
01:18:29,147 --> 01:18:32,116
It takes a very long time
when you're making the thread,

938
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:33,550
but, uh...

939
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:36,921
I suppose that's the point,
isn't it?

940
01:18:38,456 --> 01:18:40,090
Hello, Jacob.

941
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,196
Well,
you found your loophole.

942
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,400
Indeed I did.

943
01:18:55,073 --> 01:18:57,341
And you have <i>no idea</i>

944
01:18:57,409 --> 01:19:00,010
what I've gone through

945
01:19:00,078 --> 01:19:01,946
to be here.

946
01:19:04,015 --> 01:19:07,518
Have you met before?

947
01:19:07,585 --> 01:19:09,753
In a manner of speaking.

948
01:19:13,992 --> 01:19:17,528
Do what
I asked you to, Ben.

949
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:24,201
Benjamin...

950
01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:25,869
whatever he's told you,

951
01:19:25,937 --> 01:19:28,906
I want you to understand
one thing.

952
01:19:31,009 --> 01:19:33,477
You have a choice.

953
01:19:37,449 --> 01:19:39,383
What "choice"?

954
01:19:39,451 --> 01:19:42,386
You can do what he asked,

955
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:45,189
or you can go,

956
01:19:45,256 --> 01:19:48,025
leave us to discuss our...

957
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:51,195
issues.

958
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:59,737
Oh... so now,
after all this time,

959
01:19:59,804 --> 01:20:02,773
you've decided
to stop ignoring me.

960
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:09,113
35 years I lived
on this island,

961
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,249
and all I ever heard
was your name

962
01:20:12,317 --> 01:20:14,651
over and over.

963
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,054
Richard would bring me
your instructions--

964
01:20:17,122 --> 01:20:19,189
all those slips of paper,

965
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:22,926
all those lists--

966
01:20:22,994 --> 01:20:26,030
and I never questioned
anything.

967
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:29,400
I did as I was told.

968
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:36,040
But when I dared
to ask to see you myself,

969
01:20:36,107 --> 01:20:40,010
I was told,
"you have to wait.

970
01:20:40,078 --> 01:20:42,546
You have to be patient."

971
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:48,552
But when <i>he</i> asked
to see you?

972
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:54,324
He gets marched straight up here
as if he was Moses.

973
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:01,799
So... why him?

974
01:21:03,868 --> 01:21:05,836
Hmm?

975
01:21:08,873 --> 01:21:12,309
What was it that was
so wrong with me?

976
01:21:17,515 --> 01:21:20,184
What about me?!

977
01:21:22,754 --> 01:21:26,290
What <i>about</i> you?

978
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:34,665
Oh.

979
01:21:34,732 --> 01:21:36,500
Well...

980
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,278
They're coming.

981
01:21:48,346 --> 01:21:50,280
What?

982
01:21:52,484 --> 01:21:54,051
I can't hear you.

983
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:55,986
They're coming.

984
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:19,409
Juliet!

985
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:23,814
Sawyer, get off of there!

986
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:26,183
We have to go right now. We need to go!

987
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:28,919
Get off.

988
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:32,990
It's going down! This thing is
gonna go! You have to let it go.

989
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:35,124
You have to go. This thing is
going to blow at any second.

990
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:35,592
No!

991
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,661
Jack!
Jack, help me get him off.

992
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:56,673
Come on!

993
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:58,976
Come on!

994
01:23:59,043 --> 01:24:01,311
No! Come on!

995
01:24:01,379 --> 01:24:02,913
Come on!

996
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:05,716
Come on, you son of a bitch!

997
