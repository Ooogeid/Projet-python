00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:01,560
<i>Previously, on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:03,159
You brought me here to operate on you.

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,355
You think, I trust you,
that I am gonna just...

4
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:08,244
do the surgery and hope
that you let me go?

5
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,255
You have to do it.

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,606
- How did they get you to ask me?
- Please--

7
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,126
- What did they offer you?
- Nothing.

8
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:17,912
- Then what are you doing here?
- They're gonna kill Sawyer...

9
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,966
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

10
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,400
we'll get it out,
and they'll keep you alive.

11
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,182
I'm ready.

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,244
Sawyer, please!

13
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,038
You get your hands off of him!

14
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,963
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,834
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,737
Now get in here,
and bring that walkie-talkie.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,936
3x07 - Not In Portland

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,157
I fell asleep.

19
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:26,625
With candles burning-- that's real safe.

20
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,956
We don't have to keep doing this,
you know.

21
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,423
Are you saying that
because you don't think it's gonna work

22
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,324
or because you're afraid he'll find out?

23
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:46,849
Lift up your shirt.

24
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,700
Some doctor you are.

25
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,366
I'm not doing this as your doctor.

26
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:12,820
I'm doing it as your sister.

27
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,842
I don't like you being here alone.

28
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,279
Come stay with me.

29
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,603
I like living on the beach.

30
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,972
This is Miami, Rachel.

31
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,446
Everything's on the beach.

32
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,888
You have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

33
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,737
Take the walkie, take Sawyer and go.

34
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,134
<i>Wait. Where are you?<I/>

35
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,896
Kate, listen to me. Just listen to me.

36
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,836
You remember
what I told you on the beach?

37
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,782
Do you rember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

38
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,156
Do you rember it?!

39
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,682
Yes, yes, I remember!

40
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:56,258
When you get safe, you radio me
and you tell me that story.

41
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,425
<i>Jack, please--</i>

42
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:59,424
If I don't get a call from you
in the next hour,

43
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,484
I'm gonna know something went wrong,
and he dies!

44
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,163
<i>I can't leave without you.</i>

45
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,192
Yes, you are. Go.

46
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,362
- Jack, I can't!
- Go, now.

47
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:07,462
I can't!

48
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,497
Kate, damn it, run!

49
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,349
Juliet, stop the bleeding
and stitch him up.

50
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,674
She's not a surgeon.

51
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:19,732
She can't fix this.

52
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,145
He's right.

53
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,981
Let's go.

54
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,281
<i>Warning.</i>

55
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:38,282
Sawyer, let's go!

56
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,529
Then what the hell do you suggest we do?

57
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,594
Go get Danny,

58
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,465
then find Austen and Ford
and bring them back.

59
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:06,108
- No, you do that, and Ben dies.
- Go.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,758
You think I'm lying?
Do you think this is a bluff?

61
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,555
- I will let him die!
- No, Jack, you won't.

62
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,135
Go. Get them back.

63
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,678
If you have to...

64
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,791
kill them.

<i>- Dr. Burke?</i>
- Yes.

67
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,278
<i>This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience.</i>

68
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,355
<i>I'm calling to confirm
your appointment tomorrow.</i>

69
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:05,638
Uh, 2:00, right?

70
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,318
<i>2:00. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you</i>

71
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,435
<i>that he's very much looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

72
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,990
Me, too. Thank you.

73
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,163
<i>Good-Bye.</i>

74
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:04,984
Stay here.

75
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:11,194
Hello, Juliet.

76
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,798
Why exactly are you here?

77
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:23,747
Oh, I, m...

78
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:24,969
today's lab work...

79
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:28,147
I got home, and I realized
that inverted some numbers.

80
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,577
And it couldn't wait till the morning?

81
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,915
Um... Edmund?

82
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,384
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:37,637
How rude of me.

84
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,269
Uh, Juliet, this is Sherry.

85
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:40,902
Sherry, this is Juliet,

86
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,694
My ex-wife.

87
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,553
Juliet's leaving.

88
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:51,501
I am.

89
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,187
Could you please turn off the lights?

90
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:13,992
You haven't thought this through, Jack.

91
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,455
Your plan's not gonna work.

92
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,888
Yeah? Why is that?

93
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,095
Your friends aren't going
to make it back to your side

94
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,272
of the island
because we're not on that island.

95
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:25,477
We're on a smaller island
2 miles offshore.

96
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:29,021
'Fraid so.

97
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,857
So why don't we see if we can come up

98
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,976
with some kind of peaceful resolution?

99
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,408
A peaceful resolution?

100
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,467
That's right.

101
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,542
Is that what you call
asking me to kill Ben

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,025
while on the operang table--

103
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,254
- Make it look like an accident?
- That's ridiculous.

104
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,828
- She wants Ben to die.
- He's lying.

105
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,200
She said if I did it,
that she would protect me--

106
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,453
Enough!

107
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,300
Get out.

108
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,236
Tom, he's lying.

109
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:04,842
You said you can't stitch him up...

110
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,879
then you don't need to be in here.

111
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,230
Go, Julie.

112
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,150
Don't let him fool you.

113
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,892
He'll never let a patient just die.

114
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,396
Can anybody hear me?!

115
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:33,709
What happened?

116
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:34,962
Open the cage.

117
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,936
- Where is--
- Just open the damn cage!

118
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:57,859
That's our island?

119
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,009
What, you didn't believe me
when I told you before?

120
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,063
We need a boat.

121
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,470
Yeah, a couple of towels
and a buffet lunch.

122
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:04,606
We'll follow the beach.

123
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,386
There's gotta be one
around here somewhere.

124
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,888
How else do they get back and forth?

125
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,569
Why don't we just stop
and ask for directions?

126
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:15,488
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

127
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,183
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.</i>
- Are you okay?

128
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,832
<i>- I'm fine.</i>
- Tell him I said "hi"?

129
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,852
- Get to the point!
- We need a boat.

130
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,601
We need some way
to get off of this island.

131
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,452
You heard her.

132
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,203
How do they get off this island?!

133
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,242
What's he doing?

134
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:45,861
Come on!

135
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,562
This way!

136
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,514
Jason, you all right?

137
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:38,823
Over there! There!

138
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:50,668
Come on! Get inside, get inside! Go!

139
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:56,807
Come on!

140
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,592
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

141
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:07,978
What?

142
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Where'd they go?

143
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:12,183
That way.

144
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,133
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

145
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:27,857
Is it true?

146
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,507
Is what true?

147
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
What you said--

148
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:34,139
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

149
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,582
Yeah...

150
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,430
and in about 40 minutes,
she's gonna get her wish.

151
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:50,378
That's... not... helping...

152
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,554
anything.

153
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Now...

154
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,752
could somebody please get Juliet?

155
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,262
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

156
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:17,409
Do you work here?

157
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,075
I'm the new research assistant.

158
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,417
Of course you are.

159
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:40,742
I want in.

160
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:43,843
In on what?

161
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:45,446
I know what you're doing, Juliet.

162
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,606
I'm not really sure what--

163
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:50,854
I read your notes.

164
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,765
I know what you took from the lab.

165
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,427
The only thing I don't know is...

166
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,622
who's your guinea pig?

167
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,597
Ed, I've...

168
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:07,468
I've been doing my research
in my own lab, on my own time.

169
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,237
- I don't really see--
- It's your sister, isn't it?

170
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,798
Look, Jules,
there's two ways this plays out--

171
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:22,382
One is, your research is
potentially genius.

172
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,262
And the other,

173
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:29,733
you're raising
some very serious ethical questions,

174
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,703
maybe even criminal concerns...

175
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,936
but if you collaborate with me,

176
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,646
based on my reputation,

177
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,886
all this is viewed
as cutting edge science.

178
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:51,006
And we will win prizes
and drink Champagne

179
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,607
and do a lot of good for people.

180
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,185
Why don't I give you some time
to think about it?

181
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,184
Ben's awake.

182
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,439
How?

183
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:36,402
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,
not an anesthesiologist.

184
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:40,409
Ben's asking for you.

185
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:53,646
This a hobby of yours, underdog,
digging holes?

186
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,421
Yep, that and basket weaving.

187
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,588
Want one?

188
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,101
Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?

189
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,565
No, but I've got a boat.

190
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,629
Can we use it?

191
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,572
Yeah, but we've got to hurry.

192
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,005
Hold on a second, sister.

193
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:12,173
You just happen to find us in the woods,
you just happen to have a boat,

194
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:13,897
and you're gonna let us use it, huh?

195
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,120
There's something we need to do first.

196
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:18,233
Oh, gee...

197
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,043
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

198
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,486
If you help me rescue him,
I promise you,

199
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,316
I'll get you back to the other island.

200
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:28,694
Your boyfriend--
his name happen to be Karl?

201
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:32,842
Yeah.

202
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,808
Ah, come on.

203
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,620
I stopped the surgery.

204
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,910
I know.

205
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,502
I've been able to hear you
for a few minutes now.

206
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,861
It's very clever of you.

207
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:53,197
I should have seen it coming.

208
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:56,883
Are you in pain?

209
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,484
- I can...
- No.

210
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,479
But thanks all the same.

211
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:18,713
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,
please, Jack.

212
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:20,490
No, I'm sorry.

213
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:26,279
Please, I'm asking you...
one gentleman to another.

214
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:30,243
It won't hurt you to give me 3 minutes,

215
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:31,651
will it...

216
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,848
Knowing I have only 27 left?

217
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,053
If you touch him,

218
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,421
- if you try to--
- I won't.

219
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,484
You've got three minutes.

220
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm Tom, by the way.

221
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,699
They've got history.

222
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,778
I would like for you to go back
in there,

223
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,951
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

224
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,521
And why would I want to do that?

225
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,957
Because I'm going to go help
your friends escape.

226
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:31,224
Thank you for taking the time
to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

227
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,056
Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon.

228
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:35,659
We're just outside of Portland.

229
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:41,589
These shots might seem a little,
uh, cheeseball,

230
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,727
but our people really are this happy.

231
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:46,528
Now why? Because we're privately funded.

232
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,711
Privately funded means freedom.

233
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:55,327
We organize trips every week
in and around the Portland area,

234
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,521
which is just awesome for hiking
and biking and river running.

235
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,157
Look, when you--

236
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,350
your company reached out to me,
I was flattered,

237
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,651
but I don't really know
why you would want me to--

238
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:13,107
Is it true that you successfully
impregnated a male field mouse?

239
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,396
It didn't carry to term.

240
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,185
Mind if I ask you something?

241
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:21,324
Sure.

242
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:26,428
What do you see?

243
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,335
It's a human womb, obviously.

244
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,058
Judging from the decomposition
of the endometrium,

245
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:37,672
I would say
that the woman was somewhere in her 70s.

246
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,335
No, actually, she's 26.

247
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,973
What happened to her?

248
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,648
What if I told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

249
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:49,928
We think you're special, Dr. Burke,

250
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,833
and we want you to lead a team

251
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,030
of highly trained people
because we think you're just that good.

252
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:57,302
I can't.

253
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,708
Why can't you?

254
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,700
My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I--

255
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,631
He wouldn't want you to have
this opportunity?

256
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:07,385
He doesn't want me to have anything.
He would never give the okay.

257
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:08,708
Maybe we could reach out to him

258
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,285
- on your behalf--
- Don't bother.

259
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,359
There must be something
that he would respond to.

260
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:15,277
If he were hit by a bus--
How about that? That would work.

261
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:20,870
That was totally inappropriate.

262
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,743
- No, no--
- No, I, uh...

263
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,355
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

264
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:29,864
- Dr. Burke, please, you--
- No, I'm sorry.

265
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:33,363
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

266
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:36,794
I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert.

267
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:38,864
I'm a mess.

268
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,302
Well, hell.

269
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,466
Karl's gotta be in there.

270
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,669
What, you mean you ain't sure?

271
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,400
It's the only place I haven't looked.

272
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:43,978
You know the guard?

273
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,706
Yeah. His name's Aldo.

274
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:51,304
Okay, Lollipop,

275
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:54,766
you wanna tell me how we're gonna
get by him with one gun and no bullets?

276
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:55,903
I've got an idea.

277
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,500
Of course you do.

278
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:01,755
Open the door!

279
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,191
Alex? What the hell are you doing?

280
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,292
They must've gotten out of their cages.
I caught them in the jungle.

281
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,402
Now open up, Aldo!

282
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:11,080
Just stop!
You're not supposed to be here.

283
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:12,929
If your dad finds out,
he's gonna kill me.

284
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:15,857
My dad was the one who told me
to bring them here, to you.

285
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,796
Look, maybe you should call him.

286
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:20,868
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

287
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:30,035
Danny, I need Ben.

288
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,210
Why?!

289
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:34,261
Listen, I got Alex here.

290
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,032
She's got Austen and Ford with her--

291
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:40,320
Damn it, whatever she says,
don't believe it.

292
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:42,568
You hold 'em right there. I'm on my--

293
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,694
Don't get mad at me
just 'cause you were dumb enough

294
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:47,826
to fall for the old
"wookiee prisoner" gag.

295
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,137
Where's Karl?

296
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:51,232
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

297
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,640
Shoot him in the knee.

298
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,986
- What?
- Give me the rifle.

299
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,776
We don't have time for this. I'll do it.

300
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,779
Okay, all right!
He's at the end of the hall, room 23.

301
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:03,286
Keys are in my back pocket.

302
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,911
Damn good con, Freckles.

303
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,876
I almost believed
you were gonna shoot that boy.

304
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:13,935
It wasn't a con.

305
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,073
Here it is!

306
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:21,350
Sawyer!

307
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:22,844
Help!

308
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:25,145
Help!

309
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,385
- Is he okay?
- We got your boyfriend back.

310
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:52,560
Now where's your damn boat?

311
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,265
Idiot!

312
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:01,083
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

313
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:03,045
- Alex was with them.
- Danny!

314
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:06,805
We're letting them go.

315
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:09,109
- Letting them go?
- Ben gave the order.

316
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,209
- Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
- He woke up.

317
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:13,674
- Oh, he woke up, huh?
- Shephard won't finish the surgery

318
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,716
unless he knows his friends
are off the island.

319
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,254
Do you want Ben to die?

320
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:20,896
I know Ben would rather die
than let them go.

321
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:39,530
How was the interview?

322
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:42,516
It's not for me.

323
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,764
- What?
- It's fine.

324
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:47,818
They're too far away, anyway.
It's Portland.

325
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:49,648
Jules, you didn't say no
because of me?

326
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,160
Well, why would I wanna go
all the way to Portland

327
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,105
for research that doesn't even work?

328
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:57,702
Because it does work.

329
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,073
I'm pregnant.

330
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,636
I'm pre-- I'm pregnant.

331
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,609
What?

332
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,380
Look, look. I took a blood test, too.

333
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,909
I didn't want to tell you
until I was sure.

334
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,081
- It worked.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:36,401
All my life, all I've ever wanted
was to have a baby,

336
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,126
and now, because of you, I'm gonna...

337
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,867
God, now I just need to get healthy.

338
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:49,694
Now I just need--
I just need to get healthy

339
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,084
so I can see the little bugger
get into an ivy league school, you know?

340
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,261
You will. Of course you will.

341
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:59,296
Hey, now you can tell
that bastard ex-husband of yours

342
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:01,059
what he can do with his ethics.

343
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:08,271
Because you're insufferable,
and you're mean.

344
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,988
Well, you asked me for the truth, mom,
and that's--

345
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,370
Let me call you later, okay?

346
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,183
Hello, Jules. What's up?

347
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:21,694
She's pregnant.

348
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:23,855
Excuse me?

349
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:26,005
It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

350
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,804
Julie, that's...

351
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,741
I need, uh, I need to see your labs.

352
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,757
We'll have to verify the data before--

353
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:39,823
No.

354
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,786
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

355
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,038
It's my sister.

356
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,957
Fine, then if you're not interested,
why are you concerned if--

357
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,071
You okay?

358
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Yeah.

359
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:14,268
I just don't like blood too much.

360
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,529
Well...

361
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:19,701
then you probably
won't wanna be looking at that.

362
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:26,560
So, uh,
if you really can get off the island,

363
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:28,583
why didn't you
just take him to a facility?

364
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:30,048
Why all this?

365
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,906
Because ever since
the sky turned purple, we--

366
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,606
What the hell happened?!

367
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:39,094
I just nicked an artery.

368
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:41,116
Isn't that what you already did?!

369
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,778
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

370
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,317
Can you fix it?

371
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,589
Damn it.

372
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:56,170
- You got him?
- I got him.

373
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:00,251
Nice ride!

374
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:02,295
- Help me.
- We gotta go now, okay?

375
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,151
Can you stand?

376
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:06,009
All right, come on.

377
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:12,153
So... you're the boss' daughter, huh?

378
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,889
Never saw that coming.

379
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:17,190
Let's go, Cheech.

380
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,111
We're goin' for a little ride.

381
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:22,609
- Careful.
- All right, easy.

382
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,710
I'm gonna put you in the boat,
all right?

383
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:27,886
Wait, wait.

384
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:32,591
- You're gonna be okay.
- Danny...

385
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:33,737
No, Sawyer.

386
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,050
Danny!

387
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,434
- What happened? Is he--
- I can't see.

388
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:10,707
- What?
- I can't see.

389
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,776
There's too much blood.

390
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:13,070
All right, get over here.

391
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:16,227
Tom, he's gonna die
if you don't get over here right now.

392
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Go.

393
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:24,827
Get outta here.

394
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:27,931
You heard the lady.

395
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:31,743
Let's go.

396
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,038
Not you, Alex.

397
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,871
- You're staying.
- Why?

398
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,108
We both know your father,

399
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,545
and the only way he'll let Karl live
is if you're here when he wakes up.

400
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:47,141
I'm sorry, Alex.

401
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:57,324
Hey, Alex.

402
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,662
I missed you.

403
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:03,735
I know.

404
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,142
I missed you, too.

405
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,751
You have to go away now,

406
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,447
but I'll see you real soon, okay?

407
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:14,797
I love you.

408
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,660
I have to go to sleep now.

409
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,234
Wait.

410
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,402
Easy. Okay, easy.

411
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:47,378
- Wait, wait--
- Hold it steady, damn it.

412
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,446
Hold it steady.

413
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,212
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

414
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:00,110
All right, hold that up to me.

415
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:03,241
- The walkie-- Hold it up to me.
- What about the surgery--

416
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:04,377
Just do it!

417
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,491
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?

418
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,967
Yeah, I... we've got a boat.

419
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,227
They're letting us go.

420
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:19,642
Who's letting you go?

421
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:22,449
The blonde woman.

422
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,663
So you're safe, you and Sawyer?

423
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:25,833
Yes, yeah.

424
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,755
Tell me.

425
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:29,658
Tell you?

426
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,016
The first day on the beach,
the day of the crash--

427
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,539
The story that I told you--
If you're safe, tell me.

428
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:37,371
- You think this is the best time--
- Shut up!

429
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:44,110
You... were doing surgery on a girl...

430
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:47,837
and you messed up.

431
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,599
You made a mistake.

432
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:53,969
<i>You tore something on her back,</i>

433
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,290
<i>and all the nerves came loose...</i>

434
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,158
and you said you were so afraid...

435
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,916
and you said the fear was so...

436
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:13,079
real, and you didn't know what to do...

437
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,671
so you counted to five...

438
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,622
<i>and then you weren't afraid anymore...</i>

439
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,169
<i>and then it was just gone...</i>

440
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:34,868
and you fixed her.

441
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,621
<i>You saved her.</i>

442
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:59,190
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

443
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,791
Promise me that
you'll never come back here for me.

444
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:07,320
Don't come back, Kate.

445
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,786
Jack, where are you--

446
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:09,863
Turn it off.

447
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:12,817
<i>Jack? Jack, please, where are--</i>

448
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,148
Trades are comin' up.

449
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:30,718
We gotta go.

450
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,223
- Let's go.
- Okay.

451
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,541
We have some paperwork
that we need you to sign,

452
00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:31,221
but take your time. There's no rush.

453
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:32,666
Thank you.

454
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:37,791
Were you able to remove the tumor?

455
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:42,566
Yeah.

456
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,624
You'll want to do a biopsy,
see if it's malignant.

457
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:58,362
So what now, I just go back to my cell?

458
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:01,885
Until they figure out
what to do with you.

459
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,751
"They"...

460
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:14,595
What did he say?

461
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:16,844
I'm sorry?

462
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:21,342
Ben-- What did he say
that made you want to save his life?

463
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:28,134
It doesn't really matter what he said.

464
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,686
It matters to me.

465
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:34,938
After everything
that I have been put through,

466
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:37,952
you owe me an answer.

467
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,102
And I wanna know what he said.

468
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:02,125
Tissue?

469
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:05,402
Thank you. Thanks.

470
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:17,462
Have we met?

471
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,059
Hello, Dr. Burke.

472
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:26,029
- Mr. Alpert?
- I'm, so sorry for your loss.

473
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,778
What are you doing here?

474
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,296
I saw what happened on the news,

475
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:34,620
end, uh, your office said
you were down here.

476
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:37,413
I just wanted to express my condolences
in person

477
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:39,590
before I went back up to Portland.

478
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,718
This is Ethan.
He's one of my colleagues.

479
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,232
It's a pleasure to meet you.

480
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:51,826
He was hit by a bus.

481
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:54,896
I know. They say
you were there when it happened.

482
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:58,734
- It must have been--
- No, no, in our interview,

483
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,831
I said-- I said that I wanted--

484
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:03,738
I wanted him to get hit by a bus.

485
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:10,140
Dr. Burke, I realize
you're a little shook up right now,

486
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:12,115
but this is just a tragic accident.

487
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,618
You can'blame yourself.

488
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,838
I don't even rember you saying that.

489
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,788
Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?

490
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:25,792
Look, uh...

491
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,402
I know the timing is horrible,

492
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:31,202
but we came because we're that serious

493
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,168
about getting you to come work with us.

494
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,451
Just give us six months.

495
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:40,846
If you need to, you'll be back
before your sister gives birth.

496
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:45,938
- How did you know that my--
- Well, we're very...

497
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:47,767
thorough in our recruitment process.

498
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,310
Can my sister come?

499
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:01,712
Won't work. We're pretty remote.

500
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:04,527
She wouldn't have access
to the treatment that she needs.

501
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,221
But it's Portland.

502
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:08,542
- There's plenty of clinics and--
- Well, actually,

503
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,532
we're not quite in Portland.

504
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,320
I wanna know what he said.

505
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,793
I've been on this island
for three years, Jack--

506
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:37,271
3 years, 2 months and 28 days.

507
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:42,822
He said that if I...

508
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,125
let him live...

509
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:49,689
and I helped you...

510
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:58,483
that he would finally let me go home.
