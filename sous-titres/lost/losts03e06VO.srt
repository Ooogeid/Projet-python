00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,902
<I>Previously on</I> Lost...

2
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:05,002
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

3
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:07,186
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

4
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:09,784
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

5
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:12,439
My wonderful plan got shot to sunshine

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,350
when you saw my damned x-rays
and figured out I was dying.

7
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:17,616
You want me to save your life?

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,822
I want you to want to save my life.

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,303
All I can ask
is that you think about it.

10
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:15,414
Police. Open the door.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,323
Everything's all right in here.

12
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:21,756
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

13
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:23,729
someone extremely dangerous
is in the motel.

14
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,666
We're conducting a room-to-room search.

15
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,910
I'm alone, officer.

16
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,113
This person could be holding you
at gunpoint,

17
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,191
forcing you to say that.

18
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:31,542
Please open the door.

19
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,057
I don't think I should.

20
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:36,263
Ma'am, you have three seconds
before I break this door down.

21
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,565
One...

22
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:39,408
two...

23
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,337
Hey.

24
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:45,544
Wanna get it on?

25
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:49,168
Hell, yeah.

26
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,057
<i>Warning.</i>

27
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:01,896
<i>Warning.</i>

28
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,111
Hey.

29
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,546
Hey yourself.

30
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,519
Whatcha doing?

31
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:16,773
Throwing rocks.

32
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:23,805
- I thought you had to pull the lever.
- I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.

33
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,259
Then get me one.

34
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,547
What, you trying
to keep me feeling productive?

35
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:56,028
You took these blood tests,
made all the notations?

36
00:02:58,435 --> 00:02:59,768
How old are the x-rays?

37
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,177
A week.

38
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:06,280
The tumor on your spine
is borderline inoperable,

39
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:07,871
and at the rate it's growing,

40
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:09,884
that borderline goes away in about...

41
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,387
one week.

42
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,212
The O. R.
We were in-- is that fully equipped?

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,491
Yes.

44
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,699
Anesthesia? Sterile?

45
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:28,802
Yes.

46
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,733
You need to be in surgery yesterday.

47
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,689
All right, then.

48
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,357
Whatever you need,
it's yours. I'm ready.

49
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:50,306
No, I think you misunderstood me.

50
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,280
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

51
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:56,644
I just wanted you
to understand how you're gonna die.

52
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,836
You think I believe you people?

53
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,363
You think I trust you,

54
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:06,323
that I'm gonna just do the surgery

55
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,178
and hope that you let me go?

56
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,013
Don't!

57
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:24,350
Well, Jack,

58
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,277
I'm very disappointed in your decision.

59
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,722
Well, Ben,

60
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,826
at least you won't have
to be disappointed for very long.

3x06 - I Do

64
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,413
You shouldn't have come here.

65
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,188
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:09,947
I've made a huge mistake.

67
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,952
I am just full of regret right now.

68
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,337
Seriously.

69
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,183
it's bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

70
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:21,761
It's bad luck to see the bride
in her dress before the wedding.

71
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,964
You, my friend, are naked.

72
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,527
Have you tried it on?

73
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,476
I have to hold my breath

74
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:33,786
to get the claspy things to clasp,

75
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,600
so I'm waiting
till the absolute last minute.

76
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:40,186
It's in about 12 hours.
You might wanna get clasping.

77
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,846
I know it's...

78
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,263
It's been fast,

79
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,548
but... this is right.

80
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,406
I know it's real...

81
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:09,551
and I love you, Monica.

82
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,782
I love you too, Kevin.

83
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:31,154
Come on. Time for work.

84
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:38,207
- What about him?
- He's got the day off.

85
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,852
Well, if he's not working, neither am I.

86
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,190
- Oh, you're not?
- Just go, Freckles.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,797
Man wants to give me a day off,

88
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,549
let him give me a day off.

89
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,460
No, Sawyer. We're a team.

90
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,934
You break the rocks, I haul 'em.

91
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,283
All right.

92
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:57,824
Fine.

93
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:11,623
Lord knows I wouldn't want
to break up the team.

94
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,802
What happened to him?

95
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,303
Must have been an animal,

96
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,777
maybe one of the bears.

97
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,558
Are we gonna carry him back?

98
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,652
We're gonna bury him here.

99
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,228
Are we?

100
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,602
The people back at camp...

101
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,608
there's just been
a few too many funerals lately.

102
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:57,911
Nobody needs to see him like this.

103
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,107
I'll slip back to the beach
and get a couple shovels.

104
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,129
I'll come with you.

105
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:04,305
- No, I'll be back in an hour...
- it's not safe to go alone, John.

106
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:10,515
I appreciate your concern.

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,683
So what killed Eko?

108
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,749
Folks back at the beach
call it the "monster."

109
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,559
I don't really have a name for it.

110
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,563
You don't believe in monsters.

111
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,502
I believe in what I can see.

112
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,942
But obviously, you have.

113
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,580
So why don't you tell me
what you think it is?

114
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,104
It might be what brought us here.

115
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:49,470
So you believe that this monster
decided that Eko was meant to die?

116
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,402
I believe Eko died for a reason.

117
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,163
I just don't know what it is yet.

118
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,395
Is that why you lied?

119
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,527
We're not headed back towards the camp,
are we, John?

120
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,169
Sure, we are.

121
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:06,675
Just need to take a little detour first.

122
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,065
<i>Compound breach.</i>

123
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,896
<i>Compound breach.</i>

124
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:21,953
Where is she?

125
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,561
Someone's on the grid.
I want him on the ground, her too.

126
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,002
If he moves, you shoot him.

127
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:29,772
- Yeah, they're here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

128
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,521
Did the doctor get out again?

129
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:32,907
You sure?

130
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,645
Well, does he know?

131
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,151
How the hell did she get over here?!

132
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,277
Get up! Come on! Get up! Go!

133
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,897
Alex!

134
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,550
What the hell do you think you're doing?

135
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:47,759
What, you gonna shoot me?

136
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:50,380
You know you're not supposed to be here,
so let's just calm...

137
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,071
what did you do to him, Danny?!

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,221
Where is he?

139
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,297
I want to talk to Ben.

140
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:56,448
Sure.

141
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,697
That sounds like a great idea.

142
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,866
So why don't we just
lower our little sling--

143
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,181
where is he? Tell me!

144
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,412
Don't-- no! Get off of me!

145
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,974
- Get her out of here.
- What do I do with her?

146
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,462
- Get her outta here!
- Put me down!

147
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,941
Listen, whatever they say,
don't believe them.

148
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,139
They're gonna kill your boyfriend

149
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,184
just like they killed mine.

150
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,615
I don't understand.

151
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,257
- It's supposed to be two weeks.
- Our schedule's been moved up.

152
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,027
- Is that an order?
- It's coming from him.

153
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,759
- That's stupid.
- It's not my call.

154
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,288
That's the way it is, Danny.

155
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,151
All right.

156
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,311
I would like for you to put this on
and come with me, please.

157
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,868
You think I'm gonna put a hood
over my head 'cause you said "please"?

158
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,045
No, I think you're going
to put a hood over your head

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,865
because the man standing behind me,

160
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,132
the one
who's burning a hole in my back--

161
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,940
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

162
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,342
But if you put this on
and you come with me,

163
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,586
there's something you can do for us
that will save his life.

164
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,031
Come in.

165
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,065
Oh, sweetheart.

166
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,990
You're beautiful.

167
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,685
Absolutely beautiful.

168
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,325
How is it out there?

169
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,366
There are a lot of excited policemen.

170
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,400
Don't worry. I have asked them

171
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,313
not to shoot their guns in the air
when you say "I do."

172
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,659
You know, mothers-in-law
aren't supposed to be so nice.

173
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,898
Monica...

174
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,917
I have something for you.

175
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,124
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

176
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,557
My mother gave that to me
on my wedding day.

177
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,149
She told me someday
I'd give it to my daughter,

178
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:46,061
but since I had four boys...

179
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:49,816
here.

180
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,278
It's perfect.

181
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,748
You know,
Kevin's been coming to the church here

182
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:14,427
since he was about yea high.

183
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,269
When I first met you, Monica,

184
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,137
I was struck by your honesty

185
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,640
and devotion to Kevin.

186
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:24,144
And when I asked him
what he loved most about you,

187
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,209
he said,

188
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,428
"because what you see is what you get."

189
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:29,634
That being said,

190
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,524
we've got the rings,

191
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,743
you've vowed your vows,

192
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,021
and I now pronounce you

193
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,691
husband and wife.

194
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:23,834
Watch the Step.

195
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,425
I'll give you two some privacy.

196
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:15,757
You okay?

197
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah. You?

198
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,975
Yeah, I'm...

199
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,053
I'm great.

200
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,751
Where are they keeping you?

201
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,865
Outside, in a cage.

202
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,930
Sawyer?

203
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,764
He's in a cage, too.

204
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:41,826
They're making us work.

205
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:44,592
Work? On what?

206
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,527
I don't know what it is,

207
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:47,819
but it's big.

208
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:53,640
We're hauling rocks and--

209
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,148
Did they hurt you?

210
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,950
Hey, it's gonna...
it's gonna be all right.

211
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:10,840
It's gonna--

212
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,155
Jack, you have to do it.

213
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,623
- What?
- This thing that they told you to do...

214
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,803
this operation.

215
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:24,577
She said that if you do it,

216
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:26,710
- then that they would...
- What did they do to you?

217
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,497
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

218
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:29,847
How did they get you to ask me?

219
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,407
What did they offer you?

220
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,167
- Nothing.
- Then what are you doing here?

221
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,007
They're gonna kill Sawyer!

222
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:41,829
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:48,221
I'm so sorry,
but she said that if you do it,

224
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,444
and if you do it soon,
they'll let us go.

225
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,921
And you believe them?

226
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,290
I have to.

227
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,244
Please.

228
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,109
We're done here.

229
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,663
<i>We're done in here!</i>

230
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,714
<i>Jack, I'm sorry.</i>

231
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,095
<i>You have to do this.</i>

232
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:25,551
<i>They said that they couldn't--</i>

233
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:31,471
Get her out of there.

234
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,018
<i>Jack, please!</i>

235
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,042
Hey, you.

236
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:56,944
Hey, what's for dinner, gorgeous?

237
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,412
It's taco night.

238
00:17:58,705 --> 00:17:59,856
You're making tacos?

239
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,282
Yes, and you better like 'em.

240
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,331
Or what?

241
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,857
Or no dessert.

242
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,244
I'm leaving now. I'll be home soon.

243
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:12,737
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

244
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:45,086
Agent Mars.

245
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,687
It's me.

246
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,289
Well, I'm glad.

247
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,498
I realized this morning
that it was the feast of

248
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:03,039
<i>the ascension,
and I was feeling bad.</i>

249
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,062
<i>A lot of holy days</i>

250
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,844
have come and gone
since you last called.

251
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,262
I thought you and I were friends.

252
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,783
I don't want to run anymore.

253
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,921
What's his name?

254
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:16,897
Does he know who you are?

255
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,807
Edward, please.

256
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:23,882
I know you don't want to spend
the rest of your life chasing me.

257
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:25,616
Please, I love this guy.

258
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,504
Just let me go.

259
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,065
I'll tell you what.

260
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,798
If you can really stay put,

261
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,983
you really settle down,

262
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,132
then I'll stop chasing you.

263
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,698
But you and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

264
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:14,854
Sawyer...

265
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:19,036
You really care about him, huh?

266
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:21,444
Where is he?

267
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,864
I'm sorry
you weren't able to help us, Kate.

268
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,484
Move it, Ford.

269
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:43,266
Danny.

270
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,500
Son of a bitch!

271
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,277
Right. Sorry, Jules.

272
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,488
You got anything
you wanna say to your girl,

273
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,848
you'd best say it tonight.

274
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,047
And how was your day, honey?

275
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:24,885
When the hatch exploded,

276
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,399
your prayer stick fell out of a tree
right on top of me.

277
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,030
So Sayid and I went out to get it,

278
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,807
because it didn't feel right
to bury you without it.

279
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:38,319
I'd like to think you died for a reason,
Mr. Eko.

280
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,171
Just hope it's not too long

281
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:43,381
before we find out
what the heck it might be.

282
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:59,666
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

283
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,138
Thank you for helping me find my...

284
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,047
I saw Jack.

285
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:29,870
They brought me in to see him.

286
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:33,588
They want him to do surgery on Ben.

287
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:34,656
Who the hell's Ben?

288
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,481
Henry, the guy who brought us in.

289
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:38,784
He's sick.

290
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,323
And they say that if he does it,
they're gonna let us all go.

291
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,520
And you and me are what,

292
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,249
- bait?
- Somethin' like that.

293
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:48,973
At least
the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.

294
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,306
I told him he had to.

295
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,380
Why the hell
would you do something so stupid?

296
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,491
To save your life.

297
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,410
My life don't need saving.

298
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,667
You wanna die?!

299
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,724
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.

300
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:04,782
Pickett is just waiting for his chance.

301
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:06,109
I've seen him look at you.

302
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,656
Damn it, Freckles, stay put.

303
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:09,857
And you know what he's gonna do.

304
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,454
So don't pretend

305
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:13,920
like you don't care.

306
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:16,095
Get down, Freckles!
We already been through this.

307
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,322
Shut up, James.

308
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,377
You don't want Jack to save your life?

309
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,934
Then you're gonna save your own.

310
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:29,806
We're getting outta here now.

311
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:31,861
Stop it! Damn it, Kate.

312
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,451
Go. Get outta here. Run!

313
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:39,731
You're out of your cage.

314
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,281
Why don't you run, Kate?

315
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,024
'Cause me...

316
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:44,351
I ain't running...

317
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,948
'cause there ain't no place to go.

318
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,265
What are you talking about?

319
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:54,653
We ain't on our island.

320
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:58,036
We're on another island, like Alcatraz,

321
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,375
couple miles offshore.

322
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:01,956
So unless you're a mermaid,

323
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:03,036
or you got a boat,

324
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,748
there ain't no point.

325
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,993
When were you planning
on telling me this?

326
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,990
- Never.
- Why not?!

327
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:12,633
Why wouldn't you?!

328
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:19,639
'cause I wanted you to believe

329
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,243
that we had a damn chance.

330
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,204
What was that for?

331
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,282
I don't know.

332
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:54,436
I don't know.

333
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:06,336
Very nice.

334
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,161
Okay, now it's your turn.

335
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,195
Look under your place mat.

336
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,516
- What did you do?
- Just look.

337
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:19,721
What is it?

338
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:22,486
You know that honeymoon
I've been promising you for six months?

339
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,573
You are holding in your hand
two tickets to Costa Rica.

340
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,922
So get your passport ready, baby.

341
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,459
What's wrong?

342
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:38,378
Nothing.

343
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,275
I just love you so much.

344
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:47,506
Come here.

345
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,552
Let me ask you something.

346
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,877
The day blockhead was beating on me,

347
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:28,514
and you said...

348
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:31,027
"I love you."

349
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:32,671
That was just...

350
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,296
to get him to stop, right?

351
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,338
I love you, too.

352
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:44,645
Who is this?

353
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:47,528
Hello?

354
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:54,684
<i>Try it... the door.</i>

355
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:31,164
If it helps, I was surprised, too.

356
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,849
If I were a betting man,
I would have picked

357
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:37,371
- her and you.
- Shut up!

358
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:42,541
Well,

359
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,773
I suppose this would be

360
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:47,368
the proverbial nail in my coffin,
wouldn't it?

361
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:58,143
Tomorrow.

362
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,825
Sorry?

363
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,799
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

364
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,886
Get everything I mentioned before,

365
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:09,601
the instruments,

366
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:12,624
the anesthesia, and someone
who can hold a damn clamp.

367
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,855
- Of course.
- I'll get it out...

368
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,229
your tumor,

369
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,410
and I'll keep you alive.

370
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,388
But I need your word.

371
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,152
I need what you promised me before.

372
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:34,446
I need to get the hell off this island.

373
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,022
Done.

374
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:42,987
What you working on?

375
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:46,376
Just finishing some I.R.S
on that fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

376
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,865
That's what being a cop is...
just endless paperwork.

377
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,063
Thank you, sweetie.

378
00:32:57,326 --> 00:32:59,282
What if I told you I was a fugitive?

379
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,839
What if I told you I was on the run
for blowing up my father,

380
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,329
and it was only a matter of time
before you found out?

381
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,502
- This isn't funny.
- It's not a joke.

382
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,850
I almost had a baby, Kev.

383
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:18,998
Me. A baby.

384
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,580
I can't do this.

385
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:24,365
Taco night?

386
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:25,725
I don't do taco night!

387
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,096
Calm down, Monica.

388
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,587
My name's not Monica!

389
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,563
I love you...

390
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,713
but I can't stay.

391
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:47,997
Wait. Hang on.

392
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:54,097
- Kev...
- Something's wrong with me.

393
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,210
I drugged you.

394
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:57,392
- You what?
- I had to.

395
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:59,280
Otherwise, they would think you knew.

396
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:01,486
People are gonna be asking
a lot of questions,

397
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:04,363
and I didn't want you
to lose your job. Kev!

398
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,773
This is gonna be
a very tricky procedure.

399
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,644
If I tell you to do something,
I need you to do it then and there,

400
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,683
no questions asked.

401
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,480
Is that understood?

402
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:54,743
You may find this hard to believe,

403
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:57,469
but I've always been very good
at just following orders.

404
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:00,792
Is that a yes?

405
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:03,152
Yes.

406
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,395
Good.

407
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,066
Let's go.

408
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:20,042
Do you get nervous...

409
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,774
before you do surgery?

410
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,507
I used to,

411
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,502
but not anymore, no.

412
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:40,490
Whatever happens,

413
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:44,018
everything will be very different,
won't it?

414
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:45,920
No doubt about it.

415
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,572
Juliet...

416
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:56,498
did Alex ask about me?

417
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,392
We took her home last night.

418
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:02,749
I don't know where she is now.

419
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,959
Well, see you on the other side.

420
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,289
I'm ready.

421
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,706
I need you to count down from 20.

422
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,747
20...

423
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:23,052
19...

424
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,187
eight...

425
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:31,882
Scalpel.

426
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:50,169
Let's go.

427
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,603
Ben's just gone into surgery.

428
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,022
Ben just put his life
in the hands of one of them.

429
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:00,352
Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.

430
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,856
Well, well, well,
look who got out of her cage.

431
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,378
You two should've run
when you had the chance.

432
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,319
- Let's go, James.
- Don't. Please.

433
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:12,441
You don't have to do this.

434
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,791
He's coming with me,
and you can do anything about it!

435
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:15,918
Step away.

436
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,585
Give me another hemostat.

437
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,396
Swab again.

438
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:49,703
Clamp.

439
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,889
What happened? Is he okay?

440
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:13,741
His blood pressure's dropping.

441
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:17,076
- Should he be bleeding like that?
- No. No, he shouldn't.

442
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,392
Back away from the table.

443
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:23,387
Back away from the table now!

444
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:37,767
Can you hear me in there?

445
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,047
Good.

446
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,393
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

447
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,167
Now if I don't stitch
that back up in the next hour,

448
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,445
he's dead.

449
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,689
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie!

450
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:58,685
Step away!

451
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,377
You let go, or I do her, too.

452
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:18,158
Let go!

453
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:19,501
Don't you let go!

454
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,566
Don't even think about it, Sawyer.
You fight!

455
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,464
Sawyer, please!

456
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:36,214
You get your hands off of him!

457
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:37,529
Down on your knees!

458
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:40,687
Please!

459
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,671
I'll do anything you want!

460
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:44,068
I want you to watch.

461
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:47,279
Close your eyes, Freckles.

462
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:48,320
Stand up.

463
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:49,858
Close your eyes!

464
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:55,050
Don't you give up!

465
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,294
This is for Colleen,

466
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,231
you son of a bitch!

467
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:15,810
<i>Danny, are you there?</i>

468
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,855
<i>Pick it up. Pick it up, Danny.</i>

469
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:19,245
<i>Pick it up, damn it!</i>

470
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:22,567
I'm here! What?!

471
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,340
<i>You anywhere near the cages?</i>

472
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:26,941
Yeah, you could say that.

473
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,514
Give your walkie to Kate.

474
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,742
Now why the hell would I do that?!

475
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:36,883
Because if you don't,

476
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:38,965
the doctor's gonna let Ben die.

477
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:40,457
What are you talking about?

478
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:41,561
What's that beeping?

479
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,766
Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny.

480
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:49,067
Do it! Just do it now!

481
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:57,878
Let go of her!

482
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:20,338
You have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

483
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:23,324
Jack, where are you?

484
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:29,041
You remember
what I told you on the beach?

485
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:30,659
The day of the crash?

486
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:31,977
Do you remember what story

487
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:33,837
I told you
when you were stitching me up?

488
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:38,594
- You remember it?
- Yes Jack, I remember.

489
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:44,218
When you get safe...

490
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:46,703
you radio me and you tell me that story.

491
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,305
Jack, please...

492
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:55,447
If don't get a call from you
in the next hour

493
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:57,807
I'm gonna know something went wrong,
and he dies!

494
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,904
I can't leave without you.

495
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:04,290
It's time, go.

496
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,429
- Jack, I can't...
- Go, now!

497
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:09,665
- I can't!
- Kate, damn-it, run!
