1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:03,113
This island's goin' down!
(Miles) Linus, come in!

2
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:07,150
Linus, come in! (Radio static crackles)

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,622
(Miles) Linus, come in!

4
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:14,491
Come in!

5
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:16,660
Miles, is that you?

6
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:19,229
Yeah. What... what the hell is happening?

7
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:20,298
Are you with Claire?

8
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,732
She's here, but she doesn't
want to come with us.

9
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,334
Come with you where?

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,403
Lapidus is working on the plane right now.

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:28,738
Then we're taking off. (Static crackles)

12
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:32,609
(Loud rumbling) (Grunting)

13
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:39,115
Hey, how much longer till
we get this thing in the air?

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,420
I still have to check the electrical
and the hydraulics! (Thunderclap)

15
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:46,523
<i>Five hours, maybe six.
You've got maybe one!</i>

16
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:50,493
Get your asses over here!
We're leaving in an hour!

17
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,796
Son of a bitch!

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,432
How the hell are we
supposed to get over there?!

19
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,034
I know how we can get there!

20
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,237
Locke has a boat!

21
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:07,310
(Thunderclap)

22
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:17,087
<i>Locke!</i>

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,427
(Blade whooshes)

24
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,441
Aah!

25
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:47,944
(Both grunting)

26
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,045
(Groans)

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,284
Uhh!

28
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:59,189
Uhh!

29
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,690
Aah!

30
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:07,330
(Both grunting)

31
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,032
Uhh!

32
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,202
(Loud rumbling)

33
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,674
(Rumbling stops) Aah!

34
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,511
(Grunting)

35
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,386
(Loud rumbling)

36
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:41,865
(Squish) Aah!

37
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:44,801
Uhh! (Grunts) Aah!

38
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:47,204
(Blade whooshes) (Grunts)

39
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,005
Aah!

40
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:54,778
(Gasps and wheezes)

41
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,580
(Grunts)

42
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,347
I want you to know, Jack...

43
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:06,450
<i>You died for nothing.</i>

44
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:12,423
(Gunshot) Aah! Uhh!

45
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:16,227
I saved you a bullet!

46
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,932
(Panting)

47
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,706
(Loud rumbling)

48
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,146
(Grunts) You're too late.

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,781
(Rumbling stops)

50
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,452
(Grunts)

51
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,792
(Thud)

52
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,999
(Panting)

53
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,973
Nice work, Dr. Shephard.

54
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,009
(Woman speaking indistinctly)

55
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,280
What happened to your neck?

56
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:12,616
<i>(Woman speaking indistinctly)</i>

57
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:15,186
Damn it.

58
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,725
Okay, he's stable. I'm
gonna hop in the shower

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,862
and see if I can catch up with
David before the concert's over.

60
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,864
So just give me a call
if you need anything.

61
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,867
Dr. Shephard? He's waking up.

62
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,203
I watched the anesthesiologist.

63
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,171
He got the full dosage.

64
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,173
Okay.

65
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,309
I'll take it from here.

66
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,245
Mr. Locke?

67
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,647
Can you hear me?

68
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,117
John, are you awake?

69
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,320
(Chuckles)

70
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,888
You just had major surgery,

71
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,390
so I need you to try not to move

72
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,726
and just relax, okay?

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,696
It worked.

74
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,364
Well, it went well.

75
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,100
But we won't know how well you
responded to the surgery for...

76
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,035
No, Dr. Shephard. It worked.

77
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,573
I can feel my legs.

78
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,076
John, it's highly unlikely

79
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,745
that you would regain
sensation that quickly.

80
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,780
So let's just take it s...

81
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,185
ooh.

82
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,061
(Locke) Oh!

83
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,266
(Low magnetic zap)

84
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,036
(Low magnetic zap)

85
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,670
*

86
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,276
Ohh.

87
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,413
Did you see that?

88
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:50,581
See what?

89
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,522
You don't remember?

90
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,926
(Low magnetic zap)

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,561
Um...

92
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:04,895
Mr. Locke,

93
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,997
please, just, uh, just relax.

94
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,934
What we need to do...
what we need to do is go.

95
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,769
No, no, no. Hey, John.

96
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,105
Will you come with me?
We're not going anywhere.

97
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,675
You just had extensive spinal surgery...

98
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,078
(Voice breaks) And I...
I need to go see my son.

99
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,713
You don't have a son.

100
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:25,916
What?

101
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:29,587
You don't have a son, Jack.

102
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,922
Doctor?

103
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,658
Jane, um...

104
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,827
Would you give Mr. Locke
something to help him rest?

105
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,329
I need to go.

106
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:39,496
Jack.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,270
I hope that somebody does for you

108
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,839
what you just did for me.

109
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:18,234
Oh. Oh, my God. (Groans)

110
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,036
(Panting)

111
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:21,938
Oh! (Groans)

112
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,907
Ohh. Jack.

113
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,575
I'll be fine.

114
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:29,312
Just find me some thread,
and I can count to five.

115
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:30,680
(Chuckles)

116
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:33,183
Hey!

117
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:34,818
(Hurley) Oh, my God!

118
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:37,020
What the hell happened?

119
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,390
Locke's dead.

120
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,825
It's over.

121
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,633
(Loud rumbling)

122
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,005
(Kate) Uhh! (Groans)

123
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,540
(Rumbling stops) It sure
don't feel like it's over.

124
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,250
Excuse me. Ms. Paik?

125
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,718
Yes?

126
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,422
Hi.

127
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,691
I'm Detective Ford. L.A.P.D.

128
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm sorry. I heard you were shot,

129
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:21,298
but I didn't expect you
to be checking out so soon.

130
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,599
Hey.

131
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,869
Hello... Detective.

132
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,872
Well, I came by to check
if you've seen this man.

133
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:32,609
He escaped custody, and we're
worried he might come after you.

134
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:35,011
I'm gonna assign a uniform
to keep an eye on you

135
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,948
until we can AP... you/////////////////////
don't have to do that.

136
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,216
All due respect,

137
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,786
I have a job to do here, ma'am.

138
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,423
<i>I need to keep you safe.
It's okay. I am safe.</i>

139
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,362
We'll see you there.

140
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:55,198
(Door closes)

141
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:58,201
<i>See me where?</i>

142
00:08:58,235 --> 00:08:59,569
(Loud rumbling)

143
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,538
All right.

144
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:04,808
(Rumbling stops) It ain't
pretty, but it's gonna work.

145
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,177
I've gotta reset the electronics.

146
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,414
(Clicking, gages powering up)

147
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,185
(Rapid beeping)

148
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,054
Something's wrong with the hydraulics

149
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,889
down in the nose wheel.
(Gages powering down)

150
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,891
Is either one of you
guys mechanical? Yeah?

151
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,561
I-I worked for a-a contractor
renovating apartments

152
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:26,696
for a couple summers. Here, take that...

153
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,698
And this... and this.

154
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,034
Go down there, make sure
everything's hooked up right.

155
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,535
Go!

156
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,906
(Ben) Lapidus? Yeah?

157
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:39,342
Frank, how's it going over
there? What's your timetable?

158
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:41,177
Don't bother me!

159
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,880
Sounds like they're making progress.

160
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:50,186
(Loud rumbling)

161
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,721
(Rumbling stops)

162
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,860
<i>We gotta go now.</i>

163
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:58,528
I don't understand.

164
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:01,264
Locke's dead. Why is this still happening?

165
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:03,600
Because whatever Desmond turned off,

166
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,935
I need to turn it back on again.

167
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,638
But if it doesn't work...
if I don't get it done...

168
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:12,742
you all need to leave now.
You need to be on that plane.

169
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:16,279
You can come with us, too,
Jack. You don't have to do this.

170
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,314
<i>No, I do have to do it.</i>

171
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:21,685
<i>No, you don't.</i>

172
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,653
Let this island sink, Jack.

173
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,822
(Grunts) Kate, I can't.

174
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:38,368
You think you can get that boat across
the channel in time? Yeah, I can manage.

175
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,805
(Groans)

176
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,744
Good luck to you, James.

177
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,980
Thanks, doc, for everything.

178
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,987
James!

179
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:01,624
If the island's going down,
I'm going down with it.

180
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:06,830
Hugo. You better get going.

181
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,865
<i>Unh-unh. No way. You
think I'm going down that?</i>

182
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm with you, dude.

183
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:13,069
(Chuckles) Okay.

184
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,308
Kate...

185
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,677
You gotta go.

186
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,012
Get Claire on that plane.

187
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,856
(Voice breaks) Tell me
I'm gonna see you again.

188
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,886
I love you.

189
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:08,024
I love you.

190
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,001
(Crying)

191
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,301
Can you fix it?

192
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,603
(Whispers) I don't
believe in a lot of things,

193
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:47,005
but I do believe in duct tape.

194
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah, I think we're good.

195
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,942
(Loud rumbling)

196
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:53,879
Let's get the hell out of here.

197
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,514
(Kate panting)

198
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,649
Yo, chesty. It's Sawyer and Kate.

199
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,151
(Metal rattling) Yeah?

200
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,153
We're on our way down to the sailboat,

201
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:04,256
<i>then we're heading to you.
Don't leave without us!</i>

202
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,258
We're gettin' off the ground

203
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:07,960
while there's still ground to get off.

204
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,095
So if you wanna go, you
better get your asses in gear.

205
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,220
(Clatter)

206
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,065
Lapidus! Lapidus!

207
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,134
Son of a bitch! What now?

208
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,302
(Sighs)

209
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,040
We jump.

210
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:35,653
- I'll see you at the boat.
- Kate!

211
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,638
(Telephone ringing in distance)

212
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,640
(Exhales deeply)

213
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:58,042
<i>(Woman speaking indistinctly)</i>

214
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:01,579
Hey, you know where I can
get some grub around here?

215
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:03,247
Uh, the cafeteria's closed,

216
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:06,184
but there's a vending
machine down the hallway.

217
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,386
Thanks, doc.

218
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,522
Yeah, no problem.

219
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,899
(Sighs)

220
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:27,638

221
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:32,009
(Whirring)

222
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:33,144
(Whirring stops)

223
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,746
Oh, come on. (Kicks machine)

224
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,648
(Machine rattles)

225
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:41,085
Unbelievable. (Sighs)

226
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,087
(Clank)

227
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,922

(Grunts)

230
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:54,899
Can I help you?

231
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,468
It's okay. I'm a...

232
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:59,604
I'm a cop.

233
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:01,772
Mm. Maybe you should read
the machine its rights.

234
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,675
(Laughs)

235
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,344
That's funny.

236
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:09,013
Mm. Can I tell you a secret? Please.

237
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:12,750
If you unplug it, and then
you plug it back in again,

238
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,752
the candy just drops right down.

239
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,654
Is that right?

240
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,823
Yes, and it's technically legal.

241
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:21,092
Oh.

242
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:23,995
I'll give that a shot.

243
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,469
(Machine whirs, electricity powers down)

244
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,371
(Thud)

245
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:34,538
Oops.

00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:36,007
(Laughs)

247
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,643
(Clank)

248
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:40,011
It worked.

249
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,514
(Low magnetic zap)

250
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,684
Oh.

251
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:48,819
Whoa.

252
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,488
Did you feel that?

253
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:57,395
We should get coffee
sometime. I'd love to,

254
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:00,131
but that machine ate my
dollar. I only got one left.

255
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,334
We could go Dutch.

256
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:06,270

257
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,538

(Exhales sharply)

262
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,188
Juliet.

263
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:29,193
(Voice breaks) Juliet, it's... it's me.

264
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:35,666
(Whispers) Julie.

265
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:41,272
(Crying)

266
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,841
It's me, baby.

267
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:52,216
I got you.

268
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,918
I got you, baby.

269
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,188
(Sniffles)

270
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,823
(Cries)

271
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:03,461
Yeah. (Laughing)

272
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:04,995
Kiss me, James.

273
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,831
You got it, Blondie.

274
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,394

(Indistinct conversations)

277
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,345
It's over.

278
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,347
Excuse me?

279
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,915
The concert.

280
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,417
It's over.

281
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:52,687
You looking for someone?

282
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,424
Yeah. My son.

283
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,893
I was supposed to bring him here tonight.

284
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:02,697
And then I couldn't come, and...

285
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,335
(Chuckles)

286
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,037
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,208
Where do I remember you from?

288
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,910
I stole your pen.

289
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,713
(Chuckles) What?

290
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:19,881
Um...

291
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:23,385
Oceanic 815.

292
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,719
From Sydney.

293
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:27,222
I bumped into you coming
out of the bathroom,

294
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,224
and... I stole your pen.

295
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,893
And that's how I know you?

296
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,863
No.

297
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,898
That's not how you know me.

298
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:52,881
(Low magnetic zap)

299
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,617
I missed you so much.

300
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,086
(Low magnetic zap)

301
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:01,790
(Exhales sharply)

302
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:02,957
(Sighs)

303
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,894
Are you okay?

304
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:09,230
What is happening to me?

305
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,232
Who... (Sighs)

306
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,435
who are you? I don't...

307
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,104
I know you don't understand, Jack.

308
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,243
But if you come with me,

309
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,045
you will.

310
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,390
(Birds chirping)

311
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,293
(Jack panting and grunting)

312
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,061
It's over there.

313
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:47,402
(Loud rumbling)

314
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,707
(Rumbling stops)

315
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,644
(Hurley) How we gettin' down there?

316
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,914
We're not. I'm going alone.

317
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,283
Dude, you can't go down there
alone. Desmond didn't make it.

318
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:04,853
<i>How the hell are you gonna survive?</i>

319
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,422
(Sighs deeply)

320
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,569
No.

321
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,705
No way. I'm not gonna let you die.

322
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,941
Hurley, I'm already dead.

323
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,544
You said you'd protect the
island! And that's what I'm doing.

324
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:33,014
You're committing suicide! I'm not.
This is the way it has to happen.

325
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:35,517
<i>This is what I'm supposed to do.</i>

326
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,853
<i>You're not supposed to
die! The island needs you!</i>

327
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,156
Hurley...

328
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,024
<i>It needs you.</i>

329
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,760
What?

330
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:48,563
It needs to be you, Hugo.

331
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,070
(Voice breaks) I can't.

332
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,505
(Crying)

333
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,541
<i>It's supposed to be you.</i>

334
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,143
It was only supposed to
be me so I could do this.

335
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,979
But if someone has to
take care of the island,

336
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,349
if someone has to protect it,
then... then it should be you.

337
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:11,853
Hurley...

338
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,022
I believe in you.

339
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,562
(Sniffles) Alright, I'll take it.

340
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,432
But it's only temporary.

341
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,835
As soon as you get that light
back on, I'm pulling you up,

342
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,772
- and I'm giving it right back to you. Deal?
- Deal.

343
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:33,575
(Loud rumbling)

344
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,077
(Rumbling stops)

345
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:39,047
Do you have anything to drink? (Groans)

346
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:42,050
Anything to drink out
of? A... a cup. A canteen.

347
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,585
I do.

348
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,756
Is that okay?

349
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,425
Perfect.

350
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,965
(Jack groans)

351
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,534
(Grunts)

352
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,207
Drink this.

353
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,966
Is that it?

354
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,868
(Chuckles)

355
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:38,873
Now you're like me.

356
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,986
Second time's a charm.

357
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:53,988
It better be, 'cause we sure as hell

358
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,923
don't have the battery
power for a third time.

359
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,892
(Clicking)

360
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,827
(Electricity surges)

361
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:03,331
(Engines powering up)

362
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,001
Is that good?

363
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,504
That, my friends, is pure music.

364
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:13,975
(Grunts)

365
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,344
Easy.

366
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,613
(Grunts)

367
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,852
Easy. Easy.

368
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:32,660
(Loud rumbling)

369
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:34,495
Dude!

370
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,364
(Grunts)

371
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,400
(Groaning) (Rumbling subsides)

372
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,340
(Panting)

373
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:58,486
(Rumbling continues, steam hissing)

374
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,525
Desmond!

375
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,027
(Rumbling subsides) Desmond!

376
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,862
Can you hear me?

377
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:12,700
(Groans) Aah! Ah!

378
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:14,802
(Panting) The light...

379
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,471
I put it out.

380
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,072
It didn't work.

381
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,678
I thought I'd leave this place.

382
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,179
I got you. Come on.

383
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,514
Come on. Ah!

384
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,550
(Both grunting)

385
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,654
I'm still here. (Grunts)

386
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,791
You were right, Jack.

387
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,060
Yeah, well, there's a
first time for everything.

388
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:42,196
(Loud rumbling) Aah!

389
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,732
Uhh! I have to put it back.

390
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,734
It was like a drain. That's what you did?

391
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:50,271
You took that stone out of that hole
over there? Jack, you can't. Listen.

392
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:53,207
Even if you turn it back on,
it'll kill ya. It has to be me.

393
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,876
Desmond, you've done enough.

394
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,379
You wanna do something? Go home
and be with your wife and son.

395
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,281
<i>How about you, Jack?</i>

396
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,552
I'll see you in another life, brother.

397
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,857
(Sighs)

398
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,898
Claire?

399
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,069
(Loud rumbling)

400
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,975
(Rumbling stops)

401
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,948
Oh, that ain't good.

402
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,184
Miles, go look out the door!
You're gonna be my eyes while I

403
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:39,520
back this out of here. Richard,
go tell me what he says.

404
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:40,855
Claire!

405
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:44,358
(Panting)

406
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:47,195
Are you okay?

407
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:57,338
(Engines roaring)

408
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:01,209
(Creaking)

409
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:05,913
(Sighs)

410
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,382
Come on! We gotta go! Come on!

411
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,685
Claire, come on, please. I can't!

412
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,553
Why?! Look at me!

413
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:15,156
This island's made me crazy.

414
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,658
I... I don't want Aaron
to see me like this.

415
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,193
(Sighs)

416
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,262
I don't... I don't even know
how to be a mother anymore.

417
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:24,398
Listen to me. None of us do.

418
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,900
Not at first.

419
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,102
But you're not alone.

420
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,640
Let me help you.

421
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,479
Now come on.

422
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,415
Let's go.

423
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,589
Are we clear?! Miles, are we clear?

424
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,058
Yeah, it looks like it
to me! He says we're good.

425
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,594
You better pray we are, Ricky boy,

426
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:56,330
'cause I'm gonna spin her around. Hold on!

427
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,070
Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell
him we're coming! Lapidus! Lapidus!

428
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:05,973
Lapidus, hold on!

429
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:08,843
All right, we're good to go!

430
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,112
Let's go!

431
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,222
(Engines roaring)

432
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,864
(Whispers) What the hell?

433
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,134
(Chuckles)

434
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:36,170
(Engines powering down)

435
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,205
Boys, we got some late
arrivals. Open the door.

436
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:41,976
Come on!

437
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:47,949
(Rumbling and hissing continue)

438
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,419
Uhh!

439
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,256
(Grunts)

440
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:05,800
(Groaning)

441
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:06,968
Uhh!

442
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:08,269
(Grunts)

443
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,040
Uhh! (Groans)

444
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:26,120
(Rumbling and hissing continue)

445
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:29,590
(Groans)

446
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,791
Ohh!

447
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:37,298
(Whispers) No.

448
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:39,834
No.

449
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,135
No.

450
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,179
We're running out of time!

451
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:55,182
(Kate grunting)

452
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,485
(Sawyer panting)

453
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,554
Way to wait till the last second,
Jim. Good to see you, too, Enos.

454
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,056
We got 'em!

455
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,158
Everybody, buckle up tight!

456
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,292
Hold on!

457
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,030
(Engines powering up)

458
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,903
Here we go, Frank.

459
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,505
(Exhales deeply)

460
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:43,698
Come on.

461
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,702
<i>Come on.</i>

462
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,752
Amen.

463
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:36,984
(Rumbling and hissing continue)

464
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,392
(Water trickling)

465
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,731
(Rumbling and hissing subside)

466
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:08,816
(Laughing)

467
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,620
(Low magnetic humming)

468
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:15,823
(Buzzing, magnetic humming)

469
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,365
He did it. The light's back on.

470
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,100
Dude, pull.

471
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,973
Hang on, Jack!

472
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:39,947
(Continues laughing)

473
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,519
Got him!

474
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,722
Desmond?

475
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:50,090
No.

476
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,126
Jack!

477
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,202
<i>Jack!</i>

478
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:12,951
(Brakes squeal)

479
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,486
(Shifts gears)

480
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,124
(Door closes)

481
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:22,727
(Trunk creaks)

482
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:35,240
(Grunts)

483
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:39,110
Thank you.

484
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,504
Hello, Benjamin.

485
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,288
Hello, John.

486
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:07,886
Is everyone already inside?

487
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:16,581
Mm.

488
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,940
I'm very sorry
for what I did to you, John.

489
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,451
I was selfish and jealous.

490
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,370
<i>I wanted everything you had.</i>

491
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:33,851
What did I have?

492
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:37,695
You were special, John.

493
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,042
And I wasn't.

494
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:46,804
Well, if it helps, Ben,

495
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,858
I forgive you.

496
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:53,832
Thank you, John.

497
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,042
That does help.

498
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:01,260
It matters more than I can say.

499
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,900
What are you gonna do now?

500
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:07,679
I have some things that
I still need to work out.

501
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,504
I think I'll stay here a while.

502
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,787
You know, I don't think you
need to be in that chair anymore.

503
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,085
Mm.

504
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:43,633
Good-bye, Ben.

505
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,293
(Door closes)

506
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:11,281
(Water streaming)

507
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,103
I think Desmond's gonna be okay.

508
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:32,938
(Grunts)

509
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:37,119
Jack's... gone.

510
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,764
Isn't he?

511
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,469
(Crying)

512
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,577
He did his job, Hugo.

513
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,664
It's my job now.

514
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:59,677
(Breathing heavily)

515
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:01,473
What the hell am I supposed to to do?

516
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,384
<i>I think you do what you do best.</i>

517
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:10,699
Take care of people.

518
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:15,840
You can start by helping Desmond get home.

519
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:17,882
But how?

520
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,429
People can't leave the island.

521
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:23,093
That's how Jacob ran things.

522
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:26,279
Maybe there's another way.

523
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:29,715
<i>A better way.</i>

524
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:34,017
Will you help me?

525
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:36,792
I'm sorry?

526
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:39,467
I could really use someone with,
like... 

527
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,962
experience... For a little while.

528
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:49,451
Will you help me, Ben?

529
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:54,962
I'd be honored.

530
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:00,163
Cool.

531
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:13,737
(Door creaks)

532
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:16,355
Oh! Hey, dude.

533
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,676
Hello, Hugo.

534
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:20,202
We're all inside.

535
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:24,025
I don't think I'm coming in.

536
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:32,742
You know...

537
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:35,324
you were a real good number two.

538
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:40,165
And you were a great number one, Hugo.

539
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:43,962
Thanks, dude.

540
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,617
I'll see you.

541
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:51,723
(Door creaks and closes)

542
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:02,266
(Shifts gears, turns off engine)

543
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,593
Do you know where we are?

544
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,701
This is where I was gonna
have my father's funeral.

545
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:14,817
He died in Australia.

546
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,006
I'm sorry.

547
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,643
Why did you bring me here?

548
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:27,573
Because this is where you were 
gonna have your father's funeral.

549
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:34,337
You can go in around back.

550
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,823
Wait. W... where are you going?

551
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:38,229
Inside.

552
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,510
I'll be waiting for you there...

553
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:43,936
once you're ready.

554
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:45,462
(Chuckles)

555
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,030
Ready for what?

556
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,271
To leave.

557
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,185
(Grunting)

558
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:12,753
(Closes door)

559
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:04,882
(exhales sharply)

560
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:13,357
(Low magnetic zap)

561
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,623
(low magnetic zap)

562
00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:00,371
(Sighs)

563
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,709
Hey, kiddo.

564
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:17,740
(Gasps)

565
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,985
Dad?

566
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,444
Hello, Jack.

567
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:31,564
I don't understand.

568
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,480
(Voice breaks) You died.

569
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:37,153
Yeah.

570
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,351
Yes, I did.

571
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,283
Then how are you here right now?

572
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:46,913
(Sighs)

573
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:50,508
<i>How are you here?</i>

574
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,363
I died, too.

575
00:43:11,543 --> 00:43:12,709
(Crying)

576
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:16,121
It's okay.

577
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:18,153
It's okay.

578
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:20,531
It's okay, son.

579
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:23,188
(Sobbing)

580
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:26,227
(Sighs deeply)

581
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,377
(Sniffles)

582
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:39,797
- (muffled voice) I love you, dad.
- I love you, too, son.

583
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:43,195
Are you...

584
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,882
are you real?

585
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:50,665
(Laughs) I sure hope so.

586
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:53,440
(Laughs) Yeah, I'm real.

587
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:54,823
You're real.

588
00:43:55,388 --> 00:43:57,586
Everything that's ever
happened to you is real.

589
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:00,505
(Sniffles) All those
people in the church...

590
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,988
they're all real, too.

591
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:04,514
They're all...

592
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:06,904
They're all dead?

593
00:44:08,322 --> 00:44:09,811
(Sighs)

594
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:11,973
Everyone dies sometime, kiddo.

595
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,919
Some of them before you, some...

596
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:20,841
long after you.

597
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:24,801
But why are they all here now?

598
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:29,968
Well, there is no "now"... here.

599
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:40,715
(Sighs deeply)

600
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:44,775
Where are we, dad?

601
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:50,111
This is a place that you...
that you all made together

602
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,189
so that you could find one another.

603
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,822
The most important part of your life

604
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:05,584
was the time that you
spent with these people.

605
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,440
That's why all of you are here.

606
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,153
Nobody does it alone, Jack.

607
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:15,480
You needed all of them,

608
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,428
and they needed you.

609
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:22,281
For what?

610
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:26,966
To remember.

611
00:45:30,182 --> 00:45:32,246
And to... let go.

612
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,423
(Sighs)

613
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,248
Kate...

614
00:45:41,377 --> 00:45:43,107
she said we were leaving.

615
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:45,481
(Whispers) Not leave. No.

616
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,869
Moving on.

617
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,804
(Sighs)

618
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:57,075
Where are we going?

619
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:03,691
Let's go find out.

620
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:07,187
(Chuckles)

621
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:45,088
We've been waitin' for ya. (Laughs)

622
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:13,336
(Vincent barks)

623
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:20,971
(engines roaring)
