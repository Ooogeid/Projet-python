<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:02,547
We think you're special.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,187
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people.

4
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:06,315
How was the interview?

5
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,600
Why I'd want to go
all the way to Portland

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,600
for research that doesn't even work?

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
Because it does work.
I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,881
My whole life, all I've ever
wanted was to have a baby.

9
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,309
and now because of you, I can.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,251
I know that you don't care,

11
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,357
but the people I spent the last
three years of my life with...

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,900
they just left me.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,205
You okay?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,900
- She is not coming with us.
- Yes, she is.

15
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,200
- Why?
- They left her behind, too.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,500
It's getting late.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
This is a good place to make camp.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,500
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll go with you.

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,400
Do you wanna talk about it?

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
Talk about what?

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,700
About the week
you spent over there with them.

22
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,500
Well, after you left,

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,052
I'd...

24
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,371
I'd made a deal with them...
If I took care of Ben,

25
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:04,955
that they'd let me off the island.

26
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,900
I don't know.
I just kept my head down,

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,300
did what I was supposed to,

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
and I didn't ask any questions.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
And that's it?

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
That's it.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,392
Okay. Let's have it.

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I want to know what you people
are doing on this island,

33
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
why you're terrorizing us,

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,500
making lists, kidnapping children.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to know everything.

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,500
But the first thing
I'd like to know is...

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,200
Who are you?

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,683
Hi. I'm Juliet Burke.
'm with Mittelos Bioscience.

39
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,191
- I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:29,301
I think they're taking this whole
"corporate secrecy" thing

41
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,600
a little too seriously.

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,787
I'm never gonna fit in
with these people.

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Hey there, Dr. Burke.

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,108
If you pop the trunk,
I'll get your bags.

45
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,171
Thank you.

46
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,700
You managed to find us.

47
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,709
I didn't even know
they had an airport out here.

48
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,000
I know. It surprises everyone.

49
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:52,479
Hi. You must be Rachel.

50
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,900
- Richard Alpert.
- Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,731
Thank you for letting us
borrow your sister for a few months.

52
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,911
Just promise me
you'll bring her back in one piece.

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
Well, we'll do our best.

54
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:05,000
So listen, it's a...
A security thing, you know?

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,858
We have to take you in
the rest of the way, so...

56
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:08,963
Whenever you're ready,

57
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,557
we'll be waiting right over here,
but please take your time.

58
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:12,835
Pleasure to meet you.

59
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,990
Thanks. Thank you.

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,700
It's better this way.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
Is this a mistake?

62
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,632
I shouldn't go.
What if you get sick again?

63
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,000
I won't. The cancer's gone,

64
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:32,100
and I'm 100% preggers, thanks to you.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,900
- I'll be back... - Yes, I know.

66
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,425
Before you give birth. I promise.

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,732
I know. Don't worry about us, okay?

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,611
You spent your whole life
working to get here, so...

69
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:45,636
don't blow it.

70
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,067
- I love you. - I love you.

71
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,887
Go make us proud.

72
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,300
Who are you?

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,656
If I told you who I was,

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,900
if I told you everything that I know,

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
you'd kill me.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,800
What do you think I'll do if you don't?

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Leave her alone.

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
Sooner or later,
she'll answer my questions.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,067
She'll answer your questions
when she's ready,

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,700
and you'll wait until she is.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,100
She's under my protection.

Transcript: FRM - Presync: kevinvan
Resynchro: Sixe

83
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,760
What is it?

84
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,943
It's okay. Shush. I know.

85
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,218
You okay?

86
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,900
What's going on?

87
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
- Didn't you hear Aaron? - Is he okay?

88
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,240
No, he's okay, he's okay.

89
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,841
Are you all right?

90
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,127
Yeah, I just...

91
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,982
feel a little bit off.

92
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:21,700
I didn't sleep well.

93
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,843
I can't believe
I didn't hear him crying.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,565
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

95
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
But why don't you let me take Aaron,

96
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,758
and you get some more rest?

97
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,283
- Yeah, do you mind? - Absolutely.

98
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
I won't sleep... long.

99
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,700
I guess it's no use asking them
to wait up, huh?

100
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,500
They'll come around.
Just give them some time.

101
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,354
My people kept Sayid chained
to a swing set for three days.

102
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,970
Then I dragged Kate into the jungle,

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,878
handcuffed myself to her
and lied about it.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,030
How much time do you think they need?

105
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
We'll be back to our beach
a couple hours.

106
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,318
They'll probably be over it by then.

107
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,783
You nervous?

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Hell, yes.

109
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:23,500
I know that six months sounds
like an eternity,

110
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,400
but you're gonna be amazed
at how time flies once you're there.

111
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,367
I can't wait to find out
where "there" is.

112
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,019
Dr. Burke, wanna have a seat?

113
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,730
I'd like to take some of your vitals,

114
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,900
if that's okay with you.

115
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, sure.

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Everyone at the company
is really excited

117
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,500
about you coming down, Dr. Burke,

118
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,031
and I think your research

119
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,300
is really gonna have
a major impact on us.

120
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,223
- What is that?
- That is orange juice

121
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
with a considerable amount
of tranquilizer mixed in.

122
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:05,600
You want me to drink it?

123
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh, yes. You're gonna want to be asleep
for the trip, Dr. Burke.

124
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,200
It can be kind of intense.

125
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,600
I was fine with signing
all of your paperwork,

126
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,520
fine with agreeing to <I>not</I> talk

127
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,200
to anyone in my life for six months,

128
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,671
fine with the fact that no one
in the medical community

129
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,269
has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience...

130
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,454
Why were you fine?

131
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
- What?
- Why were you fine with those things?

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,712
It seems like quite a leap
for a job opportunity,

133
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,380
and we're not paying you <I>that</I> much.

134
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:39,335
I think you're fine because deep down,
a part of you knows

135
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,036
that the place we're taking you to
is special.

136
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,400
Special, huh?

137
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:47,700
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

138
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,530
You took a woman... Your own sister...

139
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,264
whose reproductive system
was ravaged by chemotherapy,

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,152
who is sterile,
and you made her pregnant.

141
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,254
You created life
where life wasn't supposed to be.

142
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,100
That's a gift, Juliet.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,100
You have a gift.

144
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,200
Now don't you feel you're meant
to do something significant with it?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Where we're going, you can do just that.

146
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,652
Where exactly are we going?

147
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,906
I can't tell you that,

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,730
but what I <I>can</I> tell you is that...

149
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,800
you'll see things there

150
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,325
that you never imagined.

151
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,600
Now no one is forcing you
to do anything,

152
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,447
so if you change your mind,
we're happy to take you back to...

153
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,500
You probably
shouldn't have drunk that so fast.

154
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:09,500
Good morning.

155
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,700
No, no, it's okay.
You'll be hoarse for a few hours,

156
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
but it gets better as the day goes on.

157
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,300
Sorry I had to strap you in,

158
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,500
but the last leg
is always a little bumpy.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,912
Watch your head.

160
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,556
Give me your hand.

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
We're here.

162
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Here where?

163
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,200
Hello, Dr. Burke.

164
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
My name is Benjamin Linus.

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,996
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

166
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,200
Watch your step here.

167
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,075
Hey, that's too much water.

168
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,300
It's gonna be all soggy.

169
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,407
It's oatmeal, dude.
It's supposed to be soggy.

170
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,400
Well, if it ain't three men and a baby.

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I counted Hugo twice.

172
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
Oh, what? Come on. I used your name.

173
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,200
Does anybody know
where there's any aspirin?

174
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:40,500
Claire, you don't look so good.

175
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,803
What are you doing up?
You're meant to be in bed.

176
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,806
Yeah, no, I know.

177
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,640
My head is pounding.

178
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,042
I got you covered.
Two aspirin coming right up.

179
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Thank you.

180
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Son of a bitch.

181
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,376
Jack! It's Jack!

182
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,398
Come on! Come on! It's Jack!

183
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,094
It's Jack.

184
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
What the hell is she doing here?

185
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,598
So...

186
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,109
You're, like, one of them, huh?

187
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm Juliet.

188
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,800
I don't remember you from the dock...

189
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,385
Where you put bags on our heads...

190
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,529
After you shocked us.

191
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,821
I had the day off.

192
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,400
So I hear you're a doctor.

193
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
I'm really more of a researcher.

194
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,165
They send you over here
to keep an eye on me?

195
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
The last one of you guys
that came over here... Ethan...

196
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,333
He kidnapped Claire,
and Charlie got upset.

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
We buried him over there.

198
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:32,269
She's gone, Juliet. She's dead.

199
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,494
It's okay. You tried.

200
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,941
Why don't you go ahead and take off?

201
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,629
I'll talk to Ben.

202
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,700
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

203
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,700
She knew she was taking a risk.

204
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,900
I think it happens at conception,

205
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,387
and if that's the case,
there's nothing I can do about it,

206
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,700
- at least not here.
- I'm not sure I understand.

207
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,283
The only way to see if I'm right

208
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,700
is to take a woman off the island,
back to Miami.

209
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,000
No. You're not taking anybody
off the island.

210
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,300
In that case,
there's thing more I can do.

211
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,300
I know you put a lot of faith in me,
Ben,

212
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

213
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,928
My sister's giving birth
in three months...

214
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
and I haven't even been able
to call her.

215
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
It's time for me to go home.

216
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,065
Your sister won't be giving birth
in three months, Juliet.

217
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,600
She'll be dead before then.

218
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,737
Her cancer's back.

219
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,342
Where did you get this?

220
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,626
Mikhail. Sorry.
I should have told you sooner.

221
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:50,329
But I didn't see what good
it would do...

222
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,300
What good it would do?!
Could have gone home!

223
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,709
I could have been with her!

224
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,714
You still can.

225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,651
You can go home, Juliet,
be with her in her final days,

226
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,017
or you can stay here
and help me with our problem.

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Why would I stay?

228
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,788
Because if you do,
I will cure your sister's cancer.

229
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,649
I'm supposed to take that on faith?

230
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,049
You've been here for six months.

231
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,279
You've done extensive workups
on all of us.

232
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:18,280
- Have you seen even a trace of cancer?
- That's <i>here!</i>

233
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,493
And being that you won't let me bring
my sister here, I'm gonna need more...

234
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:23,300
Jacob said
he would take care of it himself.

235
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:27,048
Unless, of course,
you don't have faith in <i>him.</i>

236
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,100
Every woman on this island needs you.

237
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,500
If you choose to stay,

238
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
I promise you,

239
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,700
we will save Rachel's life.

240
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,305
Trust her? She's one of them.

241
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Not anymore. They left her behind.

242
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,551
- Oh, yeah? Where'd they go?
- I told you. I don't know.

243
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:54,100
- Maybe we better ask her.
- She doesn't know either.

244
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,155
Here's a wacky idea.
Let's sic our resident Iraqi on her,

245
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,314
let him do what he does,
then see what she says.

246
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:00,600
I don't do that anymore.

247
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,200
Well, ain't that convenient?

248
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,731
But I don't trust her, Jack.
If she's so innocent...

249
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,499
why won't she answer our questions?

250
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,159
Just give her some time. She's afraid.

251
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,345
How much time?

252
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,759
Look, the fact that I trust her
should be enough.

253
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:14,294
It's not.

254
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Where did Locke go?

255
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,986
He went with them,
right after he destroyed the sub...

256
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,046
The sub that was gonna take <i>me</i>
off this island.

257
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,800
- What?
- They were gonna let you go?

258
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,085
Said who?

259
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Ben.

260
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,400
- Whose life you saved.
- Sawyer, lay off.

261
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,392
Shoulda let that bug-eyed bastard die!

262
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,843
- He did it for us.
- Sounds like he did it for him.

263
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,159
Is there something you wanna ask me?

264
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,616
I wanna ask you why you're fighting

265
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,876
every single one of us
and sticking up for one of them?

266
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,634
I spent every moment over there

267
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,257
trying to find a way off this island.

268
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,282
I was trying to help all of us.

269
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,231
I was trying to get us rescued.

270
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:56,331
Something's wrong with Claire!

271
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,383
Is she okay?

272
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:02,364
Grab her, grab her.

273
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
Let's get her up. Let's get her up.

274
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,960
How long has she been like this?

275
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,542
She started feeling bad this morning.

276
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,958
Before we got back,
was she showing any symptoms at all?

277
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,019
No, she was fine.

278
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,000
Has she been drinking enough water?

279
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
- I think so, yeah.
- All right, keep that head up.

280
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:21,500
What happened to her?

281
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,502
He said, "what do <i>you</i> care?"

282
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,200
I need your help.

283
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:37,800
I need you to go and get Jack.

284
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
- He's busy right now.
- Please, I have to talk to him.

285
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
You wanna tell me why you need Jack?

286
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,211
Because I think I know
what's wrong with Claire.

287
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
Why?

288
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
Because I did it to her.

289
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,400
Giving you a bad feeling
in your stomach?

290
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Yeah, me, too.

291
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,749
Claire's immune system
is turning on her.

292
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
She's having a latent reaction

293
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:35,269
- to a medication in her bloodstream.
- What medication?

294
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,705
It was designed to keep her alive
during the late stages of her pregnancy.

295
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:39,905
Designed by who?

296
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,700
By me.

297
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,400
For some reason
the women here can't have babies.

298
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
The mother's body
turns on the pregnancy,

299
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,800
treats it as a foreign invader.

300
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,037
I saw it happen over and over.

301
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,700
Every pregnant woman
on this island died...

302
00:23:58,499 --> 00:23:59,541
That is,

303
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,600
every pregnant woman until Claire.

304
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
What did you do to her?

305
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:09,115
One of our people infiltrated your camp

306
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,600
and began taking blood samples

307
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
right after your plane crashed.

308
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,292
Even though Claire
didn't conceive on this island,

309
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,471
we found that her symptoms
were consistent with previous mothers,

310
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,631
- so we tried to save her life.
- By kidnapping her?

311
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,765
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

312
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,207
She was our control case.

313
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,807
I had developed a serum that...

314
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:37,400
I thought would reverse
what was happening to her.

315
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,690
Ethan was administering the injections.

316
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,882
<i>Then you found out
that he wasn't on the plane.</i>

317
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,400
The census... I interviewed everyone.

318
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,064
One of them isn't in the manifest.

319
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:50,129
He wasn't on the plane.

320
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:53,300
So... he improvised.

321
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Hello there.

322
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
<i>He kidnapped her on his own.</i>

323
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
<i>That was never the plan.</i>

324
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,408
Look, I know how this sounds,

325
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,300
but without those injections,
Claire would have died.

326
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,540
Without the serum,
she's going into a form of withdrawal,

327
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,400
and if I don't treat her quickly,

328
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,800
her immune system
could shut down entirely.

329
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,521
Jack, I can fix this.

330
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,508
I just need the serum.

331
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,209
Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies
near the caves where you used to live.

332
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:29,609
If I go right now,

333
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,900
I can be back before it's too late.

334
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,300
Do it.

335
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
Get moving.

336
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,900
Where are you?

337
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
In bed... with you.

338
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
And where <i>were</i> you?

339
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,700
I was just realizing...

340
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,662
that tomorrow I will have been
on this island for three years.

341
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,599
Then I better bake a cake.

342
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Stay here.

343
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,967
What have you got there?

344
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,200
Karl developed some x-rays for me.

345
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
What's wrong?

346
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,659
Morning, Juliet.

347
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,356
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

348
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,329
Of course.

349
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,195
I was just finishing "Carrie."

350
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,251
I still don't know why you picked it,
but, boy, is it depressing.

351
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,524
You have a tumor.

352
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,131
What?

353
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:24,300
When you told me about your back pain,
I said that I would take some x-rays

354
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,100
to see if it was a small fracture
or a herniated disc,

355
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,075
but that's not your problem.

356
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,900
Your problem is a large tumor
surrounding your l4 vertebra.

357
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,600
You're surprised.

358
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,008
You've just told me that I have cancer.
Of course I'm surprised.

359
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

360
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,043
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not scared.

361
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:06,442
Why are you scared, Ben?

362
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:09,000
You said no one on this island
ever had cancer.

363
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,925
- You told me that...
- I know what I told you.

364
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,268
You told me you could fix it.

365
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,046
You said that you cured my sister.
You lied to me.

366
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:16,147
No, I did not lie to you.

367
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,289
If you can cure cancer,
then why do you have it?

368
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:22,609
I don't know.

369
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:26,372
I wanna talk to her.
I wanna talk to Rachel.

370
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:28,235
I wanna talk to her now!

371
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:29,861
That's not gonna happen, Juliet,

372
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,810
but I can promise you
that Rachel is fine.

373
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:33,837
- You never cured her!
- I did!

374
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,689
- You're a liar!
- No, Juliet...

375
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,800
- You lied to me!
- I told you the truth!

376
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,075
I gave you my word.

377
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:55,365
I know.

378
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:03,248
I wanna go home.

379
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:06,018
I wanna go home, Ben. Please.

380
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,877
Can't you please just let me go home?

381
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,729
No.

382
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,100
Step away from the case!

383
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
- Listen to me, Sayid...
- Step back.

384
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,933
It's full of medical supplies.
They're for Claire.

385
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,288
Jack knows all about it.

386
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:05,996
Jack ain't here right now, is he?

387
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,760
I'm telling you the truth.

388
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:15,264
You said earlier if you told me
everything you knew,

389
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,155
I'd kill you.

390
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,597
I'm going to test
the validity of that statement.

391
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,841
He means, "talk."

392
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:24,727
We don't have time for this.

393
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,155
We cleared our schedules.

394
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,523
We got all the time in the world.

395
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,674
You know, it's interesting...

396
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:40,144
that you two are now
the camp's moral police.

397
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,964
I'm curious, Sayid.

398
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:49,271
How long was it before
you told everyone on that beach

399
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,071
exactly how many people
you've tortured in your life?

400
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,789
Do they know about Basra?

401
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:03,168
And I'm sure the first thing
you did when you got here, <i>James,</i>

402
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,348
was to gather everyone in a circle

403
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,603
and tell them about the man
you shot in cold blood

404
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,263
the night before you got on the plane.

405
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,299
So why don't we just skip the part

406
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:15,539
where you two pretend to be righteous?

407
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:19,999
I'm taking that medication
back to Claire,

408
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,189
and you're gonna let me,

409
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,613
because if she doesn't get it,

410
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:26,060
she's gonna die.

411
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,022
And the last thing

412
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,836
that either of you need right now...

413
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:36,813
is more blood on your hands.

414
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:56,484
Goodwin! Ethan,
there may actually be survivors,

415
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,085
and you're one of 'em...
a passenger. You're in shock.

416
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,423
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

417
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,082
I want lists in three days.

418
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,283
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

419
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,420
I was looking for you this morning.

420
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,763
- You and I need to talk.
- Now?

421
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:34,900
We have some time. It's important.

422
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:39,797
Take a walk with me.

423
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,609
Mikhail, we're here.

424
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:56,298
- He never has his walkie on.
- What are we doing here?

425
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,953
Something I need to show you.

426
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,915
It's Ben! I'm here with Juliet!

427
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:07,130
We're approaching the house!
Don't shoot us.

428
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,104
Well, hurry up, then!

429
00:34:13,235 --> 00:34:14,450
Did you see it?

430
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:16,991
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

431
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,994
Of course we saw it.

432
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:21,204
What do you have so far?

433
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,060
Oceanic flight 815...

434
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:25,701
left Sydney, Australia,
headed for Los Angeles,

435
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,722
324 people on board,
including the flight crew.

436
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:31,112
I want detailed files
on every single passenger.

437
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,505
Already working on it.

438
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,440
Can we uplink to Richard
in Acadia park, please?

439
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,381
Yesterday you called me a liar.

440
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:45,647
I was hurt by that.

441
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:51,063
Hello, Richard. Can you hear me?

442
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,194
Notice today's date.

443
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:59,201
This is live. Okay, Richard.

444
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,977
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:21,986
Oh, my God.

446
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,551
A little over two years ago,
to everyone's surprise,

447
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,486
Rachel's cancer
went into complete remission.

448
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,538
Shortly after,
she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

449
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:37,188
His name is <i>Julian.</i>

450
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:47,857
Okay, thank you, Richard.

451
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:50,329
You'll want to get back here
as soon as you can.

452
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:51,872
We may have some new visitors.

453
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:55,383
Oh, god! No, no!

454
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,494
I'm not a liar, Juliet.

455
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:09,128
- I wanna go home.
- That's not our agreement.

456
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,215
You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

457
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,601
It's impossible.
The mothers keep dying.

458
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:16,212
Then we'll find more mothers.

459
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,160
Who knows?

460
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,372
Maybe there's even one on that plane.

461
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,006
Wait. What are you doing?

462
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:41,795
She's not touching her.
She's the one who did this to her.

463
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,468
- She can help her.
- Says who? <i>her?</i>

464
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,511
- How can you even trust her?
- I do trust her.

465
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,517
Do you trust <i>me?</i>

466
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,501
Do you trust me?

467
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:59,531
Just give us a couple minutes here,
okay?

468
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,397
How long before this takes effect?

469
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,357
We should see results in a few hours.

470
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:15,598
If this doesn't work,
if something happens to her...

471
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,365
I'm not gonna be able
to protect you anymore.

472
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,265
You'll be on your own.

473
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:28,083
I'm already on my own, Jack.

474
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,076
What happened?

475
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:28,900
I've got a tarp, couple of blankets,

476
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,577
airline pillows.

477
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:34,848
It's not much,
but...

478
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,129
it'll get you started.

479
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,454
Claire's awake.

480
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:47,929
There's a lean-to
that we've been using for shade,

481
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:52,359
and everyone says that it'd be all right
if you set up camp there for now.

482
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,787
Thank you.

483
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,174
They're good people,

484
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,282
and they're willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

485
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:04,486
But eventually they're gonna need
some answers.

486
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,747
Why don't you?

487
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,561
You keep talking about <i>them.</i>

488
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,723
why don't I ever have
to explain myself to <i>you?</i>

489
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,272
You were there.

490
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:28,001
You were standing right next to me
when that submarine exploded...

491
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:31,916
And in that moment,
I saw it in your eyes.

492
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:37,593
You wanna get off this island
more than anything else in the world.

493
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,644
That makes you one of us.

494
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:09,734
<i>Let's go over it again.</i>

495
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,086
- I know what to do.
- Let's go over it again,

496
00:40:12,183 --> 00:40:13,613
just to be sure.

497
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:16,897
I drag Austen out into the jungle,

498
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,749
handcuff myself to her,

499
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,121
then tell her I was gassed
just like she was.

500
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:23,896
And if she catches you in the lie?

501
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:25,224
I'll admit to it,

502
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,813
tell her it was the only way
to earn her trust.

503
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:32,242
Good. What then?

504
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,699
They'll take me back to the beach.

505
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:44,846
<i>I know you want me to go there,</i>

506
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,846
<i>but after everything we've done to them,</i>

507
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:50,231
<i>it's going to be a problem.</i>

508
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,212
We've activated the implant in Claire.

509
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,948
She should be symptomatic
within the next 48 hours.

510
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,236
By the time you get to that camp,

511
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:05,211
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

512
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:09,151
<i>I'll need supplies.</i>

513
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:10,733
<i>Pryce is already on his way.</i>

514
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:13,584
<i>He'll hide the case
at Ethan's old drop point.</i>

515
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,127
<i>Tell Jack that you can save her.</i>

516
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,458
<i>He trusts you.</i>

517
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,725
Are you all right?

518
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,258
I'm fine.

519
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,008
See you in a week.
