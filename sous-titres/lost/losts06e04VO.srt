1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,335
I'm sorry you had
to see me like that.

2
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:27,936
Hello, richard.

3
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:29,471
You? Me.

4
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,176
I am very disappointed
in all of you!

5
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,589
So what were you
doing in australia?

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,058
Business or pleasure? Actually,
I went on a walkabout.

7
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,327
welcome to los angeles.

8
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,634
bye, daddy. Bye, sweetie.

9
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:41,610
oh, come on.

10
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,107
john?

11
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:17,112
Are you okay?

12
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:19,081
Yeah. I'm fine.

13
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:20,816
Oh.

14
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,784
Come on, let's get you inside.

15
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,720
Okay.

16
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,990
well, how long will that take?

17
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,659
The wedding is in October.

18
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,895
Look, I'm gonna just have
to call you back. Yeah.

19
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:37,899
I am so sick of caterers

20
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,801
And bands

21
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:44,139
And picking fabrics
for chair backs.

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,108
What do you say we just...

23
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,611
Get my parents and your dad

24
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:52,314
And do it shotgun
style in vegas?

25
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:55,517
No. You deserve better
than that, helen.

26
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:58,720
And we can do this.
I know we can.

27
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,392
I like...

28
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:04,726
This one.

29
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,662
That one? I meant this one.

30
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:11,133
You are a very sweet man.

31
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,434
Mmm.

32
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,902
I know.

33
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,406
So how was the conference?

34
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:20,909
Boring.

35
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:26,181
Who's, uh, who's dr.
Jack shephard?

36
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,183
Oh, I met him at lost luggage

37
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,552
When I went to
fill out the forms.

38
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,921
He... He lost something, too.

39
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,456
He's a spinal surgeon?

40
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,158
Yeah. Nice guy.

41
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,226
He offered me a free consult.

42
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,262
You should call him.

43
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,664
Oh, he was just
being polite, helen.

44
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,534
So what?

45
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,669
I mean...

46
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,573
What are the odds of you just
running into a spinal surgeon?

47
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:54,776
I mean, who knows?

48
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,611
Maybe it's destiny.

49
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,247
Maybe it is.

50
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:36,585
?I'm a runaway son

51
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,523
All right, richard.

52
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:18,660
Time to talk.

53
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,469
Welcome back, colonel.

54
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,071
Wow.

55
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,307
You got a nice tan in australia.

56
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,975
Did you miss us?

57
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,910
Sure I did, randy.

58
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,480
So... How was the
conference, john?

59
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,949
Uh, it was okay.
I didn't really learn anything.

60
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,718
No? But, um, I made some
good contacts, though.

61
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,387
Really? That's interesting.

62
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:22,389
See, uh, ken fisher called

63
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,425
And said you had to cancel
your lunch with him.

64
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,395
Right, right. I was a little
under the weather that day.

65
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:31,064
Uh... probably jet lag. Really?

66
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,233
'cause then the
seminar people called

67
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,568
And said you hadn't picked
up your credentials.

68
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,437
I did some checking,

69
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,407
And it seems that you didn't
attend a single event.

70
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:43,510
Since we sent you to sydney
on the company's dime...

71
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,545
Where the hellere you?

72
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:47,514
Look, randy,
I'm really sorry. I'm...

73
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:50,016
Why don't we just call
it my vacation week?

74
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:52,018
I thought you wanted that
vacation week in October?

75
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,087
You know, for your wedding.

76
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:57,157
Please, randy. I-I know
I shouldn't have lied.

77
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,059
But where I was...

78
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,263
It's personal,

79
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,932
And I--and I really don't
want to talk about it.

80
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,434
Okay, john.

81
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,235
Hey, you're fired.

82
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,312
Thirsty?

83
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,156
Richard, I'm sorry I
hit you in the throat

84
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:33,827
And dragged you off the beach,
but I had to do something.

85
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,763
What do you want?
What I've always wanted--

86
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:39,466
For you to come with me.

87
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,435
Why do you look like john locke?

88
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:45,405
I knew he'd get me
access to jacob.

89
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:47,707
Because john's a candidate.

90
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,343
Or at least he was a candidate.

91
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,513
What do you mean--

92
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,748
What do you mean, "A candidate"?

93
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,787
Didn't jacob tell you any of this?
Any of what?

94
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:03,456
Oh, richard, I'm sorry.

95
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,326
You mean, you've been doing
everything he told you

96
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,095
All this time,
and he never said why?

97
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,066
I would never have
done that to you.

98
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,502
I would never have
kept you in the dark.

99
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:18,037
And--and what would
you have done?

100
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,473
I would have treated
you wi respect.

101
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,108
Come with me,

102
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:25,145
And I promise I'll
tell you everything.

103
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,282
No.

104
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:32,185
Are you sure about that,
richard?

105
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:35,188
Because people seldom
get a second chance.

106
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:38,091
I'm not going anywhere with you.

107
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,896
All right--

108
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,705
What?

109
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,182
I'll be seeing you, richard,
sooner than you think.

110
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,544
Am I interrupting?

111
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,949
tell me what happened to them.

112
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,817
All right.

113
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:39,786
There's a fairly
reasonable chance

114
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,654
That you won't believe me.

115
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,596
Try me.

116
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:52,498
John locke killed them.

117
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,101
All by himself? Yes.

118
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,704
He turned into a
pillar of black smoke,

119
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:00,173
And he killed them
right before my eyes.

120
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:03,009
Did it kill jacob as well?

121
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,744
Yes.

122
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:07,146
Then where's his body?

123
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:10,416
Locke kicked him into the fire,
and he burned away.

124
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,034
Locke--do you know why

125
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:31,204
He carried richard
out into the jungle?

126
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:39,779
He's recruiting.

127
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,251
Hello, james.

128
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,994
I thought you were dead.

129
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,665
I am.

130
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,569
Here's to bein' dead.

131
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,609
You're taking this
extremely well.

132
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,812
taking what extremely well?

133
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:36,380
That I'm here.

134
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,516
I don't give a
damn if you're dead

135
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,752
Or time travelin' or...

136
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:44,188
The ghost of christmas past.

137
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,657
All I care about
is this whiskey.

138
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:49,727
So bottom's up,

139
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,630
Then get the hell
out of my house.

140
00:12:57,135 --> 00:12:59,069
This isn't your house, james.

141
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,072
the hell it ain't.

142
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,541
No. You just lived
here for a while.

143
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,844
This was never your house.

144
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:12,449
Who are you?

145
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,318
You sure as hell
ain't john locke.

146
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,121
What makes you say that?

147
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:19,156
'cause locke was scared,

148
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:23,227
Even when he was
pretending he wasn't.

149
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,029
But you...

150
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,199
You ain't scared.

151
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:38,942
What if I told you I was
the person who could answer

152
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,879
The most important
question in the world?

153
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:51,822
And what question is that?

154
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:56,026
Why are you on ts island?

155
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,062
I'm on this island

156
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:00,431
Because my plane crashed,

157
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:03,634
'cause my ft blew up,

158
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,071
Because the helicopter I was
on was ridin' one too heavy.

159
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,440
That's not why you're here.

160
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,011
And if you come with me...

161
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,713
I can prove it.

162
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,922
Well, I guess I better
put some pants on.

163
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,141
Okay.

164
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,210
Okay.

165
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,920
Come on!

166
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,922
Aw, damn it!

167
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,498
Dude?

168
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,099
Dude!

169
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,071
What are you doing?

170
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,740
What am I doing?
What the hell are you doing?

171
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,776
You ever park a
car in your life?

172
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,744
You're practically in my spot!

173
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,046
I'm sorry. Yeah.

174
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,215
But, you know, there's a
handicap spot right over here.

175
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,718
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
But I don't have to park there.

176
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,753
I can park anywhere I want.

177
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:32,189
You need to stay
inside the lines.

178
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm really sorry.

179
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,360
They were supposed to
reserve a spot for me.

180
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,262
So, you know,
I just parked here.

181
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:42,332
I haven't seen you before.
You work here?

182
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,003
Actually, I own the company.

183
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,778
Hugo reyes.

184
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,181
John locke.

185
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,950
Cool. Whato you do here, john?

186
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,386
Uh, actually, nothing.
My boss just fired me.

187
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:04,354
Oh? Who's your boss?

188
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:06,356
His name is randy.

189
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,125
But, uh-- randy nations?

190
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,860
Yeah. Yes,

191
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,829
Yeah, that guy is a huge douche.

192
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,164
You want me to
talk to him for ya?

193
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,099
No, that's okay.

194
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,602
Tell you what, john.

195
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,971
I own a temp agency, too.

196
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:23,373
Call this number

197
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,409
And tell 'em that hugo said

198
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,480
To hook you up with
a new job pronto.

199
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,450
And chin up.

200
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,953
Things are gonna work out.

201
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,462
Whew.

202
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,998
He's gettin' pretty ripe.

203
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,837
Where is everybody?

204
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:57,007
They left. They said they
were going to the temple.

205
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,443
Right now it's the safest
place on the island.

206
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:02,646
We should go there, too.
Are you all right?

207
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,851
I'm fine.

208
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,655
Come on, let's get out of here.

209
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,591
What makes you think
that I'm going with you?

210
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,960
Because you want to find jin.

211
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,396
What do you know abt my husband?

212
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:24,334
I know that if he's on the
island and he's alive,

213
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,770
Then he'll be at the temple.

214
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:31,575
Let's get moving.

215
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,444
What about john?

216
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,382
We need to bury him.

217
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:48,725
What were you doing alone
in that house, james?

218
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:54,097
Drinkin'.

219
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:56,233
Why aren't you with 'em?

220
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,769
You know what?
How about we just don't talk?

221
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,537
You got it.

222
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,076
Who the hell is that?

223
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,512
You can see him?

224
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,948
The kid? Hell, yeah,
I can see him.

225
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,182
Hey!

226
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,317
What--

227
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:25,796
Uhh!

228
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:37,474
You know the rules.

229
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,209
You can't kill him.

230
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:45,382
Don't tell me what I can't do.

231
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:58,662
Don't tell me what I can't!

232
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:02,940
Locke!

233
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,983
Look, whoever you are,
you got about 20 seconds,

234
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,185
And then I'm outta here!

235
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,491
where is he? What the
hell are you doing here?

236
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,928
where is he? Locke? Ran off
into the jungle after some kid.

237
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,764
We need to gnow. Go where?

238
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,267
To the temple. Let's go.
Les go. You know what?

239
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,402
I've been to the temple.
I think I'm sticking with locke.

240
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,504
That man is not john locke.
I know.

241
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,640
Then why are you with him?
Because he's got answers,

242
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,608
Says he knows why
m on this island--

243
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,745
Unless you wanna tell me why I'm here,
richard. Don't be naive.

244
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,242
He's not gonna
tell you anything.

245
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:44,282
He's gonna kill you.
If he wanted to kill me,

246
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,938
He could've done it a
dozen times already.

247
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,752
You don't understand
what you're dealing with.

248
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,321
He doesn't just want you dead.
He wants everyone dead--

249
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,623
Everyone you care about-
all of them--and he won't stop--

250
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,196
Who you talking to?

251
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,499
Nobody.

252
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,401
You ever catch up with the kid?

253
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,603
What kid?

254
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,506
Right.

255
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,975
Let's get on with it, shall we?

256
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,277
Yes, james. Les get on with it.

257
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,719
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

258
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,522
Excuse me?

259
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:29,327
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

260
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,063
Uh... I-I don't know what
that has to do with--

261
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,700
Just say whatever comes to mind.

262
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,904
Would you describe yourself
as a people person?

263
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,042
May I speak to your supervisor?

264
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,013
Of course.

265
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,615
I'll go get her.

266
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,123
good morning, mr... Locke?

267
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,491
Yeah.

268
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,526
I'm rose nadler,
the office supervisor.

269
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,428
What can I do for you?

270
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,864
Uh, what you can do, ms. Nadler,

271
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,834
Is spare me the questio about
what kind of animal I am

272
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,736
And hopefully place me in a job.

273
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,104
absolutely.

274
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,573
What kind of placement
are you looking for?

275
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,241
Well, I see here

276
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,944
That you have a listing
for a site coordinator.

277
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,212
Construction site coordinator.

278
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,347
Uh, I'm not sure
that's a good match.

279
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,863
Well, if experience
is the issue,

280
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,517
I have-- experience
isn't the issue.

281
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,122
Look, mr. Reyes told me

282
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,025
If I came down here,
I would be taken care of.

283
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,028
And mr. Reyes is my boss,
so if he said that,

284
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,996
I can make it happen of you.

285
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,465
If you want to work construction,
you got it.

286
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,401
Thank you. I'm not finished.

287
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,736
I will send you
down there tomorrow,

288
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,805
And then the day after,

289
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,074
You will be back in my office.

290
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,110
Look...

291
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,581
Mr. Locke, let's try to be
a little more realistic.

292
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,751
And what do you know
about realistic?

293
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,358
I have cancer.

294
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,026
Terminal cancer.

295
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,496
I'm sorry.

296
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,899
When the doctors first told me,

297
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,102
I had a hard time accepting it.

298
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,872
But eventually,
I got past the denial part

299
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,577
And I got back to living
whatever life I've got left.

300
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,414
So...

301
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,783
How about we find you a job

302
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,819
You can do?

303
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,094
do you read?

304
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,361
Excuse me?

305
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,330
Books. You read books?

306
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,166
Sure. Who doesn't?

307
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,237
My favorite's steinbeck,
"Of mice and men."

308
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,905
You know that one?

309
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,408
Nope. A little after my time.

310
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,981
It's about these two guys,
george and lennie.

311
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,183
Lennie's kind of slow,

312
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,919
Causing george problems.

313
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,388
So george walks him
out in the woods,

314
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,924
Tells him to look out
yonder and picture

315
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,894
The pretty little house
they're gonna live in one day.

316
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,363
And he shoots lennie in
the back of the head.

317
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:24,068
Well, that doesn't sound
like a happy ending.

318
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,000
What's on your mind, james?

319
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,775
I'm wondering what
would happen to you

320
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,378
If I put a bullet in your head.

321
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,681
Mm. Why don't we find out?

322
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,621
What are you?

323
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,626
What I am is trapped.

324
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,730
And I've been
trapped for so long

325
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,066
That I don't even remember
what it feels like to be free.

326
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,002
Maybe you can understand that.

327
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,773
But before I was trapped,
I was a man, james, just like you.

328
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,276
I have a hard time
believing that.

329
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,112
Well, you can believe whatever you want,
but that's the truth.

330
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,982
I know what it's
like to feel joy,

331
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,786
To feel pain, anger, fear...

332
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,722
To experience betrayal.

333
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,992
I know what it's like to
lose someone you love.

334
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,699
If you wanna shoot me, shoot me.

335
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,969
But you're so close, james.

336
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,939
it would be such a
shame to turn back now.

337
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,536
Why did you have to bring him to
the statue in the first place?

338
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,204
Because the people there

339
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,640
Need to see the face of
what they're up against.

340
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,575
And what's to stop
what they're up against

341
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:12,278
From changing his face?

342
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,813
He can't. Not anymore.

343
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,648
He's stuck this way.

344
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,032
Does anyone want
to say anything?

345
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:11,404
Didn't any of you know him?

346
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,211
All right, I knew him.

347
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:24,784
John locke was a...

348
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,594
A believer.
He was a man of faith.

349
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,095
He was...

350
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,132
A much better man...

351
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,602
Than I will ever be...

352
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,907
And I'm very sorry
I murdered him.

353
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,155
this is the weirdest
damn funeral

354
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,656
I've ever been to.

355
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:56,275
hello. Dr. Shephard's office.

356
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,610
Hello?

357
00:27:57,611 --> 00:28:00,246
Can I help you?

358
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,415
No. No, you can't.

359
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,952
Who was that on the phone?

360
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,386
Mm, one.

361
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,589
No one? Mm-hmm.

362
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,524
John, I just heard you
talking on thphone.

363
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,528
I was, uh,

364
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,930
I was calling dr. Shephard.

365
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:24,303
Well, good for you.
When are you gonna see him?

366
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,772
I'm not gonna see him.

367
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,433
Well, I-I don't understand.

368
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:31,077
Why wouldn't you want-
I got fired, helen.

369
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,552
Coming!

370
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,554
ma'am? Oceanic courier.

371
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,290
I'm delivering
your lost luggage.

372
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,125
All right.

373
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:50,997
Sign here to accept
the delivery.

374
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,167
thanks. Okay, thanks.

375
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,311
Okay, john.

376
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,449
Now talk to me.

377
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,551
How did you get fired?

378
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,324
I lied to randy. I didn't go
to the conference in sydney.

379
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:20,860
What?

380
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,629
Open the case, helen.

381
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,058
W-what are these for?

382
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,427
My walkabout.

383
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:55,761
Your--y-your what?

384
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,364
My walkabout.

385
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:00,666
An adventure in the outback--

386
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,335
Man against nature.

387
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:05,137
But they wouldn't let me go.

388
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,540
And--and I sat there
yelling at them,

389
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,208
Shouting at them,

390
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:13,546
That they couldn't tell
me what I can't do.

391
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,414
But they were right.

392
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,488
I'm sick of imagining

393
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,324
What my life could be out
of this chair, helen,

394
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,893
What it would be like to...

395
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:30,830
Walk down the aisle with you,

396
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,366
'cause it's not gonna happen.

397
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:38,337
So if you need me
to see more doctors,

398
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,773
If, uh... Have more consults,

399
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:43,609
If you need me to get
out of this chair,

400
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,244
I don't blame you.

401
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,646
But I don't want you
to spend your life

402
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,116
Waiting for a miracle,
helen, because...

403
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:52,585
There is no such thing.

404
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:08,434
There are miracles, john.

405
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,573
And the only thing...

406
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:17,243
I was ever waitinfor...

407
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,780
Was you.

408
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,445
Nice view.

409
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:54,747
Now what?

410
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,582
Now we go down.

411
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,052
Down where?

412
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:02,888
Down there.

413
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:07,226
No offense,
but you already died,

414
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,995
So it's great that this
is not a big deal for you.

415
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,931
But if you think I'm
climbin' down there first,

416
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,899
You are off your damn nut.

417
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,935
It's no problem. I'll go first.

418
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,087
You comin', james?

419
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:01,480
ohh!

420
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:22,001
James!

421
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,436
Locke!

422
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:30,009
Jump. I got you. Come on!

423
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,845
Come on, I got you! Come on!

424
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,280
Come on!

425
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,482
uhh! Come on!

426
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,552
aah! Look out!

427
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,323
What is this place?

428
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:40,946
What the hell's that all about?

429
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:43,249
Inside joke.

430
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,818
So this is what you
wanted me to see--

431
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,687
A hole in the cliff with
some rocks on thecale?

432
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,389
That's why I'm here?

433
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,327
No.

434
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,143
That's why you're here.

435
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:20,419
That, james,
is why you're all here.

436
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,069
all right, dig it out.
Come on. All the way.

437
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,972
No cheatin'. Come on, now.
Come on, all the way.

438
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,807
You can catch 'em.
You can catch 'em.

439
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,775
Come on, dig it out.

440
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:50,312
bring it in now.
Bring it in all the way.

441
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:52,781
Good job. Good job.

442
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,755
All right, everyone!

443
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:02,791
Please open your textbooks
to chapter four.

444
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,595
Today we are going
to talk about...

445
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,998
The human reproductive system.

446
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,171
Do you know where the teach--

447
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:18,507
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where the teachers' lounge is?

448
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,743
Yeah, it's over there.
Thank you.

449
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:26,815
all right, people, I know I
sound like a broken record,

450
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,151
But how many times do
we have to go over this?

451
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:31,887
If you have the
last cup of coffee,

452
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,922
You remove the filter

453
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:36,592
And throw it away.

454
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:39,028
Fear not.
I will make a fresh pot.

455
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:41,230
Actually, I was just
hoping for some earl grey.

456
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,165
Tea?

457
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,868
Now there's a gentleman's drink.

458
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,904
I don't believe we've met.
Ben linus. European history.

459
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:52,074
John locke. Substitute.
Well, welcome.

460
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,658
Who wrote all this?

461
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,627
His name was jacob.

462
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,529
"Was" Jacob?

463
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,098
He died yesterday.

464
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,140
You don't seem too
upset about it.

465
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:26,909
I'm not.

466
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:32,514
Why are all the
names crossed out?

467
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:35,684
They're not all crossed out.

468
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:37,386
"Shephard."

469
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,190
That'd be jack shephard?

470
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,447
And he's not the only one.

471
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,172
"Reyes."

472
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,774
That's hugo, right?

473
00:38:00,457 --> 00:38:01,577
Jacob had a thing for numbers.

474
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,817
"16. Jarrah."

475
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:16,992
"42. Kwon." i don't know
if it's sun or if it's jin.

476
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:25,298
Here. "4. Locke."

477
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:29,952
I think both know him.

478
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,635
Last but not least...

479
00:38:39,972 --> 00:38:42,373
"Number 15. Ford."

480
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,445
That would be you.

481
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:50,047
Why would he write
my name on this wall?

482
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:53,551
I never even met the guy.
Oh, no, I'm sure you did meet jacob.

483
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:01,120
At some point in your life, james,
probably when you were young,

484
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,893
When you were miseble and vulnerable,
he came to you.

485
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,528
He manipulated you,

486
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:08,097
Pulled your strings
like you were a puppet.

487
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,933
And as a result,
choices that you thought you made

488
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,702
Were never really
choices at all.

489
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:15,838
He was pushing you, james.

490
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,208
Pushing you...

491
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,743
To the island.

492
00:39:22,312 --> 00:39:24,747
Why the hell would he do that?

493
00:39:24,748 --> 00:39:27,783
Because you're a candidate.

494
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,418
Candidate for what?

495
00:39:29,419 --> 00:39:32,755
He thought he was the
protector of this place.

496
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:35,057
And you, james,
have been nominated...

497
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,193
To take over that job.

498
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:39,728
What does that mean?

499
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:41,697
It means you've
got three choices.

500
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:46,936
First, you can do nothing and...

501
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:49,071
See how all this plays out.

502
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,641
And possibly,

503
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:54,376
Your name...

504
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,779
Will get crossed out.

505
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:00,482
Second option,

506
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,185
You can accept the job,

507
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:06,989
Become the new jacob
and protect the island.

508
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,358
Protect it from what?

509
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,759
From nothing, james.

510
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,394
That's the joke.

511
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,396
There's nothing to
protect it from.

512
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:16,298
It's just a damn island.

513
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:19,235
And it will be perfectly
fine without jacob or you

514
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:24,640
Or any of the other people
whose lives he wasted.

515
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,312
You said there
were three choices.

516
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:35,317
The third choice, james,
is that we just go.

517
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,888
We just get the
hell off this island

518
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:41,190
And we never look back.

519
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:43,659
And how do we do that?

520
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,129
Together.

521
00:40:56,973 --> 00:41:00,476
So what do you say, james?

522
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:03,045
Are you ready to go home?

523
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,156
hell, yes.
