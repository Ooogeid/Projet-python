00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,100

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,100
i'm sorry, sweetheart.
he's just too little.

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,900
we have to take him away now.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,600

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
his name is john!

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,100
who builds a cabin in
the middle of the jungle anyway?

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,400
that's a good question.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,500
so? how about answering it?

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,800
i don't know.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
and why are
we even going there?

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,600
because hopefully,
the man who lives in the cabin

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
can tell us what to do

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,800
about the people
who are trying to kill us.

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,600
we've been walking all day.
are we gonna get there soon?

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
how long?

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,300
i don't know.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>i've been following him.</i>

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
<i>what? what do you mean,
you've been following him?</i>

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,000
i'm not even in front. i have
no idea where the cabin is.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,100
hugo's the last one who saw it.
oh, this is just awesome.

67
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
<i>what do you think
we should do, john?</i>

68
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,300
we're making camp.

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,700
what?

70
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,500
here in the dark
with the monster and... him?

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
well,
the rest will do us good.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
dude, what's gonna happen when
those freighter guys come back?

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,100
i don't know...

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
yet.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
desmond.

76
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,300
the helicopter's here.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,900
all right,
get him on the litter.

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,400
careful with him!

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,700
get him down over there.
be careful.

80
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,400
okay, guys, unload it.

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,500
come on. pick it up.
pick it up. let's go.

82
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
what did this to him?

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,300
a black pillar of smoke
threw him 50 feet in the air...

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
ripped his guts out.

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
what?

86
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,800
i need you to tell me
exactly how many people

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
are on that island and where
every single one of them is.

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
and why would i do that?

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
keamy!

90
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
what the hell do you think you're
doing, mate? you gave me up.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
what? linus knew who
i was. he knew my name.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
he knew everything about me.

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,900
no, i'm not the one
who gave you up.

94
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,500
then who did?

95
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,200
aah! oh! oh!

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
ohh!

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,100
do you know who i am?

98
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,300
what?

99
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,100
my name.
do you know my name?

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
keamy.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,900
martin keamy.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,300
did you give it to him?

103
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,400
who? benjamin linus
- did you give him my name?

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,700
yeah.

105
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,100
wait. wait!

106
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,800
martin, no!

107
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
martin, we need him.

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,400
he's the only one
who can fix the engines.

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,300
and what makes you
so sure about that?

110
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,000
because he's the one
who broke them.

111
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
hello there.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
who are you?

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,900
i'm horace. whew!

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
and what are you
doing out here?

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
oh, building a place-

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
a little getaway
for me and the missus.

117
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,100
no, i mean,

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,800
sometimes you need a break
from the d.i., you know?

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
the dharma initiative?

120
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,900
i'm not making any sense,
am i?

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
no.

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,500
that's probably because
i've been dead for 12 years.

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,800
hello there.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
you gotta find me, john.

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
you gotta find me.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,700
<i>and when you do,
you'll find him.</i>

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
who?

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,900
jacob.

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,900
he's been waiting for you
a real long time, man.

130
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,400
i'm horace.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
<i>godspeed, john.</i>

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,700
hugo.

133
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
mallomars.

134
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,100
wake up, hugo.

135
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,500
hmm? huh? what?

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,300
time to get up.
we're gonna get going.

137
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,600
i thought we didn't know where
we're going, dude. we do now.

138
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,500
hmm.

139
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
i used to have dreams.

140
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,000
<i>dr. miller, dr. miller,</i>

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,900
<i>please call the switchboard.</i>

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,500
hi, emily.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
mrs. locke,
it's good to see you.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,700
how is he? he's amazing.
he's the youngest preemie

145
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,900
to ever survive in this hospital.

146
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
he's had infections,
pneumonia, you name it.

147
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,000
and every time,
he knocked them out.

148
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,500
he is a fighter,
your little john.

149
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
that's wonderful.

150
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
the other girls say
he's a miracle baby.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,900
and today, we're gonna
take him out of the incubator

152
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,900
so you can hold him
for the very first time.

153
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
i...

154
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,800
i can't do this.

155
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
i...

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,100
i'm sorry. i can't!

157
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,900
so who do i talk to
about adoption?

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,700
you can't smoke in here,
mrs. locke.

159
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,600
oh. of course.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
i'm sorry.

161
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,300
is that the father?

162
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,100
i, uh...

163
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
<i>i don't know who that is.</i>

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,400
can i ask you somethin'?

165
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
sure.

166
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,100
why am i here, man?

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,200
you're here
because you can see the cabin,

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,100
and that makes you special.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,700
well, i have a theory

170
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,600
as to why we're the only ones who
can see it. i'd love to hear it.

171
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,300
i think we can see it
'cause we're the craziest.

172
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
so how'd you figure out
where it was, dude?

173
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,100
i didn't. we're not
going to the cabin.

174
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,600
we're gonna make
a pit stop first.

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
pit stop? where?

176
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,700
you ever wonder what happened
to the dharma initiative, hugo?

177
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
there must have been
at least a hundred of 'em

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,100
living on this island-

179
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,200
manning the stations,
building those homes,

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,900
making all that ranch dressing
that you like.

181
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
and then one day,
they're all gone.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,700
they just disappeared.

183
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,900
you want to know
where we're going?

184
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,900
<i>we're going to see them.</i>

185
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,400
whoa.

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
what happened to 'em?

187
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>he did.</i>

188
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,000
hello!
that game's stupid.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
he's right in here.
come on in.

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,700
melissa, stop that!
come on now.

191
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
take your brother
in the kitchen.

192
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
there's someone here
who wants to see john.

193
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,600
it is coming down
like cats and dogs out there.

194
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
this nice gentleman
wants to talk to you, john.

195
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,300
so i want you on
your best behavior. understand?

196
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,000
he's all yours.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
you like backgammon?

198
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,200
yeah?

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,300
you seem to have
a pretty good sense of the game.

200
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,300
i'm richard, john.

201
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,600
i run a school
for kids who are...

202
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,800
extremely special,

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and i have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,400
mind if i show you
a couple of really neat things?

205
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
did you draw that, john?

206
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
i want you
to look at these things...

207
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,500
and think about 'em.

208
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,400
okay, now tell me, john,

209
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,700
which of these things
belong to you?

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
t- to keep?

211
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,300
no, no, john.

212
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,400
<i>which of these things
belong to you already?</i>

213
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
are you sure the knife
belongs to you, john?

214
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,500
you sure about that?

215
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
well, it doesn't.

216
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
how did he do?

217
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,200
i'm afraid john isn't
quite ready for our school.

218
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,100
i'm sorry
i've wasted your time.

219
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,700
what did you do?

220
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
what's he doing down there?

221
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
so...

222
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,200
this is where you shot locke
and left him for dead, huh?

223
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,300
yes, hugo, i was standing
right where you are now

224
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,700
when i pulled the trigger.

225
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
should have realized at the time
that it was pointless,

226
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
but... i really
wasn't thinking clearly.

227
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,600
is that why you killed
all these people, too?

228
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
i didn't kill them.

229
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,900
well, if the others didn't
wipe out the dharma initiative-

230
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,400
they did wipe them out, hugo,

231
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,000
but it wasn't my decision.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
then whose was it?

233
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
their leader's.

234
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>but i thought
you were their leader.</i>

235
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,500
not always.

236
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,500
the cabin?

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,700
he was building it.

238
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
did you find
what you were looking for?

239
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,700
yes, hugo. i believe i did.

240
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,700
i need your key.

241
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,300
what?

242
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,600
captain.

243
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,200
mayhew just died. doc couldn't
do anything for him.

244
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
the crew's
asking a lot of questions

245
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,200
about what happened to you guys over there.
you tell the crew that i'm dealing with it.

246
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
then you can go gas up
the chopper, frank.

247
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,800
we're going back.
going back? what the hell for?

248
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,700
gas up the chopper, frank.

249
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,900
okay.

250
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,100
listen, martin.

251
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,700
while you were gone, there was
some sort of a sickness. mm-hmm.

252
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,300
the crew-

253
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,100
they've been exhibiting
some very strange behavior.

254
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
regina threw herself overboard,
for god sake.

255
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,800
now i would be derelict
in my duty

256
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,600
if i didn't point out

257
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,800
that this might be exactly what's
happening to you. i appreciate your concern.

258
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,700
give me your key.

259
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,300
that's not the protocol-

260
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900
thank you.

261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
the reason there are two keys

262
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,600
is we're only supposed
to open the safe together.

263
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
you're here, aren't you?

264
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,600
what is that?

265
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,900
it's the secondary protocol.

266
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,900
what does it say?

267
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,200
it says where linus is going.

268
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
how would
mr. widmore know that?

269
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
'cause he's a very smart man,

270
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,000
and if linus knows that
we're gonna torch the island,

271
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
there's only one place
that he can go.

272
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
what do you mean,
"torch the island"?

273
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,700
<i>that was not the agreement.</i>

274
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
i agreed to ferry you here
for an extraction mission.

275
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,400
fix my gun.

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,300
the injured man...

277
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,900
there was no gunshot.

278
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
what do you think
happened to him?

279
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
i don't know.
but when they go back,

280
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,500
they'll be certain it doesn't happen again.
 omar!

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
keamy wants you in the armory.

282
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,900
he said i wasn't supposed to let
those two out of my sight.

283
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,600
i'll watch them. go.

284
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
there's a pantry
below our galley

285
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,100
with enough room for two men.

286
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,200
i've left you a supply of food and water.
you need to go there. michael-is he dead?

287
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,900
no, but not for lack of bloody trying,
 which is precisely why

288
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,700
you two need to be hiding before
keamy comes back on this deck.

289
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,800
hiding is pointless.
give us your zodiac raft

290
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,600
so we can start ferrying people
back here from the beach.

291
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,900
the only way
to save our lives

292
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,600
is to get our people
off that island.

293
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,300
meet me behind the container
in ten minutes.

294
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
the boat will be in the water.

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
cabin's here.

296
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,400
i came from over there.
up the coast.

297
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
here you go.

298
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
drink up, dude.

299
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,900
digging through dead bodies
takes it out of you.

300
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,800
it's gonna be dark soon,
hugo.

301
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,500
if you head that way,

302
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,800
you'll hit the coast,
and all you have to do

303
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,400
is take it north until you
reach our beach. uh, what?

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
i forced you to come with us at
gunpoint, and i'm sorry, hugo,

305
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
but i was led to believe that we
needed you to find this place.

306
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
oh, i get it.
now you got your magic map,

307
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,100
you don't- you don't need me anymore.
 i'm offering you a chance to leave.

308
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,800
i don't want to put you
in harm's way against your will.

309
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
and you think walking
through the jungle

310
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,400
at night by myself is gonna be any safer?
 i'm not sure it is.

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
i think
i'll stick with you guys.

312
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,900
this way?

313
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
what?

314
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,100
<i>he actually thinks
staying was his idea.</i>

315
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,900
not bad, john.
not bad at all.

316
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
i'm not you.

317
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,900
you're certainly not.

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,100
somebody, let me out!
please let me out.

319
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,400
please, somebody, let me-

320
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,800
john, you okay?

321
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,900
i'm fine. i'm fine.

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,900
get to class, ladies.
tardy bell just rang.

323
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
john, you're bleeding.
come on.

324
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,100
let's go to the nurse's office.

325
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
you wanna talk about it?

326
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,800
no.

327
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,700
i know you're probably upset right now,

328
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,500
but i do have some exciting news for you.

329
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,200
i got a call from portland recently.

330
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,300
there's a company up there

331
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,500
doing some very exciting things

332
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,000
in chemistry and new technologies.

333
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,800
they're called mittelos laboratories.

334
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,500
i spoke with a dr. alpert.

335
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,300
he's very interested
in finding young, bright minds

336
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,000
to enter
in these new fields of science.

337
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
they want you to go
to their camp this summer.

338
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
science camp?

339
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,900
yes.

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,800
<i>don't you understand
that things like science camp</i>

341
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
are the reason why
i get stuffed into lockers?

342
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,200
john, this is a great opportunity.
how do they even know about me?

343
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,800
well, they must have sent a rep
to the science fair-

344
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,500
your display at costa mesa.

345
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
i'm not a scientist!

346
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,200
i like boxing and fishing and cars.

347
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,100
i like sports!

348
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
i'm gonna tell you something-

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,900
something i wish someone
had told me at your age.

350
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,200
you might not want to be
that guy in the labs

351
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,600
surrounded by test tubes
and beakers,

352
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
<i>but that's who you are,
john.</i>

353
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you can't be the prom king.

354
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
you can't be
the quarterback.

355
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,600
you can't be a superhero.

356
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,700
don't tell me
what i can't do.

357
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,900
why didn't you tell me?

358
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
tell you what?

359
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,700
that you're a survivor of 815.
aah!

360
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
'cause you
wouldn't have believed me.

361
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,300
you didn't think
i'd believe you?

362
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,700
i tell you that i'm one of
the only people in the world

363
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,000
that think that that plane

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,500
on the bottom of the ocean
is a hoax,

365
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
and you didn't think i'd believe you?
i didn't know if i could trust you.

366
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,600
your boss put that plane there.

367
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,000
man, i thought
i was mr. conspiracy,

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,600
but you got me beat there.

369
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,600
listen to me.
listen to me.

370
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,800
you can't fly that guy back-keamy.

371
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,500
you let me worry about keamy,
all right? you can't fly him back!

372
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,700
he is gonna kill
everyone on that island.

373
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,200
<i>everyone.</i>

374
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,200
and you don't want that
on your conscience, man.

375
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,800
trust me.

376
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,700
hey, boss.

377
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
just getting him
down to the engine room.

378
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,100
stay on a heading
of exactly 3-0-5.

379
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,500
faraday says that's the only
safe way to and from the boat.

380
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,000
what will you tell keamy if he
notices the zodiac is missing?

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
i'll tell him you stole it.
now go.

382
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,100
desmond.

383
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
i can't go with you.
why not?

384
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,700
i've been on that island
for three years.

385
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,900
i'm never setting foot on it again...

386
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,300
not when
penny's coming for me.

387
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,800
i'll be back with the first
group as soon as i can.

388
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,100
stay on that bearing, yeah?

389
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
i will.

390
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
<i>you need to go now.</i>

391
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,100
it should be about 200 yards this way.

392
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,300
you sure it's gonna be there, john?

393
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,300
i'm sorry?

394
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,900
<i>the cabin-
what if it's moved again?</i>

395
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
it hasn't moved

396
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,400
because i was told
that this is where it would be.

397
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
i was told
a lot of things, too-

398
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,000
that i was chosen,
that i was special.

399
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,300
i end up
with a tumor on my spine

400
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,700
and my daughter's blood
all over my hands.

401
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,200
i'm sorry those things
happened to you, ben.

402
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
<i>those things
had to happen to me.</i>

403
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,600
that was my destiny.

404
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,800
but you'll understand
soon enough

405
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
that there are consequences
to being chosen...

406
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,700
because, destiny, john,

407
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,500
is a fickle bitch.

408
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
guys?

409
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,200
cabin.

410
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,700
okay, okay, okay.
good job, man.

411
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,300
good job, john. okay,
we'll try it some more tomorrow.

412
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,400
he's all yours. come on up.

413
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,600
it's all right. come on.

414
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,300
don't give up, mr. locke.

415
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,200
excuse me?

416
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,900
i'm just saying,
don't give up.

417
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
anything's possible.

418
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
you should read my file.

419
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
my spine was crushed.

420
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,000
there's a 98% chance i'll never
get any feeling back in my legs.

421
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
so i don't know
why i'm even trying to-

422
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,300
<i>as a matter of fact,
i did read your file.</i>

423
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,300
you survived falling
eight stories out of a building.

424
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,800
that's a miracle, mr. locke.

425
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,600
let me ask you something.

426
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,000
do you believe in miracles?

427
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
no. i don't believe in miracles.

428
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
you should.

429
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,600
i had one happen to me.

430
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,000
hey, look. i just want
to go back to my room.

431
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,400
you know what you need,
mr. locke?

432
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,700
you need to go on a walkabout.

433
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,000
wha-what's a walkabout?

434
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
it's a journey of self-discovery.

435
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,100
you go out
into the australian outback

436
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,800
with nothing more than a knife
and your wits.

437
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,100
i can't "walkabout" anything.

438
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,600
in case you haven't noticed,
i'm a cripple.

439
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,000
<i>is that what you are,
mr. locke?</i>

440
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,800
i went on my walkabout
convinced i was one thing,

441
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,700
but i came back another.

442
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,500
i found out what i was made of,
who i was.

443
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,600
and here you are,

444
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,100
an orderly.

445
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,800
oh, i'm a lot more
than just an orderly, john.

446
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,200
when you're ready,
mr. locke...

447
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,600
you'll listen
to what i'm saying.

448
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,300
and then when you and me
run into each other again...

449
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
you'll owe me one.

450
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,100
hey, doc.

451
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
wanna hear something weird?

452
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,700
yeah, sure.

453
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,400
you know that morse code message
that i got from the beach?

454
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,100
it said that the doctor
washed up on the shore

455
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,800
with his throat slit.

456
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,400
<i>but i'm the doctor.</i>

457
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,500
crazy, right?

458
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,700
everything here?

459
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,900
yes, sir.

460
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,500
good. get it packed up.

461
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,100
what are you gonna do
with all that?

462
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,200
fire her up, frank.

463
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,400
mr. keamy, i was hired
to fly scientists.

464
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
get your ass in the cockpit
and fire up the chopper, frank.

465
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,300
i'm not taking you.

466
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
i'll kill you, frank.
yeah, well, you do that,

467
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
you'll never get back to the island

468
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,800
'cause i'm the only pilot you got.

469
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,400
sorry, doc.

470
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,100
that change anything, frank?
huh?

471
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,100
another 30 seconds goes by
and someone else's turn-

472
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,100
i fixed your gun.

473
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,700
<i>now stand down, martin,
or i will fire.</i>

474
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,900
i don't think you want
to do that, captain.

475
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,300
what's that on his arm?

476
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,200
what's that on his arm?

477
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
hey!

478
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
what'll it be, frank?

479
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,000
we're flying.

480
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,100
come on.
let's go, boys. come on!

481
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,400
get the rest of the weapons onboard,
and let's go. let's go! let's get out of here.

482
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
let's move out.

483
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,000
thanks, captain.

484
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,600
come on! come on!
come on! come on! let's go!

485
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
hey!

486
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
what did i say to you?

487
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
you told me not to leave my tent.

488
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,300
i was hungry.

489
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,800
jack, you have to rest.
you can't run around.

490
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,900
i know that it is hard
for you to ask for help,

491
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,400
but if you tear
your stitches...

492
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,100
okay. okay. i got it.

493
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,900
doctors make the worst patients.

494
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
jack!

495
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,600
i think they want us to follow 'em.

496
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,500
all right. let's do this.

497
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,700
i'm not going in there
with you.

498
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,000
what?

499
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,700
the island wanted me to get sick,

500
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,400
and it wanted you to get well.

501
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,700
my time is over, john.

502
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
it's yours now.

503
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,800
yeah, i'm cool
with you going in alone, too.

504
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
good luck, john.

505
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,100
are you jacob?

506
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,400
no.

507
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,900
<i>but i can speak
on his behalf.</i>

508
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
well, who are you?

509
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
i'm christian.

510
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,300
you know why i'm here?

511
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
yeah, sure.

512
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,400
do you?

513
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,100
i'm here...

514
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
because i was chosen to be.

515
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
that's absolutely right.

516
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,900
claire?

517
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
hi, john.

518
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,600
what are you doing here?

519
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,700
don't worry. i'm fine.
i'm with him.

520
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,300
wh-

521
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,000
where's the baby?

522
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,500
the baby's where
he's supposed to be,

523
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,400
and that's not here.

524
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
it's probably best

525
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,200
that you don't tell anyone
that you saw her.

526
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,200
why? why is she-
we don't have time for this.

527
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,400
the people from the boat
are already on their way back,

528
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,300
and once they get here,

529
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,600
all of these questions
won't matter one bit.

530
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,600
<i>so why don't you ask the one
question that does matter?</i>

531
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,500
how do i save the island?

532
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,100
did he tell you
what we're supposed to do?

533
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,500
he did.

534
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,700
well?

535
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,500
he wants us
to move the island.

536
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,600
