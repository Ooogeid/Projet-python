<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:02,940
Is that an helicopter?

3
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:04,715
It's how an helicopter suppose to sound?

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:06,634
Get away from her!

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:09,736
Desmond.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,346
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I'm married.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,548
Right.

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,276
You're pregnant.

9
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,167
Good morning, Jack.

10
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:08,203
You need a hand?

11
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:10,396
Thank you.

12
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,475
I came by your tent earlier.

13
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,833
Is Jin gone?

14
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:25,990
He went off with Charlie,
Hurley and Desmond.

15
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:27,709
Did you need him?

16
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,171
Actually, I was looking for you.

17
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,648
I wanted to see how you were doing
with your pregnancy.

18
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,398
I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:40,685
A little tired, but that's normal,
right?

20
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:41,842
Sure.

21
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,039
Any morning sickness?

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,370
Not anymore.

23
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,557
Any bleeding?

24
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,724
Why are you asking me
all these questions, Jack?

25
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,464
I'm just checking in.

26
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:00,438
I mean, now that I'm back, I just...

27
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:02,886
wanted to make sure
that you were doing okay.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Thank you.

29
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:06,933
I'm okay.

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,870
Great.

31
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,691
- Who is she?
- I have no idea.

32
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,512
She seems to know you, dude.
She just said your name.

33
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:44,874
I've never seen her before in my life.

34
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,121
She's waking up.

35
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,846
She's trying to talk.
We should get her some water.

36
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:56,042
Hey, give me a hand.

37
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,054
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

38
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,074
- Spanish, dude.
- What, do you understand her, then?

39
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:12,600
She says she's dying.

40
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,035
My God!

41
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,607
It's a branch!
She must have hit it on the way down.

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,938
Get her pack. We haven't got much
in this first aid kit.

43
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,732
See if there's anything
we can use in it.

44
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,369
What if this is a rescue?
What if she came for us?

45
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,594
Is she gonna be okay?

46
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,023
- We can't let her...
- Just go and start looking!

47
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,747
We get Jack.

48
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,900
We have to get her to Jack
as soon as possible.

49
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,944
- She could be our way off the island.
- If we move her, it'll be worse.

50
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:45,323
We just let her bleed to death?

51
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,145
No, we need to bring Jack here.

52
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,662
It's an 8-hour walk one way!

53
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:50,703
Then I'll run.

54
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,316
You're out of your mind. It's not safe.

55
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:55,902
It's gonna be dark soon.
Who knows who's out in this jungle?

56
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,340
In case you have forgotten,
there're people on this island

57
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,411
- trying to kill us!
- Nobody knows we're here!

58

59
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,008
How's this?

60
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:08,887
That's perfect.

61
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,577
Thank you.

62
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,329
What do you think happened to Jack

63
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,952
while he was with the others?

64
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,365
Since he's been back,
he seems different.

65
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:30,065
He says that he was pretty much
a prisoner,

66
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,429
and the only reason
why he cooperated is 'cause

67
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,534
he thought
they'd let him off the island.

68
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,004
Do you believe him?

69
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:40,702
Why wouldn't I?

70
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,963
He came to me,
asking about my pregnancy.

71
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:49,471
- What would that have anything to do...
- What if...

72
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,355
What if the others want my baby?

73
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,576
He's been there alone for over a week.

74
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,410
How do we know
he isn't working with them?

75
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,515
He's not working with them.

76
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:08,942
Do you know something, Kate?

77
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:19,574
It's Juliet.

78
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,535
She was their doctor... their...
Their fertility doctor,

79
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:24,970
studying pregnant women,

80
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:27,796
and when Claire was sick,
she told me and Jack...

81
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,483
The reason the Others
wanted her baby...

82
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,291
was for research.

83
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,276
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- Go away, Kate.

84
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:49,271
I want to know about your research.

85
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,109
What happens to pregnant women?

86
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,138
You're pregnant.

87
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,177
Are you sure? How do you know?

88
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,037
I asked you a question.

89
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,834
Everyone else might be all right

90
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,330
with you washing your clothes
and eating our food,

91
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,459
but I want to know what's going on.

92
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,025
I want answers.

93
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:14,068
What are you people doing?
Why are you taking children?

94
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:19,248
What happens to pregnant women
on this island?

95
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,652
- What happens... - They die.

96
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:26,386
They all die.

97
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,476
Sun, come on. Let's go.

98
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:43,574
What is she saying?

99
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,806
Chinese... not Korean.

100
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,392
Maybe we should just pull it out.

101
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:50,000
- You'll just make it worse.
- You forgot what's at stake?

102
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,522
Or is this another of your flashes?

103
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:53,001
Who's getting an arrow in the neck?

104
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,377
Unless you forget,
she said my bloody name!

105
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,788
She had a photo of me
and my girlfriend!

106
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,978
Do I understand?
I understand better than all of you!

107
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,065
Hey, guys, chill.

108
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,099
We've wasted enough time already.

109
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:09,295
Hey, you're not leaving us.

110
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,133
Just get out of my way, Charlie.

111
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,427
Who are you?

112
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:35,838
I said, who are you?

113
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,083
He's the guy who shot Sayid.

114
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:43,593
Kate told us he lived out
in that station that Locke blew up.

115
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:45,638
He's an Other.

116
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,530
I thought Locke killed that guy
with the electro-fence thingy.

117
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:53,252
You've got five seconds to talk,
or I fire this gun, brother.

118
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:56,761
That's a flare gun.

119
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,613
And how do you think it'll feel...

120
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,475
Taking a flare to the chest
at this range?

121
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:06,147
As your friend pointed out,
I already died once this week.

122
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:15,442
You understand her.

123
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,935
She's speaking Italian.

124
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,527
She said she's dying. She needs help.

125
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:25,211
I was a soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

126
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:28,989
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

127
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,676
This branch has punctured her lung.

128
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,431
It's filling with blood.

129
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,168
If it is not ventilated soon,
she's going to die.

130
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:50,168
Well, do it. Help her.

131
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,283
If I fix her,

132
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,544
you must let me walk away
as if I never came upon you.

133
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,473
What do you need?

134
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,292
Be quiet. Don't move.

135
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,918
You want me to help you and your baby?
I have answers to your questions,

136
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,089
but you have to come with me right now.

137
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,504
Just you and me, nobody else.

138
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:19,425
If what you said was true,
that means I'm already dead.

139
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,990
Why should I go anywhere with you?

140
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,208
Because there may be hope for you yet.

141
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,360
Where are we going?

142
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,463
There's a medical station near here.
They have an ultrasound machine.

143
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,212
Claire and Kate
told me about that place.

144
00:18:58,498 --> 00:18:59,498
It was abandoned.

145
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,047
They found nothing there.

146
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:03,660
Well, that's because
they didn't know where to look.

147
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,283
What are you going to do to me?

148
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,878
I'm gonna look at your baby
and determine the D.O.C....

149
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,468
Date of conception.

150
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,710
The ultrasound will tell me
when you got pregnant,

151
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:18,866
give or take a day.

152
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,425
If you got pregnant off the island,

153
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,372
then you and your baby
will probably be okay,

154
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,160
but if you got pregnant here...

155
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,260
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

156
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,076
When was the last time
you and your husband had sex?

157
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,836
I would rather not talk about that.

158
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,647
Look, I know that it's personal,

159
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,347
but if I know when,
then I can figure...

160
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,430
Isn't that what the machine will do?

161
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,833
Then let's keep walking.

162
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,057
What else do you know
about this woman?

163
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:57,414
Did she have anything on her
besides the flare gun?

164
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:00,419
Just a book,
a fancy radio/phone thingy...

165
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,062
Does it work?

166
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:06,872
Like I'd tell you.

167
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:09,538
One of you must help.

168
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:12,047
The rest, clear the way.
I need space.

169
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:13,686
I'll do it.

170
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,669
Wipe away as much of the blood
as you can.

171
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,030
We need to evacuate the air now!

172
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:23,498
Hold her steady.

173
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,296
- Steady!
- I heard you.

174
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:33,453
Is that... normal?

175
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,193
Gauze.

176
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,571
Tape it. Be careful.

177
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,865
The covering needs to be hollow.

178
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,098
The wound needs to breathe.

179
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,221
What did she say?

180
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,284
"Thank you."

181
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:06,472
She said,
"thank you for helping me."

182
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:19,526
It's right down here.

183
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:18,873
Why are you doing this?

184
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:21,162
What?

185
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:23,285
Helping me.

186
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,989
Once upon a time,

187
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:39,196
I told women that they were pregnant,

188
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,586
and their faces...

189
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,409
it was the best news

190
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:48,513
they ever got
in their entire life.

191
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,142
Then I came here.

192
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:56,849
I've lost...

193
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:02,995
nine patients in the last three years.

194
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:09,496
I'm helping you
because I want to tell you

195
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:13,179
that you and your husband got
pregnant before you came here.

196
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,217
I'm helping you because
I want to give good news again.

197
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,536
I slept with another man...

198
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:36,151
...before we got to the island.

199
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,901
Jin and I, we were having...

200
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:45,973
trouble.

201
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:47,162
We weren't...

202
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:53,651
and I had a friend.

203
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,162
It was a mistake.

204
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,491
We all make mistakes.

205
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:13,283
Which way?

206
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,008
Will you help me move this forward?

207
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,138
Good.

208
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,353
Why is this room hidden?

209
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,638
Don't worry about it.

210
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:31,401
What is this place?

211
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,285
Tell me!

212
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,358
It's where we brought
the women to die.

213
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:46,856
She's fine.

214
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:49,427
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

215
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,387
She should be better in a day.

216
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,457
A day?
Her lung was punctured.

217
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:59,828
On this island,
the rules are a bit different.

218
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:01,864
Maybe a day and a half.

219
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:08,574
I did as I promised.

220
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:10,836
She will live.

221
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,399
- You can't seriously considering...
- Just go.

222
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,168
Are you kidding?
He's one of them!

223
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,744
So what would you
have me do, Charlie?

224
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:21,537
We've got to make a stretcher
and carry her.

225
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,434
How are we gonna do that
and bring a prisoner?

226
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,395
Give me some rope.
I'll take responsibility.

227
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,442
Phone. Phone!

228
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:29,712
Wait, Jin!

229
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,484
- Jin, it's all right!
- No, let him!

230
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:33,171
- Come back here!
- Let him!

231
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,162
Jin, it's all right! Jin!

232
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:39,551
Let him go.
Jin, let him go!

233
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,852
Phone!

234
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:50,774
You stole this?

235
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:53,025
How could you respect me
if I didn't try?

236
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:56,258
How about I take your other eye?
Would you respect that?

237
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:58,304
Sorry. I...

238
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:00,105
Charlie, don't!

239
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,020
Charlie, let him go!

240
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,889
This is a mistake!
We can't keep letting these people go!

241
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,209
We gave him our word!

242
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:19,454
Go on.
Get out of here.

243
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:43,893
The baby isn't Jin's.

244
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:51,268
We tried to have a baby
back in Korea and couldn't.

245
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And the doctor...

246
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:58,547
he told me Jin was infertile.

247
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:00,962
And then you came here.

248
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,559
What?

249
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:07,766
Did you know that
the average male sperm count

250
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:11,156
is between 60 and 80 million?

251
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,114
But on this island,

252
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,348
it's five times that.

253
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:18,399
We call that good odds.

254
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:22,683
You ready?

255
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,056
Yes.

256
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:28,129
You wanna lift up your shirt a little?

257
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,746
It's cold.

258
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:35,356
Will I see the baby?

259
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,289
Maybe. It's your first trimester,
so it's a little iffy.

260
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,387
If you don't see a heartbeat,
don't worry about it.

261
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:44,606
It's just early.

262
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:48,311
How does it work?

263
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,644
Well, I take a measurement of the fetus,

264
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,911
and that will tell us

265
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,731
when your baby was conceived,

266
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,143
and then we'll know who.

267
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:03,970
Are you okay?

268
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,821
I lose either way.

269
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,496
If I'm going to live...

270
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,519
that means the baby's not Jin's.

271
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,051
Do you still want to do this?

272
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:22,745
Yes.

273
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:27,308
Moment of truth.

274
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:14,122
There it is.

275
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,244
There's your baby.

276
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,627
Can you see?

277
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:23,700
I can see it.

278
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,295
Is it a boy or a girl?

279
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,329
It's... it's a little early,

280
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,101
but...

281
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:34,514
do you see that little flutter?

282
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,606
That's the heart beating.

283
00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:46,109
It's very strong. It's very healthy.

284
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:56,576
You crashed here 90 days ago.

285
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:01,289
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago,

286
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:04,193
so... around 53 days.

287
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,653
You got pregnant on the island.

288
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:17,976
I am sorry. I'm so sorry, Sun.

289
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:20,890
I will do everything that I can.

290
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,722
It's Jin's.

291
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:10,591
So how long do I have?

292
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,465
Most of the women made it into
the middle of their second trimester.

293
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,975
Nobody made it to their third.

294
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:26,610
That gives me two months.

295
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:32,058
I am...

296
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:38,050
very happy the baby's Jin's.

297
00:38:40,097 --> 00:38:41,870
You gave me good news, Juliet.

298
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,650
It was my pleasure, Sun.

299
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,935
I'm gonna go back inside and make sure
that I didn't miss anything.

300
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:55,620
I don't wanna take the chance
that we didn't cover our tracks.

301
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,131
Do you wanna wait out here?

302
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,631
All right.

303
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:13,194
Thank you.

304
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,791
Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.

305
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,567
Kwon is pregnant.

306
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:57,280
The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island

307
00:39:57,382 --> 00:39:58,382
with her husband.

308
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,570
He was sterile before they got here.

309
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:03,394
I'm still working on getting
samples from the other women.

310
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:05,193
I should have Austen's soon.

311
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,394
I'll report back when I know more.

312
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:15,755
I hate you.

313
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,491
You can't trust 'em, you know.

314
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,959
- What's that?
- The others...

315
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,663
The one you let go.

316
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:32,655
He'll be back tomorrow
with five of his mates.

317
00:40:32,895 --> 00:40:34,171
Should've killed him.

318
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,153
Charlie.

319
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:38,253
- Tight.
- Okay.

320
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,067
You know, brother,

321
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:42,004
by my count,

322
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,443
you've killed more of them
than they've killed of you.

323
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,743
They started it.

324
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:50,635
Just 'cause one comes
traipsing back with Jack and Kate

325
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:52,993
doesn't mean that we can
trust them now.

326
00:41:13,452 --> 00:41:14,467
Mom?

327
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:19,862
Where am I?

328
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,078
Take it easy.
You had a giant branch...

329
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,777
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

330
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,072
You're on an island.

331
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,260
Are you here to rescue us?

332
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,942
Are there more of you?
can you make your phone work?

333
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:33,341
Who are you?

334
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:36,504
Hugo Reyes.
I crashed here on Oceanic flight 815.

335
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:38,215
A bunch of us survived.

336
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,692
Is that why you're here?
Were you looking for us?

337
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:42,945
815?

338
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,290
Flight 815? The one from Sydney?

339
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:51,594
No. That's not possible.

340
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:54,430
Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy,
but we found food...

341
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,874
- in the hatch...
- No, flight 815, they...

342
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,437
They found the plane.

343
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:03,401
There were no survivors.

344
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:08,527
They were all dead.

345
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:14,692
What?
