see if aaron's my son.

4

You need to take care of them.

Wouldn't you do anything you
had to in order to keep aaron?

6

- Hello,kate.
- He's with me.

7

He's the one who's trying to take aaron.

8

That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,870
This is happening because they left.

I can bring them back.

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,080
believing that he was dead.

195
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,640
You say you have proof that
he's not. I want to see it.

196
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,550
Why don't you put down the
gun? No one wants it to go off.

197
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,790
How do you know he's alive?

198
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,630
there's someone...

199
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,070
someone here in los angeles.

200
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,310
Let me take you to them,
and I'll show you the proof.

201
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,090
"someone"? Who?

202
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,780
The same person that's gonna shous
how to get back to the island.

203
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,810
Is that what this is about?

204
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,000
- You knew about
this? - No.No,I was--

205
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,470
and that is why you were pretending to care
about aaron,to convince me to go back there?

206
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,170
- I wasn't pretending anything.
- This is insane. You guys are crazy.

207
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,170
- Kate-- -
jack,don't!

208
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,250
Sayid,where areou going?

209
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,190
I don't want any part of this.

210
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,910
And if I see you or him again?

211
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,330
it'll be extremely
unpleasant for all of us.

212
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,630
30 minutes,sun.

213
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,080
We can be there in 30 minutes.

214
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,440
And you'll have proof--
proof that he's alive.

215
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,200
Or you can shoot me and never know.

216
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,260
Let's go.

217
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,530
how far?

218
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,180
It's just over the next ridge.

219
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,840
How you will leave the island?

220
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm not sure yet.

221
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,180
I go with you.

222
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,800
No,no. It doesn't work
like that. It's a 1-man job.

223
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,860
- Why?
- I don't know why,jin. It just is.

224
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,770
But I promise I'll bring sun back.

225
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,940
you okay? You wanna take a break?

226
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,400
- let's just get there.
- Yeah.

227
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,560
So,uh... you speak any other languages?

228
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,980
Just klingon.

229
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,350
dan,is this gonna work?

230
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,110
It--it does make empirical sense that if this started
at the orchid,then that's where it's gonna stop.

231
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,710
But as far as bringing back people who
left in order to stop these temporal shifts,

232
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
that's where we leave
science behind. You okay?

233
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,260
oh,no!

234
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,840
come on!

235
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,270
charlotte!

236
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,500
Charlotte.

237
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,790
Juliet. You have a little...

238
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,580
you,too.

239
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,620
charlotte! Can you hear me?

240
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,390
Charlotte?*******

241
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
what'd she say?

242
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,700
don't let them bring
her back,no matter what.

243
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,570
Don't let them bring her back.

244
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,160
This place is death.

245
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,670
you said we'd be there in 30 minutes.

246
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,950
I didn't account for traffic.

247
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,460
Sun,I'm sorry.

248
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,210
Sorry for what?

249
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,540
For leaving jin behind.

250
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,860
When we landed that
chopper on the boat...

251
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,680
everything was just happening so fast.

252
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,570
I knew he was down below,but I...

253
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,510
should've waited for him.

254
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,350
Why are you telling me this now,jack?

255
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,390
Are you going to ask me not to kill
ben if he's lying about my husband?

256
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,320
After what he just did to kate,
if you don't do it,sun,I will.

257
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,730
what are you doing?

258
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,930
What I'm doing is helping you.

259
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,050
And if you had any idea what
I've had to do to keep you safe,

260
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,620
to keep your friends safe,
you'd never stop thanking me.

261
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,790
You wanna shoot me? Then shoot
me! But let's get on with it.

262
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,490
What's it gonna be?

263
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,820
Drive.

264
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Why can't daddy come with us?

265
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,750
Charlotte,can you hear me?

266
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,460
You know what my mum would say
about me marrying an american?

267
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,680
Yeah,I know more about ancient
carthage than hannibal himself.

268
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,930
What the hell is she talking about?

269
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,830
Have no idea.

270
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,270
Let's go. We have to keep moving.

271
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,600
All right,somebody help me with
charlotte. We're gonna have to carry her,.

272
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,540
no.She's gonna hold us up.

273
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,190
We--we can't
just leave her.

274
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,880
The flashes are getting closer together.

275
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,400
Maybe when your nose starts bleeding,
you'll realize we tta get out of dodge now.

276
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,530
We'll come back for her
just as soon as we can.

277
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,620
No. No way. We're not
gonna leave her behind.

278
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,100
Let them go without me,daniel.

279
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,230
No,charlotte. No. I'm not
gonna leave you behind.

280
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,210
the hell?

281
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,100
- We have to move now!
- He's right. Go.

282
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,070
- Charlotte-- -
just--no,just go!

283
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,800
charlotte... Oh,turn it up.

284
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,840
i love geronimo jackson.

285
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,170
we're running out of time,dan.

286
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,920
Go.

287
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm gonna stay with he

288
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,350
let me ask you something,john.

289
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,100
If we don't even know
when the hell we are.

290
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,070
What happens if the orchid
ain't around anymore?

291
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,340
Look for the well.

292
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,290
You'll find it at the well.

293
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,950
Yeah,we'll be sure and do that.

294
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,820
Let's go.

295
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,160
we're here.

296
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,350
Thank god.

297
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,540
What are the odds that we would end
up in the same time as this thing?

298
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,690
you just had to say somethin'.

299
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,110
How the hell did charlotte
know this was here?

300
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,670
- daniel?
- Yes?

301
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,310
I've been here before.

302
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,370
You've been... you've been here before?

303
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,890
I grew up here,on the island.

304
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,540
mm,there was this thing...
the dharma initiative.

305
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,870
And then I moved away with my mum.

306
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,070
Just my mom,and I
never saw my dad again.

307
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,610
And then when I got back england,w-when
I would ask my mum about this place,yeah?

308
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,620
But she would say that it wasn't
real and that I'd made it up.

309
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,910
that's why...

310
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,040
I became an anthropologist--
to find this island again.

311
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,950
It's what I've been
searching for my whole life.

312
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,290
Charlotte...

313
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,600
why are you telling me this?

314
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,230
Because I remember something now.

315
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,040
when I was little...

316
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,250
living here,there
was this man--

317
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,420
a crazy man-- he
really scared me.

318
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,070
And he told me that I
had to leave the island...

319
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,020
and never,ever come back.

320
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,610
he told me that if I
came b-back,I would die.

321
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,260
Charlotte... I don't understand.

322
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,200
daniel. I... I think that man was you.

323
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,170
You're going down there?

324
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,450
What exactly e you hoping to find?

325
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,980
A way off the island.

326
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,350
You expecting a subway?

327
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:06,140
good-bye,james. Juliet,miles.
I'll see you when I get back.

328
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,220
No. Stop.

329
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,350
You don't bring sun back.

330
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,670
No,I have tobring them all back.
That's--that's how it works.

331
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,780
How you know?

332
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,510
I-I... I just know.

333
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,670
I will cut this.

334
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,910
N-no. You do that,you'll
kill every one of us.

335
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,300
This island is bad.

336
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,280
You don't bring sun back. You promise.

337
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,770
You promise you don't bring my baby!

338
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,340
All right. All right. You have my word.

339
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,540
Promise,john.

340
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,490
I promise.

341
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,560
I won't go to sun,jin,
but she might find me.

342
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,000
If she does,what do I tell her?

343
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,430
You tell her I'm dead.

344
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,950
You say I wash up.

345
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,550
You bu me.

346
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,660
Proof.

347
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,450
I'll be back as soon as I can.

348
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,290
you sure you don't want
us to lower you down?

349
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,120
Where would be the fun in that?

350
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,700
john.

351
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,360
If whatever you're attempting
to do actually works?

352
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,140
Thank you.

353
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,690
You're welcome.

354
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,380
what?

355
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,710
John! Damn it,hold on!

356
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,010
I think you can let go of that now.

357
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,050
No. No! No!

358
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,770
- James,stoP.
- No! No!

359
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,870
James,stop

360
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,730
come on and help me!

361
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,220
JameS.

362
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,550
we can't help him.

363
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,030
hold on. Hold on. It's
okay. Okay. Okay,hold on.

364
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,660
you gotta hold on. stay. Sta
stay with me. just stay,okay?

365
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,800
You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

366
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,010
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

367
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,040
When we were back at the
hatch,I talked to desmond.

368
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,840
I told him to find my mother.

369
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,830
She can help us,charlotte.

370
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,550
She will help us.

371
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,320
How can your mother help us?

372
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,030
She can.
She--

373
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,530
- Listen,listen.
- Yeah?

374
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,500
What?

375
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,030
I'm not allowed to have
chocolate before dinner.

376
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,470
charlotte?

377
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,860
Charlotte?

378
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,550
Charlotte.

379
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,460
no.

380
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,470
james!

381
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,590
Can you hear me?

382
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,480
Can anyone hear me?

383
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,770
who's there?

384
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,190
hello,john.

385
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,470
You?

386
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,680
what are you doing down here?

387
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm here to help you
the rest of the way.

388
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,520
I don't-- I
don't understand.

389
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,120
You came to see me in the cabin.

390
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,350
You asked me how to save the island,
and I told you you had to move it.

391
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,070
I said that you had to move it,john.

392
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,970
but ben said he knew how to do it.

393
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,240
He told me that I had to
stay here and lead his people.

394
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:29,700
And since when did listening to
him get you anywhere worth a damn?

395
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,590
The good news... is
that you're here now.

396
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,220
Are you ready to go?

397
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,140
I-I d--I
don't know...

398
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,480
what to do once I get there.

399
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,720
There's a woman living in los angeles.

400
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,630
And once you get all of
your friends together--

401
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,010
and it must be all of
them,everyone who left.

402
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,170
And once you've persuaded
them to join you...

403
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,540
this woman will tell you
exactly how to come back.

404
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,920
who--who
is she?

405
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,230
Her name is eloise hawking.

406
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,860
What if can only convince
some of them to come back?

407
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,000
I believe in you,john.

408
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,470
You can do this.

409
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,760
richard said I was going to die.

410
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,170
Well,I suppose that's-- that's
why they call it sacrifice.

411
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,960
All right. okay.

412
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,190
oh,yeah,I'm ready.

413
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,190
good.

414
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,340
Now...

415
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,480
On the other side of this column here
is a wheel that slipped off its axis.

416
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,520
And all you have to do
is give it a little push.

417
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,870
could-- could
you help me

418
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,150
*******

419
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,370
*******

420
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,610
say hello to my son.

421
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,170
Who's your son?

422
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,770
May I?

423
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,910
Take it.

424
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,120
how do you have this?

425
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,240
John gave it to me.

426
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,140
You said john never came to see you.

427
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,160
That's true,jack. I went to see hiM.

428
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,670
Jin gave it to him
before he left the island.

429
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,300
Why didn't locke tell me himself?

430
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,950
I don't know.

431
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,860
Maybe he never had a
chance before he died.

432
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,860
I'm sorry I had to bring you
here before I gave it to you,sun.

433
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:50,460
But all those people back on the
island,jin included,need our help.

434
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,710
There is a woman in this church,and she
can tell us how to get back to your husband.

435
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,920
But we're running out of time,
sun,I need you to decide right now.

436
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,780
Will you come with me?

437
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,600
Yes.

438
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,800
what are you doin' here?

439
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,820
I assume the same thing you are.

440
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,900
You're looking for faraday's mother,too?

441
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,370
Hello,eloise.

442
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,020
Hello,benjamin.

443
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,820
I thought I said all of them.

444
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,150
This is all I could get on short notice.

445
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,340
well,I suppose it'll have to do for now.

446
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,600
All right. Let's get started.
