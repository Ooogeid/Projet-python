1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Dude, they'll find out.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,100
Not if we stick to the story.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,530
I don't know, Jack. It could be a risk.

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,270
It's the only way.

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,370
We have to do this. they're still at it, huh?

6
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,330
Look, we're running out of time.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,500
We gotta make a decision now.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,400
So are we all okay with this?

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,870
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm not taking it lightly.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,570
Kate?

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,530
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,670
Sun?

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,100
- Frank?  - What?

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,070
Sorry you got dragged into this, 

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,200
But we need to know that you're with us.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,830
Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,800
Hurley, what about you?

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,670
I don't think we should lie, dude.

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,630
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,000
- How does lying protect them?  - It protects them from Charles Widmore.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,370
The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us.

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,870
He faked a plane crash. I mean, you think telling him the truth, 

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,870
He's just gonna... he's gonna leave them alone?

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,430
Look, he's your dad, right?

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,670
Can't you, like... Call him off?

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,530
There's no calling my father off.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,130
But he'll never find them. I mean, the island disappeared.

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,230
We all saw it. It's gone.

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,170
Bloop!

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,000
You think anyone's gonna believe that...

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,070
Believe any of it?

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,030
They're gonna think you're crazy.

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,430
Not if someone backs me up.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,070
Sayid, come on.

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,330
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,170
But what if we all do?

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,430
And if we can stick together, we can make them believe us.

39
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,270
- I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying. Do you?  - No.

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,630
But...

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,930
I don't believe we have a better choice.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.

43
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,230
You know what, dude?

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,430
I'm gonna remember this.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,870
And someday, you're gonna need my help, 

46
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,970
And I'm telling you right now...

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,670
You're not getting it.

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Wake up, Sayid!

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,370
Sayid!

50
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,670
Sayid, wake up!

51
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,070
Sayid!

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,830
No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,330
What am I supposed to do?!

54
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,930


55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,130
Okay, okay, okay.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,400
Just stay calm.

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,670
What the hell were you thinking?

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,930
- Ana Lucia?  - You were driving like a maniac.

59
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,500
And why'd you pull over?

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,870
I just... I thought...

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,100
You didn't think. What if I were real?

62
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,670
What if a real cop stopped you?

63
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,170
They already have pictures of you covered in blood

64
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,100
- with a gun in your hand.  - Actually, it's ketchup.

65
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,100
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh...

66
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,070
Well, you need to pull it together.

67
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,200
- You've got a lot of work to do.  - I do?

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's start with the basics. First off, you need new clothes.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,370
Then you need to go to a safe place.

70
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,970
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,730
- You getting all this?  - Yeah.

72
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,730
then get to it.

73
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,330
And stay away from the cops.

74
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,170
Do not get arrested.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Thanks, Ana Lucia.

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,970


77
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,100
Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.

78
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,100
Well...

79
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,670
You heard her. 

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,830
- You really think that thing's gonna work? - Rose, I told you a hundred times.

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,630
Of course it's gonna work. Yes. I worked hard on it.

82
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,500
- It's better than rubbing two sticks together.  - Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do with it.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,900
- Yeah? Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?  - Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside.

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,870
- That's gonna smother the leaves.  - Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,130
Fire? Who cares about fire?

86
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,730
Any minute the sky could light up, 

87
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,200
And who the hell knows what could happen this time?

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.

89
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,700
You are either gonna help or be quiet!

90
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,070
- Whose shirt is this?  - It's mine.

91
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,600
- Can I have it?  - What does it matter? We're all gonna be dead by sundown.

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
I'll take that as a "yes, " Frogurt.

93
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,370
- It's Neil.  - Yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,230
Still in one piece?

95
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,270
- As far as I can tell.  - I figured it would've disappeared

96
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,900
- with the rest of our stuff.  - I guess whatever we had with us when we moved

97
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
is along for the ride.

98
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,070
What?

99
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,700
Look who's back.

100
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,600
Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
- I think it's Mr. Wizard.  - Shut up.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
You've been gone for two hours. What the hell were you doing?

103
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,430
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

104
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,400
I... left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,470
And I... I just... it was a while before I realized

106
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,600
that I was just... Uh, I was really lost.

107
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,630
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,500
- I don't know.  - Well, you at least got a plan?

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
I think we should take the zodiac, 

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,530
- Head to a shipping lane.  - No. No, no, no. We can't just sail out on any course.

111
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,000
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, 

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,970
And, uh, to do that...

113
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,370
I need to determine where we are now...

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,570
Time.

115
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,900
And what are the rest of us supposed to do?

116
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,800
- I'm gonna go find us something to eat.  - And how are you planning on doing that?

117
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't worry about it.

118
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,030
I guess we'll get the water.

119
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,830
Dude, wake up!

120
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,430
Come on. I can't do this on my own!

121
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,530
I promise I'll pay you back.

122
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,170
Wait right here.

123
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,870
# They're waiting for me #

124
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,700
# They're looking for me #

125
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,470
# Every single night #

126
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,770
# They're driving me #

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,330
# Insane #

128
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,200
# Those men inside #

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,730
# My brain #

130
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,070
Shih tzus?

131
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,770
I like shih tzus.

132
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,370
It looks like you "heart" them.

133
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,600
- # The dream police... #  - Rough night?

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,830
- # They come to me in my bed #  - Yeah.

135
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,070
Your friend's pretty wasted.

136
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,330
Yeah.

137
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,270
I know you from somewhere, don't I?

138
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,430


139
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,930
- No.  - I think I do.

140
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,600
- Yeah, you definitely look familiar.  - I just have one of those faces.

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,870
You're lying.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,630
I don't believe in lying.

143
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,730
I remember!

144
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,130
You're the guy who won the lottery...

145
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,400
And you crashed in that plane.

146
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,130
- No. I must look like him.  - You're him. Hey! Buy a ticket here.

147
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,870
If you win, we get a commission. You're good luck.

148
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,470
Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change. 

149
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,600


150
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,070


151
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,770
Okay.

152
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,330
Okay, we're outta here.

153
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,270
Mommy, I wanna go home.

154
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,800
Look at your book, baby.

155
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,400


156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,600


157
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400


158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,830


159
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,700
Hello?

160
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,030
I... I can't believe it's you.

161
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,170
No. Hi.

162
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,300
How are you?

163
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,900
Wait, you're in L.A.?

164
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,370
Of course I can meet, yeah. What...

165
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,170
I know exactly where that is. I'll be there in half an hour.

166
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,630


167
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,530
Mommy, we are we going?

168
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,670
To see a friend.

169
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,830


170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,770
You looking for your pills, Jack?

171
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,270
I flushed them down the toilet.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,970
Thank you.

173
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,530
I was just gonna do that myself.

174
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,130
Yeah, I figured you were.

175
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,600
Going somewhere?

176
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,230
I'm checking out.

177
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,000
Where are we going?

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,100
You're going home. And find yourself a suitcase.

179
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,570
If there's anything in this life you want, 

180
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,970
Pack it in there...

181
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,900
Because you're never coming back.

182
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Good. 

183
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,030
Good.

184
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,470
I'll pick you up in six hours.

185
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,370
And where will you be going?

186
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,000
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,970
I need to move it somewhere safe.

188
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,000
Safe?

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,470
He's dead, isn't he?

190
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,130
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.

191
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,570
Mmm.

192
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,230
Mmm.

193
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,730
Previously on "expose"...

194
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,870
It looks like the scorpion is taking over

195
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,930
all the cobra's business.

196
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,470
you want me to work with Tsunami, 

197
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,470
- The dragon lady of Van Nuys?  - Yeah.

198
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm here to capture the scorpion, 

199
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,430
so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work stage 3. 

200
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,100
She's hit!

201
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,930


202
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,630


203
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,570


204
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,400


205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,430
Hmm.

206
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,900


207
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,670
Hey, dad.

208
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,700
How's it going?

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
- Have you seen the news?  - No. I just got up.  - Why, are you wanted again?

210
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,140
Uh, yeah. Kinda.

211
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,100
- Is mom here?  - No, she's out shopping.  - hey, set him over.

212
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,870
- Oh, man, he's out.  - Is he... Breathing?

213
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,000
Barely. What happened?

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,440
- He got shot by a dart.  - A dart? What, were you in the zoo or something?

215
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,140
- No, we were at the safe house.  - The safe house?

216
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,170
Sayid took me there to protect me.

217
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,840
Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts. 

218
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,600
- And now he's... he's in a coma or something.  - Hugo, this doesn't make sense.

219
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,700
And what are you doing out of the mental institution?

220
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,270
Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. We both are.

221
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,570
Danger from who?

222
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm not sure exactly.

223
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000


224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,640
Hello?

225
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,600
Mr. and Mrs. Reyes?

226
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,440
L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?

227
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,570
- Just what kind of trouble are you in?  - Dad, please! Just don't tell 'em I'm here!

228
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,400
All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.

229
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,300
Well, give us a call if you hear anything.

230
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,500
You killed three people?

231
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,940
- No. Sayid did.  - Oh. Well, that's better.

232
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,400
Come on. Let's get him to the couch.

233
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,370
- He saved me.  - I think we should call a lawyer right now.

234
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,000
No, no, no. We can't go public. They're after us.

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,040
Who? Who is after you?

236
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,100
I don't know. Sayid knows. He can explain.

237
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,140
Sayid ain't explaining nothing.

238
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,500
We need to get him to a hospital.

239
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,070
Did you not hear me? People are trying to kill us.

240
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,970
We go to a hospital, they'll find us!

241
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,240
Like... like "the godfather". It's the last place you go.

242
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,070
Everyone knows it. They... they smother you with pillows

243
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,770
and make it look like an accident.

244
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,700
- Sayid, please wake up!  - That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.

245
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,840
I think I know what to do.

246
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,770


247
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,670
Mommy, mommy, can I push the button?

248
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,170
Sure you can, sweetie.

249
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,170
But we're all the way to the top, okay?

250
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,140
So I want you to press number 3-1. You see it?

251
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,170
You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.

252
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,670


253
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,700
Yeah! That's the one!

254
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,900
You pressed it! You pressed it!

255
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200


256
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,770


257
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,540
Hi.

258
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,700
Hello, Kate.

259
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,700
Have a nice day.

260
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,170
I'll be right with you.

261
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,300


262
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800


263
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,900
Hello, Ben.

264
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,100
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.

265
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,840
No, no porterhouse.

266
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,540
I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, 

267
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,740
And I need you to watch it for me.

268
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,940
- Is it what I think it is?   - It is.

269
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,340
He'll be safe with me.

270
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,700
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?  - Yeah. Everything's moving right on schedule.

271
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,470
- How's it going with Shephard?  - He's with us.

272
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,800
- Really? What'd you do? Bribe him with some pills?  - Cut the man some slack.

273
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,270
He's been through a lot. We all have.

274
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,540
Right. Of course.

275
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,070
Sorry.

276
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,400
So keep him safe, Jill.

277
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,540
Because if you don't...

278
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,800
... everything we're about to do...

279
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,000
... won't matter at all.

280
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,940


281
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,500


282
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,640
Aah! Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it!

283
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,000
- You got it. You got it.  - All right! Finally we got...

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,870
Why did you do that?

285
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,540
- Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.  - I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.

286
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,370
- And I thought you said you didn't care.  - I care about surviving.

287
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,040
I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.

288
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,300
- You'll get it, Bernard. You will.  - Yeah. All right.

289
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,740
Just... just try again.

290
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,970
Hey.

291
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,040
Hey.

292
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Give me one second.

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,040
I got you something.

294
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,240
Ooh. Hey.

295
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,200
I found these in the jungle.

296
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,970
- Look at that. Thank you.  - There was only two, 

297
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,000
- But I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.  - Thank you very much, very much.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,140


299
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,300
You all right?

300
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,470
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.

301
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Well... I'm sure it'll pass. 

302
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,770
No, it's not just that.

303
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,840
It's the weirdest thing. Earlier, I was...

304
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,040
I was thinking about my mom, 

305
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,300
and all of a sudden, I... I couldn't remember her maiden name.

306
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I mean, isn't that odd?

307
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,040
Don't worry about it.

308
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,200
Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress. Okay?

309
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,800
Daniel...

310
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,840
Do you know what's happening to me?

311
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,600
Dinner!

312
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,000
That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
I found it. 

314
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
What do you mean you "found" it?

315
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,470
It died in the jungle. I found it.

316
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,070
Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.

317
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,100
What?

318
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,770
Who's got a knife?

319
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,940
A knife? You need a knife?

320
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,040
- Oh, it's over by the cuisinart next to the stove.  - What's your problem?

321
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
My problem is, we don't have a knife.

322
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,170
W... we don't have anything.

323
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,770
And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 

324
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,940
- Because Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.  - Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.

325
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,100
It's Neil, you inbred.

326
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
And I'm not gonna ease up, 

327
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,170
Because I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed!

328
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,570
- We're all screwed!  - Calm down, Neil.

329
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,970
- We're gonna get through this.  - How are any of us gonna get through this?!

330
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,140
Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!

331
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,470
Aah!

332
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,940


333
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,770
Run!

334
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,100
Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!

335
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,470
Ow! Dan!

336
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,370
Keep moving!

337
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,470
Aah! Uhh!

338
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,170
Uhh! Uhh!

339
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,470
Come on. He's dead.

340
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,540
Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!

341
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,170
There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!

342
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,700
Dude, the cops are on a stakeout?

343
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,000
You just escaped from a mental institution.

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,200
There's dead bodies everywhere! Of course they're on a stakeout!

345
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,900
They think you're crazy enough to come back home.

346
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,940
So... so are you...

347
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,800
... crazy?

348
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,370
Do you think I am?

349
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,300
Well, either that or you're lying to me.

350
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm not crazy, 

351
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,470
and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.

352
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,600
Well...

353
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,170
... well, what is it?

354
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,470
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?!

355
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,340
He's not dead, ma.

356
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,100
Well, he's not breathing.

357
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,640
He's not?!

358
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,300
It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.

359
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,240
A plan? What are you talking about?

360
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,770
He is breathing... Kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.

361
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,340
Hugo, what's happening?

362
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,770
- Mom, please!  - No "mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news?

363
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,740
- Do you know what they are telling about you?  - Yeah, mom. I know.

364
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,470
- Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.  - It better!

365
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,400
Officers.

366
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,870
So how long are you in L.A.?

367
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,500
Just a few days.

368
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,970
I have some business to attend to.

369
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,400
But I wanted to see you.

370
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,140
Here it is.

371
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,500
Her name's Ji Yeon. Here's a baby picture.

372
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh! She's beautiful.

373
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Thank you. She's with her grandmother in Seoul.

374
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,840
I hope someday you get to meet her.

375
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,300
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.

376
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,670
Yeah.

377
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,200


378
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,440
Kate? Are you all right?

379
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,970
Yeah. I'm fine.

380
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,400
Are you?

381
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,900
Somebody knows we're lying.

382
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,270
What?

383
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,240
Some lawyers came to see me.

384
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,270
Who?

385
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,570
Two men. They came to my house.

386
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,100
And they asked for a blood sample.

387
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,470
Some kind of lawsuit.

388
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,170
They wanted to test to see if...

389
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,200
To see if Aaron's my son.

390
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,870
Who did these lawyers represent?

391
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,840
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me who their client is.

392
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,200
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.

393
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,370
How do you know?

394
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,870
Because if they were, they would just do it.

395
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,970
They wouldn't come to you in private.

396
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,900
They don't care that we're lying. They just want Aaron.

397
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,500
But who... who would do that? We...

398
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,570
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.

399
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,100
What do you mean, take care of them?

400
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,970
Wouldn't you do anything you had to

401
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,440
in order to keep Aaron?

402
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,740
What kind of a person do you think I am?

403
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,500


404
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,370
Jin! Jin!

405
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,800
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.

406
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,470
You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin.

407
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,370
Like you did on the freighter.

408
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,000
You told me to get on the helicopter, 

409
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,470
- and you said you'd get Jin.  - We gotta get outta here!

410
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,640
Sun, I hope you don't think...

411
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,270
But you did what you had to do.

412
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,740
And if you hadn't...

413
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,470
we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.

414
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm so sorry. I...

416
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,700
I don't blame you.

417
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,740
So...

418
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,600
How's Jack?

419
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,600
Hugo said I could trust you.

420
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,200
I wasn't so sure. But he swore I could, so...

421
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,040
Can I?

422
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,800
Yes. Of course.

423
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,270
All right.

424
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,700
What happened to him?

425
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,140
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.

426
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,300
Must've been some drugs or something.

427
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,800
- And where is Hurley right now?  - At our house, freaking out.

428
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,340
Let me get my car. Help me move him over.

429
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,470
I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.

430
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,340
No. No, Hugo said that whoever did this...

431
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,500
- they'll come back after him.  - All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, 

432
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
- So I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.  - All right, fine. Take him to the hospital.

433
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shepherd, 

434
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,300
- When this is over, you're gonna do something for me.  - What?

435
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,740
Stay away from Hugo. Whatever it is you talked him into, 

436
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,400
something tells me

437
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,900
you don't have his best interests at heart.

438
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,200
So stay away from my son.

439
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,870
Hello?

440
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,170
Ben...

441
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,100
You'll never guess who just showed up

442
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
Who?

443
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,040
Sayid.

444
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,500
Who is Sayid?

445
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,870
I thought he was your friend.

446
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,540
He is my friend...

447
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,500
But he's also got this double life

448
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,800
where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.

449
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
But he's a good guy.

450
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,170
A good guy doesn't kill three men.

451
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,000
A good guy doesn't kill any men.

452
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,500
- Mom...  - Don't "mom" me.

453
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,170
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.

454
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,670
The news thinks you did this.

455
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,200
And if the news does, everyone does.

456
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,970
Why is this happening?

457
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,440
How can anybody want to hurt you?

458
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,400
I don't know.

459
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,700
Tell your mother the truth.

460
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,740
We lied, ma.

461
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,370
What do you mean you lied?

462
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,370
All of us... the oceanic six, 

463
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,070
we lied about what happened after the crash.

464
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,000
And what did happen?

465
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,670
Okay.

466
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,240
See, we did crash, 

467
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,640
but it was on this crazy island.

468
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,100
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.

469
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,070
And there was a smoke monster, 

470
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,600
and then there were other people on the island.

471
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,640
We called them the others, and they started attacking us.

472
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,670
And we found some hatches, 

473
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,100
and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...

474
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,570
Well, I was never really clear on that.*

475
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,040
But... the others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.

476
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,070
That was the dharma initiative. But they were all dead.

477
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,600
The others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us.

478
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,070
And then we teamed up with the others

479
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,940
because some worse people were coming on a freighter.

480
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,840
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.

481
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,570
So we stole their helicopter

482
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,640
and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up.

483
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,840
And we couldn't go back to the island

484
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,500
because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, 

485
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
and we floated there for a while

486
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,640
until a boat came and picked us up.

487
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,100
And by then, there were six of us. That part was true.

488
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,100
But the...

489
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,300
but the rest of the people...

490
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,800
who were on the plane,

491
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,240
they're still on that island.

492
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,800
I believe you.

493
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,400
I don't understand you, 

494
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,870
but I believe you.

495
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,970
A lot of people died, ma.

496
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,640
And now this bad stuff is happening because...

497
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,270
Well, um... 

498
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,470
We shouldn't have lied.

499
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,540
Ow!

500
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,100
You okay?

501
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,070
Yeah,I'm fine. I just stepped on something.

502
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,970
Something jammed...

503
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,570
Son of a bitch.

504
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,570
We should keep moving.

505
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,040
We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.

506
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,970
- It's a long creek,James. Which part?  - I don't know...the wet part.

507
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,970
Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan...

508
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,900
Who were those people? Are they yours?

509
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,140
- Did they shoot the arrows?  - You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?

510
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,300
You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying...

511
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,840
Aah!

512
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,000
Hey!

513
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,640
What are you doing on our island?!

514
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,740
Come on.

515
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,370
Son of a bitch.

516
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,470
Come on, Sayid.

517
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,100
Come on.

518
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,270
Say...

519
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,740
Sayid.

520
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,100
It... it's... It's Jack.

521
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Hey! Uhh!

522
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,900
It's okay. It's all right.

523
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,240
U're okay. You're all right.

524
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,970
Ahh.

525
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,640
What happened?

526
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,170
You're fine. You're in the hospital.

527
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,500
Hurley's father brought you to me.

528
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,770
Hurley's father?

529
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,900
Sayid, you've been attacked.

530
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,840
Where's Hurley?

531
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,770
He's at his parents' house.

532
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,340
Who's with him?

533
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,970
I don't know. His mother, maybe?

534
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,570
Does anyone else know he's there?

535
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,940
Aah!

536
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,440
Aah.

537
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,200
Hello,Hugo.

538
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,040
Aah!

539
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,940
Get away from me.

540
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,270
Get away!

541
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,570
Hugo,I know you're in trouble,

542
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,070
And I can assure you I've taken care of everything.

543
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,300
I have a car waiting for us out back.

544
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,400
The police didn't see me come in.

545
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,370
I can get you out of here.

546
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,470
No way,dude.

547
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,440
Sayid warned me about you.

548
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,870
I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack.

549
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,100
That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me.

550
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,840
How else would I know that they're together?

551
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,100
No.

552
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,570
You're... you're playing one of your mind games.

553
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,300
They would never trust you.

554
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,870
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.

555
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,470
But they came around

556
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,470
When they realized that we all want the same thing.

557
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,040
And what's that?

558
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,200
To go back to the island.

559
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,140
Come with us, Hugo...

560
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,740
And this'll be over. You can stop hiding.

561
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,770
You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions.

562
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,840
If you come with me,

563
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,270
You won't ever have to lie again.

564
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,570
Please.

565
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,600
Let me help you.

566
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,040
Never, dude.

567
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,240
Hey! Hey,you got me!

568
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,700
- That's right, you got me! That's right! I'm the killer!  - Stop! Police!

569
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,500
- Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees!  - I'm the killer. I'm crazy.

570
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm a murderer. I killed four people... Three people.

571
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,640
However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them.

572
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,870
I killed them all. J... just... just get me away from here.

573
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,440
You have the right to remain silent.

574
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,940
Anything can and will be used against you in a court of law.

575
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,640
You have the right to speak to an attorney

576
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,840
- And to have one present during any questioning...  - Just get me out of here.

577
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,740
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.

578
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm gonna make this quite simple for you.

579
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,670
You're gonna tell me what you're doing,

580
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,600
How many of you there are and how you got here. Let her go.

581
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,240
Unlessyou're answering my questions, don't speak.

582
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,240
- I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand.  - What?!

583
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
- Other?  - The first one isn't negotiable.

584
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,900
It's just to illustrate how serious I am.

585
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,500
No! Hold on! Hold on! Chill out! We're not supposed to be here.

586
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,740
Something's happening to the island.

587
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,970
- There are these flashes...  - Do it!

588
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,640
No! Wait a second! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!

589
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
- Do it!  - No!

590
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,670
Uhh!

591
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,040
Uhh! Uhh!

592
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,670
James. Juliet.

593
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,770
Nice to see ya.

594
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,800
Any luck?

595
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,300
Yes.

596
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,570
Really?

597
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,470
Really.

598
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,340
What about you?

599
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm having some... difficulties.

600
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Well, you better get busy...

601
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,300
Because you only have 70 hours.

602
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,670
No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least...

603
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,670
What you need is irrelevant.

604
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,140
70 hours is what you've got.

605
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,300
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.

606
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,170
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?

607
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,970
Then god help us all.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
