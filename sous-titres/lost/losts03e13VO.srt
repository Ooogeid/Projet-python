00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,628
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:04,176
I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:05,879
This island, it changed me.

4
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,029
It made me whole.

5
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:09,213
I'm so thankful for you, John.

6
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,127
You stole my kidney.

7
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,422
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney,

8
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:15,014
and that's what happened.

9
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:16,276
Get over it.

10
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:17,784
I don't care what Jack said.

11
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,297
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

12
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,671
How did you get onto this island?

13
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,291
They brought me on the submarine.

14
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:26,469
So your people-- they can just come
and go whenever they want?

15
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,247
You never know
when a little c4 might come in handy.

16
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:41,516
Name?

17
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:43,357
John Locke.

18
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,953
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

19
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,327
Single.

20
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:49,876
Girlfriend?

21
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:55,556
Are your parents living?

22
00:00:57,028 --> 00:01:00,253
I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,311
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

24
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:09,813
I don't see how that's relevant.

25
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,153
It's relevant, Mr. Locke,
because if the government's

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,616
gonna continue paying
your disability insurance,

27
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:17,710
I have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

28
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,767
So... How's your appetite?

29
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,866
Fine.

30
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:30,360
I see you stopped submitting
your therapy bills for reimbursement.

31
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:32,252
It's 'cause I stopped going.

32
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:34,798
Waste of time.

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,052
It's just a temporary suspension,
Mr. Locke.

34
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:46,056
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can reapply.

35
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,158
You think I'm temporarily disabled?

36
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,097
Depression can be temporary, yes.

37
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,973
And since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

38
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,748
Guess I am.

39
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,174
Next!

40
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,525
Over here!

41
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:24,505
What is he doing?

42
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:29,809
Good hands!

43
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,542
Nice.

44
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,120
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

45
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,236
What's up?

46
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,643
I think it's gonna be a while...

47
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:56,884
Hey, what?

48
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,518
John, Rousseau's gone.

49
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,293
This is gonna be more complicated
than we thought.

50
00:03:52,567 --> 00:04:06,060
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:11,005
So you saying, we simply start
shooting people and hope for the best?

52
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,246
We came here to rescue Jack,
and we're gonna do it.

53
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,170
But obviously
the circumstances have changed.

54
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,279
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him.

55
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:18,335
That's not Jack.

56
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,822
They must have done someûthing to him.
When they captured us, they drugged us.

57
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,973
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.

58
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,709
- He wouldn't just forget that.
- I agree,

59
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,094
but until we know why,
we're putting our lives at risk.

60
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:30,235
I'm not leaving him, Sayid.

61
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,141
- We may not have a choice.
- It's Jack.

62
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,344
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life

63
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,830
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

64
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,516
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

65
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,959
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

66
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,123
What do you suggest?

67
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,964
We wait till it's dark.
We approach Jack when he's alone...

68
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,170
And if he wants out, we get him out.

69
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,732
<i>Here's what we know, Crystal.</i>

70
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:06,899
<i>The bolivian coal deposits
were stolen last night around 2:00 a.m.</i>

71
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,960
<i>Oh, that means the cobra...
he's back.</i>

72
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,266
<i>Has he been shot?</i>

73
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,502
<i>I can't find him!</i>

74
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,354
<i>He's armed! I can't get up!</i>

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,152
Hello. John Locke?

76
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,507
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

77
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:31,285
- I have a sign.
- I'm not trying to sell you...

78
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,121
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

79
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:36,382
I just need
a couple minutes to talk to you.

80
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,483
Talk about what?

81
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,672
My mother, actually.

82
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,252
I think she might be in some trouble.

83
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:43,864
You got the wrong John Locke.

84
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,560
How many kidneys do you have?

85
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,132
She met him two months ago.

86
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:54,446
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

87
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,282
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

88
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,611
His name's Adam Seward.

89
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:02,752
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

90
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,763
Anyway, Adam had something... special.

91
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,818
My mom just went gaga for him
right out of the gate.

92
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:15,135
After two months of knowing him,
she agree to marry the guy.

93
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:16,948
And something about him...

94
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,436
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

95
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,376
so I had to check him out.

96
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:27,046
Well, I'm not sure I know
what any of this has to do with me.

97
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,710
Well, what this has to do
with you, Mr. Locke,

98
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:33,811
is that you donated
one of your kidneys to Adam Seward,

99
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:36,617
only his name was different back then.

100
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,635
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

101
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,144
All I could find
were his medical records,

102
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:53,896
and I saw that he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from... You.

103
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,349
So I figured, hey,

104
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:59,249
someone gave the guy his kidney.
How bad could he be?

105
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,043
Right?

106
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:11,742
Well, it-- it was an anonymous donation.

107
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:12,809
I never met him.

108
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:19,575
Are you sure?

109
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:21,676
Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

110
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,346
Sayid, you guard the front.

111
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,795
I'll go around and cover the back.

112
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:12,347
- You head in through the side door.
- I'm going in alone?

113
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,840
It's better
if you're the first one he sees.

114
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,011
All right.

115
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,762
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,061
I came to get you.

117
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,516
Get out of here

118
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,814
right now. Go.

119
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,136
Kate, they're watching me!

120
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,091
- Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

121
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,645
- Yes, you are!
- Get down!

122
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,202
Don't hurt her!

123
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,418
Step back, doc.

124
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:57,807
Step back.

125
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:02,776
Hold him still.

126
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:06,897
Who else is with you?

127
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,057
Just answer the question, Kate.

128
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:17,908
Okay, one more time--

129
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,716
who else is with you?

130
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,754
Nobody.

131
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,256
Nobody else. It was just us.

132
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,435
Keep your voice down.

133
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,568
All right.

134
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,738
It's all right, John.

135
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,677
You don't have to point the gun at me.

136
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,289
I can tell you where Jack is.

137
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,850
I'm not looking for Jack.

138
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,018
I'm looking for the submarine.

139
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,001
The submarine...

140
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:30,749
where is it?

141
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,857
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

142
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,427
What submarine?

143
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,194
The one you use
to travel to and from the island...

144
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,374
The one your man Mikhail told me about

145
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,263
right before I killed him.

146
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,721
Dad? Who are you talking to?

147
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:47,110
Alex, don't come in here!

148
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,295
Tell her to be quiet.

149
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,407
Alex, please.

150
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,259
Ben, you awake?

151
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,264
I'm coming in.

152
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:07,921
What is it?

153
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:09,792
It's Austen and Jarrah.

154
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,445
They're here. Somehow they found us.

155
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:14,719
Where are they now?

156
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,326
We captured them.
We're holding 'em over at my place.

157
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,518
Want me to help you get out--

158
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,933
Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

159
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,837
What about Juliet and Shepard?

160
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,933
- Tomorrow--
- Let me worry about that. Just go.

161
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:25,934
Got it.

162
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:27,962
Richard, wait a minute.

163
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:28,988
I'll wait outside.

164
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:37,401
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

165
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,149
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it. Now.

166
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:55,381
"The man from Tallahassee"?
What is that...

167
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:56,637
Some kind of code?

168
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,995
No, John, unfortunately,
we don't have a code

169
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:02,146
for "there's a man in my closet
with a gun to my daughter's head,"

170
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,065
although we obviously should.

171
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,349
He had a pack with him.

172
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,296
I want her to retrieve it.

173
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,206
Okay.

174
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,359
But you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me,

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,865
so I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option--

176
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:20,866
Dad!

177
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
I'll get your bag.

178
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,563
No, nothing particular.

179
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,991
I'm looking for something
really stunning,

180
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,644
something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

181
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,102
Honey?

182
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,030
What do you think of this one?

183
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,494
Oh, it looks good. What do you think?

184
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:49,959
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

185
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:57,433
Larger would be good.

186
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,182
I'll go over there and take a look.

187
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,133
Hello, John.

188
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:12,239
Gonna be a big to-do or just
the two of you and a preacher?

189
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,919
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?
That would make for...

190
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:17,923
awkward introductions.

191
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,241
How did you even know that I...

192
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,703
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

193
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,613
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof.

194
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:30,169
So he came to me
hoping I would vouch for you.

195
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:32,649
What did you say to him?

196
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:37,200
You're conning her, aren't you?

197
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:41,025
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

198
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:43,543
What is it you want, John?

199
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:44,955
I want you to end it.

200
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:48,136
I want you to call off the wedding.

201
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:50,971
Why are you doing this?

202
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,363
Because it's not fair.

203
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:56,713
You make people think
that you're their family,

204
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,244
and then you leave their life in ruins,

205
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,709
and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

206
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,656
You're gonna call off your engagement
and go,

207
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,432
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

208
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:12,757
I want to hear you say it.

209
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,278
You say you're gonna leave.

210
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:23,643
Okay, John.

211
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:25,997
You got it.

212
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,676
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

213
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,615
No tricks, I promise.

214
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,169
I just want some dignity.

215
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:58,784
You of all people should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

216
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,948
Thank you.

217
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:13,654
So tell me, John,

218
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,183
how do you expect to pilot
our submarine?

219
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,793
I mean, it's a complicated
piece of machinery.

220
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,034
You don't just press "submerge."

221
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,701
I'll figure something out.

222
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:26,691
For all you know,
I was a commander in the navy.

223
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,870
Put your arm around my neck.
I'll lift under your knees.

224
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:35,391
What's in the pack, John?

225
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,239
If you've met Mikhail, that means

226
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:40,189
you were in the communications
station...

227
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,270
Which means you found the explosives.

228
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,218
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

229
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,896
You're planning to destroy it.

230
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,272
I know you, John Locke.

231
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:04,933
You don't know me at all.

232
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,696
I know you were born in California.

233
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:12,167
I know you were raised in foster care.

234
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,845
I know you wasted
a big part of your life in Tustin

235
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:19,160
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

236
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,281
I know you spent the four years

237
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,264
prior to your arrival on this island
in a wheelchair.

238
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,181
And I know how you ended up in it.

239
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:39,902
Tell me, John...

240
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,182
Did it hurt?

241
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:52,447
I felt my back break.

242
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:56,700
What do you think?

243
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,323
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon, Kate.

244
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:31,023
Be careful in here.

245
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:33,672
Thanks.

246
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:53,926
Did they hurt you?

247
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,645
Did they hurt you?

248
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,105
What is all this?

249
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,748
This is where they live.

250
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,807
And the people they took?

251
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:18,277
The kids?

252
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
They're all safe.

253
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,231
"Safe"?

254
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,534
So you're with them now?

255
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,504
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

256
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,291
What did they do to you?

257
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,897
- Nothing.
- Then why are you acting like this?

258
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:48,056
There's no way...

259
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,534
You... There's no way that I could...

260
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:51,778
I came here to help you!

261
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:52,875
So why don't you tell me...

262
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,098
I told you not to come back here for me.

263
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,132
I didn't think you meant it.

264
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:37,904
What did they do to you, Jack?

265
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:46,039
I made a deal with them.

266
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,151
They're gonna let me go.

267
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,069
Where?

268
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,958
Home.

269
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
When?

270
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,642
First thing in the morning.

271
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:14,998
I can bring back help.
It's our best chance.

272
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:16,305
You trust these people?

273
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:17,913
They are liars. Why would you believe...

274
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:20,358
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate...

275
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:25,057
When you asked me
to save Sawyer's life.

276
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:35,974
What did they tell you?

277
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:43,754
Jack, we need to go.

278
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,331
I'll be right there.

279
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:00,603
I asked you not to come back here
for me, and I wish...

280
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,777
I wish that you hadn't.

281
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:14,193
But I will come back here for you.

282
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,253
John Locke?

283
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,430
Detective Mason.

284
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,500
That's detective Reed. Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

285
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:54,533
No, of course not.

286
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:56,489
Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

287
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,420
No, I don't think so.

288
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,616
Thin, brown hair, 20.

289
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:06,292
If it'll be helpful,
we believe he was here

290
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,787
in your apartment two days ago.

291
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:11,081
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

292
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,984
I sent him away.

293
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:16,823
Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

294
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,753
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

295
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,949
Well, I...
Look, I told you I don't know him.

296
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:26,141
Then why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

297
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:31,865
Why were you... would you be
looking through his pockets?

298
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:33,953
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

299
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:42,257
It wasn't easy, you know...

300
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,507
Being in that hatch with you
all that time...

301
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,150
Knowing you had no business
walking around,

302
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,042
knowing I couldn't even ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

303
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:54,635
So ask me now...

304
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,482
Now that I know who you really are.

305
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Was it immediate?

306
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,598
It started the moment you got here?

307
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,933
And you were just walking,
the feeling returned

308
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,412
right after the crash, that day?

309
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:15,258
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

310
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,555
You're wondering why
it hasn't happened for you.

311
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:24,070
You're not recovering
as fast as you like.

312
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,396
How long's it been since Jack fixed you?

313
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:30,009
A week?

314
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:32,281
Now that I think about it,

315
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:34,653
how did you get sick in the first place?

316
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,659
Are you afraid it'll go away, John?

317
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,941
Is that why you want
to destroy the submarine?

318
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:43,006
'Cause you know if you leave the island,
you'll be back in the chair?

319
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:48,462
You got anything to eat?

320
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:13,064
Go on home, kid.
You know you're not supposed to be here.

321
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,420
My father sent me to get his pack.

322
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,086
Why?

323
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,800
I don't know, Ryan,
but he told me to get it.

324
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:24,716
All right.

325
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Here you go.

326
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,069
You're Alex, aren't you?

327
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:36,998
Hey! Can it.

328
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:38,878
How do you know my name?

329
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:41,889
Because you look like your mother.

330
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:46,117
My mother is dead.

331
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm sure that's what they told you.

332
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,066
Get going, Alex!

333
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,396
Keep your mouth shut.

334
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:13,657
Where do you get electricity?

335
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,317
We have two giant hamsters
running on a massive wheel

336
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:18,777
- at our secret underground lair.
- Yeah, that's funny.

337
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,206
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

338
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:35,629
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

339
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,576
I never really appreciated chicken
until right now.

340
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,991
I know you think you need
to do this, John,

341
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,769
but if you blow up my submarine,

342
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:53,113
I'll have a big problem with my people.

343
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,882
Is that supposed to be
an incentive not to blow it up?

344
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,504
I was born on this island.

345
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,980
Not many of my people can say that.

346
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:05,273
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

347
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:07,274
And as much as they love this place,

348
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:09,523
as much as they would do anything
to defend it,

349
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:12,118
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

350
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,056
The sub maintains that illusion.

351
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,936
So you're lying to 'em.

352
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,339
No. They're here
because they want to be here.

353
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:23,551
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full... commitment yet.

354
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,199
But you, John...

355
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,653
You've already made that commitment,

356
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:32,205
and now you have a choice.

357
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,261
Because if you stop and if you think,

358
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,817
I can show you things...

359
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,337
things I know you want
to see very badly.

360
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:43,814
Let me put it so you'll understand.

361
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,361
Picture a box.

362
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,633
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

363
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,523
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

364
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,024
there's a very large box,

365
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:01,929
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

366
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:06,575
when you opened at box,
there it would be.

367
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:11,262
What would you say about that, John?

368
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,745
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

369
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:25,116
- Why are you so angry, John?
- Because you're cheating.

370
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:26,315
You and your people

371
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,564
communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to.

372
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:31,593
You come and go as you please.

373
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:34,206
You use electricity
and running water and guns.

374
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,854
You're a hypocrite, a Pharisee.

375
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:39,153
You don't deserve to be on this island.

376
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:42,940
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

377
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,150
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator.

378
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,971
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

379
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:55,310
So how is it that you think
you know this island better than I do?

380
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,741
Because you're in the wheelchair,

381
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:00,096
and I'm not.

382
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:18,272
Did you have any problems?

383
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,680
Okay, here's how this is gonna work...

384
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,570
she's gonna take me to the sub.

385
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:30,003
Once we're there, I let her go.

386
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:31,883
John, she's done enough.
Let me take you.

387
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:34,085
I don't want you to slow me down.

388
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,106
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:39,588
John, before you go, you should know...

390
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,135
Jack and I made a deal.

391
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,560
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island

392
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:47,789
on that submarine,
and it's a 1-way ticket.

393
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,348
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

394
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:53,071
We have no way of contacting
the outside world...

395
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:55,661
Which means when that sub leaves,

396
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,078
it can never come back.

397
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,519
So whether you destroy the submarine

398
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,106
or whether you let it go,
the end result is the same--

399
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:05,488
no one will find this island.

400
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:09,694
Let's go.

401
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,306
Come on.

402
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,114
You know he's manipulating you, right?

403
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,415
How's that?

404
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:22,437
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

405
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,741
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

406
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,745
I'll have to keep that in mind.

407
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,142
Submarine's down there...

408
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,795
At the end of the dock.

409
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

410
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,003
Look, I know you don't owe me anything,

411
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,607
but I need to ask you
for one last favor.

412
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:10,892
You don't knock?

413
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,573
I need you to let my friends go

414
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:18,498
after I'm gone.

415
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,542
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

416
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,665
Of course it would.

417
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:31,239
Your friends
are only here to rescue you.

418
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:34,727
But you seem to be doing
a good job of rescuing yourself, so...

419
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,601
I suppose
there's no reason to keep them here.

420
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:43,092
Do I have your word on that?

421
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,092
You have my word.

422
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:52,873
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

423
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:03,755
Well, I guess this is it.

424
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,141
Thank you, Ben,

425
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,231
for keeping your promise.

426
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:51,905
Hold it right there!

427
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:53,344
Get your hands up!

428
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,911
Get down! I said get down!

429
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,851
What are you doing here, John?

430
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:11,265
I'm sorry, Jack.

431
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:15,584
Sorry for what?

432
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:44,406
What did you do?

433
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,777
Tell me you didn't do it.

434
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:51,648
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!

435
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:52,991
What?

436
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,445
You think I had something to do
with Peter's death?

437
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,148
I tell you to end things
with his mother,

438
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,724
and the next thing you know, he's dead!

439
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:00,207
John, now calm down, please.

440
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:02,698
Think about what you're saying.
Why would I kill Peter?

441
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:03,717
He was on to you!

442
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,542
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

443
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,773
Then why are you still here?

444
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,500
- What do you mean?
- I tell you to leave.

445
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:13,521
You tell me you're gonna leave town.
Why are you still here?

446
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:15,937
Now listen, John,

447
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,581
I'll be honest with you.

448
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
I didn't end it.

449
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:21,546
I was looking for an angle.

450
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:24,142
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

451
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:26,403
But then all this happened.

452
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,038
Peter died, and everything
just went straight into the tank.

453
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,026
She's devastated.

454
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:35,814
She's called off the wedding.

455
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,286
There's no profit in it, John.

456
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,167
I'm a con man, not a murder.

457
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,726
She called off the wedding?

458
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,324
She said she couldn't deal with it.

459
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:53,524
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

460
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:55,724
that's what she would tell me?

461
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,291
Phone's right over there, John.

462
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,180
What's her numb--

463
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,638
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't
what you want to hear, but...

464
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:19,627
Your father's gone.

465
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,311
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your...

466
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:26,006
encounter, then he disappeared.

467
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:30,132
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

468
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:33,489
All right, detectives,

469
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,326
that's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

470
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:40,934
We'll let you know if anything develops.

471
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:47,132
We have got ourselves quite a day
ahead of us, my friend.

472
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,930
It's finally time
to get you up out of that bed.

473
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:51,707
No. I don't want to.

474
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:53,023
I don't remember asking.

475
00:36:58,988 --> 00:36:59,988
Now...

476
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:02,715
Most people struggle with this at first,

477
00:37:02,868 --> 00:37:04,000
but don't worry.

478
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:06,068
You'll get used to it.

479
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,790
No, please. I can't do this.

480
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:12,858
You fell eight stories and survived.

481
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:15,904
I don't want to hear
about what you can't do.

482
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:17,260
Now let's go.

483
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,330
It's gonna be all right.

484
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,768
It's gonna be fine, John.

485
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,326
- Come on.
- No, I can't...

486
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:28,884
You're fine...

487
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,283
There we go.

488
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:34,347
There you go, buddy.

489
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,164
See?

490
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:39,626
Wasn't that bad, was it?

491
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,865
Be right back, buddy.

492
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,670
Well, John,
you've really gone and done it now.

493
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,621
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

494
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,380
We both know you wanted it to happen.

495
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,128
That's why you left the c4
in Sayid's bag

496
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:35,558
Because you wanted me to make it happen.

497
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:38,685
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

498
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:46,812
You gonna do anything stupid?

499
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,161
No, sir.

500
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:58,420
Do you remember earlier, John,
when you called me a cheater...

501
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,361
When you said I didn't deserve
to live on this island? Well, get this--

502
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,946
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

503
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,975
and thinking I'd give almost anything
to come up with a way

504
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:10,670
to stop him from leaving,
because to let him go

505
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,802
would be a sign a weakness,
of failure, of defeat.

506
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:16,829
My people would see that.
They would know it,

507
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,146
and that, John, would be the end of me.

508
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:20,635
But to kill him...

509
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,369
That would be cheating,

510
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:27,119
because my people
also heard me make a promise,

511
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,512
and to break my word...

512
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,937
that would be the end of me, too.

513
00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:39,261
And then you came striding out
of the jungle, John...

514
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,057
to you make my dream come true.

515
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:50,542
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

516
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,681
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

517
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,268
When I asked you earlier if it hurt

518
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:14,356
when you suffered your injury,
I think you misunderstood me.

519
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:17,752
It seems fairly obvious
that when a person's back smashes

520
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:20,106
into a hard surface after being thrown
from a building,

521
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,880
that's gonna sting a little.

522
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,962
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

523
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:28,217
What, do you want to know
if it hurt my feelings?

524
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,791
No, John.
I wanted to know what it felt like

525
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,025
when your own father tried to kill you.

526
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:39,528
He's the reason you destroyed
the submarine, isn't he?

527
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:41,874
You're afraid.

528
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:46,079
You're afraid of him, and this is
the one place he can never find you.

529
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:48,131
This is the one place
he can never get to.

530
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:49,520
What do you want from me?

531
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:54,498
I don't know how it happened...

532
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:00,499
But you seem to have
some communion with this island, John,

533
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,042
and that makes you very, very important.

534
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:06,706
You have no idea
what you're talking about, of course,

535
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:09,780
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

536
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:12,765
So what do I want?

537
00:41:14,523 --> 00:41:15,911
I want to help you, John.

538
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:19,545
Why?

539
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,476
Because I'm in a wheelchair,
and you're not.

540
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,362
Are you ready to see?

541
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:13,953
Dad?
