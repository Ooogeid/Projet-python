<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:05,000
- We're gonna have to take the boy.
- Dad!

3
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:11,457
I'm going after my son.

4
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:14,467
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is gonna stop me.

5
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:17,184
We need him!

6
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,808
One of our people
was captured by yours.

7
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:24,185
- So go get'em back.
- We can't do that,

8
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:26,563
but you can, and if you do,

9
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:28,811
we'll let you and Walt go free.

10
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,567
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

11
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:34,571
I'll kill him.

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,709
You lived up to your word.

13
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,964
We live up to our word, too.
You're gonna take this boat

14
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,800
and follow a compass bearing
of 3-2-5,

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,471
and if you do that exactly,
you and your son will find rescue.

16
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:03,099
Who are you people?

17
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:06,519
We're the good guys, Michael.

18
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,900
- Daddy!
- Come here.

19
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,295
Thank you all for your patience.

20
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:12,284
I know
it's taken me a few days to...

21
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,119
Figure out our next move
but I didn't wanna do anything

22
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,090
until I knew more
about our situation.

23
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,051
You deserve to know everything
that I do,

24
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,120
so...

25
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:23,471
no more secrets.

26
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:27,952
As you all know, Miles here,

27
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:31,396
and three of his people
came to the island about a week ago.

28
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,942
So I brought him up from the boathouse
to share with us

29
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:39,577
exactly why they're here.

30
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,579
We're here for him.

31
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,900
We kind of, like,
knew that forever ago.

32
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:52,083
OK then. Problem solved.
How soon do we turn him over?

33
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:55,044
- We can't turn him over.
- And why the hell not?

34
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:57,480
'Cause once they have me,
their orders are to kill

35
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,392
everyone else on the island.

36
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,430
Wait. So what, he's one of us now?

37
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:11,186
You're gonna protect him?
He tried to kill you, John.

38
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,563
And he won't tell us
who his spy on the boat is.

39
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,250
It's Michael.

40
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:17,984
What?

41
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,862
My spy on the freighter is Michael.

42
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,756
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,902
The same guy who killed
two women in cold blood

44
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,239
to set this little bastard free?

45
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,207
And then sold us out to get off
the island? That Michael?

46
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:38,103
That Michael.

47
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,756
The rules of desertion...

48
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,950
Still apply to everyone.

49
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:13,210
Nobody leaves this ship
without my say-so!

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,838
I'm not beating these men
to scare you.

51
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,423
I beat them to save your lives!

52
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,427
You remember what happened to the last
2 men who took off in this boat?

53
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,638
You remember what happened
to Minkowski?

54
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:33,368
As soon as we get the engines fixed,
we're back in the hunt.

55
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,104
In the meantime, everybody

56
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,263
just hold on!

57
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,804
- Johnson!
- Yes, sir.

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,565
Clean this mess up.

59
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,592
Sir.

60
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,506
- Hello, Michael.
- Not now, man.

61
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,068
Yes, right now.

62
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:11,015
Why are you on this boat?

63
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm here to die.

64
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:34,203
www.soustitreslost.com

65
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,845
That was a nice meeting but I thought
there wasn't gonna be any more secrets.

66
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,266
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the 3 million bucks

67
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:57,344
your buddy here asked for.

68
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:04,192
Miles offered his loyalty
in exchange for the money.

69
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,862
But I haven't seen a bank on the island,
so I didn't think it worth mentioning.

70
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,455
Something funny?

71
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:15,941
Linus will find a way to get it.

72
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,539
And how will he do that?

73
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,168
He wants to survive.

74
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:26,688
And considering a week ago
you had a gun to his head,

75
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,233
and tonight he's eating pound cake...

76
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,970
I'd say he's a guy
who gets what he wants.

77
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,594
- It's fine.
- Okay, thanks.

78
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:43,572
Bye, guys.

79
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,253
May I have a word with you?

80
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,028
We've heard enough from you
for one night.

81
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,302
- You have to listen to a little more.
- It's okay.

82
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,993
What do you want?

83
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,467
This is a map to the temple.

84
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:05,253
It's a sanctuary.

85
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:07,922
It may be the last safe place
on this island.

86
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,504
- Why don't we know about it?
- It wouldn't be a sanctuary

87
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,482
if I told everyone, would it?

88
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,597
All our people are already there.
You'll get there in a day and a half.

89
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:19,867
If it's safe, why don't we all go?
Hurley, Claire, the baby?

90
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:23,097
Because the temple's not for them.
It's only for us.

91
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:26,149
The people that are coming
know who I am.

92
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,420
They're here to capture me.
They'll kill anybody in their way.

93
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,780
If they knew who you were,
that you were my daughter,

94
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,429
they would use you to get to me.

95
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,036
We don't have much time.

96
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,542
Maybe he's right.

97
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,396
I agree. We should go.

98
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:52,688
These people...

99
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,120
you said they're dangerous.

100
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,867
More dangerous than you?

101
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,220
But your mother will protect you.

102
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:14,489
Okay, now go.

103
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,240
Where is he?

104
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,946
- You sure?
- Yeah.

105
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:38,943
He's in the engine room.

106
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,314
I don't understand.
It should be working.

107
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,193
Gaskets are all corroded.

108
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,063
- Can I help you?
- The captain sent us down

109
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,896
to help with the repairs.

110
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,705
Thanks. We're okay.

111
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,543
Jeff, man, you know what?
We need a pressure valve.

112
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,830
You mind go grabbing one
from the supply room?

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,116
Not at all.

114
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,446
You shouldn't be here.

115
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,346
- What you doing?
- Why are you here?

116
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,001
- If they see me talking to you...
- Then talk quickly!

117
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,913
- You won't understand!
- I'll understand perfectly.

118
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,124
You just start from the beginning

119
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,774
and explain how you came
to be on this boat.

120
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,291
I'm sorry.

121
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you, Mr. Dawson.

122
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,278
It's...

123
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,748
- What happened to me?
- You were in a car accident.

124
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:28,784
It's a miracle you're alive.

125
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,870
How badly am I hurt?

126
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,206
You just need to rest now.
It's a cold night.

127
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,168
I brought you some extra blankets.

128
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,183
Let's get some light in here.

129
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,470
Now I thought I heard someone shout,

130
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,647
and something tells me it wasn't him.
You okay?

131
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,526
You're lucky to be alive.

132
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:07,239
EMTs say they found you in a wrecked car
with a note pinned to your chest.

133
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,176
You didn't have any ID on you.

134
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,895
You want to tell me your name?

135
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,095
Yeah, I didn't think so.

136
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,628
You want me to call Walt?

137
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:26,742
- What?
- The note pinned to your chest.

138
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,678
It was written to "Walt."
You want me to call him?

139
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,850
No.

140
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,305
Okay, then.

141
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,043
Hey, ma.

142
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,636
Can I... come in?

143
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,264
No. You know the answer to that.

144
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:14,974
- I wanna see him.
- No.

145
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,825
- Just let me talk...
- I don't know what you said to him,

146
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,563
But whatever it was,
he doesn't want to see you.

147
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,003
Please, ma. He's my son.

148
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:25,359
- I have a right!
- I thought you were dead.

149
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,488
They said your plane crashed
in the middle of the ocean,

150
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,241
but you show up here fine and dandy,

151
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,036
only I can't tell anybody
but you or Walt,

152
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,711
I can't call you by your real names.

153
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,700
He barely talks to me,

154
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,679
But he does wake up screaming
in the middle of the night,

155
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,514
and I'm the one who got to tell him
it's gonna be okay.

156
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,848
So until you can explain to me

157
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,600
where you were for over two months,

158
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,352
and what happened,

159
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,907
you gave up your rights.

160
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,065
Will you...

161
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,455
Will you tell him I love him?

162
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:24,579
Yeah.

163
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,957
What can I do for you?

164
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,644
How much can I get for that?

165
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,570
Why is there Chinese writing
all over it?

166
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,224
A Korean guy gave it to me.

167
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,185
You don't look like you speak Korean.

168
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,023
- I'll give you $300 for it.
- I'm not looking for money.

169
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:30,818
What are you looking for?

170
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:33,296
I want a gun with bullets.

171
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,460
Come on. Let's just get this done.

172
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,499
Help me just get this done.

173
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:14,069
Excuse me, sir, you got the time?

174
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,458
No, man. no.

175
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,489
Come on, Michael.

176
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,491
How about for an old friend?

177
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:35,604
Manhattan?

178
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,927
We let you leave one island,
you just go to another one.

179
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:44,516
Will you just relax?
I just came here to...

180
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:50,397
Now are you ready to talk like adults?

181
00:17:57,972 --> 00:17:58,863
Enough!

182
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:06,081
- Do it. Go ahead, do it!
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

183
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:09,667
How did you find me?

184
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:12,810
We're the ones who sent you home.

185
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,860
Did you honestly think
we weren't gonna keep tabs?

186
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,110
- What do you want?
- Your help.

187
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,618
Why would I help the son of a bitch
who kidnapped my son?

188
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,891
We gave him back to you in one piece.
You're the one who lost him.

189
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,636
You told him, didn't you?

190
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,568
You couldn't carry the guilt
of what you did

191
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,700
so you shared it with a 10-year-old.

192
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,937
Is that why you wanna kill yourself?

193
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,357
Because that's the way
he looks at you now?

194
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,519
- Because he knows you're a murderer?
- Go away!

195
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:56,088
Bad news amigo, you can't kill yourself,
the island won't let you!

196
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,990
- What'd you say?
- No matter how bad you want to,

197
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,756
No matter how many different ways
you try,

198
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,224
it won't happen.

199
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,137
Give it a shot
if you don't believe me.

200
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,387
You got more work to do, Mike.

201
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:23,404
When you figure that out,
I'm in the penthouse at the hotel Earle.

202
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,014
<i>The wreckage of oceanic flight 815
has been found.</i>

203
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:13,119
<i>This footage confirms
the airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.</i>

204
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,023
<i>At these tremendous depths,</i>

205
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:18,622
<i>there is little hope
of recovering any remains.</i>

206
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,382
<i>Investigators are equally skeptical
about the chances of retrieving</i>

207
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:24,391
<i>Oceanic 815's black box.</i>

208
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:28,492
<i>The real story behind what happened
to this fateful airliner</i>

209
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:32,390
<i>may have been lost along
with the 324 passengers onboard.</i>

210
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,520
<i>But even with this tragic discovery,</i>

211
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,983
<i>the victims' families
were hoping today...</i>

212
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,658
I didn't expect you that fast.

213
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,490
Is this the guy who hit you
with a champagne bottle?

214
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,494
Yeah, but I had it coming.

215
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:01,900
Arturo, Michael and I
have some business to attend to.

216
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,439
- Would you get some air?
- Of course.

217
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,598
Help yourself to the chow.

218
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,056
I don't make it to the mainland
too often. So when I do,

219
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,991
I like to indulge myself.

220
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,212
So you people can just...

221
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,474
- come and go?
- Some of us.

222
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:24,048
- Want a drink?
- What I want is for you to tell me

223
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:26,928
what my plane is doing
at the bottom of the ocean.

224
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,743
That's not your plane. It's a phony.

225
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,623
A man named Widmore put it down there,
and he staged the whole wreck.

226
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,209
Staged? Why would he stage a...

227
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:42,775
Because he doesn't want anyone else
finding where the real plane ended up,

228
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,381
except for him.

229
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,842
I'm supposed to believe this?

230
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,904
Did the bullet bounce off your skull,

231
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,256
or did the gun just jam on you?

232
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,983
Prove it.

233
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,774
- Sorry?
- Prove that this Widmore

234
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:07,446
did what you say he did.

235
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,500
That's the cemetery in Thailand

236
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,880
where Widmore dug up
the 300-odd corpses he needed.

237
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,630
And the purchase order for the old 777
he bought through a shell company,

238
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,430
and the shipping logs
for the freighter he used

239
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,054
to drop the whole mess
down a trench deep enough

240
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,186
to guarantee that no remains
are ever gonna be identified.

241
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,855
Do you have any idea what it would cost
to bring those bodies up?

242
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:46,193
What you want from me, man?

243
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,490
In a few days,
a freighter is porting in Fiji.

244
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:54,686
It's Widmore's boat.

245
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:58,074
We have reason to believe
he found the coordinates of the island

246
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,583
and he's heading right for it.
So congratulations, Michael.

247
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:05,289
Your shore leave is over.
You just got a job on that boat.

248
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,118
Meet Kevin Johnson.

249
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,468
You're joining the crew in Fiji
as a deckhand.

250
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,932
You want me to go undercover?

251
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,853
Why the hell would I go back
to work for you people?

252
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,687
Because if Widmore finds the island,

253
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,942
it's good night for everybody on it.

254
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,320
He'll kill them all
without thinking twice.

255
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,208
You wanna redeem yourself
for what you did,

256
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,451
this is your only chance.
You can save all their lives.

257
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,831
No. I can't.
I can't go back to that island.

258
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:43,041
I didn't say you were going back
to the island.

259
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:47,421
You're going on that boat
so you can swab decks.

260
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,862
You're going
so you can kill everyone onboard.

261
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,854
You are engineer?

262
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:49,858
Just a deckhand.

263
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,069
We're all equals on this boat.

264
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,351
As long as you play decent hold'em.

265
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:57,450
I'm George Minkowski.

266
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:01,078
- Kevin Johnson.
- Nice to meet you, Kevin.

267
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,413
Go check in with Naomi over there.

268
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,588
I'll be seeing you. Welcome.

269
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,635
I'm reporting for duty.
Kevin Johnson.

270
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:22,006
Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure.

271
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,893
- So you're from the States, yeah?
- New York.

272
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:28,522
- Yeah, I could tell from the accent.
- Manchester?

273
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,817
How'd you guess?
You can head onboard.

274
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,278
One of these crates
was delivered for you.

275
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,179
I'll have it delivered to your berth?

276
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,368
- Yeah. thanks.
- Welcome aboard, Kevin.

277
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,986
Your name isn't Kevin.

278
00:25:57,804 --> 00:25:58,887
Don't worry.

279
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,533
80% of the people on this boat
are lying about something.

280
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:04,303
Orange?

281
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:06,958
No, thanks.

282
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:16,153
- Yeah?
<i>- How was your trip?</i>

283
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,780
I figure flying can't be
too much fun for you.

284
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,200
- What do you want?
- You get your care package?

285
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,664
Wait until you're out in the open sea,
then you're good to go.

286
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,002
You can stow your gear downstairs, OK?
Welcome aboard, Keamy.

287
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,046
You met some of'em now.

288
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,923
<i>Got some names and faces,</i>

289
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,926
- and you're gettin'cold feet, huh?
- Yeah, actually, I am.

290
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,345
Here are a few more names for you:
Sun,

291
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:43,930
<i>Sawyer, Jack,</i>

292
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,849
Claire, her baby.

293
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,560
<i>and your only way to save their lives
is if you man up</i>

294
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,372
and get on that boat.

295
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:53,930
<i>Or maybe you wanna come back
and explain to your kid</i>

296
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,091
<i>how you let all of them die, too.</i>

297
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,592
It's game time. Are you in or out?

298
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,418
I'm in.

299
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,625
Then ditch your phone
and go do your job.

300
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:39,193
No offense but I was flying these things
when you were still at school.

301
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,533
- I should be the 1st to go.
- I need you here

302
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,990
- to transport the science team.
- What you gonna do?

303
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,381
That's need-to-know. You don't.

304
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,150
So much for the fairer sex, huh?

305
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,072
Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.

306
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:09,264
Kevin Johnson.

307
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,501
Deckhand.

308
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,945
- So what's your story, Kevin?
- Sorry?

309
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,026
How'd you end up on this tub?

310
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,447
Looking for a little adventure.

311
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:26,475
Adventure...

312
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:32,330
Well, how do you like this
for adventure?

313
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,688
You ever hear about Oceanic 815?

314
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,966
What would you say if I told you
the plane they found in that trench

315
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:47,593
wasn't Oceanic 815?

316
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,853
Then what is it?

317
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,780
You know those nuts that think
the moon landing was faked?

318
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,730
Well, this is like that...

319
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,567
Only real.

320
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:05,113
That's why I signed up for this trip.
The owner of this boat believes me.

321
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,040
Charles Widmore.

322
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:10,243
He believes that 815
is still out there somewhere.

323
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:14,892
I mean,
can you imagine what would happen...

324
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,962
if we'd found
some of those people alive?

325
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,430
Pull!

326
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,686
- Another clip.
- Good job.

327
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:26,277
Kill shot!

328
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,650
What are you guys doing?

329
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:34,331
What's it look like we're doing?

330
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,636
We're shooting things. Pull!

331
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,213
Thought we were going
on a rescue mission.

332
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,876
Don't you have something to mop up?

333
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:01,865
Come on, let's go.

334
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,244
You can do this, OK?
You can do this.

335
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,070
Seven, one...

336
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,348
seven, seven, six.

337
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,412
Don't do it, Michael.

338
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,702
I love you, Walt.

339
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:23,546
- What, are you going Nicholson on us?
- What?

340
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:25,669
Jack Nicholson in <i>The Shining</i>,

341
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,508
when he's bouncing that ball
against the wall?

342
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:31,746
Next thing you know, you're gonna go
after your wife with an axe.

343
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,020
I'm not married.

344
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:38,145
Sorry to interrupt but you got a call.

345
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:41,130
- A call?
- Yeah. From the mainland.

346
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,460
They patched it through
to the radio room.

347
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,702
It's gotta be a mistake.
Nobody knows I'm here.

348
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:49,040
You're the only Kevin Johnson onboard,
so somebody knows you're here.

349
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:52,929
Said he really needs to talk to you.
His name's Walt.

350
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,324
Yeah, here you go.

351
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,040
It's kind of personal.
Mind if I take this alone?

352
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,643
Take your time, Kev.

353
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,563
You just push this yellow button
and turn this knob on the console.

354
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,273
Got it.

355
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,440
<i>I'm so sorry, Michael,
but he's still in New York.</i>

356
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,893
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

357
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:37,296
Are you still there?

358
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,452
You put me on this boat,

359
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,815
talked me into blowing it up,

360
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,721
and when I push the damn button,

361
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,611
a flag pops up.

362
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,806
- You actually activated the bomb?
- It's not a bomb! It's a...

363
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,733
It's a joke.

364
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,486
There are people on your boat
who are innocent.

365
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:04,657
<i>They have no idea
hat the man they work for is a monster,</i>

366
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,247
a killer without conscience
or a greater purpose.

367
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,880
I had to show you the difference
between him and me.

368
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,086
When I'm at war,

369
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,170
I'll do what I need to do to win
but I will not kill innocent people.

370
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,798
Ana Lucia and Libby...
They were innocent.

371
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,328
You killed them, Michael.

372
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,977
No one asked you to.

373
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,639
<i>I don't blame you, Michael.
We did you have your boy.</i>

374
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,105
And what wouldn't a man do
for his son?

375
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,634
What do you want... from me?

376
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,234
I want you to compile
a list of names...

377
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:48,743
Every person on your boat.

378
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:52,038
<i>When I call again,
you'll give me that list.</i>

379
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,875
Then you will disable
the radio room you're sitting in.

380
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:59,040
When the crew is disoriented
by their lack

381
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:01,888
of communication,
you'll take out the engines too.

382
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,879
That way,
the boat can never get to this island,

383
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,804
and your friends will be safe.

384
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,690
Will you do that for me, Michael?

385
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,066
Then consider yourself
one of the good guys.

386
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,107
So you're telling me...

387
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,592
that you're working
for Benjamin Linus?

388
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:16,414
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

389
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:26,750
Guys!

390
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,535
Hold it!

391
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:32,177
- Let me go! What are you doing?
- Shut your mouth.

392
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:37,226
What the hell is this?

393
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:39,186
This man is not who you think he is.

394
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,231
He was a passenger
on Oceanic flight 815.

395
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,212
I spent two months with him
on the island before he betrayed us.

396
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:49,363
This is the man who sabotaged
your radio room.

397
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:53,191
He destroyed the ship's engine,
and his name isn't Kevin Johnson.

398
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,495
It's Michael Dawson.

399
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,641
And he's a traitor.

400
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,478
We'll stop here and drink.

401
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:23,198
Two minutes, then we keep moving.

402
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,489
What's wrong?

403
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,389
Nothing.

404
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:50,790
I don't know.

405
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,324
I just have a bad feeling about this.

406
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,522
What if your dad is... playing us?

407
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,835
Look, I don't like taking orders
from my dad any more than you do.

408
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:06,065
But I know he doesn't want me
to get hurt.

409
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:10,896
At least we've got something
in common.

410
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,115
Promise not to tell if you won't.

411
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:33,634
Come on, he's gone!

412
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,600
- No, we have to get Karl!
- He's gone, he's gone!

413
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,478
Listen to me.
I need you to take my hand.

414
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,720
On the count of three,
we're going to run.

415
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:50,401
Can you do that with me?

416
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,332
I love you.

417
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:56,282
I love you very much, Alexandra.

418
00:40:58,835 --> 00:40:59,743
You ready?

419
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,400
One...

420
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:04,685
Two...

421
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,420
Three!

422
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:41,118
Wait, wait, don't!
I'm Ben's daughter!

423
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,074
I'm his daughter!

424
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,360
