00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,470
<i>on September 22nd, 2004,</i>

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,012
<i>in Sydney, Australia,</i>

4
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:12,050
<i>when 324 people boarded
a plane to Los Angeles.</i>

5
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:13,918
Hold the door!

6
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,112
<i>Like any flight that day,</i>

7
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:20,116
<i>this was comprised of strangers...</i>

8
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:22,585
<i>among them, a doctor</i>

9
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,957
<i>and a fugitive,</i>

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:30,527
<i>a soldier</i>

11
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,131
<i>and a rock star,</i>

12
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,369
<i>a con man</i>

13
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,604
<i>and a lottery winner</i>

14
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:44,376
<i>and an estranged couple,</i>

15
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:47,012
<i>a single
mother-to-be...</i>

16
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,584
<i>And a man whose faith was lost.</i>

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:58,458
<i>As Oceanic flight 815
flew high over the ocean...</i>

18
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,428
<i>this group of strangers...</i>

19
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,231
<i>It's normal. Was about
to be joined together.</i>

20
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,465
Don't worry.

21
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,347
<i>on a mysterious Island...</i>

22
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,583
This place is different.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,620
<i>Far from home... The pilot said we
were over a thousand miles off course.</i>

24
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,390
<i>They found themselves on a journey...
It's a place where miracles happen.</i>

25
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,491
Run!

26
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,360
<i>They could never have imagined.</i>

27
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,828
We're not alone.

28
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:35,933
<i>They loved... Yes, I love him!</i>

29
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,401
<i>And lost.</i>

30
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,637
Charlie!

31
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,273
<i>They fought... This is our Island.</i>

32
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,308
<i>And died.</i>

33
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,409
Jin!

34
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,946
<i>And after 108 days...</i>

35
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,248
I'm one of the survivors of flight 815.

36
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:52,384
<i>Six people found rescue.</i>

<i>But the Island...</i>

39
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,258
<i>vanished...</i>

40
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,462
<i>Sending the friends left behind...</i>

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,698

<i>Three years passed,</i>

46
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:18,710
<i>and those who came

47

<i>Were beckoned... I don't understand.</i>

<i>to undo their past...</i>

51
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:32,089
There's a way for you to take it
all back. You think you can come here

52
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,224
<i>and do whatever the hell you
want? To alter their fate...</i>

53
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,726
Get in! I'm gonna
detonate a hydrogen bomb.

First plane crash? What gave it away?

00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,964
I can always spot the newbies.

<i>Clung to hope for rescue.

I'm Kate. Jack.

00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,675
Get me a blood gas and a c-spine.

65
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:15,277
Get her up to LCU and
keep her immobilized.

00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,947
<i>Jack Shephard was a spinal surgeon...</i>

67
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:21,284
<i>I'm gonna fix you. Consumed by his work.</i>

68
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,520
I got it all. I mean, I had it! His
heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.

69
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:27,757
<i>Jack was also driven
by a relentless urge</i>

70
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,859
<i>to prove himself to
his father, Christian.</i>

71
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:33,562
What are you talking about? I'm
talking about you stitching up the sacs

72
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,698
so this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

73
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,400
<i>But Jack would never
get that opportunity</i>

74
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,735
<i>because his father died in Sydney...</i>

75
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,804
That's him.

76
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,773
<i>And it was up to Jack
to bring the body home.</i>

77
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,442
<i>On the Island, the Oceanic survivors</i>

78
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,545
<i>looked to Jack as their leader.</i>

79
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:53,314
If we can't live together,

80
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:57,851
we're gonna die alone. You did a
good thing, taking care of everybody

81
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,886
and just giving them
something to count on.

82
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,457
Ah, hey, girl.

83
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,059
<i>Kate Austen grew up in Iowa</i>

84
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,395
<i>where her mother was
married to an abusive man.</i>

85
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:12,164
You are beautiful.

86
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,433
<i>Then one night, Kate had enough.</i>

87
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,503
Katherine, what did you
do? I took care of you, ma.

88
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:24,706
<i>She became a fugitive, on the
run for years...</i>

89
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,276
<i>hey, Kate. Until she was
apprehended in Australia.</i>

90
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:32,013
<i>But when Oceanic 815
crashed on the Island,</i>

91
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,016
<i>Kate found a place to begin anew.</i>

92
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:38,986
I wanna tell you what I
did. It doesn't matter, Kate.

93
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:42,657
<i>We should all be able to
start over. On the Island,</i>

94
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,225
<i>Kate found herself drawn
to two different men...</i>

95
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,227
<i>Jack, the honorable leader</i>

96
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,897
<i>and Sawyer, the charming rogue.</i>

97
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,766
Did you tell the doc about you and me?

98
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,868
No, but he knows.

99
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,638
Well, now if that's out of the way,

100
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,807
how about a little afternoon delight?

101
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,642
Freckles, wait!

102
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,412
You need me to make you a mix
tape? Yeah, why don't you do that.

103
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,514
Listen to mommy.

104
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:11,283
<i>James Ford was just a young boy</i>

105
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,752
<i>when his father was swindled
by a man named Sawyer.</i>

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,454
Get under the bed. Don't make
a sound. Open this door!

107
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,990
<i>James' father went into a
rage and killed his wife...</i>

108
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,993
Stop it! What are you doing?!
What the hell are you...

109
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,829
<i>just before he killed himself.</i>

110
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,164
<i>James grew up to become a con man,</i>

111
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,333
<i>taking the name of the man
who had conned his father,</i>

112
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:34,303
<i>and his need for vengeance
brought him to Australia,</i>

113
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:37,139
<i>where he believed he'd
found the man he sought.</i>

114
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,841
Sawyer.

115
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,542
<i>But he was wrong.</i>

116
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,745
You don't know what
you're doin', do you?

117
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,481
<i>On the Island, Sawyer
often clashed with Jack.</i>

118
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,549
You're just not looking
at the big picture, doc.

119
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:51,118
You're still back in
civilization. And where are you?

120
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,220
I'm in the wild.

121
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:55,255
<i>And he had trouble getting along.</i>

122
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,591
break it up!

123
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,360
Stop! We found a transceiver
but it's not working.

124
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,729
Can anybody help? Yes.

125
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,630
<i>Let's trust this guy!
we're all in this together, man.</i>

126
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,332
Let's treat each other with a
little respect. Shut up, lard-o.

127
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,401
Chain-smokin' jackass.

128
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,037
Some people have problems.

129
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:15,507
How do you know how to do all that? I
was a military communications officer.

130
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:19,310
What were you, air force?
Army? The republican guard.

131
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,978
yes, sir.

132
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,913
<i>Before the 815 crashed,</i>

133
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,782
<i>Sayid was a torturer in Iraq.</i>

134
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,718
I guess you have a new
skill set you can use.

135
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,654
<i>But he was conflicted,</i>

136
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,390
<i>and he fell in love
with a woman he tortured.</i>

137
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:36,760
This isn't a game, Nadia. And
yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

138
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,561
Guard!

139
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,531
<i>Sayid risked his life to
give Nadia her freedom...</i>

140
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,999
Take it.

141
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,401
<i>Then spent his life searching for her.</i>

142
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,937
We know where she is.

143
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,807
<i>When he cooperated with the CIA
to overthrow a terrorist plot,</i>

144
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,043
<i>he thought he'd finally
found a way back to Nadia.</i>

145
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,780
<i>But Oceanic 815 crashed on the Island...</i>

146
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:01,783
did anybody see that?

147
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,085
<i>And that presented its
own set of challenges...</i>

148
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,319
Terrific.

149
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,722
<i>For this was not an ordinary Island...</i>

150
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,262
Jack!

151
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,965
<i>Not by any stretch of the imagination.</i>

152
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,437
Dad?

153
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:29,473
<i>And this group was a
very long way from home.</i>

154
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,209
Hey! We've got a bar!

155
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:35,244
that's French! The
rescue party... it has to be.

156
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:36,913
It's a distress call.

157
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,183
It's been playing over
and over for 16 years.

158
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,752
Guys...

159
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,388
Where are we?

160
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:50,628
I know food's scarce...

161
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,863
But your shirt?

162
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,465
When you find the
laundromat, let me know.

163
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,534
for Hugo Reyes,

164
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,470
<i>crashing on the Island
carried its own special burden.</i>

165
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:02,905
I think the plane crash
might've been my fault.

166
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,375
Don't be daft. How could you possibly...

167
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:09,479
hey, a lot of bad stuff used
to happen whenever I was around.

168

Hugo played the lottery and won

<i>(Michael but misfortune followed.
I've had some bad luck, too.</i>

00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,959
Grandpa Tito died of a heart attack,

173
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,195
and the first house I
bought my mom burnt down.

174
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:30,532
<i>And when his chicken franchise
was destroyed by a meteor...</i>

175
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:36,605
<i>he became convinced his
winnings were a curse.</i>

176
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:40,076
<i>welcome. After the
crash, Hugo tried to find</i>

177
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,978
<i>the brighter side of the Island.</i>

178
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,347
Dudes, listen, if we're stuck here,

179
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,349
then just surviving's not gonna cut it.

180
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,641
We need some kind of relief, you know?

181
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,477
We need some way that we
can, you know, have fun.

182
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,880
<i>The Island had a hold on
all of the survivors...</i>

183
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,253
<i>but one man was determined to
uncover its deepest mystery.</i>

184
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,024
well...

185
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:09,993
this is... awkward.

186
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,529
<i>John Locke met his biological father</i>

187
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,999
<i>only to learn that he was being used.</i>

188
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,902
You stole my kidney? You needed a
father figure, and I needed a kidney.

189
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,405
Get over it.

190
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,331
<i>When Locke confronted his father,</i>

191
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,300
<i>it ended in tragedy.</i>

192
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,568
Aah! Aah!

193
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:32,440
<i>He was left shattered and paralyzed,</i>

194
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,775
<i>but he eventually made
his way to Australia</i>

195
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:36,911
<i>with a dream of conquering the outback.</i>

196
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,946
Just put me on the bus
right now. I can do this.

197
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:41,515
No, you can't.

198
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,517
You don't know who you're dealing with!

199
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,585
Don't ever tell me
what I can't do, ever!

200
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,888
<i>When Oceanic 815 crashed on the Island,</i>

201
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,356
<i>John Locke rose from the wreckage</i>

202
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,458
<i>and discovered he could walk again.</i>

203
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,227
<i>This gave him faith</i>

204
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,363
<i>that they were on the
Island for a purpose.</i>

205
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,865
You think we crashed on
this place by coincidence?

206
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,269
Each one of us was
brought here for a reason.

207
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,540
And who brought us
here, John? The Island.

208
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,608
<i>But the survivors</i>

209
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,877
<i>were not the first people
drawn to the Island.</i>

210
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,445
<i>Teams of scientists from
the Dharma initiative</i>

211
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,814
<i>came to the Island in the 1970s.</i>

212
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:20,684
<i>They built research stations
in an attempt to understand</i>

213
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:25,789
<i>the Island's special properties.
<li>unique electromagnetic fluctuations.</i>

214
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,141
<li>One station was
called 'The Swan'</li>

215
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,458
<i>Where a man named Desmond spent years</i>

216
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,293
<i>entering a code into a computer</i>

217
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,630
<i>to keep a massive amount of
electromagnetic energy at Bay.</i>

218
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,732
<i>system failure. System failure.</i>

219
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,535
<i>one day, Desmond
neglected to enter the code</i>

220
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:42,772
<i>and caused Oceanic flight
815 to crash on the Island.</i>

221
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,607
<i>The Island's original inhabitants</i>

222
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,542
<i>were not pleased to have visitors.</i>

223
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,411
Goodwin, if you run you can
make that shore in an hour.

224
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,846
Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.

225
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:53,815
There may actually be survivors. Go!

226
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,551
This is not your Island.

227
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,286
<i>This is our Island.</i>

228
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,457
<i>The Oceanic survivors would soon meet</i>

229
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,693
<i>the Island's original inhabitants.</i>

230
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,697
<i>They would call these people
the others. Hello, Jack.</i>

231
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:11,166
<i>There leader was a man
named Benjamin Linus,</i>

232
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:14,903
<i>and he would do anything in his power
to protect the Island. uhh!</i>

233
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,473
If any of them are stupid enough
to get in your way, kill 'em.

234
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,242
hey, welcome
to the Island, man.

235
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,245
<i>Ben Linus came to the
Island as a young boy</i>

236
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:27,047
<i>when his father joined
the Dharma initiative.</i>

237
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:30,216
<i>But it was not a pleasant experience.</i>

238
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,386
<i>I'm stuck here on this
Island... with you.</i>

239
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:36,990
<i>Then one day, Ben met the others.</i>

240
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:40,426
Take me with you. You're
gonna have to be very patient.

241
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:43,029
<i>So Ben waited,</i>

242
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:44,864
<i>and when he became a young man...</i>

243
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,766
Good-bye, dad.

244
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,436
<i>he did whatever it took</i>

245
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:53,439
<i>to help the others protect
the Island from outsiders</i>

246
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:56,308
<i>like the Dharma initiative.
You want us to go get his body?</i>

247
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,443
No. Leave him out there.

248
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,846
<i>Ben joined the others and
Rose to power as their leader.</i>

249
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:04,415
<i>He raised a daughter</i>

250
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,918
<i>and was a devoted servant to the Island.</i>

251
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:10,121
<i>But when John Locke
arrived, Ben felt threatened</i>

252
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,056
<i>by Locke's special
communion with the Island.</i>

253
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:15,793
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

254
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,062
So how is it that you
think you know this Island

255
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,531
better than I do?

256
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,366
<i>Though not all of the others
regarded Locke as a threat.</i>

257
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,468
When word had gotten back here

258
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,702
that there was man with a
broken spine on the plane

259
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,671
who could suddenly walk again...

260
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,906
Well, people here began
to get very excited.

261
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,075
<i>Locke joined the others</i>

262
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,811
<i>and would soon become their new leader.</i>

263
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,779
<i>But one of them wanted
desperately to leave.</i>

264
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:40,848
I wanna go home. That's
not our agreement.

265
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,150
You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

266
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,386
we're here.

267
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:48,355
<i>Juliet was a fertility specialist.</i>

268
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:51,157
<i>She was recruited by
the others to find out</i>

269
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:53,859
<i>why women on the Island
could not have children.</i>

270
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,861
I think it happens at conception.

271
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,097
There's nothing I can do
about it... at least not here.

272
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,133
<i>The situation appeared hopeless,</i>

273
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,036
<i>so Juliet joined the Oceanic survivors</i>

274
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,805
<i>in hopes of finding a way home.</i>

275
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,574
I want to know about your research.

276
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:11,509
What happens to pregnant women?

277
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,110
They all die.

278
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,417
<i>Sun and Jin were from
Korea...</i>

279
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:23,652
<i>and despite their very
different backgrounds,</i>

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,055
<i>they fell in love.</i>

281
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,327
<i>their wedding was joyful,</i>

282
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,029
<i>but their marriage soon darkened,</i>

283
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,999
<i>and Sun planned an escape from Jin</i>

284
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,467
<i>when the two were in Sydney.</i>

285
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,137
<i>Life on the Island
brought them closer...</i>

286
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,573
You're pregnant.

287
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,376
<i>And they fell in love once again.</i>

288
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:52,646
<i>But Sun's pregnancy put her in danger.</i>

289
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:55,215
Your wife is very sick.

290
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:58,852
If she doesn't get off
this Island, she will die.

291
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,988
<i>But there was new hope for rescue.</i>

292
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,490
<i>After nearly 90 days on the Island,</i>

293
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:06,889
<i>a freighter arrived off the coast.</i>

294
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:09,693
<i>So Jack led his group to a radio tower</i>

295
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,129
<i>to make a call for help.</i>

296
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,312
I'm one of the survivors
of Oceanic flight 815.

297
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,815
Can you get a fix on our location?
hell, yeah, we can.

298
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:21,217
<i>They believed they'd
finally found a way home.</i>

299
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,417
<i>A group from the freighter arrived
by helicopter. uhh!</i>

300
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,555
Who are you? I'm Daniel Faraday.

301
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,791
I'm here to rescue you.

302
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:38,327
what's his story? Half the
stuff he says goes way over my head.

303
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,229
The other half goes way, way over.

304
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,065
<i>Daniel Faraday was a physicist</i>

305
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,935
<i>who devoted his life to
the study of time travel.</i>

306
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,971
<i>He came to the Island
with a science team</i>

307
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,774
<i>and their pilot Frank Lapidus.</i>

308
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,109
<i>but rescuing
the Oceanic survivors</i>

309
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,711
<i>was not the primary mission.</i>

310
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,947
This is Charles Widmore, the man
whose boat is parked offshore.

311
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,949
What does he want? Charles Widmore
wants to exploit this Island,

312
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,885
<i>and he'll do everything
in his power to possess it.</i>

313
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:09,154
<i>Charles Widmore was a
wealthy and powerful man</i>

314
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,690
<i>who at one time was the
leader of the others.</i>

315
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,191
I'll be seeing you, boy.

316
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:18,262
<i>He was banished from the Island
and swore vengeance on Ben.</i>

317
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,931
<i>Widmore's freighter also carried</i>

318
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,867
<i>a team of mercenaries
with orders to capture Ben.</i>

319
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:28,405
Get your ass out here right now.
I'm not coming out of this house.

320
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:30,874
<i>And in the process...</i>

321
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,943
<i>Ben's daughter Alex was murdered.</i>

322
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,146
If you wanna kill her, go
ahead and do it.

323
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:41,517
<i>so the survivors and
the others made a deal...</i>

324
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:43,618
Uhh! Aah!

325
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,889
<i>and joined forces to
defeat the mercenaries.</i>

326
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:51,025
The helicopter is yours.
You have a safe journey back.

327
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:54,328
So we can go off the Island?

328
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:57,464
That's it?

329
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,200
That's it.

330
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,092
<i>He say something to tick you off, freckles?
With Widmore's mercenaries defeated,</i>

331
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,395
<i>the survivors were eager
to leave the Island.</i>

332
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:13,531
<i>But John Locke chose to stay
and had one request for Jack.</i>

333
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,500
You have to lie about everything.

334
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:20,805
<i>It's the only way to protect
it. It's an Island, John.</i>

335
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:24,008
It's not an Island. It's a
place where miracles happen.

336
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:26,845
Let's go, freckles. I've
seen enough of this rock.

337
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:30,816
<i>Jack led a group to
the freighter by chopper</i>

338
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,518
<i>as the science team
shuttled others by boat.</i>

339
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,254
<i>But the chopper was leaking fuel.</i>

340
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:38,589
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

341
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,892
if we were a few hundred
pounds lighter. Hey.

342
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,726
<i>So Sawyer acted quickly...</i>

343
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,328
Sawyer.

344
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:50,700
<i>And as he made his way
back to the Island...</i>

345
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,936
<i>There it is! The boat... I see it!
The chopper reached the freighter,</i>

346
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,872
<i>only to find it was
rigged with explosives.</i>

347
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:01,610
it's Jin! Turn around!

348
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,478
we can't do it.

349
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,246
<i>Jin!</i>

350
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,854
<i>Sawyer reached the Island...
What are you doing here?</i>

351
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:15,689
<i>Believing his friends were safe.</i>

352
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,992
Is that our boat? It was.

353
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:24,063
<i>Meanwhile, Locke began his new
role as leader of the others...</i>

354
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,800
Welcome home.

355
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:30,069
<i>And Ben descended to a cavern
deep below the orchid station</i>

356
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:32,605
<i>to move the Island</i>

357
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:35,775
<i>and ensure that Charles Widmore
would never find it again.</i>

358
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:48,154
<i>but the act of moving the Island</i>

359
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,156
<i>created a profound side effect.</i>

360
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:52,158
Anyone?!

361
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,494
where's the freighter?

362
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:58,264
A minute ago, that boat
was coughing Black smoke.

363
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,000
Now there's just nothin'?

364
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,869
<i>The Oceanic survivors and
the freighter scientists</i>

365
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:06,438
<i>were taken on an extraordinary journey.</i>

366
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,440
Whatever Ben Linus did
down at the orchid station

367
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:10,976
dislodged us. Dislodged us from what?

368
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,176
Time.

369
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:17,515
<i>they flashed through numerous
time periods on the Island.</i>

370
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,850
What year is it right now? It's 1954.

371
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,186
<i>during one flash...</i>

372
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:23,954
Jin? Sawyer?

373
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:27,824
<i>They reunited with Jin,
who was very much alive.</i>

374
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:30,694
<i>But the flashes... Charlotte!</i>

375
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:32,596
<i>Were slowly killing them.</i>

376
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:35,866
<i>Locke believed he knew how
to save everyone left behind.</i>

377
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,902
This is all happening because they left.

378
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,404
We have to go back to the orchid.

379
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:44,807
excuse me?
that's where all this started.

380
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,376
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
Aah!

381
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,612
aah!

382
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,282
Hello, John. I'm here to
help you the rest of the way.

383
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,218
<i>Locke turned the same
wheel Ben turned...</i>

384
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,622
Say hello to my son.

385
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,190
<i>and the flashes stopped.</i>

386
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:05,660
I think it's over. I think John did it.

387
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,396
Now what? Now we wait
for him to come back.

388
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,468
<i>after John Locke turned the wheel,</i>

389
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,404
<i>Sawyer and Juliet were
left stranded in 1974.</i>

390
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,873
<i>Along with Jin and Miles, they joined</i>

391
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,175
<i>the Dharma initiative on the Island</i>

392
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,276
<i>and soon became fixtures
in the community.</i>

393
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:26,678
Hey, Boss. Evening, Enos.

394
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:28,613
<i>Sawyer was named head of security,</i>

395
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,882
<i>Juliet became a mechanic...</i>

396
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,583
Somethin' smells good.

397
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,720
<i>And the two made a life
together on the Island.</i>

398
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,622
I love you. I love you, too.

399
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,259
Mm.

400
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:47,130
<i>when John
Locke turned the wheel,</i>

401
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:50,200
<i>he was transported to
the Tunisian desert...</i>

402
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,435
<i>three years
in the future, to 2007.</i>

403
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:55,371
<i>He soon received help
from Charles Widmore.</i>

404
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,506
All your friends who left the Island?

405
00:19:57,574 --> 00:19:59,842
They've been back three years.

406
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,644
They've gone back to their normal
lives. I have to bring them back.

407
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,814
And I'm gonna do everything in
my power to help you do that.

408
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,882
<i>So Locke set out</i>

409
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,518
<i>to convince his friends
to come back to the Island.</i>

410
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,753
I'm not going back. The answer is no.

411
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:16,090
No, I'm not going anywhere with you.
I only need to convince one,

412
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:19,226
and if I can do that,
the rest will come.

413
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,127
<i>Locke's task was difficult,</i>

414
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:24,063
<i>but it was about to become dangerous.</i>

415
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:34,840
<i>Locke's misfortune gave him one more
chance. What are you doing here?</i>

416
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,609
We have to go back.
Because it's our destiny?

417
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,245
How many times are you
gonna say that to me?

418
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,781
Good-bye, John. Your father says hello.

419
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,016
What?

420
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,151
He said his name was Christian.

421
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,620
he died in
Australia three years ago.

422
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,355
I put him in the coffin! He's dead.

423
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,958
You leave me alone,

424
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,260
and you leave the rest of 'em alone!

425
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:03,101
<i>Locke believed he had failed,</i>

426
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,270
<i>but in his despair...</i>

427
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:08,873
<i>Come on. Ben Linus found an
opportunity to get back to the Island</i>

428
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:10,642
<i>and assume his old role.</i>

429
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,680
I know where we go.

430
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,782
There's a woman here in Los Angeles.

431
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,250
Eloise Hawking.

432
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,686
Eloise Hawking? You sure?
Yeah. Why? You know her?

433
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:22,656
Yes, John. I know her.

434
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:30,830
I'll miss you, John.

435
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,866
I really will.

436
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,285
<i>When Widmore's freighter was destroyed,</i>

437
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:45,254
<i>the passengers on the chopper
had only one place to go.</i>

438
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,689
Lapidus!

439
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:49,525
Fly us back to the Island!

440
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,594
<i>they made their way back</i>

441
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:54,397
<i>just in time to see the Island...</i>

442
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,398
<i>vanish.</i>

443
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:59,134
Where the hell's the Island? It's gone.

444
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:02,304
That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

445
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:09,645
<i>they survived the
crash... There's a boat.</i>

446
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:13,014
<i>And found rescue in
the middle of the ocean.</i>

447
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,217
<i>And on board the search boat,</i>

448
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,819
<i>Jack and Kate planned the next move.
What are we gonna do about Aaron?</i>

449
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,655
I don't know.

450
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,958
you're so good with him.

451
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:28,128
The last thing I ever thought
I'd be good at is being a mum.

452
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,530
You know, you should try it sometime.

453
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:33,133
<i>Claire was 8 months pregnant
at the time of the crash,</i>

454
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:36,736
<i>and on her way to LA to give
her baby up for adoption.</i>

455
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:39,906
you have a little boy.

456
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,475
<i>She gave birth to Aaron
on the Island...</i>

457
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,510
<i>and soon became close with Charlie.</i>

458
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:49,147
I didn't want you to
worry. I'll be fine, Claire.

459
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:52,216
<i>But Charlie drowned trying to
help his friends find rescue.</i>

460
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:58,022
<i>and not long after,
Claire went missing...</i>

461
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,724
She just walked off in
the middle of the night.

462
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,760
<i>Leaving Kate to care for Aaron.</i>

463
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:06,964
I think we should say he's mine.

464
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:11,000
After everyone we've lost,
I can't lose him, too.

465
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:14,638
Kate, if we're gonna protect
the people that we left behind,

466
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,273
tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
have to convince everyone to lie.

467
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:19,376
Are you with me?

468
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:22,246
<i>I have always been with you.</i>

469
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,081
<i>And so they returned home.</i>

470
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:29,519
<i>Jack, Kate, Hugo, Sayid, Sun and Aaron</i>

471
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:32,855
<i>would come to be known
as the Oceanic six,</i>

472
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:35,958
<i>and to protect their
friends left behind,</i>

473
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,460
<i>they lied about their entire experience.</i>

474
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:41,562
Is it possible there are any
other survivors from the crash

475
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,265
yet to be discovered? Absolutely not.

476
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:48,669
<i>The Oceanic six tried to
adjust to a normal life,</i>

477
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:50,738
<i>but three years passed,</i>

478
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,606
<i>and the memories of
their friends left behind</i>

479
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:55,075
<i>continued to haunt them.</i>

480
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,876
Jack.

481
00:23:56,944 --> 00:24:00,446
<i>Jack began seeing
visions of his dead father</i>

482
00:24:00,514 --> 00:24:02,981
<i>and took flights over the pacific,</i>

483
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,017
<i>hoping the plane would
crash on the Island.</i>

484
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,821
Can I get another one of those,
please? How about a newspaper instead?

485
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:11,624
<i>When he read the news of Locke's death,</i>

486
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,959
<i>he was devastated.</i>

487
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,596
<i>But in Jack's greatest despair,</i>

488
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,599
<i>he formed a most unlikely
alliance. Hello, Jack.</i>

489
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,635
Did he tell you that
I was off the Island?

490
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:26,204
He told me that after I left the Island,

491
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:29,073
some very bad things happened.

492
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:31,876
And he said that I had to come back.

493
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:35,046
<i>All of you have to go back.</i>

494
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,215
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

495
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:39,383
what is this place?

496
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:44,020
the Dharma
initiative called it the lamp post.

497
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,456
<i>Jack and Ben met with Eloise Hawking,</i>

498
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:50,125
<i>who was once the leader of the others</i>

499
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:53,796
<i>and the only person who knew
how to get back to the Island.</i>

500
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:56,699
There's a commercial airliner
flying from LA to Guam.

501
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,602
Ajira airways,
flight 3-1-6.

502
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,272
So that's it? No, that's not all, Jack.

503
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,074
<i>Eloise explained</i>

504
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:08,209
<i>that Jack would need to
bring the body of John Locke</i>

505
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:12,113
<i>on the plane. John is going to
be a substitute of your father's.</i>

506
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,649
You must be laughing your ass off,

507
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,418
because this is even
crazier than you are.

508
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:21,121
Rest in peace.

509
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:24,924
<i>Kate had no intention of
going back to the Island.</i>

510
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:28,226
<i>Aaron? Aaron? But when
she nearly lost Aaron...</i>

511
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:32,630
<i>Honey, is this your mommy? She began
to doubt her decision to be his mother.</i>

512
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,799
Mrs. Littleton, I'm Kate Austen.

513
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,736
<i>So Kate went to Claire's mother,</i>

514
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,004
<i>who had no idea that
Claire was still alive.</i>

515
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,941
I told him that you're
his grandmother...

516
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,577
that you'll
take care of him while I'm gone.

517
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,179
Where are you going?

518
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,615
I'm going back to find your daughter.

519
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,518
welcome to Ajira air.

520
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,653
Thank you, sir.

521
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,922
<i>And so those who came home
were together once again,</i>

522
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,593
<i>each returning to the Island
for very different reasons.</i>

523
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:07,329
It's pretty crazy, huh?

524
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,132
<i>this is your
captain, Frank J. Lapidus.</i>

525
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:13,035
<i>Welcome aboard. Well, hello, doc.</i>

526
00:26:13,102 --> 00:26:15,871
What are you doing here, Frank?
Well, I fly this route all the time.

527
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:19,341
Sometimes I take the big
birds into new... Delhi.

528
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:22,043
Is that Sayid? And Hurley.

529
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:26,213
Wait a second. We're not
going to Guam, are we?

530
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:28,849
<i>High over the
pacific...</i>

531
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:31,718
<i>a familiar feeling
swept through the plane.</i>

532
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:35,188
Dude, you might want to
fasten your seat belt.

533
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,838
I have the controls.

534
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,406
Aah! Aah!

535
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,910
is that a runway?

536
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:50,913
massive instrument
failure! We're putting her down!

537
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:53,315
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Ajira 3-1-6.

538
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,024
brace for impact.

539
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:59,762
Hey.

540
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,765
<i>The Oceanic six were
back on the Island...</i>

541
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,600
Frank? Sun.

542
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,001
<i>Separated by two very
different time periods.</i>

543
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:09,437
Oh, my God. What happened?!

544
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,340
<i>Sun landed with the plane in 2007...</i>

545
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:16,110
Where'd they go? they're gone.

546
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,780
Gone where? How would I know?

547
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,917
<i>But her friends found themselves</i>

548
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:26,621
<i>back on the Island... 30 years
earlier.</i>

549
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:31,292
Jin?

550
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,563
Dude, I can't believe it.

551
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:36,631
Oh!

552
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,633
Oh!

553
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,169
easy on the ribs there,
Kong. I actually missed that.

554
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,838
I missed you, too, Hugo. Sawyer.

555
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:45,807
Doc.

556
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:52,012
Good to see you, Kate.

557
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,214
You too, James.

558
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:57,117
So what's up with you guys
and the old Dharma jumpsuits?

559
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,787
We're in the Dharma initiative.

560
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,656
It's 1977.

561
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,191
Uh... what?

562
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,391
What about everyone else from the plane?

563
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,956
They could still be out there.
What do you mean, everyone else?

564
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:11,825
Sayid was on the plane,
too, Lapidus and Sun.

565
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:14,361
<i>As Jin began his search to find Sun,</i>

566
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:18,197
<i>Sawyer created a cover
story for the new arrivals,</i>

567
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,399
y'all are gonna be the
second batch of recruits

568
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,702
comin' in off the sub, pullin'
into port right about now.

569
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,037
everybody say,
"namaste!" namaste.

570
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,140
<i>30 years in the future,</i>

571
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,642
<i>sun began her search for Jin.</i>

572
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,144
hello.

573
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,546
Who the hell are you?
My name's Christian.

574
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,448
I'm looking for my husband.

575
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,952
I'm sorry, but you have a
bit of a journey ahead of you.

576
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,187
Where did you get this?
Who gave this to you?

577
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,357
He said his name was Christian.

578
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,192
He said if I ever wanted
to see my husband again,

579
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,094
I had to wait here for John Locke. But
considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath.

580
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:56,165
well, you might
want to look outside.

581
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:06,878
<i>A man who looked like John
Locke was on the Island...</i>

582
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,179
Morning.

583
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,947
Hello.

584
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,082
<i>And he raised many questions.</i>

585
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,785
Nobody remembers you being on the plane.

586
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,288
Well, I don't remember being on
it either. What do you remember?

587
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,857
I remember dying.

588
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,194
hello, Ben.

589
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,964
my God.

590
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,066
You're alive. Yes, I am.

591
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,004
Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.

592
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,907
What, John, don't you trust
me here with my former people?

593
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:40,676
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

594
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:43,245
<i>Ben quickly realized</i>

595
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,748
<i>there was something very
different about this man.</i>

596
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:48,483
How is it that you
know where you're going?

597
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:52,287
<i>He was no longer plagued by
fear and doubt... I just know.</i>

598
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:55,157
<i>But more in touch with
the power of the Island</i>

599
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:57,693
<i>than he'd ever been
before. I brought dinner.</i>

600
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,662
Hello, Richard. It's been a while.

601
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,299
Who's that man he's talking
to? His name is Richard alpert.

602
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:07,268
He's a kind of... Advisor.

603
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:09,336
<i>Richard alpert</i>

604
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,905
<i>had lived on the Island
for a very long time,</i>

605
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:14,374
<i>and he did not appear to age.</i>

606
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:18,846
<i>He was a devoted servant to
the Island and its leaders.</i>

607
00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:21,482
I am the leader now, right?
Yes, John, that's right.

608
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:24,918
Good. Then I would like
you to take me to Jacob.

609
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:27,353
Can you do that? Yeah, of course.

610
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:28,621
Fantastic.

611
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:30,757
we all answer to someone, John.

612
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:34,126
And whom might that
be? His name is Jacob.

613
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:36,829
<i>The man known as Jacob</i>

614
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,930
<i>was a mystery to the Island inhabitants.</i>

615
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:41,299
<i>Jacob wanted it done.
Jacob talks to me, John.</i>

616
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:43,735
No one else has ever seen him?

617
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,970
That's right. How convenient.

618
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:52,076
<i>Jacob was a spiritual presence
on the Island for centuries</i>

619
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,580
<i>and has seen many people
make their way to his home.</i>

620
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:59,884
I take it you're here 'cause of the
ship. How did they find the Island?

621
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:04,955
<i>You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.
I don't have to ask. You brought them here.</i>

622
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:07,891
<i>Still trying to prove me wrong,
aren't you? You are wrong.</i>

623
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,726
Am I?

624
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:11,360
<i>Jacob's optimism</i>

625
00:31:11,428 --> 00:31:13,896
<i>was a stark contrast to his Nemesis.</i>

626
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,397
They come. They fight.

627
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:18,033
They destroy. They corrupt.

628
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:20,035
It always ends the same.

629
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:22,103
It only ends once.

630
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:26,450
Anything that happens
before that is just progress.

631
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,292
<i>But the conflict with this man in Black</i>

632
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,995
<i>had rules which prevented
them from harming one another.</i>

633
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:35,098
Do you have any idea how
badly I want to kill you?

634
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:39,503
Yes. One of these days, I'm going
to find a loophole, my friend.

635
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,372
Well, when you do, I'll be right here.

636
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,841
<i>Jacob did not confine
himself to the Island.</i>

637
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,378
Excuse me, sir? Could you help
me? What are you looking for?

638
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:51,080
<i>He made contact with some
of the Oceanic survivors...</i>

639
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:56,219
<i>at critical moments in their lives...</i>

640
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:58,821
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be all right.

641
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:01,557
<i>Though they had no idea who he was.</i>

642
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:08,429
one of these yours? I guess
it just needed a little push.

643
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:12,266
<i>Some of Jacob's visits
occurred long before</i>

644
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:14,336
<i>the Oceanic passengers
crashed on the Island.</i>

645
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,905
I'm very sorry about your
mother and father, James.

646
00:32:16,972 --> 00:32:19,240
Be good, Katie.

647
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:22,076
<i>And for others... Oh. Sorry.</i>

648
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:25,413
<i>Actually, I'm only going a few blocks,
if you want to share. He provided guidance</i>

649
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,716
<i>that would eventually lead them back
to the Island. Ajira airways flight 316.</i>

650
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,884
<i>It's your choice, Hugo.</i>

651
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:34,454
<i>But on the Island,
Jacob remained a mystery,</i>

652
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:38,491
<i>and one man was very eager
to find him. For some time,</i>

653
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,895
you all have been accepting
orders from a man named Jacob.

654
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,564
Well, I'm gonna go and see Jacob,

655
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,699
and I'd like all of you to come with me.

656
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,535
I'm starting to think John
Locke is gonna be trouble.

657
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:52,405
Why do you think I tried to kill him?

658
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:55,307
I know we've had our
differences in the past, John,

659
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,909
but if you need Jacob to
help you reunite your people,

660
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:02,079
then I'll do whatever... I'm not
interested in being reunited with my people.

661
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,282
<i>Then why are we going to
Jacob? So I can kill him.</i>

662
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,685
<i>But in order to kill
Jacob, this man needed help.</i>

663
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,155
<i>Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?</i>

664
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,923
Because...

665
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,993
Despite your loyal
service to this Island,

666
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,362
you had to watch your
own daughter gunned down

667
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,131
right in front of you. And
your reward? You were banished.

668
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,200
And you did all this

669
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:28,036
in the name of a man
you've never even met.

670
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:30,639
So the question is, Ben,

671
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:33,508
<i>why the hell wouldn't
you wanna kill Jacob?</i>

672
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,377
<i>But Jacob had friends
aboard the Ajira flight.</i>

673
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:39,680
what's in the box? We
need to show it to somebody.

674
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:42,917
What for? So they'll know
who they're up against.

675
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,556
<i>Ilana was a devoted follower of Jacob...</i>

676
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,493
<i>and he came to her at a critical time.</i>

677
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,995
I'm here because I need your help.

678
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:59,030
Will you help me, Ilana?

679
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:00,966
Yes.

680
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,934
<i>But the man who looked like Locke</i>

681
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:06,671
<i>finally reached his destination.</i>

682
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:07,772
Hello, Jacob.

683
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,076
Well, you found your loophole.

684
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:14,111
Indeed I did.

685
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,581
<i>And you have no idea</i>

686
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,217
what I've gone through

687
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:21,684
to be here.

688
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,786
Have you met before?

689
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,855
In a manner of speaking.

690
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:30,694
<i>Outside...</i>

691
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:33,230
<i>Ilana and her team arrived.</i>

692
00:34:33,298 --> 00:34:34,898
Don't shoot.

693
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:38,335
Richard, I'm Ilana.

694
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,537
I have something you need to see.

695
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,541
I don't understand.

696
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,478
If this is Locke...

697
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,079
Who's in there?

698
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:55,551
<i>All the pieces were in place...</i>

699
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:58,086
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

700
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:00,222
<i>Leaving Ben
face-to-face...</i>

701
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:02,657
<i>Benjamin... With the
Island's spiritual leader.</i>

702
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,928
Whatever he's told you, I want
you to understand one thing...

703
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:09,830
you have a choice.

704
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:13,967
<i>But Jacob had neglected
Ben for far too long.</i>

705
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:19,539
Oh... so now, after all this time,

706
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:23,209
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

707
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:27,546
Well...

708
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:35,986
they're coming.

709
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:37,121
What?

710
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:38,988
They're coming.

711
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,876
Let me get this straight.

712
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:59,010
All this already happened. Yes.

713
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:01,379
Then what am I gonna
say next? I don't know.

714
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,915
<i>Ha! Then your theory is wrong!</i>

715
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:05,984
<i>Hugo attempted to comprehend</i>

716
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:08,052
<i>the complex laws of time travel,</i>

717
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,721
<i>and along with Jack and Kate,</i>

718
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:12,823
<i>he did his best to adjust to life</i>

719
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:15,292
<i>in the Dharma initiative of the
1970s. Why don't we carpool?</i>

720
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,661
It'll help with global warming,
which hasn't happened yet,

721
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:21,464
<i>so maybe we can prevent it.
Sawyer's cover story worked,</i>

722
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:24,767
<i>and they were each assigned
jobs within the community.</i>

723
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:27,503
And don't forget to
try the dipping sauces.

724
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,906
<i>They really bring out the ham. But
their arrival weighed heavily on Juliet,</i>

725
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:33,108
<i>who knew Sawyer's history with Kate</i>

726
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:36,411
<i>and believed her life with
Sawyer would never be the same.</i>

727
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,113
It's over, isn't it?

728
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:39,781
What's over?

729
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,984
Us... playing house.

730
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:45,120
we got a
hostile inside the perimeter.

731
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:46,688
<i>As for Sayid... Move.</i>

732
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,757
<i>He was separated from his friends</i>

733
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,927
<i>at the time of the flash,</i>

734
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:54,563
<i>and his arrival aroused suspicion of
the new recruits. I guess we found Sayid.</i>

735
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,332
<i>But everything on the Island... <
/i> Hey, can I get a hand with this?</i>

736
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,601
<i>Was about to change. Dan.</i>

737
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:02,771
Hey, Miles.

738
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:05,807
what the hell
are you doing back here, Dan?

739
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,609
<i>this is what
I'm doing back here.</i>

740
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,545
<i>Daniel Faraday endured the
time flashes on the Island</i>

741
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:12,848
<i>with the rest of the Oceanic survivors,</i>

742
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:15,350
<i>and during a visit to the 1950s,</i>

743
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:18,720
<i>he learned the others
had a hydrogen bomb.</i>

744
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:21,923
You need to take it off
this platform and bury it.

745
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,359
<i>When Faraday arrived in the 1970s,</i>

746
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,328
<i>he focused his energies on finding a way</i>

747
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:28,230
<i>to change the future,</i>

748
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,565
<i>and with a new Dharma
station under construction,</i>

749
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,167
<i>the timing was perfect.</i>

750
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,468
The Dharma folks at
the Swan work site...

751
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:35,770
they're gonna drill into the ground

752
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,183
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

753
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,018
In order to contain it,
they're gonna have to

754
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:42,887
cement the entire area in, like
Chernobyl.

755
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:45,990
they're gonna spend the next 20 years

756
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,293
keeping that energy at
bay by pressing a button...

757
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,995
<i>A button that your friend Desmond...
system failure.</i>

758
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,598
Will one day fail to push,

759
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,833
<i>and that will cause your
plane to crash on this Island.</i>

760
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,358
I think we can change that.

761
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:02,360
Then that hatch will never be built,

762
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:05,163
and your plane will land
just like it's supposed to.

763
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:08,432
And just how exactly do you
plan on destroying this energy?

764
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,502
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

765
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:14,037
<i>Jack was inspired.</i>

766
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,239
Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it?

767
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:20,877
<i>and when Faraday
was shot and killed,</i>

768
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:24,847
<i>Jack assumed Faraday's mission. We
disappeared off that plane and ended up here</i>

769
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:27,449
because this is our destiny.

770
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:30,886
<i>Jack convinced the others
to take him to the bomb.</i>

771
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:34,456
<i>If he could prevent flight
815 from ever crashing,</i>

772
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:37,392
<i>he could eliminate all
the pain and suffering</i>

773
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,094
<i>the survivors endured.</i>

774
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:41,363
Well... now what?

775
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,134
<i>Using Faraday's journal as a guide,</i>

776
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:48,537
<i>Sayid extracted the core of the bomb.</i>

777
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:52,306
<i>But there was only one way to
get to the Swan site...</i>

778
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,610
<i>and that was through
the Dharma compound...</i>

779
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:59,413
that's not good, right?

780
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:01,949
<i>Which was already on High alert</i>

781
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:05,118
<i>to hunt down Sayid and the
rest of the new arrivals.</i>

782
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:06,420
Hey!

783
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,298
get in.

784
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:21,200
<i>with Jin and Hurley's help,
Jack and Sayid escaped.</i>

785
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:23,635
I don't know where we're
going. The Swan site.

786
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:25,804
Swan it is.
Jack, what's at the Swan?

787
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:28,773
I think I found a way to
get you back to your wife.

788
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,705
Don't worry, dude.

789
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,908
Everything'll be fine when
Jack changes the future.

790
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,378
It's time for me to go.

791
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:41,514
Be careful. It's rigged
to explode on impact.

792
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,477
Sayid, this is gonna work.

793
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:46,946
<i>Jack was ready... See
you in Los Angeles.</i>

794
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:49,850
<i>But before he could finish
what he started... Jack?</i>

795
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:52,785
<i>He needed Kate on his side.</i>

796
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:56,422
Nothing in my life
has ever felt so right.

797
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,859
I just need you to believe that.

798
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,330
it won't shut down!

799
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:07,299
Something's pulling the
drill down. We hit the pocket!

800
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,836
it's about to happen.

801
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:13,138
Are you with me on this?

802
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:14,606
Yes.

803
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:17,475
Then let's go.

804
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:20,177
<i>When Jack approached the Swan site,</i>

805
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,380
<i>he was spotted by Dharma security...</i>

806
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:28,085
<i>but help soon arrived.</i>

807
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,621
Uhh!

808
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:36,659
Aah! put your guns down.

809
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,095
All right, you can
come down out now, doc!

810
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,735
<i>Most believe that what's done</i>

811
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:50,205
<i>is done.</i>

812
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:53,408
<i>You cannot change fate,</i>

813
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:55,844
<i>no matter how hard you try.</i>

814
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:02,616
<i>And those who challenge what is destined</i>

815
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:05,786
<i>will always be met</i>

816
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,321
<i>with disappointment...</i>

817
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:14,851
this don't look like LAX

818
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,907
<i>for fate has a way...</i>

819
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:23,331
<i>of charting its own course.</i>

820
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,454
Aah! Help! Juliet!

821
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,655
Help! Juliet!

822
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,787
aah! No!

823
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,647
No! aah!

824
00:41:32,682 --> 00:41:35,121
Don't you leave me.

825
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:37,526
it's okay.

826
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,677
<i>Don't you leave me!
I love you.</i>

827
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:43,634
No, you don't let go. I love you, James.

828
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,816
No. I love you so much.

829
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,456
<i>No! No, don't let go! Aah!</i>

830
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:49,628
<i>Juliet!</i>

831
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:50,765
<i>No!</i>

832
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:57,761
<i>But before one surrenders
to the hands of destiny...</i>

833
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,511
<i>one might consider</i>

834
00:42:01,711 --> 00:42:05,137
<i>the power of the human spirit...</i>

835
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:10,503
<i>and the force that lies</i>

836
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,867
<i>in one's own free will.</i>

837
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:16,992
Come on!

838
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:18,942
come on!

839
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:20,961
Come on, you son of a bitch!
