1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,084
Previously on "lost"

2
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:04,167
You're the son of a
bitch who shot my kid.

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:09,134
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,533
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

5
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,867
Your friend is dead.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,967
Jack!

7
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,867
What happened?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,834
What is it you want?

9
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:26,468
I don't have any secrets.
Why are you doing this?

10
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,267
You have to give your friend
this pill. What is in it?

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,533
Poison. Why would you
people wanna kill sayid?

12
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,867
There is a darkness growing in him.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,434
And once it reaches his heart,
everything your friend once was

14
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:42,867
Will be gone.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,301
What are you hiding from me?

16
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,900
The pill was poison.
They wanted me to kill you.

17
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,500
The meter doesn't stop
until you get out, pal.

18
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,934
Keep the change.

19
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,267
Sayid.

20
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:31,867
Hello, nadia.

21
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:37,967
You're here!

22
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,067
Where were you, uncle sayid?

23
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,401
I was in sydney. Where's sydney?

24
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,468
In australia.

25
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:49,201
You bring flowers for my wife?

26
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,134
I'll give them to you, if you want.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,800
It's good to see you, sayid.

28
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:00,034
It's good to see you,
too, brother. Come.

29
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:07,967
Uncle sayid, what did you
bring us from australia?

30
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,934
Go look in my bag.
It's on the couch.

31
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,167
It's good you came, sayid.
They've missed you.

32
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,001
We're lucky he even showed up--

33
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:22,633
The world traveler off on
his exotic business trips.

34
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,633
Translating contracts
for an oil company

35
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,767
Is hardly exotic...
and it's painfully dull.

36
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,667
Thin the world
veryof dry cleaning.E

37
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:37,633
He's being modest.
Omer's just opened up a new store.

38
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,134
Congratulations.

39
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:42,633
I thought we talked about cell
phones at the dinner table.

40
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,267
Dinner is over. This is business.

41
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,700
Yes?

42
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:59,334
Did you get my letters?

43
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,934
Yes.

44
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:04,900
You never wrote back.

45
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,967
These are awesome! Thanks!

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,601
You're welcome.

47
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,501
Mommy, we found a picture
of you in uncle sayid's bag.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,933
I want to talk to you.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,401
I want some answers.

50
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,933
Answers to what?

51
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:55,768
Let's start with that machine.

52
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:05,000
You hooked me up to this thing,

53
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:08,134
You stuck needles in me,

54
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,334
And you called it a test.

55
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,267
For every man, there is a scale.

56
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:18,900
On one side of the scale,
there is good.

57
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,367
On the other side--Evil.

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,601
This machine tells us

59
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,768
How the scale is balanced.

60
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,900
And yours...

61
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,833
Tipped the wrong way.

62
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:38,134
And that's why you
tried to poison me?

63
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,634
Yes.

64
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:45,134
I think it would be
best if you were dead.

65
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,234
You think you know me,
but you don't.

66
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,967
I'm a good man.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,200
So if you're trying
to kill me--Uhh!

68
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,900
Go.

69
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:17,401
Leave this place.

70
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:19,467
Never come back.

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,933
Are you ready?

72
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,933
Why does it have to me be?

73
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,467
I mean, you could send
sawyer or jin or...

74
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,701
Do it yourself.
If i could do it myself,

75
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,301
I wouldn't be asking you, clai.

76
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,833
If i go in there,

77
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,401
I need to know you'll
do what you said.

78
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,401
I want my son back.

79
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,134
I always do what i say.

80
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,267
Are you gonna hurt them?

81
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,867
Only the ones who won't listen.

82
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,534
Aah! It's me.

83
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,534
Calm down. What are you doing?

84
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,767
It's 2:30  the morning.

85
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,000
Sayid, i'm in trouble.

86
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,334
What kind of trouble?

87
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:26,133
I borrowed money to
open the second store.

88
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,467
But...

89
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:31,033
I didn't borrow it from the bank.

90
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,968
I paid the loan back,

91
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,801
But the man who
lent me this money--

92
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,868
He says i still owe him
interest every month...

93
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,033
For as long as i own my business.

94
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,234
If you need money,
i'll lend it to you--

95
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,868
I don't need money, sayid.

96
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,300
I need you to convince these
people to leave me alone.

97
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:52,701
"Convince" them? Sayid,
don't forget who you're talking to.

98
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:56,067
I know what you did in the war.

99
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,567
You were an interrogator
for the republican guard.

100
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:05,968
I know what kind of man you are.

101
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,334
If you think i'm
going to hurt someone

102
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,000
Just because you made a
bad business decision--

103
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,868
Look, this is not about me!

104
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,167
Our life savings-- It's all gone,
sayid. All of it.

105
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,133
We could lose our home.

106
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,801
Please.

107
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:23,567
Look... i know you
care about nadia.

108
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:27,400
If you care about us-- About her...

109
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,701
You will do this, sayid.

110
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:35,968
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm not that man anymore.

112
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,133
What are you doing?

113
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,634
I'm leaving.

114
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,767
I've been banished.

115
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,834
Banished? For what?

116
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:11,267
Apparently, i'm evil.

117
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,367
These people say i'm
better off dead...

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,801
Which is surprising,

119
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,868
Considering they were the
ones who saved my life.

120
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,868
Well, actually,
they're not. They...

121
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,801
They tried to save you, but...

122
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,934
You were dead, man.

123
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:32,167
For two hours.

124
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,634
Trt me, when--When-
When you sat up,

125
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,634
They were just as surprised
as the rest of us.

126
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:41,367
So whatever brought you back,
it wasn't them.

127
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:46,734
Hold it.

128
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,367
Stop! Don't shoot her!

129
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,467
What are you doing here?

130
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,334
He wants to see you.

131
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,934
Speak english.

132
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,901
Who wants to see me?

133
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,501
You know who.

134
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:13,567
If he wants to see me,
then tell him to come in.

135
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,501
No, he wants you to go to him.

136
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:18,100
He's waiting outside
beyond the outer wall.

137
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,734
I'm not a fool.

138
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,634
If i step outside this temple...

139
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,067
He'll kill me.

140
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, then maybe you should
send someone he won't kill.

141
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,534
Stop her!

142
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:41,601
Ah, that's gonna be
a little difficult.

143
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,467
We can't find them.

144
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,200
Come on!

145
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,701
Come with me.

146
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:01,133
I thought you wanted me to leave.

147
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,234
Things have changed.

148
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,567
Your friends-- Shephard and reyes--

149
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,533
Do you know where they went?

150
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,900
No, i don't.

151
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,900
Why is claire here?

152
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,101
And what was she talking about?

153
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:39,301
She's a confused girl,

154
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:43,034
Under the influence
of an angry man.

155
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,800
What man?

156
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,934
For years,

157
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,934
He has been trapped.

158
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,468
But now jacob's gone.

159
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:54,800
He's free.

160
00:12:56,334 --> 00:13:00,900
This man will not stop
until he has destroyed

161
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:04,367
Every living thing on this island.

162
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,967
He is evil incarnate.

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,667
And you want me to speak to him?

164
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,301
No.

165
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,000
I want you to kill him.

166
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,367
He will come to you
as someone you know...

167
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,600
Someone who has died.

168
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,401
As soon as you see him...

169
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,334
Plunge this deep into his chest.

170
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,501
If you allow him to speak,

171
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,434
It is already too late.

172
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,800
Since i've been here,

173
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:44,401
I've been drowned,
beaten and tortured at your hands.

174
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,434
Why would i ever do
anything for you?

175
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:52,101
You said that there is
still good in your soul.

176
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,167
Then prove it.

177
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:06,167
How long are you staying,
uncle sayid?

178
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,767
Just a few more days.

179
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,434
I have to go to toronto...

180
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:13,700
To work.

181
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,034
We like it when you're here.

182
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,568
Yeah, and mommy likes it, too.

183
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,834
Okay. Be good.

184
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,600
Sayid!

185
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,067
Omer!

186
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,067
Is my husband going
to be all right?

187
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:59,401
We're taking him into surgery now.

188
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,000
He's suffered a punctured lung
and some internal bleeding.

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,667
Do you know how this happened?

190
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,134
E.M.T.S thinhe was mugged.

191
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,434
I'll come get you as
soon as he's stable.

192
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:11,134
Sayid! Where are you going?
Stay here with omer.

193
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,533
This wasn't a mugging, was it?

194
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:17,434
Whatever you're
thinking of doing...

195
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,101
Don't do it.

196
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,368
I don't want you to.

197
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,700
Please... just...

198
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,201
Go home.

199
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,900
Wait for the kids.

200
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:30,600
Make them feel safe, sayid.

201
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,667
Will you of that?

202
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,600
Hello?

203
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,001
Sayid?

204
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,367
Hello, kate.

205
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Are you leaving?

206
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,934
I am not exactly sure.

207
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,901
What'd i miss?

208
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,034
Ask miles.

209
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,001
Thank you.

210
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:33,333
It's good to see you, too, miles.

211
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,101
Sawyer sent you packing, huh?

212
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,068
I thought about going
after him, too.

213
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,068
But, um, i knew he'd
just end up berating me

214
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:48,233
Until i turned
around and came back.

215
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,767
That pretty much what happened?

216
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,134
Pretty much.

217
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,467
Well...

218
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,901
Welcome back to the circus.

219
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,034
What's going on in here? Well,
let's see...

220
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:03,767
Oh, that australian chick's back.

221
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,034
Wait. What?

222
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,134
You know, the--The blonde-
One that had the baby.

223
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,434
Claire?

224
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,500
Right. Claire.

225
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,901
She just strolled in
here a couple hours ago,

226
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,867
Acting all weird.

227
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,101
Still hot, though.

228
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,801
Miles, where is she?

229
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,333
Where is she?

230
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,734
Hello, sayid.

231
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,467
Now why'd you go and do that?

232
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,834
You want it back?

233
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,134
Take it. I won't bite.

234
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,468
What are you?

235
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,468
Well, sayid, you seem to
have some idea about that,

236
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,934
Considering that you
stabbed me in the chest

237
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,767
Without even saying hello.

238
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,767
What did they tell you?

239
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,434
They said you were evil incarnate.

240
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,567
I feel sorry for you.

241
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,600
Why?

242
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,934
Dogen--The man who
sent you out here--

243
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,234
Knew that you had no
chance of killing me.

244
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:37,600
And he believed that i would
kill you if you tried.

245
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,134
And this wasn't the first time that

246
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:44,201
He tried to get someone else
to do it for him, was it?

247
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,967
No.

248
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:50,834
Then shame on you for being
talked into it so easily.

249
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:54,934
And what is it you are
trying to talk me into?

250
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,367
Sorry?

251
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,534
You haven't killed me.

252
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,312
Clearly, there's
something you want.

253
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,615
I just want you to deliver
a message, that's all.

254
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,334
Then why didn't you just
have claire deliver it?

255
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,503
Because it would mean a
lot more coming from you.

256
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:13,422
Sayid, if you'll do this for me...

257
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:19,789
What if I told you that you
could have anything you wanted?

258
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:26,823
What if I said you could have
anything in the entire world?

259
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:32,656
I would tell you that the
only thing I ever wanted

260
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,789
Died in my arms.

261
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,923
And I'll never see it again.

262
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:45,489
But what if you could?

263
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:03,055
Uh...

264
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,723
We had an unfortunate incident

265
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,222
Involving a boomerang.

266
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,623
My apologies.

267
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:18,356
Oh, what time did
the kids go to bed?

268
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,689
About two hos ago.

269
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,665
And what did you tell them?

270
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:26,682
Daddy had an accident,

271
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:28,881
But that he's going to be fine.

272
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,947
He's still recovering
from surgery, but...

273
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,547
He's awake now.

274
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,264
Did he tell you about the loan?

275
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,261
Look, I have money.

276
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,228
No.

277
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:49,404
This is omer's responsibility.

278
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,461
He brought this on himself.

279
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,907
Why didn't you want to be with me?

280
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:09,041
You carry my picture
around with you, sayid.

281
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,573
If you care about me,

282
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:15,274
Why did you push me
towards your brother?

283
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,940
For the last 12 years,

284
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:28,607
I've been trying
to wash my hands...

285
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,540
Of all the horrible
things I've done.

286
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:37,074
I can't be with you...

287
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,774
Because I don't deserve you.

288
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,673
What happened?

289
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:10,141
There is a man in the jungle...

290
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,141
About a mile south of us,

291
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,907
By the outer wall.

292
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,874
He sent me back here
to give you a message.

293
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:20,540
He wants you to know
that jacob is dead.

294
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,673
And because he's gone,

295
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:26,007
None of you have to
stay here any longer.

296
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,374
You're free.

297
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:30,349
The man that I met

298
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:33,723
Is leaving the island forever.

299
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:36,433
And those of you who
want to go with him

300
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:39,063
Should leave the
temple and join him.

301
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:42,101
You have until sundown to decide.

302
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,676
What happens at sundown if we stay?

303
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,153
You die.

304
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,381
Hey!

305
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:00,732
When did you get back?

306
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,995
Are ford and kwon with you?
Where is claire?

307
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:05,194
Okay, I need you to tell me
what I need to know before I--

308
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,165
I sa, where is claire?

309
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:12,417
All right. Just let go of me, okay?

310
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:20,217
You have two minutes.

311
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,217
...fade away

312
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,050
Catch a falling star and
put it in your pocket

313
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:28,883
Save it for a rainy day

314
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:33,317
For love may come and
tap you on the shoulder

315
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,451
Some starless night

316
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:39,250
Claire? * just in...

317
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,084
Claire, it's me.

318
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,217
Kate?

319
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,150
Are you okay?

320
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:54,084
I-I can't believe you're here.

321
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,117
Did they capture you, too?

322
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,583
No. No, they...

323
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:01,117
Why did they put you down here?

324
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,050
What happened?

325
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,783
They have my son, kate.
They have aaron.

326
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,750
They took him from me. No. No.

327
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:10,883
Claire, they don't have aaron.

328
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,683
I took him.

329
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:14,017
I...

330
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,284
What?

331
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:18,117
I took him off the island.

332
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,650
You were gone,
and we couldn't find you.

333
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:22,850
So...

334
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,683
I raised him.

335
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,451
And...

336
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,917
He is the most beautiful,
amazing little boy.

337
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,384
But I came back here to rescue you

338
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,551
So that you could be with him,

339
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:39,484
So that you guys could
be together again.

340
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,384
I'm not the one that needs
to be rescued, kate.

341
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,451
Time's up. Let's go.

342
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,451
No! No! Wait!

343
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:50,650
No! Wait! Wait!
You wanted to see her.

344
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,950
So let's go.

345
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:54,683
He's coming, kate.

346
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,716
He's coming,
and they can't stop him!

347
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,464
All right, hurry!

348
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:07,715
Everybody, calm down!
It's going to be okay.

349
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:09,236
No! No! Wait!

350
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,529
Hang on!

351
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,297
Hey!

352
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,364
Hey, you created a panic here.
Our people are leaving.

353
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:17,431
I was asked to deliver a message,

354
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:19,397
And that's what I did.

355
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:21,963
What your people do
now is up to them.

356
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:25,076
Cindy, just wait.
You're all safe here.

357
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,289
As long we stay in the temple,
he can't touch us.

358
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,480
You heard him. Jacob's dead.

359
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,211
And if it isn't safe here anymore,

360
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:33,259
We can't take that risk.

361
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:36,531
Everyone, listen!

362
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:38,130
This is a bluff!

363
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:41,297
He can't come in! He can't come in!

364
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,197
Hey, what happened out there?
One minute, you're banished,

365
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,284
The next you're telling

366
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,531
everyone they're gonna die.
That's the sum of it.

367
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,330
So are we getting out of
here or what? Not yet.

368
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:53,831
I have to return this.

369
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:05,731
Going to pick up the kids?

370
00:27:07,898 --> 00:27:10,164
Excuse me?

371
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,831
Why don't you get in the car?

372
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,674
Get in, sayid.

373
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,986
1¿Õ°×Ê±¼äÖá

374
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,134
Why don't you have a seat?

375
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,579
Hey, you want some eggs?

376
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:09,585
I can, uh...

377
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,946
Make whatever you want-
fried, scrambled.

378
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:14,356
Uh, we still got that poacher?
Where's the poacher?

379
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:17,048
You want poached? 'cause I could
make you some good poached eggs.

380
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:19,382
No, thank you.

381
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:20,861
I make good eggs.

382
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:23,894
No?

383
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,943
All right.

384
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:36,276
Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup, ba, ba

385
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:40,510
Martin keamy.

386
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:44,109
Sayid jarrah,
but you already know that.

387
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:47,510
Uh, that, I do. Yeah.

388
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,142
Right.

389
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:54,676
So...

390
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,843
Sayid...

391
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,877
How's your brother doin'?

392
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,676
His brother got mugged

393
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,776
Right out front of his own store.

394
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,943
It was just... terrible.

395
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:09,243
Well, but at least this way,
you know,

396
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,243
You're still around to
take care of his family.

397
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:14,510
You do want to take care
of his family, don't you?

398
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:19,743
Yes?

399
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:23,409
You know, I can see that you're
a very... direct guy, sayid,

400
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:26,276
So I'm just gonna get to the point.

401
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,343
Your brother--he borrowed
some money from me,

402
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:29,776
And just like anybody

403
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,576
Whborrows money or
has a loan to pay,

404
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,952
He has to make payments.

405
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:36,610
My brother told me he's
paid you everything he owes,

406
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:38,543
But that you still want more.

407
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,490
Sayid, that's a lie.
You brother does owe me,

408
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,642
And somebody is gonna
pay me that money.

409
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:48,433
Did you put my brother
in the hospital?

410
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,510
Oh, you think it was me?

411
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,910
I didn't do that.

412
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,543
You know, it's a
dangerous world, sayid.

413
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:03,276
Y-you know that because
you're from iraq.

414
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,576
You never know when somebody's
just gonna sneak up--

415
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,877
Uhh!

416
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,776
Uhh!

417
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:16,476
Sayid...

419
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,409
Okay, just relax now. Shut up.

420
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,443
Okay. Fine.

421
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:25,409
Fine. Okay, it's done.

422
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:27,109
All right?

423
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,142
Y-your brother doesn't
owe me anything.

424
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:31,743
The debt's forgiven, all right?

425
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:36,543
Good? Okay?

426
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:40,009
Just relax and... forget about it.

427
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:45,009
I can't.

428
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,409
Uhh!

429
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,036
Who are you?

430
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:34,014
No english.

431
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,004
You let him talk to you.

432
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:52,611
I stabbed him in the chest
like you told me to.

433
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:56,105
Then I let him talk to me.

434
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:04,775
That's twice you've tried to
have someone else kill me.

435
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:08,012
You had the opportunity
to do it yourself.

436
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,650
Why didn't you?

437
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,384
I was a businessman once...

438
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,351
In osaka.

439
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,084
I worked at a bank.

440
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:27,017
I was good at my job,

441
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,583
Very successful.

442
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,917
And one friday,

443
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,217
I was promoted.

444
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,917
My associates took
me out to celebrate.

445
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,080
I had too much to drink.

446
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:52,579
Every friday...

447
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,380
I picked my son up from baseball.

448
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,380
He was 12.

449
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,313
The accident was very bad.

450
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,913
I survived.

451
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:15,347
But my son...

452
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,414
And then...

453
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:23,213
In the hospital...

454
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:28,613
A man came to me...

455
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:30,880
A man I had never met.

456
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:33,579
And he told me that

457
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,813
He could save my son's life,

458
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:40,980
But I would have to come
here to this island,

459
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:43,813
Where I would have a new job.

460
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:50,746
And I could never see my boy again.

461
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,177
Who was this man?

462
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,543
His name was jacob.

463
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,943
Jacob drives a hard bargain.

464
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,177
The man outside...

465
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,144
I take it he offered
you a similar bargain?

466
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:22,977
Yes.

467
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:35,849
It is sundown.

468
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,649
Will you choose to stay or go?

469
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:44,761
I'd like to stay.

470
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,397
Oh, my god!

471
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:31,730
What have you done?!

472
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:44,698
Do you realize what you just did?!

473
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,264
He was the only thing
keeping it out!

474
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:49,830
Idiot!

475
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:52,598
You just let it in!

476
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,397
I know.

477
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,510
We gotta go now.

00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,643
Just answer the question.
They're gone.

484
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,377
Everyone's gone.
I'm the only one left.

485
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,204
Kate and I got separated. Lapidus?

486
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,152
How did you... we'll
play catch-up later.

487
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:29,497
You want to live,
you better move your ass.

488
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,190
What about jarrah? Is he here?

489
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,551
Yeah, he was headed to the pool room.
I'll go get him.

490
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:35,778
Linus, wait!

491
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,010
All right, the rest of you,
with me. Come on.

492
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:44,853
Claire, come on! Claire,
we gotta go.

493
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:46,598
You gotta get out of there. No.

494
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,785
What?! You'll be much safer here.

495
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,252
Sayid?

496
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:17,152
Come on.

497
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:19,286
I know a way out of here.

498
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:24,019
There's still time.

499
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,820
Not for me.

500
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,619
Where's your husband?

501
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,386
What?! Your husband
took off yesterday.

502
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:47,586
Jin was here? He's alive?
Last I saw him, yeah.

503
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,838
You do hear that, right?

504
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,616
You got a plan or you gonna
keep staring at the wall?

505
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:11,050
Yes, I have a plan.

506
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,183
