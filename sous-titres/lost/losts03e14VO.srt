1
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,616
And now dancing on stage three,

2
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,976
the pride of St. Paul...

3
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,435
Corvette!

4
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,757
That's the money for the orphanage!

5
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,809
That means, Mr. Lashade,
you're the Cobra.

6
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:28,840
Sorry, baby, it's just business.

7
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:30,836
All this time it was you!

8
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,918
Pretty and smart, what a shame.

9
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,508
Razzle dazzle!

10
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,167
Autumn, Crystal, bad news.

11
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,450
Corvette was working for the Cobra.

12
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:58,570
But fear not...

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,824
He will pay.

14
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,133
And... Cut!

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,833
- Check the gate!
- Checking.

16
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,150
Here, let me give you a hand.

17
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,952
Thank you. Billy Dee,
it was so great working with you.

18
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,013
No, the pleasure's all mine.
Thank you so much.

19
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,211
- You're sweet.
- Take care.

20
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:16,320
You, too.

21
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,710
All right.
That's a series wrap for Corvette!

22
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,714
Let's hear it for Nikki!

23
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:22,941
Well done!

24
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:25,770
Thank you. Thanks.

25
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,132
Brilliant, Nikki, as always.

26
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,752
You know, you don't need to die.

27
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:32,981
We can bring you back next season.

28
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,140
How?

29
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:35,772
Well, we could say that...

30
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,893
Corvette was wearing a bulletproof vest.

31
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:42,242
Bulletproof breast.

32
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,090
Look, I'm just a guest star,

33
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,424
and we all know what happens
to guest stars.

34
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,438
Now that your work's done here,

35
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:52,886
I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney
and heading back to L.A.

36
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:54,852
No, I'm not leaving Sydney.

37
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,635
I love you.

38
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,685
And I love you, too.

39
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,037
Son of a bitch.

40
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,273
All right. Come on. Let's go one more.

41
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,571
You said best out of five.

42
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,255
Well, now we're goin' best of seven.

43
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:25,676
You okay?

44
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:32,905
What happened?

45
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:33,991
Pa... l... s...

46
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,365
- What the hell did she say?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,303
Let's get her some water. Get help.

48
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,421
What are you doin'? Get movin'!

49
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,425
Dude...

50
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,615
Nikki's dead.

51
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,467
Who the hell's Nikki?

52
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:19,936
Subtitles : www.swsub.com

53
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,263
Howie, the frittada is amazing.

54
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,337
It's my new chef.

55
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,669
He's fantastic.

56
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,584
Paulo, come in here.

57
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,970
- Yes, sir?
- Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.

58
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,778
I'd like you to meet Nikki.

59
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,890
The food is amazing.

60
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:42,777
You're too kind.

61
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,967
The secret is the shaved truffles.

62
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,717
Luckily for you, they are in season.

63
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,083
You know, you should ask for a raise.

64
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:55,902
Excuse me.

65
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:57,992
He just came to Sydney.

66
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,091
Heard I was hiring
and showed up at my office every day

67
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,480
until I gave him the job.

68
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:06,637
Apparently, back home, he's the...

69
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:08,923
Wolfgang Puck of Brazil.

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Here.

71
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,806
Try one of his homemade rolls.

72
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,127
Please, please do.

73
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,376
It's...

74
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:26,661
Beautiful.

75
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,989
Howie, you shouldn't have.

76
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,367
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.

77
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:35,261
Not yet, but, when my wife...

78
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:57,177
He's gone.

79
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,714
I would have loved it
if you could've figured out a way

80
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:18,111
where I didn't have to eat
the same food as him.

81
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,586
So nobody else knows about this thing?

82
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,248
Everything in here is way off the books.

83
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,552
- What?
- Ashes are evidence, Paulo.

84
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,059
We poisoned him.
Let's not poison ourselves.

85
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,929
Razzle frickin' dazzle.

86
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,858
What happened?

87
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,058
We don't know.

88
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:01,119
She's got no gunshot wound,
no knife wound,

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,083
no polar bear bite, nothing.

90
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,093
Maybe it was something she ate.

91
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,340
Maybe she was poisoned.

92
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:09,255
We should check the food supply
to see if anyone else is sick.

93
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,108
She's got gunk under her fingernails.

94
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,089
Where'd you find her?

95
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,731
Right here.
She stumbled out of the jungle,

96
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,457
face planted.
She said something like "plywood"

97
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,959
and... sayonara.

98
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,737
Actually,
I think she said "power lines."

99
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,759
Who the hell knows what she said?
She was 5 seconds from dying.

100
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:31,208
She was probably seein' the light
at the end of the tunnel.

101
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,053
"Paulo lies!" That's what she said.

102
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,367
"Paulo lies," not "power lines."
Paulo lies.

103
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,687
Who the hell's Paulo?

104
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:37,955
Paulo's her...

105
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,387
husband or boyfriend

106
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,435
Whatever. They lived down the beach.

107
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,979
Well, where the hell is he?

108
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,095
'cause if he lies,
that might be a good place to start.

109
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:53,012
"English expat, Howard L. Zuckerman,

110
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:56,596

113
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,791
"from heart failure."

114
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,079
Are you chewing gum?

115
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:20,468
Nicotine gum.

116
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:22,655
I quit.

117
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,407
A toast...

118
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,044
To our new life together.

119
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:31,405
Cheers.

120
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:33,621
There's nowhere to sit.

121
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,157
No tables, no chairs, nothing.

122
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:38,720
Good call, Boone.

123
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,268
You want me to grab a chair
from the restaurant?

124
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,782
Forget it. Let's just leave!

125
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,842
You already screwed us
out of seats in first class.

126
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:46,680
Why would you be able to find them here?

127
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,667
Hey, can I have this chair, please?

128
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,519
Yeah. Be my guest.

129
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,069
Boone, let's just go!

130
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,594
Thanks anyway.

131
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,343
I'm coming, Shannon.

132
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,248
If you quit flirting with random guys,

133
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,207
maybe we could actually
get on the plane.

134
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,038
Promise me we'll never end up like them.

135
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,781
I promise.

136
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,979
Please help!

137
00:09:58,649 --> 00:09:59,806
Get away from there!

138
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,898
Hey! Get back! Get down!

139
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:03,494
Get away from there!

140
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,088
Are we alive?

141
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,207
Did we survive?

142
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:30,055
Look at me. Am I okay? Am I okay?

143
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,141
Do you have a pen?

144
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,520
Pen?

145
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,087
Does anybody have a pen?

146
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,381
Are you okay?

147
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,426
Yeah, I think so.

148
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:56,161
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

149
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,457
Where's the bag?

150
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:02,721
- What?
- The bag.

151
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:03,975
Paulo, where is it?

152
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,900
I'm telling you, this is the trail.

153
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,434
What do you know about tracking?

154
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,607
- Well, I know what a footprint is.
- Over here.

155
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,972
I'm guessin' that's Paulo.

156
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,219
He's just like Nikki. No wound, nothing.

157
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:38,672
Yeah, I know.

158
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:40,873
Why are his pants undone?

159
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:45,529
- And why is his shoe in that tree?
- Maybe he stepped on something.

160
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:52,787
You see something?

161
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:56,429
Nothing.

162
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:01,894
Don't.

163
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:07,567
Dude,
what are you doing?

164
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:08,738
Two people are dead.

165
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:10,582
You ever think
they might have been poisoned.

166
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,388
That's evidence.
You're messing up the crime scene.

167
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:14,553
Crime scene?

168
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:17,575
Is there a forensics hatch
I don't know about?

169
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,681
Monster.

170
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:27,698
How many times do I have to tell you,

171
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:29,550
there's no such thing as monsters?

172
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,583
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

173
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:35,027
It's not "Jurassic Park," Paulo.
It's the South Pacific.

174
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:37,612
Then what was it?
You saw the trees move.

175
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:42,207
Would you start focusing?
We've been here for six days, okay?

176
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:44,188
The coast guard
is gonna get here any second,

177
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,232
and I really don't think
that they're gonna take,

178
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,308
"hey, you know what?
I'm looking for my script bag"

179
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,298
as an excuse
for not getting on the rescue boat.

180
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:53,708
Did you guys lose your luggage?

181
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:57,820
I lost mine, too.
I found some other stuff, though,

182
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,074
so if you need anything,
pants or sweatshirt...

183
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,977
I can help you find some that fit.

184
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:07,927
I'm Ethan, by the way.

185
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:09,785
Hi. I'm Nikki...

186
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,436
and this is Paulo.

187
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,784
And you are so sweet, Ethan, but

188
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:17,356
actually, we're not looking for clothes.

189
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:19,946
Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.

190
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,636
You might have more luck
looking inland.

191
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,189
In the jungle?

192
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,251
The plane split apart
when it was over the island,

193
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,868
so some of the stuff might have
rained down in there.

194
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:31,780
Boone took the water!

195
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:34,765
What is going on?

196
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,894
Someone had to take responsibility.
It would have never lasted.

197
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,571
Leave him alone!

198
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,290
It's been six days,

199
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,572
and we're all still waiting
for someone to come.

200
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:51,965
We have to stop waiting.

201
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,688
We need to start figuring things out.

202
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,106
Now I found water,

203
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,008
fresh water up in the valley.

204
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,207
I'm taking a group at first light.

205
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:08,434
If y don't want to come,
then find another way to contribute,

206
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:12,580
because every man for himself
is not gonna work.

207
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,153
But if we can't live together...

208
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,104
we're gonna die alone.

209
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,257
I'm with Jin.

210
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:29,757
It's the monster.

211
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,969
Yeah, because that makes
the most sense.

212
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,005
It does.

213
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,381
Locke said when Eko died,
his last words were,

214
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:38,318
"you're next,"
and Nikki and Paulo were with them.

215
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:40,998
He was talking about them.

216
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,577
He wasn't saying
"you're next" about them.

217
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:47,433
He was saying "you're next"
as in you're all next.

218
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,417
Yeah, that's not really better.

219
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:52,038
All right, so here's how I see it.

220
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,398
We wanna know what happened?

221
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:57,240
We gotta find out whatever we can
about these jabonies.

222
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:58,507
Ja-bo-nies?

223
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,630
Nina and Pablo.

224
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,160
Dude, show some respect.

225
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,937
You know their names.
It Nikki and Paulo.

226
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,256
Whatever, Hugo.

227
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:06,813
Where's their tent?

228
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,916
And we better get some shovels.

229
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,539
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

230
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,850
Oh, hi.

231
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:24,919
You're a scientist, right?

232
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,610
And an educator, yes.

233
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,640
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

234
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:33,414
Well, since we got here,
I've discovered 20 new species.

235
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,233
I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.

236
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,836
That is, latrodectus regina.

237
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:41,892
Very dangerous.

238
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:44,330
They call her the medusa spider.

239
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,377
Her pheromones are very strong,

240
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:50,045
one whiff, and every male of the species
would be here in seconds.

241
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:51,845
Not unlike you, I guess.

242
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,450
So you're probably too busy
to help me, then.

243
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,743
No, not at all.

244
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:00,572
I'm fine. I can help you.

245
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,047
What can I do you for?

246
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:04,115
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

247
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:07,320
and since the plane broke apart
over the jungle,

248
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:11,051
I was wondering if you knew
about trajectories and stuff.

249
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,491
Do I?

250
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,164
Do I know about trajectories?

251
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,192
Allow me to draw you a map, madam.

252
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,989
Are you sure we should be listening
to a high school science teacher?

253
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,945
Junior high, and yes.

254
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,960
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

255
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,291
Leslie?

256
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:34,478
You're jealous!

257
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,697
Of him? Never.

258
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,009
Yeah, his spiders
turned me on so much,

259
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,070
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

260
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,310
I wouldn't be surprised.
You slept with Zuckerman.

261
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:48,042
I did that for us.

262
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:55,603
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just...
I don't trust that guy.

263
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:59,059
We should've gone to Ethan.
He would've helped.

264
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,229
Paulo, look.

265
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:05,542
Another plane.

266
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:08,920
Looks like it's been here a while.

267
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,232
Go up there.
Maybe there's a radio or some...

268
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:12,233
Are you insane?

269
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:14,253
If I go up there,
that thing's gonna fall.

270
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,392
You're not gonna fall.

271
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,160
What? You want me to die?

272
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,613
Come on. Let's keep going.

273
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,092
What is that?

274
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay. Let's do it.

275
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,037
Let's check it out.

276
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,694
So our carry-on bag fell from the sky,

277
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,716
opened a manhole, crawled inside

278
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,556
and closed the doors
behind itself?

279
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,566
You don't wanna climb up to a plane...

280
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,894
but now you want to climb down
a ladder into a dark tunnel?

281
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,157
I don't think so.

282
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,009
Hey, man, be careful.

283
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,055
Why? They don't live here anymore.

284
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,551
So Sun checked the food.

285
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:29,640
They're eating the same as us,
and no one else is sick.

286
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:30,908
Could be a virus.

287
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,227
Dude... Monster.

288
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,723
Creepy. They collected bugs?

289
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,795
I think these were Arzt's.

290
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:44,592
He collected all kinds of
different creepy crawlies before he...

291
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:46,094
Exploded.

292
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,389
They must've been friends.

293
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,722
<i>Exposé.</i>

294
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,090
Did you just say <i>Exposé</i>?

295
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,516
What the hell's <i>Exposé</i>?

296
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,257
Only the most awesome hour
of television ever.

297
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,512
It was like <i>Baywatch,</i> only better.

298
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,993
You've got Autumn and Crystal--
two stripers that solve crimes

299
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:06,495
with the help of their suave,
smooth-talking club owner, Mr. Lashade.

300
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,094
How'd I miss that one?

301
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,955
Check it out.
Look at the cast list. Nikki Fernandez.

302
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:13,420
That's gotta be
why she was in Australia.

303
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:14,993
This must've been her big break.

304
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:16,494
Certainly sounds like it.

305
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,119
No way.

306
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,937
Mr. Lashade was the Cobra?

307
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,159
Is that supposed to mean something?

308
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,194
Dude, the Cobra's the big bad guy.

309
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:28,297
His identity's been shrouded
in mystery for four seasons.

310
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,063
They had a walkie-talkie?

311
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:36,367
Every damn one of those bastards
on the other side of the island

312
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,625
had one exactly like this
hanging from their belts.

313
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,334
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

314
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,495
I'll tell you how.

315
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,171
They were working with the others.

316
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,950
What gives you the right?

317
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,409
You have to understand.
We thought it was best for everybody.

318
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,647
I'm sorry.
Are you my mother?

319
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:58,270
Because she knows what's best for me.
Other than that, I decide.

320
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,486
Hey. What's going on?

321
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:03,854
Kate and her two boyfriends found a case
of guns that fell out of the plane,

322
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,552
but they decided not to tell the camp.

323
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,161
Look, the case is locked.

324
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,082
The key is around Jack's neck,
all right?

325
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,574
I promise you, they're safe.

326
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,089
You're all out of control.

327
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,523
The pigs are walkin'.

328
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:16,878
The pigs are walking!

329
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,897
So... where did you say
you found that case?

330
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,823
It's just water, Paulo.

331
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:34,199
Stop being such a wuss and dive in.

332
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:35,623
Why me?

333
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,276
Well, as you had
no trouble reminding me,

334
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:42,157
I slept with Howie Zuckerman, so
the least you could do is go for a swim.

335
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:44,194
And Kate said they found the case
on the bottom.

336
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,841
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

337
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:49,459
If you didn't need me to find that bag,
would we still be together?

338
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,698
That bag is worth $8 million.

339
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:55,357
Just dive in, Paulo.

340
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:26,626
Well?

341
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,125
Nothing.

342
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,813
There's nothing down there?

343
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:36,438
Just dead bodies.

344
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:48,277
Okay, so they had
a walkie-talkie.

345
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,882
You think they were working
with the others? Like, how?

346
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,999
Like Michael.

347
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,349
If that's the case,
then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?

348
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,866
Who knows why those people do anything?

349
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:01,030
What matters is they could be out there
right now waiting to get us.

350
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,242
I don't know, dude.

351
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:04,785
I was with the others,
like, two weeks ago.

352
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,729
They're on the total
other side of the island.

353
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,812
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

354
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,977
The others came into our camp.

355
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,533
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

356
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,578
And if I hadn't gotten away,
they would have killed me.

357
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:21,869
Look, y'all stay here.

358
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,291
Let me see if I can see any sign of 'em.

359
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:25,872
I'll do a perimeter sweep.

360
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,346
- Where'd you get the gun?
- Got it off one of them.

361
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,535
And when were you gonna let us know?

362
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:32,237
I guess right now.

363
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,977
What exactly is a perimeter sweep?

364
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,058
Shouldn't we cover them up?

365
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,313
Yes, of course.

366
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,550
Nice night.

367
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,075
- Whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

368
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,431
It looks like you're digging a hole.

369
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,066
Every man's entitled to his secrets,
but can I give you
a piece of advice?

370
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:33,293
Please, John.

371
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:36,075
You should put the shovel away
and save yourself some trouble.

372
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,166
Why is that?

373
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,150
Things don't stay buried on this island.

374
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,524
The beach is eroding.

375
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:47,036
Winter's coming, high tide.

376
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,191
Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure
you pick a spot that won't wash away.

377
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:53,522
See you back at camp.

378
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,625
<i>Who left this open?</i>

379
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,502
<i>Tom was down here
a couple of days ago.</i>

380
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:50,648
<i>Well, have him cover it up
with the plane.</i>

381
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:00,328
That him?

382
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,301
- Shephard?
- Yes.

383
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:06,231
He's cute.

384
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,487
Why are we doing this?

385
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,431
Shephard will never agree
to do the surgery.

386
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,128
No. I can convince him to do it.

387
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,753
How?

388
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:19,022
Same way I get anybody to do anything.

389
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,680
I find out what
he's emotionally iested in,

390
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:24,865
and I exploit it.

391
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:30,539
So what,
we just grab all three of them,

392
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:31,772
Ford and Austen, too?

393
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,356
No, they need to come to us.

394
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,079
And how do we make that happen?

395
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:36,219
Michael, of course.

396
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,417
Are we done here?

397
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,518
This place gives me the creeps.

398
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,477
You hear about what happened
to Nikki and Paulo?

399
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:19,769
Aye. Tragic.

400
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:22,001
So... do you know anything?

401
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,166
How do you mean?

402
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:29,267
Can you... you know,
use your psychic powers?

403
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:30,755
Doesn't work like that.

404
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,034
I only see flashes.

405
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,124
No offense, dude, but...

406
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:37,439
as far as superpowers go...

407
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,058
yours is just kinda lame.

408
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:42,504
Thanks anyway.

409
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:46,410
I do know she was
with your mate this morning.

410
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,005
My mate?

411
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:51,973
I saw her with your boy Sawyer...

412
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:55,910
The dead girl, Nikki.

413
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,755
He said he didn't know her.

414
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,781
Then why was she yelling at him?

415
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Yelling?

416
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:05,620
At Sawyer, this morning?

417
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:10,579
Right before she died.

418
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:23,986
Vincent! Dude!

419
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:27,837
So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fightin'.

420
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:31,048
- That doesn't prove athing.
- Look at the facts and ask yourself,

421
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,747
why is Sawyer so gung how
about investigating this?

422
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,084
What's in it for him?

423
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:37,184
He pretended he didn't know their names,

424
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,728
but then he was fighting with Nikki.

425
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:40,360
Sawyer's not a murderer.

426
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,602
He went all the way across
the island to help Michael.

427
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:46,566
It is the others.
I know what they can do.

428
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,153
Okay, you know what?

429
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:50,756
I'll go get Desmond.
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

430
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:01,982
It was me.

431
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,242
What?

432
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:10,066
It was me who took you, not the others.

433
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:17,232
I wasn't myself.

434
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:19,708
After Locke hit me...

435
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:21,794
After he humiliated me...

436
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,942
Sawyer told me I could get even
by helping him steal the guns.

437
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,058
We just made it...

438
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,329
look like... the others.

439
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:36,298
I didn't mean to hurt you.

440
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,541
Sorry.

441
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,194
Hey, everybody.
We're heading out to the pearl station.

442
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:53,630
There's a computer there that
might help us find our people.

443
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,441
- Anybody wanna come along?
- I'll go.

444
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,936
- Great.
- What?

445
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:00,193
Anybody else wanna come, meet us
at the tree line in ten minutes,

446
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,194
and bring water.

447
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:02,497
You're not serious.

448
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,617
What? You always whine
about not being included.

449
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,131
Now's our chance.

450
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,350
Hey, guys,

451
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,954
what are these other tvs for?

452
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,004
Sorry?

453
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,005
<i>All these tvs.</i>

454
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,053
<i>This guy says
that there's six stations...</i>

455
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:50,136
<i>So maybe some of these tvs
are connected to the other hatches.</i>

456
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:51,972
<i>Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.</i>

457
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,962
<i>Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,</i>

458
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:57,119
<i>see if we can get another picture.</i>

459
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,245
The toilet still works.

460
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:28,157
Give me the gun.

461
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:30,354
What the hell you talking about?

462
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:31,716
Give it to me.

463
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,032
It ain't even loaded.

464
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,623
Then how are you
sweeping the perimeter?

465
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:41,093
Quit lying, dude.

466
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,335
Desmond saw you fighting
with Nikki this morning.

467
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,305
Oh, I see what this is.

468
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:53,012
The villagers have got
themselves some torches.

469
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:54,796
Did you kill them?

470
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,136
No, I didn't kill them.

471
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,472
Yeah, me and Nikki
went at it this morning...

472
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,393
'cause she wanted a gun.

473
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,185
Why didn't you tell us this before?

474
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:15,819
'cause of the dirt under her nails.

475
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,402
- What?
- She was digging,

476
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:21,615
and when we found him,
I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

477
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:23,807
She was burying somethin',

478
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:26,801
and if you take the time to dig a hole
right before you die,

479
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,184
then what you're hiding's
probably pretty damn good.

480
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:32,045
So what was it?

481
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:33,546
What did she hide?

482
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,165
Go ahead. Take 'em.

483
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,884
'cause whatever happened to those two,
I had nothing to do with it.

484
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:19,667
Did you know thanksgiving
was two weeks ago?

485
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:25,599
We missed it, Paulo,
just like we're gonna miss everything.

486
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:27,860
They're going to find us.

487
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:29,601
We'll get rescued.

488
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:30,915
You'll see.

489
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:35,553
Okay, where did this sudden
burst of optimism come from?

490
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,997
I don't know. I guess...

491
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:41,453
It's how you look at things...

492
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:44,226
Like the bag.

493
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:48,605
I mean,
maybe not finding it was good for us.

494
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:50,752
How do you figure that?

495
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:52,285
Look what it did.

496
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,415
It might have... torn us apart.

497
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:08,091
Wait here.

498
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,815
I'm gonna get us some breakfast.

499
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,289
Okay, I know you have them.

500
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:44,099
Give me a gun.

501
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:46,387
I don't have the guns.

502
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,022
- A- team took 'em all.
- Right,

503
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,246
except for the ones
you kept for yourself.

504
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:53,150
Even if I had a gun,
I wouldn't give it to you.

505
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:55,675
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

506
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,917
I got a feeling
no good would come of it.

507
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:00,485
Sawyer, give me a gun.

508
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,594
I got a better idea, sister.

509
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,758
How about you go stick your head
in the ocean and cool yourself off?

510
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:09,029
Thanks for nothin'.

511
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,566
And who the hell are you?

512
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:23,904
Thanks for nothin'.

513
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:43,167
Charlie told me it was your idea...

514
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,164
to kidnap me.

515
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:56,028
You gonna tell Jin?

516
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,349
Why not?

517
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:09,943
Because then we'd have
to dig another grave.

518
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:20,014
Why are you giving me these?

519
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,322
Because they're worthless here.

520
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,914
See, I thought I was gonna
get out of this without a...

521
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,537
Nikki and Paulo...

522
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:42,381
I guess we didn't
really know you very well,

523
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:47,582
and it appears you killed
each other for diamonds.

524
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,837
But I know there are
good parts to you, too.

525
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:54,071
You were always nice to me,

526
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,203
and you were a member of the camp.

527
00:35:59,663 --> 00:36:00,663
And...

528
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,233
I really loved <i>Exposé.</i>

529
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:09,345
Okay, then.

530
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:11,373
- Good-bye.
- Wait.

531
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,506
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

532
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:36,005
Come on, Nikki, just tell me.

533
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,356
It's a surprise.

534
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:38,797
We're almost there.

535
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:41,995
Okay, ready?

536
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,803
I found the diamonds.

537
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:51,204
What? Where?

538
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:53,869
Right here.

539
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,241
Give them to me.

540
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:02,493
What are you talking about?

541
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,012
What am I talking about?

542
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,556
What's this?

543
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:07,804
Your nicotine gum?

544
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,401
You wanted to stop looking for the bag
because you'd already found it.

545
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,907
I know you have them, Paulo,
so where are they?

546
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,277
Calm down, okay?

547
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:19,767
What the hell is that?

548
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,421
Are you out of your mind?

549
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,256
You remember Dr. Arzt's friend.

550
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,053
Did it bite you?

551
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,158
Does it hurt?

552
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:34,380
He told me why they call it
"the medusa spider."

553
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:35,768
Wanna know why?

554
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:39,744
What did you do?

555
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:47,062
Because one look from medusa
would turn anyone to stone,

556
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:50,223
just like one bite from the spider
will paralyze you...

557
00:37:50,928 --> 00:37:53,026
For... oh, about eight hours.

558
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:55,243
It won't kill you.

559
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:56,304
It'll just...

560
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:58,777
slow your heart rate down to the point
where even a doctor

561
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:00,130
would have a hard time...

562
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,062
hearing it beat.

563
00:38:03,744 --> 00:38:05,970
You won't be able to move a muscle,

564
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:09,592
so I'll be able to do all sorts
of nasty things to you.

565
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,955
And since it bit you on your neck,

566
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:15,863
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

567
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:24,169
I'm guessing that
you have the diamonds on you.

568
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,554
In a shoe, maybe?

569
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,182
I think I know where.

570
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:56,494
Son of a bitch.

571
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:01,366
I'm sorry.

572
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,466
You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.

573
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,355
I was... afraid...

574
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:11,430
of losing you.

575
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,235
If you found the diamonds...

576
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,136
you wouldn't need me anymore.

577
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:00,784
Damn it!

578
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,782
You okay?

579
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:37,569
Hey, what happened?

580
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,128
I'm paralyzed.
