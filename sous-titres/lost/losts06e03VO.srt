1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,806
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,191
Juliet.

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,207
Kate? Hurley!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,033
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

5
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,665
The water isn't clear. What happened?

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,665
You're not saving him! You're drowning him!

7
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:29,932
Your friend is dead. Jack!

8
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,166
What happened?

9
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,367
He's alive.

10
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,301
It worked?

11
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:13,100
Dude, you're okay!

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,767
Hurley, let him breathe.

13
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:17,534
Miles, can you go get some water?

14
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:19,434
Yeah, on it.

15
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:21,800
Sayid. Hey.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
How are you feeling?

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
A little light-headed.

18
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,434
Jack...

19
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,568
What happened to me?

20
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,100
You died.

21
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,401
How is that even possible?

22
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,367
I mean...

23
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:48,167
One minute he's gone, and now he's fine?

24
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,833
Of course he's fine.

25
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,234
What does that mean?

26
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,733
He's an iraqi torturer who shoots kids.

27
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:58,000
He's definitely deserves another go-around.

28
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,267
How many guys with guns you think are outside this place?

30
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,267
What? I was out cold when they brought me in here.

31
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:15,034
How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?

32
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,367
What are you thinking?

33
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm thinking about running, kate.

34
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,334
She's got hands in handcuffs,

35
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:27,434
But she's probably got 'em covered, okay?

36
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,067
Hey!

37
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,367
Hey, watch it.

38
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,800
Go!

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,134
Go now! Lady, I already have a customer.

40
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,634
Damn it, I said go! Okay.

41
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,967
Ooh! Easy, easy. Slow down.

42
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,067
Hey, just slow down. Slow down! Okay! Okay! You said go!

43
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,967
Just get us out of here.

44
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,534
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

45
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,568
Can you please just let me out of--aah!

46
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:53,534
Be quiet!

47
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,594
What are you doing? Move!

48
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,767
There's a guy. I'm not gonna run him over.

49
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,134
Hey. I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!

50
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,067
Do not get out of this car.

51
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,900
Just go.

52
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,467
Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!

53
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,201
Hey! Hey! What the hell?!

54
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:32,201
Hey, I got your license plate!

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,501
At the light, take a left.

56
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,867
Can you--can you please, please just let me go?

57
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,267
I promise I won't say anything to anyone. Hey!

58
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,767
Hey!

59
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,201
Damn it!

60
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,700
Please. Please.

61
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,601
Give me your purse.

62
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,800
What? I said, give me your purse!

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,833
Now get out of the car.

64
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,764
Can I please just-- just get my suitcase?

65
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,367
No, you can't! Get out of the car!

66
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:21,267
Easy.

67
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,000
Right over there.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,301
All right.

69
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:34,800
Who are these people?

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,467
What do they want?

71
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,401
It's the others, dude.

72
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,067
They caught us...

73
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,534
Again.

74
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:45,034
I don't know. I think they're trying to protect us.

75
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,034
Yeah, and as-- as you can see, uh,

76
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,934
Hugo here has assumed the leadership position,

77
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,601
So... that's pretty great.

78
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,434
What?

79
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:56,034
The wound.

80
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,234
It's almost completely closed.

81
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,833
Thank you, jack.

82
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,434
For what? Saving my life.

83
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,601
Mr. Jarrah, will you come with us, please?

84
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,934
Come with you where? Inside. Nothing to worry about. We--

85
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,234
I'm coming with him.

86
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:40,367
Oh, I'm sorry. We need to talk to him alone.

87
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,367
Just a few questions. You have a few questions? Well, so do we.

88
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,234
I mean, let's start with, who are you?

89
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,234
Why are you holding us here?

90
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,301
You--

91
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,601
Once we've spoken to mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy

92
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,767
To tell you everything you want to know.

93
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,267
Something tells me

94
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:06,201
That you're not gonna be happy to tell us anything.

95
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,967
Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!

96
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,267
Please, you don't have to do this.

97
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:30,301
We won't hurt your friend. He ain't my friend.

98
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,134
You do what you want with him and anybody else.

99
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,000
But me? I'm walking outta here.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,100
James?

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm gone. You understand?

102
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,700
Please.

103
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,501
You have to stay.

104
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,434
No, I don't.

105
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,100
Don't come after me.

106
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:24,388
Hey! Hey!

107
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:26,388
Where are they taking sayid?

108
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:29,822
Hey, calm down! Everybody calm down!

109
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,955
Where'd ford go? What?

110
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,452
Ford. Your friend who just

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,988
ran out here--where did he go? I don't know.

112
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,760
You really expect me to believe that?

113
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,155
He told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?

114
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,955
I can bring him back. You know where he went?

115
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,788
No, but I can track him.

116
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,222
Let me go.

117
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:49,888
I will bring him back, and I can make him stay.

118
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,788
Kate...

119
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,655
You sure you wanna go out there alone with these people?

120
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,755
I'll go with her.

121
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:02,022
It's very important that he gets back here safely.

122
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,521
What makes you think he's gonna listen to you?

123
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,521
I can very convincing when I wanna be.

124
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:24,088
Where's your tire hammer?

125
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,888
You got a problem.

126
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,988
So do you. Where's your tire hammer?

127
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:35,122
Tire hammer'll just cut off your wrists.

128
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,122
Your problem is you need a punch press,

129
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:39,122
And you're not gonna be able

130
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:42,122
To use one of those and keep that gun pointed at me.

131
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,488
You volunteering? I got steady hands,

132
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:47,488
But I kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

133
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,822
I'll give you $200.

134
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:56,521
Now hold still.

135
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,922
Thanks.

136
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:11,222
So why the bracelets?

137
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,922
I'm wanted for murder.

138
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,688
Murder?

139
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,588
You don't happen to have

140
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,588
Somewhere I could change, do you?

141
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:21,621
Bathroom's over there.

142
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,122
Make it quick.

143
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:24,621
Thank you.

144
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,022
You better not slow us down.

145
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:29,055
You better not slow me down.

146
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:36,122
I'd go with you, but--

147
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:39,189
But... sawyer would kill you?

148
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:47,454
I'll take care of james. You take care of sayid.

149
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:51,421
Deal.

150
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:00,255
Good-bye.

151
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:06,289
Be careful.

152
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:28,454
What is it you want?

153
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,888
Please, whatever you're thinking of doing...

154
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:44,521
What is that?

155
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,922
Just tell me what you want.

156
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,488
Why?!

157
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,955
Why are you doing this?

158
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:53,289
I don't have any secrets.

159
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,688
Ask...

160
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:02,022
Aah!

161
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:17,454
I'm sorry we had to put you through that.

162
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:21,022
It was a test. We had to be sure. Test to be sure of what?

163
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,555
Don't worry.

164
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,222
You passed.

165
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:42,888
I just lied to him, didn't I?

166
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,222
Yes.

167
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,318
Where were you going?

168
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,584
What?

169
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,418
Before I got in the cab, where were you going?

170
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,517
Why, so you can hijack them, too?

171
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,418
I was waiting for a bus.

172
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:15,251
I came to bring you your stuff.

173
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,184
Relax. I didn't take your money.

174
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:20,851
Well, uh, gee, thanks.

175
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:24,184
So where were you goin'? Don't worry about it.

176
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,517
Fine.

177
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,917
Langdon street.

178
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,917
Brentwood.

179
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,284
You got family there?

180
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:41,951
Uh, no.

181
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,550
It's the... couple who's adopting my baby.

182
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,118
They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport,

183
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,385
But I guess they got the days mixed up or somethin'.

184
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,351
It's not like they abandoned me. Brentwood's not far. Get in.

185
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,517
Seriously?

186
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:59,650
Do you want a ride or not?

187
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:13,118
So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?

188
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:14,784
We're protecting you.

189
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:17,784
From what? You've been on this island for a while, right?

190
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,951
Ever see a big pillar of black smoke--

191
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,817
Makes a "Ticka ticka" Sound, looks pissed off? Yes.

192
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,584
From that.

193
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,717
Do you know anything about another plane coming in?

194
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,751
An ajira flight. I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?

195
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,018
I think he means the one that landed--

196
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,351
Justin. Shut up.

197
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,917
No, no, no, that's a decoy trail.

198
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,451
He went this way.

199
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,617
And you're basing this on what? Experience.

200
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:49,318
Aldo.

201
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,650
What?

202
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,650
I think she's right.

203
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,451
Of course she is.

204
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,851
After you, princess.

205
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:59,751
So what's your strategy for bringing you boyfriend back?

206
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,751
I hope you got one, because he shot a guy on his way out.

207
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:03,780
If he tries that on me,

208
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,751
I'm gonna blow his head off. Whoa. Watch it.

209
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,184
Thank you.

210
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:12,451
Looks like one of rousseau's traps.

211
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,451
The frenchwoman? No, she's been dead for years.

212
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,951
This--this couldn't be one of her-- justin!

213
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,584
Shut up.

214
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,617
What was he gonna say?

215
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,817
You don't even remember me, do you?

216
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,517
You don't recognize me?

217
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,184
Well, maybe this will jog your memory.

218
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,851
Three years ago,

219
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,851
You staged yourself a little prison break, and you did it

220
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:39,351
By knocking the guard out with the butt of you rifle.

221
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,251
That would be me.

222
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,151
Aah!

223
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:52,451
What are you doing?

224
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,917
Escaping.

225
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:07,184
Sayid!

226
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,051
You okay, man?

227
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,984
Jack! He's back!

228
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:19,717
Sayid, what happened?

229
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:22,784
They tortured me. Why?

230
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:25,884
Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.

231
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,184
Step aside.

232
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,617
Hey, shephard.

233
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:58,118
We were hoping you'd come on your own.

234
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,751
What the hell did you do to sayid?

235
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,817
We--we didn't do anything to him. Y-your friend is sick.

236
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,485
Sick with what?

237
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,385
He's...

238
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:12,251
Yeah, I... not really--

239
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:14,251
There's not really a literal translation.

240
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:16,617
The closest thing would be...

241
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,650
Infected.

242
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,251
Infected? He's not even runnin' a fever.

243
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,018
What...

244
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:26,018
Did I say something funny?

245
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:29,018
I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.

246
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:44,284
He says you have to give your friend this pill.

247
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,584
Are you serious?

248
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,485
Why don't you give it to him?

249
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,650
Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly,

250
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,650
And he won't take it willingly from us.

251
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,284
Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it

252
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:03,051
Before you tortured him. We didn't torture him.

253
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,684
We were diagnosing him. To see if he was infected.

254
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:07,984
Yes.

255
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:10,151
I'm not gonna give anything to sayid

256
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,151
Unless I know what's in it.

257
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:17,351
Tell me, shephard--

258
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,284
Your friend...

259
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,851
How did he get shot?

260
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:26,517
He was, um...

261
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,684
He was helping me.

262
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:33,084
So it was your fault?

263
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,251
Yes.

264
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,251
And there have been others

265
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:40,418
Who were hurt or died...

266
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,817
Helping you?

267
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,817
Yes.

268
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,617
Well...

269
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:53,617
Then this is your chance to redeem yourself.

270
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,684
It's medicine,

271
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:05,851
And your friend needs it.

272
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,851
What happens if I don't give it to him?

273
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,485
The infection will spread.

274
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,330
so... nothing? There wasn't anything?

275
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,330
No white light? Angels singing?

276
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,829
No dead relatives?

277
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,296
I remember being shot.

278
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,530
You're not a zombie, right?

279
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:41,096
No. I am not a zombie.

280
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:42,496
Hey.

281
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,697
You mind giving me and sayid a minute?

282
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,929
Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out

283
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,430
'cause they usually lead

284
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,229
To me having to do something I don't quite understand.

285
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,229
I'm right there with ya.

286
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:02,129
It's fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.

287
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:17,029
So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?

288
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,829
They said they were trying to diagnose you.

289
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,797
Right.

290
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,996
They told me it was some sort of test,

291
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:29,430
Which they said I passed.

292
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,096
Clearly, I didn't.

293
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,862
What's that?

294
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:43,363
They want you to take it.

295
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:45,363
It's medicine, according to them.

296
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:48,029
What about according to you?

297
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:50,396
I don't know.

298
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,396
And you know, before when you--

299
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:58,330
When you thanked me for saving your life, I...

300
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:03,829
I didn't have anything to do with it, sayid.

301
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,862
I didn't fix you. They did.

302
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,463
I don't care who fixed me.

303
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:16,797
I only care about who I trust,

304
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,896
So if you want me to take that pill, jack,

305
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,563
I'll do it.

306
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,797
Wait. Where are you going?

307
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:36,463
Catching up with sawyer.

308
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,463
So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.

309
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,630
No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?

310
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,430
Where did your plane land, kate? What?

311
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,096
The ajira plane that you, jack and hurley came in on--

312
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:49,663
Where did it land? I don't know.

313
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,730
Sun was on that plane, too, and I have to find her.

314
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,763
You think they're gonna tell you?

315
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:59,129
You think they care about you or about sun or about any of us?

316
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:03,962
Who do you care about, kate?

317
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,929
Good luck, jin.

318
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,430
Once you catch up with sawyer... then what?

319
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:13,697
I guess we'll figure that out together.

320
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,829
So, uh...

321
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:23,829
What happened to your handcuffs?

322
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:26,229
I cut them off.

323
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,396
It's a beautiful neighborhood.

324
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,730
I bet they're a really nice couple.

325
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,163
What?

326
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:46,163
I didn't say anything.

327
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:50,563
What, you--you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?

328
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,330
Why would I think that?

329
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,330
Good, 'cause they didn't.

330
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,196
This is it.

331
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,163
Um...

332
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,596
Will you come in with me?

333
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,496
Are you kidding me?

334
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:20,996
Please, I-I just...

335
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:23,797
I really don't want to go up there on my own.

336
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:37,163
Uh, hi. Uh, mrs. Baskum?

337
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,896
I-I'm--I'm claire littleton.

338
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,630
Oh, my god.

339
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,630
I'm so sorry.

340
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,463
Um...

341
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:51,463
My husband...

342
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,463
He left me.

343
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,797
And... believe me,

344
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:03,363
I wanted the baby so much,

345
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,363
But...

346
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:07,962
I can't do it alone.

347
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,330
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,797
Look, I know I should've called you--

349
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,530
So, uh, wh--

350
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,962
Y-y-you just changed your mind?

351
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,455
Look, my--my life is just...

352
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,417
A little bit complicated right now.

353
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,817
She came all the way from australia, and you don't call?

354
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,320
Oh, my god.

355
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,743
Are you okay?

356
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:33,060
Aah! It's coming!

357
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,330
Who's there?

358
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,596
Better come out now

359
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:25,263
Or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.

360
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,697
What the hell are you doin' here?

361
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:35,929
I was worried about you.

362
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
What's happening?

363
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
I-I think I'm having contractions. When did they start?

364
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,560
Um, about 20 minutes ago. Try to relax.

365
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
We're gonna take you to the m.F.C.U. To get looked at.

366
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Are you with her?

367
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,726
Yeah. Okay, follow me.

368
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:24,393
What are you doing? What--what's going on?

369
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:27,494
Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.

370
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:31,227
What--what's going on? Is something wrong?

371
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,594
Excuse me.

372
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,560
Excuse me. Yes.

373
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Are you a doctor? Yes. I'm dr. Goodspeed.

374
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,093
Can I please get your help in here?

375
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:45,193
Ms. Littleton?

376
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:47,193
Claire, how are you feeling?

377
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:50,093
Uncomfortable, what--w-what's happening?

378
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,393
What's happening...

379
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:55,427
Is that mother nature's gotten a little ahead of herself.

380
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:57,759
Are you ready to have your baby?

381
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,527
I-I'm sorry. What?! You're at 36 weeks.

382
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,427
3 centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced.

383
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:06,393
Which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.

384
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:09,460
If I want? So what, you mean-- you mean you can stop it then?

385
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,393
Maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.

386
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:14,759
Drugs? I mean, w-will that hurt the baby?

387
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,427
No, they're perfectly safe.

388
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:18,427
I just don't want to have to

389
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:20,726
Stick you with needles if I don't have to.

390
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,427
So it's up to you.

391
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,993
I'm--I'm not ready.

392
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,093
Okay. Let's get her started on the nifedipine drip.

393
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:39,527
Wh--what--what is it?

394
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,826
Margaret, let's do an ultrasound.

395
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,160
I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there.

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,594
Ah, it--it could just mean the baby's out of position.

397
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,594
W-w-what are you-- what are you saying?!

398
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:50,793
W-what--what's happening to my baby?!

399
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:53,127
Is my baby okay?!

400
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:54,793
Is aaron okay?!

401
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,693
See?

402
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:02,626
There he is. Everything is just fine.

403
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,759
Your boy just likes to move around.

404
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:08,793
140 b.P.M.

405
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:10,527
Perfectly normal.

406
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,026
I have a feeling

407
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:16,393
That aaron is gonna be a handful.

408
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:21,494
Now let's see if we can slow this down.

409
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:23,726
You did great, mommy.

410
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:27,160
Thanks.

411
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:56,594
A couple days ago,

412
00:30:56,594 --> 00:31:00,093
You asked me why I came back to the island.

413
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,093
I need to find claire.

414
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:09,293
I thought...

415
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:13,093
Maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me,

416
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:15,093
And then...

417
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:18,293
Maybe if we could find her and bring her back to aaron,

418
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,293
Then maybe all of this wouldn't have been for nothing.

419
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,826
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:30,127
I never should've followed you.

421
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:32,893
Which time?

422
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:44,327
That was your house, right? With juliet.

423
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:45,826
Yep.

424
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:49,360
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You already said that.

426
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,560
No...

427
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,393
For juliet.

428
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,759
If I hadn't come after you on the sub,

429
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,460
Then you two would've left, and she would've never died.

430
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,127
It's not your fault she's dead.

431
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,427
It's mine.

432
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:15,093
She was sittin' right there,

433
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,093
Right where you are now,

434
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:20,693
Tryin' to leave this place.

435
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:23,360
And I convinced her to stay.

436
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,527
I made her stay on this island

437
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:34,193
'cause I didn't want to be alone.

438
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,759
You understand that, right?

439
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:49,560
But, uh...

440
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,793
But I think some of us

441
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:53,793
Are meant to be alone.

442
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,626
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

443
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,793
Ahh.

444
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:32,926
You can probably make it back to the temple by nightfall.

445
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:08,793
What's that?

446
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:11,193
It's a baseball.

447
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,527
You speak pretty good english

448
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,193
For someone that needs a translator.

449
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:28,193
We both know that I don't need a translator.

450
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,626
Then why do you have one?

451
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,726
Because I have to remain separate

452
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:37,293
From the people I'm in charge of.

453
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:38,993
It makes it easier

454
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,060
When they don't like the decisions I make for them.

455
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,227
Who are you?

456
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:49,460
My name is dogen.

457
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,759
Are you from here-- the island?

458
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:55,093
I was brought here like everyone else.

459
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,494
What do you mean, "Brought here"?

460
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,393
You know exactly what I mean.

461
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:11,127
You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?

462
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,560
No.

463
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,594
Why not?

464
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:19,026
Because I don't know what's in it.

465
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:21,659
It will eliminate-- the infection, yeah.

466
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,626
I got that.

467
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:26,127
But what's in it? I cannot explain.

468
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,594
Try. There isn't any time.

469
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,093
He'll die if you don't-- he already died.

470
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,060
What is in it?

471
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,327
You just have to trust me.

472
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:47,060
I don't trust myself.

473
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,659
How am I supposed to trust you?

474
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,926
Let's see where trust gets us.

475
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:15,093
Now... are you gonna tell me

476
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,759
What's in it?

477
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:24,659
Poison.

478
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,180
Come in.

479
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,380
Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?

480
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,814
Um, yeah?

481
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,580
I'm detective rasmussen.

482
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,780
Is ms. Hart here? Uh, I'm sorry. Who?

483
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,914
Joan hart. She signed in with you.

484
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,413
Oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver.

485
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:54,547
I needed help, and she brought me up here.

486
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,213
She left after they treated me, though.

487
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,881
Did she, uh,

488
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:01,380
Give you any indication where she was headed?

489
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,046
Why? Is something wrong?

490
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:06,614
No. It's nothing for you to worry about. Come on. Let's go.

491
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,347
E.K.G. Tech to 3-1-5. E.K.G. Tech to 3-1-5.

492
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:19,847
Thanks.

493
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,347
Sure.

494
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:27,680
Thank you.

495
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,447
Why--why are they after you?

496
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,247
What--what did you do?

497
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:37,046
Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?

498
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,947
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

499
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:50,347
Well, I should go.

500
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:53,580
Oh, wait. Um...

501
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,947
Here. Take my credit card.

502
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:56,180
No.

503
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,480
There's not much of a limit on it, but it's something.

504
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,869
You don't have to do this.

505
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,113
You didn't have to do what you did either.

506
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,180
Aaron's a great name.

507
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,847
I don't know why I said it. It's like...

508
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:18,947
I don't know. I knew it or something.

509
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,447
I think you should keep him.

510
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:27,547
Well, um, good luck.

511
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:29,714
Yeah.

512
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:31,046
You, too.

513
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:34,313
Thanks.

514
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:26,380
He swallowed it?

515
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:29,914
Yes.

516
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,313
What's this?

517
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,313
Tea.

518
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:59,347
Why would you people want to kill sayid?

519
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,347
We believe he has been...

520
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:15,347
Closest translation is "Claimed."

521
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,514
Claimed.

522
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,113
By what?

523
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:27,881
There is a darkness growing in him.

524
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:31,480
And once it reaches his heart,

525
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,213
Everything your friend once was...

526
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,881
Will be gone.

527
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:41,146
No, I...

528
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,514
How can you be sure of that?

529
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:51,614
Because it happened to your sister.

530
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,881
Get up!

531
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,747
That's for my head.

532
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,413
Uhh!

533
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,914
Now...

534
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,380
Where's that bitch? I don't know.

535
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,380
You don't understand. I'm going back to the temple! Yeah, right.

536
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,313
It looks like he's alone. Maybe we should take him back.

537
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:34,747
Or maybe we didn't find him alive.

538
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:37,180
Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.

539
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,347
He may be one of them.

540
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,380
Hey! Hey!

541
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,046
Aah! Uhh!

542
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,780
Where you goin'?

543
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:53,347
Uhh!

544
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,547
Uhh!

545
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,180
Claire?
