1
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,294
Jin. Come on. Wake up, buddy.

2
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,411
wake up.

3
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:28,383
Sawyer.

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,909
How long have I been out?

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,384
A while.

6
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:35,496
Figured you could use the rest.

7
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:38,371
Claire and locke-- where are they?

8
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,380
I don't know. They said
they'd be back by sunup.

9
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,489
We have to get out of

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,866
here before they come back.
Easy. Whoa, whoa.

11
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,271
I'with locke.

12
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,541
That is not locke.

13
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:51,349
Yeah, I know.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,692
Whoever he is, he says he can
get us off this damn island.

15
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:57,201
I can't leave.

16
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:59,206
Sun could be here somewhere.

17
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,345
Fine.

18
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:05,224
If she's here, you got my word.
We ain't leaving without her.

19
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:08,665
What's that?

20
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,002
They're back.

21
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:40,472
Hi.

22
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:43,828
Hi yourself.

23
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:55,007
Ahh.

24
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,115
wow.

25
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:02,786
Jimmy...

26
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,589
mmm.

27
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,527
You are...

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,997
Unbelievable.

29
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:11,199
Mmm.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,102
You weren't too shabby
yourself, darlin'.

31
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,237
Mmm.

32
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:15,672
baby?

33
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:17,208
Yeah?

34
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,378
Aren't you supposed to
meet that guy at 9:00?

35
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,780
Yeah. So?

36
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:25,320
It's 8... 42.

37
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,556
Damn it!

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,276
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

39
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:45,880
Jimmy, what are you doing
with all that money?

40
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,350
This meeting is a
potential investment.

41
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,919
We're going 50/50.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,155
The guy wants to see
the money upfront.

43
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:55,527
Don't worry. It won't take long.
I'll be right back.

44
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,264
Me and you'll go for round-- whoa.

45
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,667
Step away from t case.

46
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,837
take it easy, honey.

47
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:04,439
Here's the thing, dimples.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,875
I can spot a con man.
I'm married to one.

49
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,145
So I know all about
the pigeon drop.

50
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:12,516
Oh, what? That case just
accidentally flew open?

51
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:15,453
How stupid do you think I am?

52
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,123
Pretty damn stupid, actually.

53
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:20,259
Excuse me?

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,853
This is a setup, lady.

55
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:25,023
There's a van sittin'
right outside.

56
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,727
The room is bugged.
The place is surrounded by cops.

57
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,562
So now you wanna put that gun down,

58
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,397
And we'll work something out.

59
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,967
They don't care about you.
They want your husband.

60
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,604
There's a tracer in the case.
All you had to do

61
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:39,441
Was take it back to wherever
your hubby's hiding out.

62
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:41,376
You really except me to believe

63
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,345
That you're working
with the police?

64
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,947
If this place is surrounded,

65
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:46,982
How come no one came to save you?

66
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:49,018
I don't need saving,

67
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,987
'cause you're gonna
do the right thing

68
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:53,891
And put that gun down.
But if you don't,

69
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,828
Well, then all I gotta
do is say the magic work,

70
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,064
And that door busts open.

71
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,293
You're a lousy con man.

72
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:05,859
Lafleur.

73
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,090
"La" What?

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,109
Police! Drophe gun!

75
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:15,567
behind your back.
Cuttin' it a little close, huh?

76
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,477
Only way to cut it.

77
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,859
put your damn clothes on, jim.

78
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,019
You got it, partner.

79
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,267
You're a cop? Surprise.

80
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,976
let's go. Move.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,370
Is this where you lived?

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,500
Yeah.

83
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,730
What is that?

84
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,240
It's all I had.

85
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,840
all right, everybody, listen up!

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,740
Come on in. Gather 'round.

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,550
I know that everyone is tired.

88
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,020
It was a...

89
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,050
A long and traumatic
night for all of us.

90
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,520
And you all have got a
lot of questions, I know,

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,660
And I will make myself
available to answer them.

92
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
But right now we
need to keep moving.

93
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,990
We have to take advantage of
the daylight. We wanna know

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,260
What happened to the people who
stayed behind at the temple.

95
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,930
The black smoke killed them.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,670
Hey.

97
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,710
I know that what happened
back there was really scary.

98
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,010
But it's over.

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,510
You're with me now,

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,820
And I promise that I'm
gonna take care of you.

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
Okay.

102
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,560
Alright, let's move out.

103
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,600
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

104
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,100
Yeah.

105
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,140
Jack, hurley, the rest of 'em--

106
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,870
They make it out of
the temple all right?

107
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,870
I saw them leaving on my way back.

108
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,840
What about miles?
I don't know what happened to him.

109
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,350
So you're with lockeow?

110
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,880
I ain't with anybody, kate.

111
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,560
Hello. Is this anthony cooper?

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Hi, mr. Cooper. This is
detective james ford, l.A.P.D.

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah, we've discovered
some unclaimed property

114
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
That might belong to you.

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,560
Can you verify you were
in alabama in 1976?

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,200
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,470
Okay, thanks. Sorry to have
taken up your time. Bye-bye.

118
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,280
Can I speak with anthony cooper?

119
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
...Sti holding for you.

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,780
Sorry. I'm gonna have
to call you back.

121
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,690
Who's anthony cooper?

122
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,590
Old buddy I ran into.

123
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,620
Said he could hook me up with
some laker tickets. That's cool.

124
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,130
What, did you-
-you see him in palm springs?

125
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,360
What?

126
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,430
Palm springs?
Your trip last weekend?

127
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,460
Yeah. It's a blur.

128
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,030
Too much sunshine.
Too many mai tais.

129
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,170
Well, get it together,
because you got a date tonight, pal.

130
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,500
date with who?

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,800
Friend of mine, works
with my dad at the museum.

132
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,170
She's great.

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,840
Well, if she's so great,
why don't you go out with her?

134
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,380
Hey, I got a girlfriend.
What is your deal,im?

135
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,980
Do you wanna die alone?

136
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,410
All right, look, I go out with her,

137
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,180
You gonna leave me alone?
Throw in one of those laker tickets,

138
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,750
Hell, yes, I will.

139
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,960
Look, I'm already pulling
strings with this guy.

140
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,620
It's just, uh...

141
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,630
I don't know if I can
get another seat.

142
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,160
You know you can
tell me the truth...

143
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,200
About anything.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Are you lying to me, man?

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,030
Why the hell would I lie?

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,290
About a quarter mile ahead,
there's a clearing.

147
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,260
We'll make camp there.
Everybody fill up on water.

148
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,730
We might be there a couple of days.

149
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,360
A couple of days?

150
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,300
I thought you said we were
gettin' off this rock.

151
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,630
We are.

152
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,930
When?

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,940
Maybe we should talk
about this in private?

154
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,810
Great. Let's go.

155
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,410
I wish you hadn't interrupd me.

156
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,610
I'm sorry. I forgot my manners.

157
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,180
I forgive ya.

158
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,190
What happened back at the temple?

159
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,760
How'd you know to rescue
everybody from that smoke thing?

160
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,760
I didn't rescue them.

161
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:06,271
I'm the smoke thing.

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,430
You telling me you
killed all those people?

163
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,970
I gave them the opportunity
to leave peacefully,

164
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,970
And they didn't take it. Why not?

165
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,121
Because they're convinced

166
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,052
That they're protecting
the island from me,

167
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:25,240
When, in fact,
all I wanna do is leave.

168
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,610
So it's either kill or be killed.

169
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,650
And I don't want to be killed.

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,840
We goin' on a boat ride?

171
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
You are.

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,670
Where?

173
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,270
Hydra island.

174
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,710
What's on hydra island?

175
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,480
The plane. The ajira flight.

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
The same plane that
brought your friends back.

177
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,420
Unfortunately,
they didn't come alone.

178
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,550
And I have reaso to believe that

179
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,350
Some of the other passengers
mean to do us all harm.

180
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,790
So I want you to go over
there and do some recon.

181
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,720
Well, that sounds safe.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,442
You'll be fine. Yeah? Well,
what am I supposed to do

183
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,451
If I run into somebody
who wants to do me harm?

184
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:24,070
I'm not worried about that.
Oh, you're not, huh?

185
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:29,090
No, because you are the
best liar I ever met.

186
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,989
You tell 'em whatever
you need to tell 'em

187
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,919
To gain their trust, find out
everything you can about them,

188
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,089
And then get back here.

189
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,289
Why exactly am I doing this again?

190
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,329
Why do you think, james?

191
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,369
We get on the plane,
we fly off this island,

192
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:48,669
And we never look back.

193
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,139
Come on.

194
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,380
yeah?

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,610
Miles, what's this
girl look like again?

196
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,620
She's a redhead. How many-
how many redheads do you see?

197
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,680
Roger that. Be nice to her--

198
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,180
Yeah, yeah.

199
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,220
Excuse me.

200
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,720
Would you be charlotte?

201
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,990
I most certainly am.

202
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,180
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

203
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,230
Thank you.

204
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,270
Archaeology, huh?

205
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,700
What's wrong with archaeology?

206
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,040
Nothin'.

207
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
I just figured you'd be
stuckn a room somewhere

208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,370
Dusting off antiques.

209
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,410
no, I actually get to
travel quite a bit,

210
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,510
To far off and romantic places.

211
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,150
Really?

212
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,250
What, you like an indiana
jones or sethin'?

213
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,150
Yes. I'm exactly
like indiana jones.

214
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,620
You got a whip?

215
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,890
Maybe.

216
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,730
So, um, what about you?

217
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,000
What about me?
Why did you become a cop?

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,763
You ever seen "Bullitt
steve mcqueen flick.

219
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,357
No.

220
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:29,357
Well, then I won't even bore
you with an explanation.

221
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,257
Okay, do me a favor, james,
and don't treat me like

222
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,997
All the other girls who ask you.

223
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,497
Tell me the truth.

224
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,067
Well...

225
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,007
I guess I... Got to
a point in my life

226
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:52,377
Where I was either gonna
come a criminal or a cop.

227
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,307
So I chose cop.

228
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,165
What?

229
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,635
You know what.

230
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,955
Well, not bad, considering
we didn't have that whip.

231
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,155
Bring it next time.

232
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,565
You want some water?

233
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:39,295
Mm-hmm. Yes, please.

234
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,035
You mind if I borrow a t-shirt?

235
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:45,549
Help yourself.
Top drawer on the right.

236
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:46,669
Thanks.

237
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,470
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,600
Um, I was just looking foa t-shirt.

239
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,732
What did you see? Nothing,

240
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,107
just that you had-
that picture fell out,

241
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,815
And I was just trying to put it back.
What did you see?!

242
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,773
Nothing! I didn't see anything.
Get the hell out.

243
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:36,278
James, just let me explain.
Get out!

244
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,505
Hey.

245
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,765
Kate.

246
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,275
Do you believe locke?

247
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,705
What do you mean?

248
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:14,275
That he can get us off the island.

249
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,505
Yes, I believe him.

250
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:19,075
Sayid, are you all right?

251
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
No.

252
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,155
claire! Sayid!

253
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,025
Sayid, please! St--

254
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,105
What are you doing?!

255
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:44,023
She took him!
She took aaron! Claire,

256
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:46,305
you had disappeared.
Kate couldn't find you.

257
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,916
She did what she had to do.

258
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,245
She took aaron!
She can't just do that!

259
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,485
This is completely inappropriate.

260
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:58,815
All right?

261
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:02,585
Now... You go over there.
I'll deal with you in a minute.

262
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:06,898
Go.

263
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,068
You all right?

264
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:15,078
No, I'm not all right!

265
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,960
Hey! Stop!

266
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,300
No! Oh! Don't move!

267
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
please don't hurt me!

268
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,800
Who the hell are you?

269
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm the only one left.

270
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,135
Excuse me, sir?

271
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,105
I asked you about my brother.

272
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:47,535
I told you. I'll be
with you in a minute.

273
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,705
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for my brother.

274
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:57,105
Uh, he was arrested at the
airport on a drug charge.

275
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,415
Sorry. Not my department.

276
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,915
Mornin', sunshine.

277
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:02,375
Come with me.

278
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,645
Whoa! What the hell is your--
shut up!

279
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,915
Is there something you
wanna tell me? What?!

280
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:13,555
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

281
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,685
Look, she opened the wrong drawer.

282
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:20,395
What the hell are
you talking about?

283
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,965
I wanna know what you
were doing in australia

284
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,165
When you told me you
were in palm springs.

285
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,835
I ran your credit card.
I know you went to sydney.

286
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,005
Oceanic. Round trip.

287
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,399
You took flight 815
back 2 days ago.

288
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,011
What the helare you doin'
running my credit card?

289
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,581
You lied to me!

290
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:40,644
're supposed to trust each other.

291
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,470
So, jim...

292
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,570
What were you doing in australia?

293
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,110
That's none of your damn business.

294
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,610
You know what?

295
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,020
You're right,

296
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,190
Because I'm not your
partner anymore.

297
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,640
You thirsty?

298
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,110
Very.

299
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,180
I'm sawyer.

300
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,680
Ahh.

301
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,950
I'zoe. I can't believe
there's anybody left alive.

302
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,650
I thought I knew
everybody on the plane.

303
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,680
I didn't come on this plane.

304
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,990
What plane did you come on?
Long story.

305
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,790
What the hell happened here?
What killed all those people?

306
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,260
I...

307
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,760
We--we crashed here,

308
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,760
And we were all just waiting for...

309
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,460
Someone to rescue us.

310
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,170
I was out collecting wood

311
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,940
When I heard...

312
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,880
Screaming.

313
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,910
Screaming?

314
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,220
When...

315
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,090
When I came back...

316
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,230
They were-- they were all dead.

317
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,140
I spent the last two days
dragging their bodies up here.

318
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,340
I didn't feel it was right to
leave them out there in the sun.

319
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,020
Are you alone?

320
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,890
No. I'm with a group of people
back on the main island.

321
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,690
I can take you back there.
Oh, thank god.

322
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,620
Trust me,

323
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,390
God's got nothing to do with it.

324
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,070
I'm sorry, kate.

325
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,310
Excuse me?

326
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,810
I have to take responsibility
for claire's behavior.

327
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,449
I was the one who told her
that the others had her baby.

328
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,955
Why would you tell her that?

329
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,380
Have you ever had an enemy?

330
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,080
Someone that you needed to hate?

331
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,420
Very powerful, isn't it?

332
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,720
Claire was devastated
without aaron.

333
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,160
She needed something to...

334
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,130
Something to keep her going, so...

335
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,160
I gave her something to hate.

336
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,100
And then when you
told her the truth,

337
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,070
All those feelings,
all--all that anger

338
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,470
That she'd been holding
on to for so long--

339
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,240
It had to go somewhere.

340
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,310
Very insightful...

341
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,210
Coming from a dead man.

342
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,680
Mm.

343
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Well, nobody's perfect.

344
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,850
I'm sorry that this happened.

345
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,780
And I'm sure if you give her time,

346
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,050
Everything will be all right.

347
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,620
I promised before that I
would keep everyone safe,

348
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,890
And that means you, too, kate.

349
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,630
Where did sawyer go?

350
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,470
I'll show you.

351
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,740
think that thing'll still fly?

352
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't know.
It'll take a bit of work

353
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,680
And someone who knows how to-
how to do it.

354
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,180
I-I take it you haven't
come across the pilot?

355
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,710
No, ma'am.

356
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,180
How many people did
you say were with you?

357
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,050
Couple dozen.

358
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,590
Did they all come on the
same plane with you?

359
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,090
Some, not all.

360
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,360
When did you crash?

361
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
Long time ago.

362
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,900
Do you all have guns?

363
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,460
I mean, whoever killed
those people back there,

364
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,470
They--they might come back.

365
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah, we got plenty of guns.

366
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,670
You wanna grab that end?

367
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,610
Where'd you say you were headed?

368
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,940
What's that?

369
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,910
Your flight. Where were you going?

370
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,340
Oh. Uh...

371
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,510
Guam.

372
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,750
What's in guam?

373
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,520
My boyfriend.

374
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,020
You're good, sweetheart,
but you ain't that good.

375
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,690
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

376
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,800
Drop it now!

377
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,570
Your name even zoe?

378
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,940
Is yours sawyer?

379
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,410
Down on your knees!

380
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,740
All right, all right. You got me.

381
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,250
Take me to your leader.

382
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,090
That island over there-
that's where I sent sawyer.

383
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,830
You could've just told me

384
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,700
That you sent him to the island
where we were locked in cages.

385
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,630
You didn't have to
bring me down here.

386
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,200
Sure, but then I wouldn't
have gotten to talk to you.

387
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,570
You referred to me as a dead man.

388
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,610
I am not a dead man.

389
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,510
I know what you're feeling, kate.

390
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,140
I know what you're going through.

391
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,610
How do you know that?

392
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,050
Because...

393
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,850
My mother was crazy.

394
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,130
A long time ago, before I...

395
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,870
Looked... Like this,

396
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,370
I had a mother, just like everyone.

397
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,600
She was a very disturbed woman.

398
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
And as a result of that...

399
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,840
I had some growing pains...

400
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,220
Problems that I'm still
trying to work my way through.

401
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,150
Problems that...

402
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,620
Could h-have been avoided,

403
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,720
Had things been different.

404
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,030
Why are you telling me this?

405
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,560
Because now... Aaron...

406
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,900
Has a crazy mother, too.

407
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,090
Get in. He's waiting for you.

408
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,140
It's not me I'm worried about.

409
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,250
I just don't know what I'd do

410
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,510
If anything ever
happened to you and ma.

411
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,408
Anyway, nothing's
gonna happen to us.

412
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:40,088
Not today, anyway.

413
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:42,127
It's the way you live this life,

414
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:44,454
Each day one at a time.

415
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:46,781
Now if you spend your whole life

416
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,289
Worrying about something
that's gonna happen,

417
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:49,680
Before you know it,
your life's over

418
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,790
And you spent an awful
lot of it just worrying.

419
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,605
Hey, you hear that?

420
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,705
That's what life's all about--

421
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:01,505
Laughing and loving each other,

422
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:05,015
And knowing that people aren't
really gone when they die.

423
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:08,845
We have all the good
memories to sustain us

424
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,815
Until we see 'em again.

425
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:14,055
It's hard not being afraid, pa.

426
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:15,955
I know, sweetheart

427
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:17,425
I know.

428
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,226
You've got to be joking.

429
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,761
May I come in?

430
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,732
Absolutely not. Why not?

431
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,602
You don't get to kick me out at 3:
00 in the morning

432
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,542
And then come 'round the next day

433
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,972
With puppy dog eyes
and a sad sunflower.

434
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,442
Look, I don't know

435
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:50,342
If you're just lonely or
guilty or completely mad.

436
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,742
Buy you know what? I don't care.
You blew it.

437
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,080
What you got in here?
None of your business. Keep moving.

438
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,730
Come.

439
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,360
He's here, sir.

440
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,990
Thanks, zoe.

441
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,500
Would you leave us, please?

442
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,100
Of course.

443
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,170
Hello, mr. Ford.

444
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,480
My name is charles widmore.

445
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,250
Do you know who I am?
Of course I do.

446
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,950
You're the fella sent a
freighter to the island,

447
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,820
It's sad, really...

448
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,890
How little you actually know.

449
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,320
Well, I know you murdered
all them people out there

450
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,130
And dropped 'em in the ditch.
We didn't murder those people.

451
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,160
But I don't expect
you to believe that.

452
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,060
Good, 'cause I don't.

453
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,943
So why don't you tell me what
brought you over to this island?

454
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:54,485
John locke sent me.

455
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:55,993
John locke's dead.

456
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,282
I think we both know the
guy I'm talking about

457
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:00,207
Is not really locke.

458
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,465
So here's the deal, chief.

459
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:11,635
I'll go back over there and
tell him the coast is clear,

460
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,635
That I didn't find anybody.

461
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:18,035
Then I'll bring the old man
right to your doorstep.

462
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:20,845
Then you can kill him.

463
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:30,415
And what do you want
in exchange, james?

464
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:33,725
One-- the people I come back with--

465
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:35,685
The people on my boat--

466
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:38,795
Don't get touched,
not even a hair on their head.

467
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,255
And two--

468
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:44,595
You give us safe
passage off the island.

469
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:48,965
How do I know I can trust you?

470
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:52,535
Same way I know I can trust you.

471
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:58,075
So...

472
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:03,145
Do we have an agreement?

473
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,485
I suppose we do.

474
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,170
Kate.

475
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,410
I--

476
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,940
I just, um...

477
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,880
I-I just wanna say I'm sorry.

478
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,080
I don't know why I did that.

479
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,910
I know everything you did was
just 'cause you care about me

480
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,780
And out aaron.

481
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,220
thank you.

482
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,490
Thank you for taking care of him.

483
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,490
I'm so, so sorry.

485
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,430
It's okay.

486
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,400
It's okay.

487
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,800
It's okay.

488
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,063
How'd go?

489
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:28,757
You didn't really
send me over there

490
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:31,052
To find passengers from
that plane, did you?

491
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,210
No.

492
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,800
Well, in case you're interested,

493
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
They're all dead.

494
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,370
Well, that's terrible.

495
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,370
What happened?

496
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,010
I don't know.

497
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,440
Well, what do you know, james?

498
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,710
I know there's a man
over there on that island

499
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,080
That ain't gonna let us get
on that plane without a fight.

500
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,950
Came over on a sub. Name's widmore.

501
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,050
Charles widmore?

502
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,550
Well, I guess y'all
know each other.

503
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,690
He ain't alone.

504
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,120
I counted at least six
armed compadres with him,

505
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,590
Not to mention whatever
crew's on that sub.

506
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,990
There's a locked room on there-
somethin' they're hiding.

507
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,360
And they're settin' up pylons,
like the ones at new otherton.

508
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,760
You know...

509
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,300
The ones that keep
out that smoke thing.

510
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,800
And what did you
tell them about me?

511
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,240
I told them

512
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,280
I'd tell you the coast was clear
and bring you back with me.

513
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,180
Walk you right into their trap.

514
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,610
That way, they could kill you...

515
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,520
Which means they'll be
caught with their pants down

516
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,150
When we change our plan of attack.

517
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,190
I appreciate your loyalty, james.

518
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,460
You said you were gonna
get me off this island.

519
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,060
Deal's a deal.

520
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,870
What are you doing here?
Get in t car.

521
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,150
Who's sawyer?

522
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,030
When I was 9 years old,

523
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,540
My father shot my mother,
and then he killed himself.

524
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,980
Sawyer was the reason why.

525
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,250
He was a grifter.

526
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,650
Con man.

527
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,133
I've been hunting him down

528
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,510
Since the day I left the academy.

529
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,380
I chased down a lead in australia,

530
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,150
Got a name--anthony cooper.

531
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,090
I ran the name. I got a
list of anthony coopers,

532
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,160
And I've been calling them.

533
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,890
And when I find the right one...

534
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,200
I'm gonna kill him.

535
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,270
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

536
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,550
I knew you'd try and
talk me out of it.

537
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,580
Damn right.

538
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,220
Fair enough.

539
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,160
whoa! My car!

540
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,860
Hey!

541
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,210
Uhh!

542
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,750
Son of a bitch.

543
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:58,895
What's for dinner?

544
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:01,555
Rabbit.

545
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,565
I think.

546
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:06,235
Good. I'm starving.

547
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:14,205
What are you doing running
errands for locke?

548
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,305
I ain't runnin' errands for nobody.

549
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:21,105
He said he sent you over
to the other island.

550
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:23,045
Did you find the plane?

551
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,745
Yeah.

552
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,685
And that ain't the
only thing over there.

553
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,615
A guy named widmore set
up camp on the beach,

554
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:33,285
Got a whole team with him--

555
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,585
Guys with guns.

556
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:37,725
They're here for locke.

557
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:40,295
So what are you gonna do?

558
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:44,795
I'm gonna let them fight it out.

559
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,965
And while they got their
hands full with each other...

560
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:53,435
You and me are gettin'
the hell off this island.

561
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:01,245
Even if we could get on that pla,
who's gonna fly it?

562
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,645
We ain't taking the plane,
freckles.

563
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:11,725
We're taking the sub.
