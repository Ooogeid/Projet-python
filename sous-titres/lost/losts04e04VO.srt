1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,691
These are the last two eggs.

2
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,100
From my own bookshelf?

3
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:09,281
- Help you pass the time.
- I've already read it.

4
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:13,156
You might catch something you missed
the second time around.

5
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,706
Why did you move me
from the rec room down here?

6
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,455
I wanted you under my own roof.

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,674
Where are you keeping
your other prisoner? Miles, is it?

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,390
- You don't want to share.
- Well, I was hoping you would share,

9
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,889
seeing as you claim
to have a spy on his ship.

10
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,930
I feel for you, John. I really do.

11
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,940
You keep hitting dead ends.

12
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,550
You couldn't find the cabin.
You can't make contact with Jacob.

13
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,532
You're so desperate to figure out

14
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,954
what to do next,
you're even asking me for help.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,510
So here we are, just like old times...

16
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,878
except I'm locked
in a different room.

17
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,844
And you're more lost
than you ever were.

18
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,181
I know what you're trying to do.
It's not gonna work.

19
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,393
- Excellent, John. You're evolving.
- Done with your breakfast?

20
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,307
What was that all about?

21
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,713
Who knows? It's Locke.

22
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,508
Mornin', ladies.

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,420
Good morning.

24
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,670
Mornin'.

25
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,710
Coffee smells good.

26
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,550
Well... Why don't I go make you a cup?

27
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,530
Kinda weird, ain't it?

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,871
Sitting on porches,
drinking coffee out of mugs.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,742
Anyway, I found some clothes
about your size.

30
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,534
Hung 'em in a closet.

31
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,539
- So after I kick out Hugo...
- I'm not moving in with you.

32
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,419
Well... Then why did you stay?

33
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,754
That's none of your business.

34
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,485
You got a secret agenda?

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,385
- If you're spying for Jack...
- I'm not spying for anyone.

36
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:39,012
- So why don't you tell me...
- Because I don't trust you.

37
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,477
This is about the pregnancy thing.

38
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:52,153
Go home.

39
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,872
Okay, fine.

40
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:01,662
See you later, then.

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,548
You ready?

42
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,900
Is there a back entrance?

43
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,118
Yeah, but you're going in the front door

44
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,182
with your head held high, okay?

45
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,250
Let's do this.

46
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,694
Why'd you do it, Kate?

47
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,020
Coming through.

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,710
Folks, we're not making any statements
or answering any questions right now.

49
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,127
Excuse us.

50
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,150
The people
versus Katherine Anne Austen.

51
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,464
The honorable
arthur galzethron presiding.

52
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,020
The bailiff will read the counts.
Will the defendant please rise?

53
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,556
Katherine Anne Austen,
you are charged with fraud,

54
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,101
arson,
assault on a federal officer,

55
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:08,104
assault with a deadly weapon,
grand larceny,

56
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,909
grand theft auto,

57
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,107
and murder in the first degree.

58
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:14,363
Miss Austen, how do you plead?

59
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,270
Not guilty.

60
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,370
Thus entered.

61
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,959
I'll now hear argument on bail.

62
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,845
Your Honor, we are requesting

63
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:29,291
that the defendant be remanded into
custody for the duration of the trial.

64
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:31,880
Your Honor, my client was free
pending arraignment.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,130
- Now, she's a flight risk?
- She's the very definition of it.

66
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,745
She has one of the most
recognizable faces in America.

67
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,355
Where will she run?

68
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,948
Based on your prior history,
I'm inclined to agree wh the people.

69
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:47,142
You're hereby remanded into federal
custody for the duration of your trial.

70
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,355
- Your Honor, my-...
- Take the defendant into custody.

71
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,440
Sorry.

72
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:16,589
Subtitles: www.soustitreslost.com

73
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,367
Albuquerque?

74
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,921
Too hot.

75
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,806
- New York?
- Too many people.

76
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,307
More than Seoul?

77
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,058
What's wrong with Seoul?

78
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,537
Sun, we're going to leave this island
any moment now.

79
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,730
I learn english...

80
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
for you...

81
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,215
to live... in... America.

82
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,930
I want...

83
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,220
to raise my baby at home.

84
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,668
In Korea.

85
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,212
You mean our baby.

86
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,726
This is, Charlotte and Dan.

87
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:14,604
Their helicopter already took Sayid
and Desmond back to their freighter.

88
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,053
They can make arrangements
to get all of us off this island.

89
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:20,668
Where's Kate?

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,350
She stayed with Locke.

91
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,600
Is that blood?

92
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,946
I just...

93
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,950
killed a chicken.

94
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,250
What can I do for you?

95
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,579
I wanna talk to Miles.
Where you keeping him?

96
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,660
Why do you need to talk to him?

97
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,137
Well, that's personal.

98
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,540
- What gives you the right to decide?
- You may think this is a democracy

99
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,021
because of the way
Jack ran things, but it isn't.

100
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:02,278
Then I guess
that makes it a dictatorship.

101
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:06,323
If I was a dictator, I would just
shoot you and go about my day.

102
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:10,408
Dinner's at six if you're hungry.

103
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,480
Wait.

104
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,131
You bringing that to Miles?

105
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,010
- Yeah, Locke asked me to do it.
- Cool. That dude creeps me out.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,722
- He's still in the rec room, right?
- No, I moved him to the boathouse...

107
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,619
You just totally
scooby-doo'd me, right?

108
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,002
Sorry.

109
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,070
- You're not gonna let him go, are ya?
- No. No, I promise.

110
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,196
Don't tell Locke it was me.

111
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,107
So the arab traded you too?

112
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,203
- Do you know who I am?
- Excuse me?

113
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,373
Do you know who I am?

114
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,168
Do you know what I did?

115
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,928
What did you do?

116
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:47,048
Answer me.

117
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,810
I'll tell you what you want to know,
but you gotta do something for me first.

118
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,875
- I'm not letting you go.
- I don't want to be let go.

119
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,774
I'm exactly where I wanna be.

120
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,730
What I want...

121
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,883
is one minute...

122
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:12,575
of someone's time.

123
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,463
You bring him to me,

124
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,457
and I will tell you
everything I know about you.

125
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
Who?

126
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,631
Who do you think?

127
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,680
You okay?

128
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,090
Yeah, I'm fine.

129
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:51,070
The D.A.'s decided
to try this case herself,

130
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,907
So they'll do the full court press,

131
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,367
and we need to talk
about cutting a deal.

132
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,411
What kind of deal?

133
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,326
Honestly, my best guess,
I'd say she'll take a 15-year sentence,

134
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,459
- and you serve seven.
- No way.

135
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:09,043
If you go trial, you're looking
at 20 years on each count,

136
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,259
not to mention a life sentence
on the murder charge.

137
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,849
You confessed to your mother
that you killed your father,

138
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,208
and now she's their star witness.

139
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,810
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to win this thing?

140
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,431
Put me on the stand.

141
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,640
And take a chance
with the D.A. crossing you? No.

142
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,860
Way I see it,
we've got one shot at this.

143
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,897
What?

144
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,427
We make it about character,
not about what you did or didn't do,

145
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,229
but about who you are.

146
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,994
What do you mean, who I am?

147
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:44,314
- I want him in the courtroom.
- Absolutely not.

148
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,744
- It'll generate tremendous sympathy.
- Duncan, listen to me.

149
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,934
You are not bringing him in here.

150
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,044
You wanna make this about me,
about my character? Fine.

151
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:56,183
But you are not using my son.

152
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,723
Maybe we should try a number

153
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,309
other than the boat, like... 9-1-1.

154
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,647
What's wrong?

155
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,316
Nothing.

156
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:18,034
- We can't contact their boat.
- You haven't heard from Sayid?

157
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,454
You said they left yesterday.

158
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,586
And I'm sure they're fine.

159
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,871
What if Locke was right?
What if they are here to hurt us?

160
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,123
Locke has no idea what he's doing.

161
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,051
Then why is kate with him?

162
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:46,019
You sure he's got Ben
in his basement?

163
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,853
I saw Rousseau
take him in there last night.

164
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:52,064
- Does Locke ever go out?
- He's been in there cooking all day.

165
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:53,985
He invited us all over for dinner.

166
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,776
Can you get Aaron for me?

167
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:04,370
Just pick him up
and rock him a little bit.

168
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,260
Yeah, I'm just...
not very good with babies.

169
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,573
I wouldn't want him
to get more upset.

170
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,192
Here, I got him.

171
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:22,967
It's okay.

172
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:27,138
Here we go, muffin.
Yeah. There we go.

173
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,642
You're so good with him.

174
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:34,227
What?

175
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:38,215
Just the last thing I ever thought
I'd be good at is being a mum.

176
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,116
You should try it sometime.

177
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,096
Hey, Aaron. Come on, sweetie.

178
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,905
Please rise.

179
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,839
Court is now in session.
Please be seated.

180
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,274
Don't fire me, okay?

181
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,297
What?

182
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,976
We got killed in the opening.
I had to do this.

183
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:10,500
Does the defense have a witness?

184
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,090
Yes, we do, Your Honor.

185
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,642
The defense calls Dr. Jack Shephard
to the witness stand.

186
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,206
Your Honor, I renew my objection
to this witness. He's irrelevant.

187
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,625
And I renew my overruling
of your objection.

188
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,079
Be aware that this witness
did not meet the defendant

189
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,799
until after the alleged crimes
she's being charged with.

190
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,607
He's to be viewed
as a character witness only.

191
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,994
- Proceed.
- Please raise your right hand.

192
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,435
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

193
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,973
so help you God?

194
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,480
Could you please tell the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

195
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,368
if there are any of you who don't read
newspapers or the Internet or watch TV,

196
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,687
how you met the defendant?

197
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:14,798
On september 22, 2004, Kate...

198
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:21,169
Miss Austen and I were both passengers
on Oceanic flight 815,

199
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,046
which crash-landed
on an island in the South Pacific.

200
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:27,508
Were you aware that Miss Austen
was a fugitive being transported

201
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,767
by a United States Marshal
on that flight to Los Angeles for trial?

202
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:34,229
- I did learn that eventually, yes.
- From the U.S. Marshal?

203
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,980
The Marshal died in the crash.

204
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,773
I never spoke to him.
Miss Austen told me.

205
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,213
Did you ever ask her
if she was guilty?

206
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:49,605
No. Never.

207
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,163
Seems like a reasonable question.
Why not?

208
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:56,500
I just assumed that there'd been
some kind of mistake.

209
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,635
And why would you think that?

210
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:04,303
Only 8 of us survived the crash.
We landed in the water.

211
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,967
I was hurt pretty badly.

212
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,642
In fact, if it weren't for her,
I would have never made it to the shore.

213
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:15,053
She took care of me.
She took care of all of us.

214
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:18,315
She gave us first aid, water,
found food,

215
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,736
made shelter. She tried to save
the other two, but they didn't...

216
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,407
Miss Austen, please, sit down.

217
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:29,702
This has nothing to do with...
With anything.

218
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,416
It's my trial, and I don't want him
to say anything else.

219
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,829
It's fine.
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

220
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,339
Miss Dunbrook, your witness.

221
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,859
That was very moving, Dr. Shephard.

222
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,347
I only have one question for you.

223
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,834
- Do you love the defendant?
- Objection!

224
00:16:57,301 --> 00:17:00,065
You opened this door, Mr. Forrester.
I'll allow it.

225
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,338
Dr. Shephard?

226
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,823
Do you love Miss Austen?

227
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,951
Not anymore.

228
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:28,677
So what do you want to watch?
<i>Xanadu</i> or <i>Satan's doom</i>?

229
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,220
I'm reading.

230
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,684
- Turn that thing down, damn it!
- Sorry.

231
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:49,140
Can I come in?

232
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,735
Sure. I believe you know my roommate.

233
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,286
Got something in your eye, Hugo?

234
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,007
Why don't we talk in the kitchen?

235
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,821
I know it's in a box, but...

236
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,826
It's pretty damn good wine.
I tested it.

237
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,243
So how's the life at <i>casa de Claire</i>?

238
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,107
- Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?
- No, he's a good sleeper.

239
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:25,396
Good for you.

240
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,952
You're terrible at this, Freckles.

241
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:39,289
- Terrible at what?
- You said you didn't stay for me.

242
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,499
So at least be woman enough to tell me
you wanna use me for something.

243
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,759
I wanna use you for something.

244
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,970
See? Wasn't that hard.

245
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,353
- For what?
- For Ben.

246
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,225
I want you to help me bust him out.

247
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,862
- You wanna play some Backgammon?
- You're on.

248
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,944
Do you think I know what I'm doing?

249
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,223
Do you...

250
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,392
regret following me out here, or are you
worried about what we should do next?

251
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:35,971
All I know is I'd be a lot more worried
if I was sitting on that beach.

252
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,130
And the rest of the group,
what do they say?

253
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,310
I think they're saying,"baa."

254
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:45,355
That's the nice thing about sheep.
They're predictable.

255
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,695
But I ain't so sure about Kate.

256
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,601
What do you mean?

257
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,786
I need your word
you'll do nothing to her.

258
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,831
- Why would I do anything to her?
- Just give me your word.

259
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,462
- You know what? Forget it.
- No. All right.

260
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:11,662
You have my word.

261
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,339
She came to me about an hour ago.

262
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,932
Said she wanted my help busting Ben
out of your basement.

263
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:22,880
Why?

264
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,606
She talked to that guy...

265
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,638
Bruce Lee from the freighter,
the guy you got locked up.

266
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:31,652
He told her to bring Ben to him
to chat.

267
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,154
It's impossible.
She doesn't know where Miles is.

268
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,086
What? The boathouse down by the dock?

269
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,953
If Hugo knows, everybody knows.

270
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,457
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:53,549
- Where you going with that?
- Whatever Miles has to say to Ben,

272
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,969
he can say to me.

273
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,349
Son of a bitch.

274
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:33,415
Come on.

275
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,481
You got one minute. Go.

276
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,955
- How about some privacy?
- 55 seconds.

277
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,752
You know who I am?

278
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,919
You know who I work for?

279
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,964
Then you know he's put a lot of time
and energy to find you.

280
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:28,310
So now I found you, and I can tell him
exactly where you are.

281
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,399
Or I can lie and tell him
you were already dead.

282
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:40,113
And I'd be willing to do that
for $3.2 million.

283
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,161
You've arranged this meeting
so you could blackmail me?

284
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:52,084
- It's extortion, technically speaking.
- 3.2? Well, why not 3.3 or 3.4?

285
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,936
What makes you think I have access
to that kind of money?

286
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,052
Do not treat me like I'm one of them!

287
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,806
Like I don't know who you are
and what you can do.

288
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,269
- Your friend Charlotte knows I'm alive.
- I'll take care of her.

289
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:14,815
Just worry about getting me the money.
You have two days.

290
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:18,276
My present situation is a little bit
restricted. Can that be amended?

291
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,010
- One week, in cash.
- Time's up.

292
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,057
- Don't even think about...
- I said time's up!

293
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:33,500
- This is hot.
- You got your chat. I want my answer.

294
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,132
We got your name
when you called the freighter.

295
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,218
Of course, we know about you
and everybody else on the manifest.

296
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:46,764
- Then prove it.
- Your name is Katherine Anne Austen.

297
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:49,495
You're wanted for murder,
fraud, arson,

298
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:52,019
a whole bunch of other stuff
I can't remember.

299
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,028
You're a fugitive.

300
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:57,989
You got caught in Australia,
and the feds were bringing you back.

301
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,981
So, yeah, we know.

302
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,342
If I were you,
I'd stay right here on the island.

303
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:09,770
Who knows?
Maybe you didn't survive the crash.

304
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,829
Come on.

305
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,798
Go back to your house.

306
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:25,969
- This has nothing to do with you...
- Go back to your house!

307
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,318
You okay?

308
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,159
I couldn't sleep.

309
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,204
Yeah.
The beds take a little getting used to.

310
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,080
- I didn't wake Aaron, did I?
- No.

311
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,959
Aaron was born on this island.
He can sleep through anything.

312
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,885
- What are you doing?
- I'd like a moment alone with Kate.

313
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,553
Would you excuse us, please?

314
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,340
It's okay.

315
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,441
I don't need to know
why you did what you did.

316
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,387
I just need to know
what they said to each other.

317
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:32,570
Miles told Ben th he would lie
to the people he works for on the boat,

318
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,205
tell them that Ben was dead
for $3.2 million.

319
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,713
Listen, I'm sorry.
I asked you where he was...

320
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,049
You're not welcome here anymore.

321
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,762
I want you gone by morning.

322
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,350
You two can have a few minutes
of privacy.

323
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,832
- I don't need any privacy.
- You need to talk to her.

324
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,548
I'll be outside.

325
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,512
Hello, Katherine.

326
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:37,434
Was it true, what he said,

327
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,187
Dr. Shephard? That you're a hero?

328
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,370
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Because the last time I tried,

329
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,260
when you got sick,
when I risked my life to see you,

330
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,293
- you screamed and called the police.
- Please.

331
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,715
I don't wanna fight with you.

332
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,140
Why are you here?

333
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,317
Because...

334
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:28,485
It all changed
when I thought you were dead.

335
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,330
My doctors have given me
6 months to live for the last 4 years.

336
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,768
I don't know how long
I'm going to last.

337
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,260
I came here to tell you that I...

338
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:52,081
I don't want to testify against you.

339
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:03,103
Then don't.

340
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:10,402
I want to see my grandson.

341
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:19,911
You came here to make a deal?

342
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,394
I just wanna meet him.

343
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,251
I don't want you anywhere near him.

344
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,334
We're finished.

345
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,950
Hey, Freckles.

346
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:49,774
You okay?

347
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,157
I'm sorry I couldn't do nothing.

348
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,868
I wanted him to think
that you fooled me, too.

349
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:05,204
No sense in him
not trusting both of us.

350
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,294
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

351
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,505
What, he... banished you?

352
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,620
Well, I un-banish you.

353
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,215
You can stay...

354
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:23,850
right here.

355
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:26,311
This is my house.

356
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,106
Okay, me and Montezuma's house.

357
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,198
You're gonna be all right.

358
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,367
I'll keep you safe.

359
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,290
Time. OK, tell me.

360
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,304
What do you remember?

361
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,188
Okay... Queen of diamonds.

362
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,404
Then we... Six

363
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,819
of...

364
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,821
clubs! Sorry.

365
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,435
And we have the red ten of...

366
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,578
hearts, maybe?

367
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,022
It's two out of three.

368
00:30:36,352 --> 00:30:38,633
It's not bad. It's progress.

369
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,405
Three cards, Charlotte?

370
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:44,014
Is that progress?

371
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,040
Been calling your boat all day.
Why isn't anyone answering?

372
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,964
We're here. How should we know?

373
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,231
- If they're not answering...
- Are you saying

374
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,140
there's only one line on that boat?

375
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,947
There is another number we're only
supposed to use in emergencies.

376
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,287
It's an emergency.

377
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,829
Put it on speaker.

378
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:33,110
- Regina, it's Charlotte.
<i>- Why are you calling me on this number?</i>

379
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,689
Minkowski wasn't answering.

380
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:39,488
The people on the island want to talk
to their friends, make sure they're OK.

381
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,987
<i>What friends?</i>

382
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,752
They left last night.

383
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:48,973
- Frank took 'em up in the helicopter.
<i>- What do you mean, they took off?</i>

384
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,414
<i>I thought the helicopter was with you.</i>

385
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,393
Morning.

386
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,940
Listen, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

387
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,123
- but you're wasting your time.
- Open your mouth.

388
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,070
Open your mouth. Wide.

389
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,990
Don't talk. Bite down, bite down.

390
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,368
I realize that when I tied you up
in here the other day,

391
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:33,623
I made the mistake of failing
to introduce myself. I'm John Locke,

392
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:37,530
and I'm responsible
for the well-being of this island.

393
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,318
Eventually, Miles,
you're gonna tell me who you are,

394
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:44,259
who are the people on the boat,
and why you're so interested in Ben.

395
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:48,888
In the meantime, however,
you're gonna keep your mouth shut.

396
00:32:52,394 --> 00:32:54,145
I learned something yesterday.

397
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,859
No use having rules if there's
no punishment for breaking 'em.

398
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:01,252
You'll be fine
if you bite down on the trigger.

399
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,510
Enjoy your breakfast.

400
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,895
Wait. Wait a minute.

401
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,274
- Just slow down.
- Come on.

402
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,464
It's not like we ain't never done it
before.

403
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:48,420
Yeah, I'm cool
we didn't go all the way last night.

404
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,682
I get it. You were sad.

405
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:54,984
But, I mean,
how can you resist after that whole

406
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:57,415
"I'll keep you safe" thing?

407
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,472
What?

408
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,748
- What did I say?
- Just... forget it.

409
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,214
Oh, right.

410
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,638
You still think you might be pregnant.

411
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,007
I'm not worried.

412
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:22,357
And I'm not pregnant.

413
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,768
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

414
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:30,826
I mean...

415
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:34,370
Would it have been
the worst thing in the world?

416
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,663
Yes, it would've been!

417
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,625
- What would we have done with a baby?
- I'm going back to the beach.

418
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:46,005
Beach?
What, you're leaving because of this?

419
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,217
That's that?
You crawl up in my bed one second,

420
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,010
- the next, you...
- Good-bye.

421
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,349
Don't make this about me. You didn't
want a baby any more than I did.

422
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:01,145
You're just looking for some excuse
to split, and now you got one.

423
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:06,420
That's all right, Freckles.
I ain't gonna hold it against you.

424
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm just gonna sit right here
in my comfy bed,

425
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,228
because in about a week, you'll find
some reason to get pissed at Jack

426
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,451
and bounce right back to me.

427
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,264
Miss Dunbrook.

428
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,277
Are the people ready to proceed?

429
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:54,282
- May we approach the bench, Your Honor?
- Please.

430
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,340
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
our chief witness, Diane Jansen,

431
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,670
the mother of the defendant, is unable
to testify because of medical reasons.

432
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:09,917
How long will you need?

433
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,080
- I can't say right now.
- I'll grant a recess for lunch,

434
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,263
but be prepared to proceed
with your case after we return.

435
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,893
- This court is now in recess.
- All rise.

436
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,291
We have to talk.

437
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,363
My key witness spoke to her daughter
yesterday, and now she's got cold feet.

438
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,909
Quit posturing, and let's get to it.
What are you offering?

439
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:41,078
Four years in.

440
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,297
No jail time.
Kate Austen is a worldwide hero

441
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,962
who saved 5 other peoples' lives
after a plane crash,

442
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:53,341
and nearly starved to death
on a deserted island and after all that,

443
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:58,221
you put this woman on trial for rescuing
her mother from an abusive husband.

444
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:00,640
If you think that jury

445
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,631
is gonna give her actual time, then...

446
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,354
you must have a hell of a closing,
Melissa.

447
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:10,762
All right.

448
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,988
Time served, plus 10 years' probation
and agreement not to leave the state.

449
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:19,367
- What does that matter? She can go...
- I'll take it.

450
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,160
No. Wait.

451
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,581
Give me something to sign, I'll sign it.
And then I walk out the back door.

452
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,376
I just...

453
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,671
want this to be over.

454
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:35,480
I can do that.

455
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,761
10 years' probation,
and you stay put.

456
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,439
I have a child.

457
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,518
I'm not going anywhere.

458
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,516
How did you know I'd be here?

459
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:12,642
Your lawyer gave me the heads-up.

460
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,417
He owed me one.

461
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,287
Thank you.

462
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,339
For saying what you did.

463
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:23,890
You're welcome.

464
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:28,070
You know, I've heard you say
that story so many times.

465
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:31,124
I'm starting to think you believe it.

466
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:39,596
I just wanted to tell you
that what I said in there...

467
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,285
I didn't mean it.

468
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,170
You wanna follow me?
Come by for a visit?

469
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,913
I actually have to get over
to the hospital,

470
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,282
but maybe you and I could grab
some coffee together or something?

471
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,031
I know why you don't wanna see
the baby.

472
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,944
But until you do,

473
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,196
until you want to...

474
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:27,954
there's no you and me
going for coffee.

475
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,285
But...

476
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,926
if at any time you change your mind,
come and see us.

477
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,400
Hello?

478
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:42,486
Kate! I'm so glad you're back.

479
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,535
- He missed you so much.
- Did you keep him away from the TV?

480
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,870
Absolutely.

481
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:53,706
I put him down for a nap.

482
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,568
Hey, buddy.

483
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:32,943
Hi, mommy.

484
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,748
Hi, Aaron.
