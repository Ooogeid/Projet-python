1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,400
Jack? Jack?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,930
Jack! Jack!

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,500
Jack? Jack?

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,020
Jack, I need you to wake up.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,890
Jack! Jack!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,170
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,530
You okay?

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,940
Come on! come on!
I just wanna know why.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,450
What happened?

10
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,050
He knows somethin'!

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,590
I want the truth!
I don't know. that's the truth.

12
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:45,059
I'm telling you, I don't know why,
but there's no signal now. signal?

13
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:48,208
What, there was a signal when you
called them last night. that's right.

14
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,352
So--so--so what?
now they're just ignoring us?

15
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:52,440
How are we supposed to know
why they're not answering?

16
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:53,940
Oh, who's talking to you?
and in case you haven't noticed,

17
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,401
We're not on the bloody boat, are we?
just watch your tone, red.

18
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,732
I just wanna know why. hey!

19
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,250
Everybody just needs to calm down,
okay? jack,

20
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:02,610
These people are lying to us.

21
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:05,242
I know they're lying.
I know it.

22
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:09,021
Sooner or later, their people
are gonna come back for them,

23
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:12,542
And when they do,
we'll be waiting for them.

24
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,370
Unless they run off again.
listen to me.

25
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,502
Jack, are you all right?
no, I'm fine.

26
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,911
We just have to
be patient, okay?

27
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,503
I've gotten us this far.

28
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,581
I said I was gonna get us
off the island--all of us.

29
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:29,702
I promised that I would.

30
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:33,731
Jack? Jack? Jack?
Jack? jack? jack?

31
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:34,931
Jack Jack.

32
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,131
Is he all right?

33
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:39,020
Jack? Jack?

34
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,412
Jack Jack.

35
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:00,382
Hello?

36
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,551
Dr. shephard?

37
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,720
Just confirming your 11:00
consult with ms. berenberg.

38
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,073
It was moved up yesterday,

39
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,962
And I know how you are
with your calendar.

40
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:12,931
Yeah. yeah, I remember, jane.
I'll, um... I'll be in there.

41
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,542
Thank you, doctor.
all right. bye.

42
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,561
Ow. son of a bitch.

43
00:02:58,746 --> 00:02:59,593
A-rod.

44
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:11,722
Morning.

45
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:13,470
Morning yourself.

46
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,361
I bought you a razor.

47
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:17,830
What, you don't
like the scruff?

48
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,892
Razor's by the sink, jack.

49
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:40,000
Morning.

50
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,993
"alice took up the fan,
and as the hall was very hot,

51
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,611
"she kept fanning herself

52
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,670
"all the time she
went on talking,

53
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,942
"'dear, dear.
how queer everything is today.

54
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,311
"'and yesterday,
things went on just as usual.

55
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,631
"'i wonder if I've been
changed in the night.

56
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,861
Let me think. was I the same
when I got up this morning? '"

57
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:38,321
"'but if I'm not the same,
the next question is,

58
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,212
"who in the world am i? '

59
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,401
Aha, that's the great puzzle. "

60
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,293
You're a natural.

61
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:16,331
Yeah?

62
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,293
Yeah.

63
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:20,243
My old man used to
read me that story.

64
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:21,402
Really?

65
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:23,280
What?

66
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,312
It's just...

67
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,942
It's just sweet hearing you
say nice things about your dad.

68
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't say nice
things about my dad?

69
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:37,343
Well, he was a good storyteller.
I'll give him that.

70
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,670
You okay?

71
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:49,852
Yeah.

72
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,713
Just, i...
I love seeing you with him.

73
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,261
I'm so glad you
changed your mind.

74
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,701
I'm so glad that you're here.

75
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,341
Me, too.

76
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,450
Keep him in the shade.
I'll get him some water.

77
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,512
Give--give him some air, guys.

78
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,161
You okay?

79
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:36,660
Yeah.

80
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:40,221
I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.

81
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,650
Hey, what happened?
he passed out.

82
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,712
You fainted?

83
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:47,820
I'm fine. I'm just, uh...
just a little dehydrated.

84
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,283
No, jack. you're not okay.
you're burning up.

85
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,690
I'm fine. I'm fine. I just...

86
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,151
Just need to get a
little rest. jack--

87
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:55,072
I'm fine.

88
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:06,301
You okay?
yeah, just a bit woozy.

89
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,422
How's your head?

90
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,703
It's better. bit of a headache,

91
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,243
But at least I'm not
seeing things anymore.

92
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,023
Yeah? what'd you see?

93
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,781
Back off, donger.

94
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,143
I'm just making conversation.
let's make some time.

95
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,932
I wanna cover more ground
before we gotta camp tonight.

96
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,483
If we hoof it, we can make it
to the beach by noon tomorrow.

97
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,612
No!

98
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:35,563
What?

99
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,472
Who's danielle and karl?

100
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,082
Y-you mean rousseau?
the french woman?

101
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh, my god.

102
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,280
Is this your french woman?

103
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,293
Karl Karl.

104
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:20,221
How'd you know they
were down there?

105
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,491
Your buddies do this?

106
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,420
They're not my buddies, man.

107
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:30,951
I didn't sign up for this.

108
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,992
Can we just--can we just get out
of here, please? can we just go?

109
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah, yeah, of course.
but don't worry.

110
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,550
Once we get back to the beach,
everything's gonna be fine.

111
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:41,843
All right?

112
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,323
Come on.

113
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,313
Let's go.

114
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,462
I hate being sick.

115
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,320
What do you think it is?

116
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,230
It's food poisoning.

117
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:06,132
What makes you think that?

118
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:10,563
I've got some cramping,
dehydrated, nausea.

119
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,411
I respectfully disagree.

120
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:16,670
Do you?

121
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,760
You want to lift your shirt up?

122
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,022
If it's food poisoning,
you got nothing to worry about.

123
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:48,442
It's your appendix, jack.

124
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,271
When did the pain start?

125
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,030
Yesterday.

126
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,662
Has it ruptured?

127
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,783
Not yet.

128
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,870
Well...

129
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,113
I guess we're just gonna
have to take it out.

130
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,110
Do you remember where
the medical station is?

131
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,823
-Or don't you?
-Yes, I remember.

132
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,791
These are the instruments that
I need you to bring back.

133
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:20,680
-You'll find them in the drawers in
the exam room. -"clamps"? sutures"?

134
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,371
Juliet, I don't know
what these look like.

135
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:26,602
I can help you.
I'm familiar with surgical instruments.

136
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,843
I thought you were a physicist.
Yeah, well,

137
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,913
I've done some animal autopsies,
too, so if--if-- no.

138
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:35,242
We can't trust them.
-See, Dan? I told you.

139
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,051
They're convinced we're
trying to kill 'em.

140
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,632
-Might as well keep playing the part.
-Damn it, charlotte.

141
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,302
That right there,
that right there.

142
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:44,290
Your--your attitude--
your very bad attitude--

143
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,430
It's exactly why
they don't trust us.

144
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,340
Come on.

145
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:50,349
Juliet, please.

146
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,438
Don't blame us for--for this,
for whatever is happening.

147
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,653
We're scientists.
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

148
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,363
We just wanna help.
Please let us help.

149
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:06,093
Either of them tries to run?
Shoot 'em in the leg.

150
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:10,010
Get back here as fast
as you can. Okay.

151
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,522
Thank you.

152
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,583
We need to create a
sterile environment.

153
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,663
Find a hard surface,
wash it down,

154
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,282
Gather as many
tarps as you can.

155
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:21,830
Hey, juliet.

156
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,373
If everything that we need
is at the medical station,

157
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,851
-Then why don't we just bring jack
there? -Because if we move him,

158
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:30,260
There's a good chance that
his appendix will rupture.

159
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,341
And if that happens,
he's gonna die.

160
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,553
Don't even think about it.

161
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:52,161
What?

162
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:57,240
Don't look at her.
Don't talk to her.

163
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,340
Don't mess with her.

164
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:03,581
You got a restraining order.
20 feet.

165
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,302
What are you, her big brother?

166
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:09,193
No. I'm the guy who's gonna
put a boot in your face

167
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,980
Unless you say, "yeah.
I getcha. "

168
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:12,703
Yeah. I getcha.

169
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,152
Honey, I am sure Jack
is gonna be okay.

170
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:29,342
An appendectomy

171
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,403
Is just about the most common
kind of surgery there is.

172
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:33,930
That's not what I
was thinking about.

173
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,901
I was thinking,
"why did he get sick? "

174
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,363
Why? It's just--
it's just bad luck.

175
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:41,571
The day before we're all
supposed to be rescued,

176
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,201
The person that we
count on the most

177
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,361
Suddenly comes down with a
life-threatening condition,

178
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:48,102
-And you're chalking it up to bad luck?
-Well, what are you saying,

179
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,313
That--that Jack did
something to offend the gods?

180
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,551
People get sick, Rose.
-Not here.

181
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:58,993
Here, they get better.

182
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,241
When was the last
time you did this?

183
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,913
An appendectomy or
shaving a man's stomach?

184
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,580
In my residency.

185
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,561
I did a lot of 'em back then.

186
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,960
Then you know the
incision needs to be

187
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,323
2 inches lower than
where you're shaving.

188
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,390
I'm just cleaning the area.

189
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:33,370
Thank you.

190
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,780
I wanna talk you through it.

191
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:42,672
What?

192
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,550
I don't want to be unconscious.

193
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,870
We can use the lidocaine

194
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:48,532
To numb the area.

195
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,882
And then I can
watch the procedure,

196
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:53,753
Help you out.

197
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:56,430
And, uh,
how are you gonna watch

198
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:59,680
Flat on your back with my hand
in your abdominal cavity?

199
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:03,412
We can use a mirror.
kate can hold it.

200
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,781
If someone's going
to be in there,

201
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,963
Shouldn't it be someone
with medical experience?

202
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,130
-Bernard's a dentist--
-No, I want it to be kate.

203
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:19,611
Okay.

204
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,502
Don't worry, Ms. berenberg.
You're in good hands.

205
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,392
Thank you.

206
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:29,773
-I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.
M. ? -Mm-hmm.

207
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,833
And remember,
no solid food. okay?

208
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,473
-Thank you, doctor.
-Have a good evening.

209
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:37,280
Jack? Jack?

210
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,421
Jack? Jack?

211
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,310
Will you take a
look at this x-ray?

212
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,001
-Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know
what you think. -The L4. yeah. yeah.

213
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,633
Oh, Dr.
Shephard, there's a call for you.

214
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:53,433
It's a dr.
stillman from Santa rosa hospital,

215
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,051
Says it's about a
friend of yours.

216
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,612
He's refusing to take his meds,

217
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,830
And he's stopped sleeping.

218
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,083
What about his
therapy sessions?

219
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,841
Therapy's... been
rendered useless.

220
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:09,731
And why is that?

221
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,651
Because he doesn't
think I exist.

222
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,470
Hey, hurley.

223
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,540
Hey, jack.

224
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,631
Why aren't you
taking your meds?

225
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:40,490
Cause we're dead...

226
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:43,462
All of us.

227
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,681
All the oceanic six--
we're all dead.

228
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,713
We never got off that island.

229
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,703
Hurley Hurley...

230
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,680
That is not true.

231
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,132
What'd you do today?

232
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,291
What did I do today?

233
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,491
I, uh...

234
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,962
I woke up, took a shower.

235
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:07,343
Uh, kate and I fed the baby.

236
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:10,961
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with aaron.

237
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,363
I changed my mind
after the trial.

238
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:16,991
Living with kate...

239
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,593
Taking care of aaron...

240
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:21,993
It all seems so perfect...

241
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:24,130
Just like heaven.

242
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,421
Just because I'm happy

243
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:30,262
Doesn't mean that this
isn't real, hurley.

244
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,842
I was happy, too, jack...

245
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,643
For a while, anyway.

246
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,350
Then I saw charlie.

247
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,321
He likes to sit with
me on the bench

248
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,713
Out on the front lawn.

249
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,681
It's pretty cool, actually.

250
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay. so what do the
two of you talk about?

251
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, yesterday,
he told me you were gonna be coming by.

252
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,800
He wanted me to
give you a message.

253
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,180
A message?

254
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:13,892
He made me write it down
so I wouldn't mess it up.

255
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,540
"you're not supposed to raise him,
jack. "

256
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,780
Does that make any sense?

257
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:29,151
No, that...
doesn't make any sense.

258
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,372
Do you think he means aaron?

259
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,000
Take your meds, hurley.

260
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:44,273
Just take 'em.

261
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:46,843
Hey, jack?

262
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:52,501
Charlie said someone's
gonna be visiting you, too.

263
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,253
Soon.

264
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:09,693
We're here.

265
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:27,830
Why don't you let me go first?

266
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:30,751
Um, you know,
make sure everything's safe.

267
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,203
Okay.

268
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,483
Be careful, dan.

269
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,040
Absolutely.

270
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,663
Do you think she
knows he likes her?

271
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,551
She's a woman. She knows.

272
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:45,932
Jin. Come on.

273
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,672
Where do you suppose all
this power's coming from?

274
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,633
Add that one to the list, dan.

275
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,052
Let's just grab the equipment and go,
shall we?

276
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:06,453
Are you all right?

277
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,251
This is where
Juliet brought me.

278
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:11,900
This is where I saw our baby.

279
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,543
They're not going
to help us, Jin.

280
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,783
Don't worry about them.

281
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:28,710
I promise you Sun.

282
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:32,640
I will get you and our
baby off this island.

283
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,331
Whoa! hey,
you want a hand with the baby?

284
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,023
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

285
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:53,233
You sure? I'm good with kids.
what part of "restraining order"

286
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:54,502
Don't you understand?

287
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,133
Get behind me, claire.

288
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,290
Who the hell are you?

289
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:14,423
-Lapidus? -Miles?
Lapidus? miles?

290
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:16,362
You two know each other?

291
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,971
You gotta hide, man,
right now. what?

292
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,501
Keamy's coming back,

293
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,702
And if he sees you,
he'll kill all of ya.

294
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:24,853
And he's close, man.
you gotta hide now!

295
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,610
Go! hide! come on.

296
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,572
Just hide!

297
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,403
Come on. come on. let's go!

298
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,960
Where's the chopper?
it's about a click back that way.

299
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:40,410
Did you bring the kit?
yeah, it's right here.

300
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,763
Jeez, man, he looks bad.
what the hell happened?

301
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,502
You do your job. I'll do mine.

302
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:57,270
Okay.

303
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,832
It's gettin' dark, man.

304
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:00,803
We gotta leave now.

305
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,911
Mr. keamy,
we gotta get back to the chopper.

306
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,451
Keamy, we gotta get back,
cause I'll tell ya right now,

307
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,420
I am not flying faraday's
bearings at night.

308
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:09,293
I'm not gonna do it.

309
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,620
So if you wanna get back,
we gotta leave right now, sir.

310
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:15,352
Fine. you lead the way.

311
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:18,270
Come on.

312
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,181
Okay. come on.

313
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,072
Watch it now.

314
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,832
The tent's all set.
everything's ready.

315
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:32,803
Good. thanks.

316
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,511
Listen, I could use an extra
pair of hands in there.

317
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:39,482
You wanna help me out? um, I don't...
I don't think that's a good idea.

318
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,752
It's just holding a mirror.

319
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,092
Jack wants to watch the surgery,
"talk me through it. "

320
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:45,762
What?

321
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,373
I'm just surprised

322
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:49,200
He's not taking it
out of himself by now.

323
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,052
Jack Jack.

324
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:54,880
What are you doin'?

325
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:58,072
I don't need a stretcher.
I can walk 50 feet. I'll help you.

326
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,432
They're gonna be back with
the instruments soon.

327
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,540
We need to be ready to go
as soon as they get back.

328
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:05,171
See you in there.

329
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:14,283
So it looks like I'm
gonna be your nurse.

330
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,822
Wouldn't be the first time.

331
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:23,953
Listen, um...

332
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,361
If something happens to me--
shut up, Jack.

333
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,110
Fair enough.

334
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:02,763
Kate? Kate?

335
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:05,623
Kate? Kate?

336
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,953
Wake up, Kate.

337
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,152
What time is it?

338
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,771
It's late. I just got home.

339
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:20,501
Were you working?

340
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,091
No. i...

341
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,313
I just...
had to stop and get something.

342
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,723
It just took a while.

343
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:31,013
What's going on? what's wrong?

344
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,593
The other night,
when I was reading to aaron,

345
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:37,562
You said...

346
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,090
That I was a natural.

347
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:43,752
Do you really...

348
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,353
Do you really think
that I'm good at this?

349
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:54,730
Yeah.

350
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,310
You're good at this.

351
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,182
Will you marry me?

352
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:43,651
Yes.

353
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:52,622
Of course I will. yes.

354
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:13,430
Look, they're back.

355
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:17,682
Did you find everything?

356
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,883
Yes, ma'am. entire list.

357
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:21,553
Is he okay?

358
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,173
For now.
sun, we need to sterilize these.

359
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:25,951
There's a pot of water
boiling over here.

360
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:27,760
Charlotte Charlotte.

361
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:29,260
Yeah?

362
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:31,572
I konw you understand me.

363
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,362
Pardon?

364
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:35,122
I know you speak Korean.

365
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,291
You smiled when Sun
and I talked about you

366
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:43,090
And you were listening
to us at the station

367
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,441
Perhaps I can get your
wife to translate--

369
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,651
If you continue to lie...

370
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:50,550
I'm going to hurt
your friend Daniel.

371
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,572
I'm going to break his
fingers one at a time.

372
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,562
Do you understand that?

373
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,350
What do you want?

374
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,890
When the helicopter
comes for you...

375
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:16,453
You're going to take my
wife off this island.

376
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:21,700
What about you and the
rest of your friends?

377
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,672
Just get her on the helicopter.

378
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:51,632
You know, Jack,

379
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,741
They found some chloroform
at the medical station.

380
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,022
I could knock you out.

381
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,963
Wouldn't you rather be dreaming
about something nice back home?

382
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:00,921
No, I'll manage
with the lidocaine.

383
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,332
Kate Kate.

384
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,162
Just hold it right there.

385
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:13,763
Okay, now this is gonna numb
the area of the first incision.

386
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,760
After that,
I would like to be able to tell you

387
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:20,683
You're not gonna feel a thing, but...
you will.

388
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,070
You ready?

389
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:32,353
Okay. here we go.

390
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,532
Okay, Jack. one more.

391
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:00,960
Oh! okay, try not to move.

392
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,053
Just stay still.

393
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:06,791
Spreader. Kate,
i-i can't see it.

394
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:09,461
Sorry. don't worry about the mirror.
just stay still. spreader.

395
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,593
That's good. that's good. yeah.

396
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,103
This is it.

397
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:16,480
That's good.

398
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,820
Knock him out, bernard.
no! no. hey.

399
00:28:23,178 --> 00:28:25,293
Not wanna be unconscious.

400
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,370
You don't want to be
out of control. Kate.

401
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:29,962
Kate, you need to leave.
bernard! no. Kate.

402
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:33,020
Kate, you need to go.
bernard! please. no!

403
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:35,040
Kate, get out of here!
bernard. Kate...

404
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,303
-Jack -Kate Jack. Kate.

405
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,963
Kate, get outta here!
damn it, bernard! knock him out!

406
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,770
I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.

407
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,080
Ryan Laker Laker, ryan.

408
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:55,040
Patient is male, 36.

409
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,792
Osteoblastoma is present

410
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:01,030
In the posterior
area of the lumbar.

411
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,673
I am recommending biopsy for...

412
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:50,703
Jack? Jack?

413
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:10,053
Jack? Jack?

414
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,442
You okay?

415
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:25,030
Uh, yeah. I'm--i'm... I'm okay.

416
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,831
I, uh...

417
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:29,963
I just, uh...

418
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:33,901
The, um,
the smoke detector was...

419
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:36,373
Was beeping, and I just...

420
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:39,822
Okay. thank you for
keeping us safe.

421
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,623
Erika, um...

422
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,912
Do you mind doing me a favor?

423
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:48,030
Yeah, sure.

424
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,100
Can you write a script for...

425
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:52,242
Clonazepam?

426
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,090
For you?

427
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:57,300
Yeah, um...
I just got a lot going on right now,

428
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,283
And I'm just a
little snowed under

429
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:03,281
With all my caseload,
and Kate and I got engaged.

430
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:08,571
Just... not sleepin' very well at night,
you know? just...

431
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:12,631
Thank you.

432
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:14,913
You know, getting engaged

433
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:17,781
Is supposed to help reduce stress,
not create it.

434
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:20,830
Yeah. you're right.

435
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,013
Maybe you should
talk to someone.

436
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:26,390
I'll do that.

437
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:28,600
Good night.

438
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:29,701
Good night.

439
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,902
Yeah, I'll just
have the nanny stay

440
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:44,172
For an extra couple hours.

441
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:46,681
Jack's never home
before 8:00 anyway.

442
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:51,273
I could stay for
at least an hour.

443
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:57,221
I-i gotta go.
Jack's home. Yeah, okay.

444
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll call you later. Bye.

445
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,081
Hey.

446
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,821
Hey. You scared me.

447
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,912
Sorry. I thought
you'd be in bed.

448
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:09,520
Who was that?

449
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:10,961
That was Noreen.

450
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:13,762
Noreen? Noreen?

451
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:16,631
Yeah. She's one of the
moms from the park.

452
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:21,843
What?

453
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:23,851
Nothing. I just...

454
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:26,480
Never heard you
mention her before.

455
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:27,941
Well, now you have.

456
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:33,380
I'll see you upstairs.

457
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,001
Dad?

458
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:53,600
Hey.

459
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,313
Don't worry.

460
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,543
It went well.

461
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,232
She did good.

462
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:05,511
She said you could go back
inside if you want to.

463
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:08,270
Thank you.

464
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:09,383
Okay.

465
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,253
He didn't lose that much blood.

466
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,293
I got the appendix out

467
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:32,021
And put everything back
where it belongs, I think.

468
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:35,401
So he's gonna be okay?

469
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,862
He should be fine.

470
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:40,011
We just have to talk
him into resting.

471
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:41,402
Good luck with that.

472
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:44,852
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

473
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,642
Don't worry about it.

474
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:48,571
You had enough going on.

475
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:55,883
You know, he kissed me.

476
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,021
What?

477
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:00,483
The other day,
when you came back

478
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:02,673
From the other side of the island,
Jack kissed me.

479
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,080
Oh.

480
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:07,973
It was nice.

481
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:12,633
But it wasn't for me.
it was for him.

482
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:15,510
I'm pretty sure he was
trying to prove something.

483
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:17,593
Prove what?

484
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,573
That he doesn't
love someone else.

485
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,373
Thank you, Juliet.

486
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:41,353
Thank you for saving his life.

487
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,673
I know you're awake.

488
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:09,372
Hey.

489
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:13,383
Hey.

490
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:16,360
You're home early.

491
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:17,991
Where's Veronica?

492
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:19,211
I sent her home.

493
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,610
The baby's asleep.

494
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,123
Good.

495
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:28,673
Why was she here?

496
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:34,073
Sorry?

497
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,453
The nanny.

498
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:40,092
She only works till 4:00.

499
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,593
I came home at 6:00.

500
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,772
I had to run some
errands, so...

501
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,323
I asked her to stay
a couple extra hours.

502
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:53,843
What's going on, Jack?

503
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,950
Why are you home so early?

504
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,113
I went to see Hurley.

505
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:04,881
Today?

506
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,320
Last friday.

507
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:10,953
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've gone with you.

508
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:16,821
Because he's crazy, Kate,

509
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,032
And I didn't wanna upset you.

510
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:25,581
Where were you today?

511
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:36,611
I'm gonna ask you...

512
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:38,792
To trust me.

513
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:42,580
Trust me. Just leave it be.

514
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,330
Where were you?

515
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,073
Jack, don't.

516
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:59,051
No, I heard you on
the phone last night.

517
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,392
Who were you talking to?

518
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,332
Just let it go.

519
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:07,611
-No, no, I wanna know.
-No, jack.

520
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,450
I wanna know where you were.
I wanna know who you were with.

521
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,413
It doesn't matter,
Jack. please.

522
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:13,423
No, tell me. Tell me!

523
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,963
I was doing something for him.

524
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:21,483
For who?

525
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:24,362
For Sawyer.

526
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:30,493
I made him a promise.

527
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:33,782
It...

528
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:37,930
What?

529
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:40,581
It doesn't matter.
It has nothing to do with us.

530
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,890
Then why won't you tell me?

531
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:45,591
Because--because he
wouldn't want me to.

532
00:38:46,898 --> 00:38:49,622
But he's not here, is he? no.

533
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,890
No, he made his choice.

534
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:53,403
He chose to stay.

535
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:56,683
I'm the one who came back.

536
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,820
I'm the one who's here.

537
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,981
I'm the one who saved you.

538
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:07,360
Jack Jack.

539
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,571
You can't-- you can't do this.

540
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,300
If you have problems,
you need to figure them out.

541
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,370
All right? 'cause I can't have
you like this around my son.

542
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,680
Your son?

543
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:23,880
You're not even related to him!

544
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,780
Hey, sweet pea.

545
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:36,470
Hey.

546
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:08,200
Morning.

547
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:10,931
It's way too early for chinese.

548
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:15,210
Where's Claire?

549
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,382
Ladies' room?

550
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:18,710
Nope.

551
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,692
She just walked off
into the jungle.

552
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:24,680
What?

553
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,043
When?

554
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:30,110
In the middle of the night.
Just got up and left.

555
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,611
-You let her go alone?
-She wasn't alone.

556
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,391
Well, who was she with?

557
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:38,682
She called him "dad.
" I'd have followed them,

558
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,352
But I have a restraining order.

559
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:49,343
Claire! Claire!

560
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:51,160
Claire! Claire!

561
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:11,812
It's okay. It's okay.

562
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,140
I've got you.

563
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:18,512
Claire! Claire!

564
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:25,031
Claire! Claire!

565
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:30,871
Claire! Claire!

566
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:34,923
Claire! Claire!
