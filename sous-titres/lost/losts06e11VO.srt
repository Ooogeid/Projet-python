1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,800
Mr. Hume.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,110
My name is Zoe.

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,010
I know you're disoriented.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,230
You've been unconsciousness for the last three days.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,680
But you're off the I.V. Sedation now.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,670
And I've just given you a shot to help you wake up.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,910
Are you a nurse?

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,370
You're not in a hospital anymore, Mr. Hume.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,490
We had to move you.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,850
What? Move... move me? Move me where?

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,250
Where's my wife? 

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,030
No. Wait. Mr... you shouldn't... you shouldn't...

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,270
I wanna see Penny.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,540
I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible, Desmond.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,140
You.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,670
Mr. Hume... 

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,440
- Easy. Easy. I'll take it from here.  - You should sit.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,440
Desmond.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,210
What happened to me? Where am I?

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,500
You were shot by Benjamin Linus.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,990
Do you remember that?

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,040
Yes, I remember.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,800
Yeah, I wanna talk to Penny. Penny!

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,780
She's not here. But I assure you,

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,680
both she and your son are perfectly safe.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,260
I'm really sorry for taking you away from them,

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,890
but I didn't have a chance to explain, and...

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,500
if I had, you never would've come with me.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,530
Come with you?

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,150
Come with you where?

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,830
I brought you back to the island.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,970
I... can't imagine how you must be feeling.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,990
But if you'll give me a chance to explain... 

34
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,330
- Damn it! Don't hurt him!  - You take me back!

35
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,640
- You take me back right now, you hear!?  - I can't take you back.

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,750
The island isn't done with you yet.

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,270
Aah!

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,760
What is Desmond doing here?

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,790
It will be easier for me

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,210
to show you than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.

41
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,840
Take him with you to the generator room.

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,330
I'll be along with Hume so we can start the test.

43
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,030
Charles, that... that... that test isn't scheduled till tomorrow.

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,220
I know when it's scheduled. Get them ready now.

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,660
Come on. No time for sightseeing.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,500
They're bringing Hume down now.

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,810
- What?!  - You heard me. We are go right now.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,890
- What's your time Frame?  - We're not even close to being ready.

49
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,080
This generator probably hasn't run in 20 years.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,770
- How am I supposed to...  - Widmore doesn't want to wait.

51
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,650
- What are you doing here?  - Running a little test.

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,510
- What kind of test?  - All right, let's see where we are.

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,030
- Can we get a functioning M. Field going, people?  - Sure thing.

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,040
- Let's try a power test. Generator to full, please.  - Okay.

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,930
Okay. 

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,580
Here we go. On my count...

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,640
Three... Two... One.

58
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,740
And power on.

59
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,190
Great.

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,820
We probably got a faulty contact somewhere. Find it.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
Simmons, go down and check the circuits on the solenoids.

62
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,120
- Yes, sir.  - Try it again.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,330
Guess what, Angstrom?

64
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,680
You're going in there next.

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,920
Found it!

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,170
It's a bad breaker on the genny.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,470
- Bringing it back online now.  - No!

68
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,570
No!

69
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,620
Turn it off! Turn it off!

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,270
Zoe.

71
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,850
- Are we ready?  - Let's go.

72
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,660
Stop.

73
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,150
You can take him now. Thank you.

74
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,130
Put him inside.

75
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,440
No! Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

76
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,290
Uhh! Aah!

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,180
- I know how this looks, Desmond.  - Aah!

78
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,940
But if everything I've been told about you is true,

79
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,350
you'll be perfectly fine.

80
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,290
You don't have any metal on you, do you? Keys? Change?

81
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,760
Of course he doesn't, you idiot.

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,490
I hate to resort to forcing this upon you, Desmond...

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,510
But once it's over,

84
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,780
I'm going to ask you to make a sacrifice.

85
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,710
And I hope, for all our sakes, you'll help me.

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,800
Sacrifice?

87
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,940
What the bloody hell do you know about sacrifice?

88
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,910
My son died here for the sake of this island.

89
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,760
Your wife...  my own daughter... 

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,850
hates me.

91
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,760
And I've never even met my grandson.

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,460
But if you won't help me, Desmond,

93
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,270
all of it will be for nothing.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,790
Penny, your son and everyone else

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,010
will be gone... forever.

96
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,140
Aah!

97
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,590
Uhh!

98
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,770
Aah!

99
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,770
All right. Turn it on.

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,460
No. If you want me to help you with whatever you're doing here,

101
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,330
you need to explain to me... 

102
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,690
That man is the only person I'm aware of in the world

103
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,730
who has survived a catastrophic electromagnetic event.

104
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,210
I need to know that he can do it again,

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,910
or we all die.

106
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,330
Turn it on.

107
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,960
- Do we have full power?  - Yeah, but...

108
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,480
Let me out!

109
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,220
Let me out of here, you bastards!

110
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,540
Let me out!

111
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,620
Let me out of here!

112
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,310
Let me out of here! 

113
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,340
It's Carousel 4.

114
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,620
Sorry?

115
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,470
You were on the Sydney flight, right?

116
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,610
- Yeah.  - Our bags are on Carousel 4.

117
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,280
I double-checked it with the dude at the counter.

118
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,900
Thank you.

119
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,920
Hang on. I've got it. I got it.

120
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,730
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,180
Pleasure.

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,120
Do you have any more bags?

123
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,490
No. Uh, that's it, thank God. 

124
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,540
- Boy or a girl?  - Um...

125
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,390
- Oh, I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't mean to pry.  - Oh, no, no. It's... it's fine.

126
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,690
I just, um... I don't know what it is.

127
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,300
Oh, right.

128
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,290
Well, you're braver than I. I'm not a big fan of surprises.

129
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,480
Oh, excuse me. That's mine.

130
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,880
So... have... have you got someone meeting you?

131
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,340
Uh, yeah. I... I don't know. Maybe they got the...

132
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,880
Flights mixed up or something.

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,820
Because I've got a car picking me up.

134
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,870
You know, if you need a ride,

135
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,080
I'd be more than happy to give you a lift.

136
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,550
Oh, no, no, no. That's, um, that's really sweet of you,

137
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,910
- But I'm... I'm good. There's cabs, so...  - Oh. Oh, all right. Yeah.

138
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,430
- Well, it was nice meeting you.  - Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

139
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,910
A boy.

140
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,480
- What?  - I bet it's a boy.

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,100
... Lockers located at Baggage Claim Entrance.

142
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,600
Detailed baggage claim information on...

143
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,470
Looks like I'm with you.

144
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,150
Mr. Hume. Hello. Let me grab that for you.

145
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,910
Thank you.

146
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,230
- My name is George.  - Hi, George.

147
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,830
So I will take you back to your hotel?

148
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,780
The office.

149
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,170
Office. Wonderful. Um, this way, please.

150
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,760
So, uh, you... you flew in from Sydney, huh?

151
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,010
Yeah. That's right.

152
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,910
And what... what were you doin', uh....

153
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,270
Down Under?

154
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,740
I was closing a deal for the boss.

155
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh. Good for you. Congratulations.

156
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,720
Hey, listen, if you need anything at all

157
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,850
while you're in town, I know everyone.

158
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,210
If you need a reservation, you just pick a restaurant.

159
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,660
Uh, the Room Service at the hotel is excellent.

160
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,360
Thank you.

161
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,540
You, uh,

162
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,580
you looking, uh, for some company?

163
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,550
Well, I noticed that you weren't wearing a wedding band,

164
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,320
and there are a lot of lovely ladies

165
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,470
offering their, uh, "companionship."

166
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm not looking for any companionship.

167
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,310
I'm here to work.

168
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,710
Guess that's why you're e boss's right-hand man,

169
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,810
and I am the driver.

170
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,970
Okay. Got it.

171
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,510
- Good morning, Mr. Hume. How was your flight?  - Lovely, thank you.

172
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,950
- He said to send you right in.  - Thank you.

173
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,500
Charles.

174
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,240
Hello, Desmond.

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,530
Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.

176
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,060
Thank you.

177
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,380
I don't give a bloody damn what he did

178
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,140
or how much it's going to cost.

179
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,610
Just get him arraigned and get him out of there.

180
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,340
Sorry, Desmond.

181
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,440
Looks like our celebration of the Australian deal

182
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,470
is gonna have to be cut short.

183
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,820
You are aware that my son is a musician?

184
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,980
Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.

185
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,700
Yeah, he is, quite.

186
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,950
Anyway, my wife is putting together

187
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,520
one of her charity events,

188
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,290
and, uh, the boy had the crazy idea

189
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,080
to combine classical music with modern rock.

190
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,290
Have you heard of a band called Drive Shaft?

191
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,080
No can't say I have.

192
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,950
Their bass guitarist overdosed and, uh, got himself arrested.

193
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,260
And now if I don't get this junkie to my wife's event,

194
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,770
she will, simply put, destroy me.

195
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,500
- So you want me to babysit him.  - I know it's beneath you,

196
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,770
but I need someone I can trust to do the job right.

197
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,880
Say no more, Charles. It's done.

198
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,480
You really do have the life, son.

199
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,790
No family,

200
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,010
no commitments.

201
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,750
Ah, to be free of attachments.

202
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,390
I'm a blessed man, sir.

203
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,030
No, it is I who am blessed

204
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,690
to have you in my employ. 

205
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,070
A drink to celebrate your indispensability.

206
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,190
That's your 60-year-old Scotch, Charles.

207
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,450
Nothing's too good for you.

208
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,700
Slaninte.

209
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,090
Mr. Hume?

210
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,050
That's right.

211
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,060
Bail's all been taken care of.

212
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,110
Remember, he's not allowed to leave the state.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,630
Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume.

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,540
Charles Widmore sent me...

215
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,670
Hey.

216
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,130
Where you going?

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,220
He's all yours.

218
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,360
Hey! 

219
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,700
Hey! What's wrong with you?!

220
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,690
Come on.

221
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,950
Yeah, I'll have whatever he's having.

222
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,920
One drink, then we go.

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,360
So what's your job then...  to babysit me?

224
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,220
What are you? Mr. Widmore's chief lackey?

225
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,030
Henchman?

226
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,050
No title.

227
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,680
Plenty of perks, though.

228
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,500
Mm. Such as?

229
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,800
I get to meet charming people.

230
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,580
Well... Cheers, then.

231
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,600
Tell me, perky. Are you happy?

232
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,070
Quite.

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,530
No, you're not.

234
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,390
Well, I've got a great job, lots of money,

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,670
Travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?

236
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,590
- Have you ever been in love?  - Dozens of times.

237
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,310
That's not what I'm talking about.

238
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,900
I'm talking about spectacular, consciousness-altering love.

239
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,310
Do you know what that looks like?

240
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,490
I wasn't aware that love looked like anything.

241
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,650
I've seen it, mate...  on the plane back from Sydney.

242
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,220
Is that so?

243
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,060
Well, we were on the same flight, so...

244
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,610
maybe I saw it, too.

245
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,180
Trust me. You didn't.

246
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,470
No? Enlighten me.

247
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,270
There was this woman

248
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,080
two rows in front of me...  in handcuffs... 

249
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,890
sittin' with a cop.

250
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,110
He looked at me,

251
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,860
knew I was holding.

252
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,890
If I didn't take action, I'd be caught.

253
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,720
So I got up, went to the lav...

254
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,190
proceeded to eliminate the evidence

255
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,170
by swallowing my stash.

256
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,800
And at that exact moment,

257
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,860
we hit turbulence.

258
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,890
I choked.

259
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,510
The entire bag of heroin is stuck in my throat.

260
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,390
It's, uh, it's over. Everything starts to go dark.

261
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm slippin' into the abyss, and then...

262
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,930
I see... her.

263
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,550
"Her"?

264
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,700
A woman.

265
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,310
Blonde.

266
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,430
Rapturously beautiful.

267
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,430
And I know her.

268
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,090
We're together.

269
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,950
It's like...

270
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
You've always been, and...

271
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,090
always will be.

272
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,070
This...

273
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,280
feeling, this...

274
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,240
love.

275
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,710
And just as I'm about to be engulfed by it.

276
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,540
I open my eyes,

277
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,710
and this sodding idiot

278
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,580
is standing there, asking me if I'm okay.

279
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,970
But I saw it.

280
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,710
Just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.

281
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,470
Well, that's just...

282
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
poetry, brother.

283
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,040
You know, you should... you should write a song about that.

284
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying.

285
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,920
"Poor suicidal rock star."

286
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,250
But I've seen something real. I've seen the truth.

287
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,080
No, that's not the truth.

288
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,570
You wanna know the real truth, Pace?

289
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,810
Right now you have a choice.

290
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,140
You can keep on drinkin', or you can come with me.

291
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,050
Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here,

292
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,110
it will very likely result

293
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,950
in the extermination of your musical career.

294
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,600
And if I go with you?

295
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,790
20 minutes,

296
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,020
you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel,

297
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,050
right on the harbor front. Charles Widmore,

298
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,980
one of the most powerful men in this town,

299
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,570
will owe you favor.

300
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,990
Doesn't really seem like a choice.

301
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,240
There's always a choice, brother.

302
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,250
# You all, everybody #

303
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,180
- # You all, everybody #  - That's my band.

304
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,640
- # Acting like you're stupid people #  - Drive shaft.

305
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,630
- Our first single.  - # Wearing expensive clothes #

306
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,510
The beginning of everything great.

307
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,100
# You all, everybody #

308
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,380
# You all, everybody #

309
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,680
You like it?

310
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,990
- # You all, everybody #  - Sure. For what it is.

311
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,570
I feel sorry for you, mate.

312
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,250
You think you're happy. You think you got it all.

313
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,260
This... your life.

314
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,590
But you don't.

315
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,860
Hmm. Why, because none of it's real?

316
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
# You all... #

317
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,170
All right, Mr. Hume. How about I offer you a choice?

318
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,180
What's that?

319
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,950
I can either show you what I'm talking about,

320
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,570
or you can get out of the car.

321
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,920
Why in god's name would I want to get out of... 

322
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,200
Charlie! Charlie!

323
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,090
Come on!

324
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,250
Come on!

325
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,450
Come on!

326
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,970
Come on, damn it!

327
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,190
You sustained a pretty bad bump in your accident.

328
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,580
Any nausea?

329
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,800
Nope.

330
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,130
- Double vision?  - No.

331
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,480
Listen, I need to find the man that I was brought in here with.

332
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,380
How about hallucinations?

333
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,380
What do you mean?

334
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,410
Hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there.

335
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,390
Um...

336
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,950
I'm not sure.

337
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,830
Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive.

338
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,810
I'm gonna send you downstairs for an M.R.I.

339
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,860
No, I don't have time for this.

340
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,820
- I need to find the man I came in here with.  - I'm afraid you're not finding anyone

341
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,500
till we know what's going on inside your brain.

342
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,020
Are you wearing any metal, carrying keys or chains?

343
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,970
Any metal inside your body...  pacemakers, pins, bullets?

344
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,030
- Steel plate inside of your head?  - No, nothing.

345
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,370
I see you didn't list an emergency contact.

346
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,250
No friends or family?

347
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,230
Um...

348
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,150
Just put down my employer...  Charles Widmore.

349
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,510
This machine is super loud.

350
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,450
You're gonna want these.

351
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,080
And you need the button.

352
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,150
- Button?  - Panic button.

353
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,640
You need to stop, press it. But try not to,

354
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,720
'cause we'll have to start all over again from the beginning.

355
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,710
I'll be in that booth over there.

356
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,050
You'll be able to hear me. 30 minutes, okay?

357
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,570
Okay, here we go.

358
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,670
Desmond?

359
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,520
Hey!

360
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,100
Hey, let me out of here!

361
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,490
Hey!

362
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,330
Hey!

363
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,950
- What happened, man? Are you all right?  - I need to find the man I came in here with.

364
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,170
I need to find the man I came in here with.

365
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,870
His name is Charlie Pace. He came in an hour ago.

366
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,890
- If you'd just give me his room number...  - If you're not a relative, that's confidential information.

367
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,900
Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him.

368
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,130
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

369
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,420
Hey.

370
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,350
E... excuse me.

371
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,370
Um... We were on the same Oceanic flight.

372
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,070
Um, from Sydney.

373
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,840
Yeah, yeah. You were, uh, you were sitting next to me.

374
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,600
- Desmond, right?  - Yeah, that's right.

375
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,730
Listen, I-I wonder if you can help me, brother.

376
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,580
I need to find someone. He was on our plane.

377
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,660
- He's somewhere in the hospital.  - Wait. He was on our plane,

378
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,440
and now he's here in the hospital?

379
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,020
- None of this matters! None of this matters!  - No! Sir, please! Stop!

380
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,460
Take it easy.

381
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,600
- Why you running?  - 'Cause no one here can help me. Now let me go.

382
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,560
- Why'd you try and kill me?  - I didn't try and kill you.

383
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,420
I was trying to show you something.

384
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,670
- You wanna show me something? Show me your hand.  - What?

385
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,910
Your hand. Show me your bloody hands now.

386
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,630
You saw something, didn't you?

387
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,880
In the water.

388
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,600
What was it?

389
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,440
What are you looking for, mate?

390
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,910
Who's Penny?

391
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,700
I don't know.

392
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,620
Ah.

393
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,100
- You felt it, didn't you? I didn't feel anything.

394
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,850
- Then why are you accosting a man in a dressing gown?  - All right, come on. We're leaving.

395
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,040
Whoa! You think I'm gonna go play a rock concert after this?

396
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,310
This doesn't matter.

397
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
None of this matters.

398
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,570
All that matters is that we felt it.

399
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,070
You wanna try and stop me? Good luck.

400
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,460
Hey. Where you going?

401
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,760
If I were you, I'd stop worrying about me

402
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,230
and start looking for Penny.

403
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,150
What do you mean he's gone?

404
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,910
He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart

405
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,130
- and then ran out of hospital.  - And you let him go?

406
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,110
He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles.

407
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:00,010
- I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.  - And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond.

408
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,760
But when I give you a job to do, I expect you to do it.

409
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,350
- With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert.  - I'll tell you what, Desmond.

410
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,160
If you can't deliver Pace,

411
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,330
why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore it's only a bloody concert?

412
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,340
Mr. Hume.

413
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,520
So you've never met the boss's wife, huh?

414
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,890
No.

415
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,490
Good luck.

416
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,470
Please tell me how it is

417
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,590
that someone in your line of work is not aware

418
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,380
that the butter knife is placed handle to the right?

419
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,140
- Blade facing left just so.  - Okay.

420
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,900
For god sake. 

421
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,460
Mrs. Widmore?

422
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,010
Yes?

423
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,460
My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.

424
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,940
Oh, of course, Mr. Hume.

425
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,540
Charles has told me so much about you.

426
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,550
It's a travesty we haven't met before.

427
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,770
Well, it's about time.

428
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,440
Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.

429
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,410
Oh, please. It's Eloise.

430
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,070
Eloise. 

431
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,670
So, uh, what crisis forced Charles

432
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,190
to send his best fix-it man

433
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,110
into the bowels of charity balls?

434
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,520
Well, Eloise, um...

435
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,820
I'm deeply sorry,

436
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,100
but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft

437
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,390
won't be able to perform alongside your son.

438
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,820
And, um, I take full responsibility... 

439
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,980
Don't worry about it.

440
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,410
Excuse me?

441
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,450
Oh, my son will understand.

442
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,240
I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars,

443
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,780
a certain unpredictability comes with the territory.

444
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,450
Yeah. Y... you're not angry?

445
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,180
Oh, not at all, dear. 

446
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
What happened, happened.

447
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,040
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

448
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,290
For coming and telling me in person.

449
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,350
- A pleasure meeting you.  - And you. Thank you.

450
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,700
Uh, center that flower arrangement, please.

451
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,210
Have a good evening.

452
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,950
Thank you.

453
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,700
Leifer, Stephanie... plus two.

454
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,650
Markey, Mary... plus one.

455
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,890
Milton, Penny... solo.

456
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,800
Pepper, Nicholas... plus one.

457
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,180
Excuse me.

458
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,960
I'm sorry. Um...

459
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,340
Did you just say "Penny"?

460
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,240
- And who are you?  - Um, I work for Mr. Widmore. May I see the list?

461
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,020
You absolutely may not.

462
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,110
That list is confidential.

463
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,450
Begging your pardon,

464
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,510
I... I'm entrusted with confidential items every day... 

465
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,950
Are you questioning me?

466
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,720
No, I... just want to look at one name on that list.

467
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
- And if, for some reason, that's a problem...  - Come with me.

468
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,880
Out, everyone. Now.

469
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,980
Look, I'm... 

470
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm sorry if I've overstepped my bounds, but I just... 

471
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,960
Stop talking, Hume.

472
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,690
I've heard what you've had to say. Now you listen to me.

473
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,280
I want you to stop.

474
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,710
Stop? S... stop what?

475
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,060
Someone has clearly affected the way you see things.

476
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,030
This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation.

477
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,530
So whatever you're doing,

478
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,750
whatever it is you think you're looking for...

479
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,800
you need to stop looking for it.

480
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,490
Do you... 

481
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,820
do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

482
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,760
I don't know why you're looking for anything.

483
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,460
You have the perfect life.

484
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,500
On top of it, you've managed to attain

485
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,380
the thing you wanted more than anything... 

486
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,740
My husband's approval.

487
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,310
How do you know what I want?

488
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,190
Because I bloody do.

489
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,330
I need to see that list...

490
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,660
Or you need to tell me why I can't.

491
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:23,460
You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.

492
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,780
Ready?

493
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,550
Ready? R... ready for what?

494
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,460
That bad, huh?

495
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,680
Is there any alcohol in this car?

496
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,710
Oh, yeah.

497
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,540
Whatever you need.

498
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,130
So, uh...

499
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,270
Where to, Mr. Hume?

500
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,940
Just drive, George.

501
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,770
- Mr. Hume.  - Yes?

502
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,560
My name is Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

503
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,260
We need to talk.

504
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,640
Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...

505
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,490
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

506
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,300
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

507
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,710
Dan, um, look, if... if this is about Charlie Pace

508
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,240
not being able to perform with you,

509
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,970
I'm... I'm very sorry.

510
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,600
Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?

511
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,320
Excuse me?

512
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,690
The first time I saw her, I was walking through this museum

513
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,470
a few weeks ago.

514
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,760
She... she works here. She was on her lunch break.

515
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,110
She was eating a chocolate bar.

516
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,810
She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair.

517
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,930
And as soon as I saw her,

518
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,440
right... right in that moment, it was like...

519
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,150
it was like I already loved her.

520
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,230
And that's when things got weird.

521
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,250
That same night after I saw that woman...

522
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,630
I woke up and I wrote this.

523
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,680
So what is it?

524
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,730
I'm a musician. I have no idea.

525
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,030
So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech.

526
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,940
He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics.

527
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,060
He said these equations are so advanced that

528
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,260
only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life

529
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,090
could've come up with them.

530
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,810
So...

531
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,670
so what do they mean?

532
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,690
Okay, imagine... imagine something terrible is about to happen,

533
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,040
something catastrophic.

534
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,410
And the only way to stop it from happening

535
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,870
was by...

536
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,770
releasing a huge amount of energy.

537
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,130
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

538
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?

539
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,480
Just listen. What if this... all this...

540
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,600
what if this wasn't supposed to be our life?

541
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,630
What if we... we had some other life

542
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,470
and for some reason, we changed things?

543
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,760
I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

544
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,230
I think I already did.

545
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,680
Listen, mate, um...

546
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,790
I don't know what any of this has to do with me. So...

547
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,630
Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny?

548
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,550
It happened to you, too, didn't it?

549
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,820
You felt it.

550
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,800
I don't know...

551
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,890
I don't know what I felt.

552
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,760
Yes, you do.

553
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,710
You felt love.

554
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,340
That's impossible because

555
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,190
I don't know anything about this woman.

556
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,210
I don't know... I don't know where she is.

557
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,680
I don't even know if she exists.

558
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,890
She's...

559
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,710
She's an idea.

560
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,030
No, Mr. Hume.

561
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,620
She's my half-sister.

562
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,300
And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.

563
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,550
Excuse me?

564
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,300
Yeah?

565
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,990
Are you Penny?

566
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,640
Uh, yes. 

567
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,460
Hello.

568
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,710
I'm Desmond.

569
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,810
Uh, hi.

570
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,690
Checking in now.

571
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,830
He's okay.

572
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,500
Indeed he is.

573
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,120
How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?

574
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,640
Fine.

575
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,640
H... how long was I unconscious for?

576
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,730
Oh, no more than a few seconds.

577
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,280
Will you help me up, please?

578
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond.

579
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,170
But as I told you, your... talent is vital to our mission.

580
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,770
So if you just let me explain... 

581
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,530
It's all right. I understand.

582
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,160
What?

583
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,640
I said I understand.

584
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,160
You told me you brought me here to the island

585
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,070
to do something very important.

586
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,660
Yeah.

587
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,740
When do we start?

588
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,020
What happened to you?

589
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,600
What do you mean?

590
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,130
What I mean is 20 minutes ago,

591
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,220
you were beating the crap out of Widmore with an I.V. Stand,

592
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,510
and... and now you're Mr. Cooperative.

593
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,720
A lot can happen in 20 minutes.

594
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,880
Sure it can.

595
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,120
That thing fried your brain.

596
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,920
Did it?

597
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,290
Whatever. Doesn't change that you're gonna... 

598
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,150
Run.

599
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,370
Desmond, I don't have time to explain,

600
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,080
but these people are extremely dangerous.

601
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
We need to go now.

602
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Aye, of course.

603
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,750
Lead the way.

604
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,610
Hello? You okay?

605
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,670
What happed?

606
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,120
Well, I shook your hand, and then you fainted.

607
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,280
I must have quite an effect on you. 

608
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,530
Aye.

609
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,500
Aye, you must have.

610
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,420
Have we met before?

611
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,290
I... I think we'd remember it if we have

612
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,990
Yeah.

613
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,860
Well, as long as you're sure you're all right...

614
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,620
Yeah, I'm fine.

615
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,660
Hey, listen. Um...

616
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,290
Would you like to go for a coffee?

617
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,500
What, now?

618
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,350
I'm a sweaty mess.

619
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,890
I just fainted in front of you.

620
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
I'd say we're even. 

621
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,900
There's a coffee shop

622
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,610
on the corner of Sweetzer and Melrose.

623
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,360
I'll meet you there in an hour.

624
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,010
Absolutely.

625
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,150
- Okay.  - Okay.

626
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,430
So... did you find what you were looking for?

627
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,120
Yes, George, I did.

628
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,820
Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer, please.

629
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,140
You got it.

630
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,760
And if there's anything else I can do for you, Mr. Hume,

631
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,730
you just name it.

632
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,230
Actually, there is one thing, George.

633
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,210
Can you get me the manifest from my flight from Sydney?

634
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,270
Oceanic 815.

635
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,420
Just the names of the passengers.

636
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,210
Sure, I can.

637
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,710
Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?

638
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,960
I just need to show them something.
