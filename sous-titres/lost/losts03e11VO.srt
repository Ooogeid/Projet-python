<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:05,079
You can go back to your camp.

3
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:06,523
What about my friends?

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,165
Your job is to tell
the rest of your people

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,687
they can never come here.

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,537
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

7
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:18,130
And thank you for helping me find my...

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,425
I don't care what Jack said.

9
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,562
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>The pearl is a monitoring station
where the activities of participants</i>

11
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,437
<i>in the Dharma initiative projects
can be observed and recorded.</i>

12
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,424
I guess he'll be expecting us.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,726
Ping-Pong table?

14
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:06,593
Where the hell did that come from?

15
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:09,598
Jin found it when he was out
looking for firewood.

16
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:11,846
We made legs for it and paddles.

17
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:14,108
Now all we need is a ball.

18
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:15,263
Found it?

19
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:18,654
Must have landed in the jungle
when the hatch exploded.

20
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,204
I thought the hatch collapsed.

21
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:22,311
Look, dude,
all I know is the sky turned purple.

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,844
After that, I don't ask questions,

23
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,186
just make myself a salad and move on.

24
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,755
Yeah, I can see that's working for you.

25
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:31,644
You seen Kate around?

26
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:33,286
Wow, she's not back yet?

27
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:38,594
You guys find anything
we can use for a ball?

28
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,390
Hey, that's my "Guns & Ammo."

29
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,087
Where the hell did you get it?

30
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,754
It was in the magazine stack.

31
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:48,353
We share things now.

32
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,467
Listen, Worro, it was in my stuff--

33
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,585
Stuff you decided
to have a little party with

34
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,897
while you thought I was dead.

35
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,786
Listen, Hillbilly,
if you want it that bad, take it.

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,585
Just keep it.

37
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,353
We need to eat.

38
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:27,179
Are we still on course?

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,864
We're still heading north
on a bearing of 3-0-5.

40
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:40,128
- Yes.
- I'm sensing a lack of confidence.

41
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,769
We've been walking for two days,

42
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:45,382
following a compass bearing
provided by the carvings on a stick.

43
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,545
And?

44
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:49,403
You really think we're just going
to chance upon where the others are?

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,455
I don't know what we're gonna chance on,

46
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,432
but my bearing
is the only bearing we got.

47
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,977
I'm going to find some fruit,

48
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:03,425
and then, John, we're going
to have a rational conversation

49
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,759
regarding our next move.

50
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:33,462
Subtitles: swsub.com (V.1.00)

51
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,334
Y'all looking for something like...
this?

52
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,927
Cool, a ball.

53
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:50,259
We need to do
a little quid pro quo first.

54
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,880
I know I've been gone a while,

55
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:55,179
and y'all thought the general store
was having a going out of business sale,

56
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,686
but now I'm back,

57
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,986
and I want what's mine.

58
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,687
Yeah, but it wasn't really yours
to begin with.

59
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,949
"A"--
It was mine when I took it.

60
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,991
"B"--
Who the hell are you?

61
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:08,084
And "c"-- Because I'm fair,

62
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm gonna let you play me for it.

63
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:12,547
Play ping-Pong?

64
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,686
That's right, Avalanche.

65
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:17,211
You bastards put up your best player.

66
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:20,065
One game, and when I crush them,

67
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:23,295
y'all gotta bring me
every piece of my stash back.

68
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,016
And if you lose?

69
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,019
I ain't gonna lose, but..

70
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,587
if I do, tell you what--

71
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,834
name it.

72
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,094
Looks like Crouching Tiger
and Hidden Dragon got something good.

73
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,364
Lay it on me.

74
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:52,372
No nicknames.

75
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,347
If y lose, no nicknames for anyone...

76
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,425
for a week.

77
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:00,688
Nice.

78
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,247
You're on.

79
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:07,849
Pick your player.

80
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,189
I'll be back in an hour,
then let the slaughter begin.

81
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,335
Are you sure it's completely isolated?

82
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:21,964
I've circled the house.

83
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,314
There's nothing but jungle
surrounding it.

84
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,157
Here.

85
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:30,773
That dish still work?

86
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,823
A satellite dish of that size would have

87
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,477
broadcasting capabilities
for thousands of miles.

88
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,359
Danielle, you once mentioned
a radio tower.

89
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,527
Is this it?

90
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,748
I have never been here before.

91
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,931
The man in the house--
you said you've seen him before?

92
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,155
On a video feed from the pearl station.

93
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:51,889
So who is he?

94
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,591
Only one way to find out...

95
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,201
we ask him.

96
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,414
- What's this for?
- If I'm unarmed,

97
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,281
he won't feel threatened.

98
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,487
In case he is threatened,
you can cover me from here.

99
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,806
Where are you going?

100
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,646
I have no interest in that man
inside the house.

101
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:14,821
I have survived on the island

102
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,554
precisely by avoiding
these types of encounters.

103
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:22,033
I'll wait for you by the stream...

104
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,214
for those of you who survive.

105
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,403
Najeev.

106
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,126
Did you cook this?

107
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,125
Yes, I did.

108
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:11,858
It's delicious.

109
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,833
My name is Sami.

110
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:16,841
Najeev. Thank you.

111
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,792
Please sit.

112
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,391
Sit.

113
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,048
So where are you from, Najeev?

114
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,249
I'm Syrian.

115
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:26,902
Please.

116
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,234
What do you want from me?

117
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,309
You're an excellent cook,

118
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,572
and I...

119
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:46,957
I have a restaurant
much nicer than this place.

120
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,652
Come take a look.

121
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:53,487
If you like it, I will hire you
at twice your pay here.

122
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,014
You're offering a stranger a job
because of a single meal?

123
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:01,394
I'm offering you a job
because we are outsiders here,

124
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,709
and because, uh, my chef just quit.

125
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:52,394
- He's been hit, he's been hit!
- Not yet. You wanna get shot, too?

126
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,796
I didn't cross the line!

127
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,121
We had a truce.

128
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:56,569
- This is my land!
- I'm not--

129
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:58,735
- You said I could stay here!
- I'm not who you--

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,931
Who you think I am.

131
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,213
My name is Sayid Jarrah.

132
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,285
I was on a plane
that crashed here months ago.

133
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:08,586
A plane?!

134
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,480
I'm unarmed, I swear!

135
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,344
Stay right there!

136
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,014
Drop the rifle! Drop it right now!

137
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,239
Back up. Back up.

138
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,931
Are you all right?

139
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,362
You really did crash here?

140
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:44,868
Over 40 of us, yes.

141
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,706
I'll go in first, make sure it's okay.

142
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
Who are you?

143
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,311
My name is Mikhail Bakunin...

144
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:59,390
and I am the last living member
of the Dharma Initiative.

145
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,083
Watch your step.

146
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:10,986
Please...

147
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,490
Sit.

148
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:17,496
Here, let me.

149
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,705
You've had experience
treating gunshot wounds?

150
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,838
I spent some time in Afghanistan.

151
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,014
I had experience with field medicine...

152
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,568
in the Soviet army.

153
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,672
In the kitchen on the top shelf
there is a medical kit.

154
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,166
Will you bring it, please?

155
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,047
It's all right, Kate.

156
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:49,699
How did you get here?

157
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:52,109
I almost don't know where to begin.

158
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,328
Why don't you begin
with the Dharma Initiative?

159
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:58,865
I grew up in Kiev
and joined the Soviet army.

160
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,666
I was stationed
at a listening post in Vladivostok.

161
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,753
After the cold war...

162
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,140
After we lost the cold war,
my unit was decommissioned.

163
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,252
I was dismissed
from my life in the military,

164
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:20,500
and after years of conducting
unpleasant actions against our enemies,

165
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,205
I found myself wanting
to do something good,

166
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:27,546
so I replied
to a newspaper advertisement.

167
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,022
An advertisement?

168
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,857
"Would you like toave the world?"
It read.

169
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,837
That's how I met the Initiative.

170
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,301
They're very secretive,

171
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,485
very rich and very smart.

172
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,665
So when did you come to the island?

173
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:43,878
11 years now.

174
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,675
I liked computers,

175
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,324
communications equipment

176
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,773
and being alone
like a lighthouse keeper,

177
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,218
so they put me in this station.

178
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,093
They called it "The Flame."

179
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:58,473
What's the purpose of The Flame?

180
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:02,073
To communicate
with the outside world, of course.

181
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,077
<i>Ready to play?</i>

182
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:27,698
<i>Your move.</i>

183
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,350
What happened to the Dharma Initiative?

184
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,665
They're all dead, of course.

185
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:41,109
They foolishly initiated a war
against the hostiles--

186
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,321
a "purge," they called it.

187
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,025
And how did you survive this purge?

188
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,288
By not participating in it.

189
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:52,686
I told you.

190
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:53,949
I like being alone.

191
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,194
And the hostiles allowed you
to stay here?

192
00:13:58,344 --> 00:13:59,648
After it was over,

193
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,653
four men appeared in the yard.

194
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,568
They offered a truce.

195
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,356
They said to imagine a line

196
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,230
that extended
all the way around the valley.

197
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,265
As long as I did not cross it,

198
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,988
I would be left alone.

199
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:18,185
Then they took two cows,
and I never saw them again.

200
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:20,899
They weren't interested
in the satellite dish in the yard?

201
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:21,978
Why would they be?

202
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,254
It hasn't functioned for years.

203
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,481
Who are they--

204
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,756
- these hostiles?
- I do not know,

205
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,112
but they were here
for a long time before we were--

206
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:34,847
A very long time.

207
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,484
I'm looking for Sami.

208
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:09,456
I'm so glad you came.

209
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,551
What do you think?

210
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,906
It's a simple place, as you can see,

211
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,921
but we have good customers.

212
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,158
Here's my wife.

213
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,472
She's in charge of the kitchen.

214
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:25,814
Amira, come meet Najeev.

215
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,460
Pleasure to meet you.

216
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,484
Are you sure this is him?

217
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,554
Yes.

218
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,322
Look, I don't know who you think I am--

219
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:21,368
What did you just say?

220
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:24,575
I told Nadia to be polite,
because you are my guests.

221
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,778
After Nadia Comaneci,

222
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:31,201
the greatest athlete
the world has ever known.

223
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,047
We have the same birthday.

224
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,118
Now...

225
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,526
excellent work, if I say myself.

226
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,500
Thank you, Mikhail.

227
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:49,234
Perhaps...

228
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,220
I can begin to earn your forgiveness
by offering some iced tea.

229
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,464
I will also check on your friend.

230
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,882
Don't waste your time.

231
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:14,175
For ten years I've tried
to defeat that game.

232
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,751
But it was programmed
by three grand masters...

233
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,194
and it cheats.

234
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,279
Well I've played a lot of computers,

235
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,792
and I'm pretty sure
they don't know how to cheat.

236
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,521
That's what makes being human
so distinctly...

237
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,242
wonderful.

238
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:44,155
What's wrong?

239
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,666
It just...

240
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,209
it doesn't make any sense.

241
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,101
Why would they let him stay here,

242
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,639
with all this stuff, all this equipment?

243
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,761
Actually, it makes perfect sense.

244
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:56,381
What are you talking about?

245
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:59,826
The reason they let him stay here
is because he is not Dharma.

246
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,448
He is one of them.

247
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,504
He shot you, and you just let him...

248
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,025
Why are we still sitting here?

249
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,327
We are sitting here, Kate,
because I am certain he is not alone.

250
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,307
So...

251
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,786
you really the number one draft pick,
Grimace?

252
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,521
Yep.

253
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,593
Are we playing with the mercy rule?

254
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:43,834
Mercy rule?

255
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,083
Yeah, like, If I'm up 11-0, then I,

256
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:49,890
you know, automatically win.

257
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,274
You're gonna go up 11-0?

258
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,155
No, I mean either one of us.

259
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:57,782
Sure.

260
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,306
We can have a mercy rule.

261
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,988
- Do you wanna volley for serve?
- I'll tell you what...

262
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:04,864
Be my guest.

263
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,589
Take him down, Hurley.

264
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,368
0 serving 0.

265
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,212
1- Nothing.

266
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,734
I grow the tea myself,

267
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:35,389
so pardon its bitterness.

268
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:36,806
Any tea is good tea.

269
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,573
You know how long it's been
since we've seen ice?

270
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:45,549
I noticed a series of thick wires
as I walked around the station.

271
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:46,705
This is the hub,

272
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,993
but they go underground
to various stations all over the island.

273
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,691
And these cables--
do any of them run into the ocean?

274
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,371
Yes. There is an underwater beacon

275
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,938
that emits sonar pings
to help guide in the vessels.

276
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,905
By vessels, you mean submarines?

277
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:03,529
Yes. The Initiative
used one to bring us here,

278
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,551
but I can imagine only that the hostiles

279
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,003
have either destroyed
or commandeered it by now.

280
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,888
That explains how they were able

281
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,666
to get round my position
and capture our sailboat.

282
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,055
You have a sailboat?

283
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:18,430
Till we lost it to your hostiles.

284
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,791
That's very unfortunate.

285
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,669
Well...

286
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,832
at least we were able to kill one them.

287
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,457
Why are we continuing
to play this little game...

288
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,961
when we all know
it has moved to the next stage?

289
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,087
Get some rope.

290
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,791
Drink.

291
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,152
You were a torturer, were you not,

292
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,703
in the Republican Guard?

293
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:03,436
Do you not recognize
one of your victims?

294
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:07,293
Do you not recognize
the woman that you tortured?

295
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,141
Do you not recognize my wife?!

296
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:11,236
No, I've never...

297
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,095
You've confused me with someone else.

298
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:26,914
Amira was arrested for harboring
an enemy of the state.

299
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,166
She was held for three months
while she was questioned.

300
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,730
Her arms bear the scars
of those questions.

301
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:46,249
So I assure you, Najeev,
I am not confused.

302
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,602
My name is not Najeev.

303
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:55,685
I am Sayid Jarrah.

304
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:59,349
I was in the Republican Guard,

305
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,335
and, yes, I was an interrogator,
but I have never seen your wife.

306
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,229
Maybe she saw me at the same facility,
but I do not know her!

307
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:12,091
I can remember every face
of every person I've interrogated.

308
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,577
She remembers your face.

309
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,510
She remembers it so well

310
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,744
that she recognized it
from a mere glimpse

311
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,000
when we walked
by the restaurant where you worked!

312
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:39,888
What do you want from me?

313
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:42,614
I want you to admit to what you did,

314
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,464
And if you don't,

315
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,827
you will leave this room in that bag.

316
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:02,921
How do you know he isn't alone?

317
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,998
The horse outside is still saddled,

318
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,117
And the stirrups are set up
for someone much shorter than this man.

319
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:11,563
You think the others sent someone
to keep him company?

320
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:15,398
They sent someone out here
because they lost communications.

321
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:17,752
Maybe when the sky turned purple?

322
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,599
That would be my guess.

323
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:22,367
If there's someone else here,
they're hiding pretty good.

324
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:25,138
I checked every nook and cranny
of this place...

325
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,200
Not every nook and cranny.

326
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:02,638
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

327
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:04,800
I have told you the truth.

328
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:10,590
I do not know you--

329
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:13,347
You tortured her.

330
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:19,267
No. I would never touch a woman--

331
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,393
Do you tnk this will do any good,

332
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:32,274
that this will make me confess
to something I didn't do?

333
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,986
My wife confessed
to something she didn't do.

334
00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:39,697
She confessed when you poured
a pan of boiling oil over her arms.

335
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:42,433
- No, I did not. You have the wrong--
- Admit it!

336
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,445
Admit it!

337
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,793
I cannot admit to something I didn't do.

338
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:00,965
That is enough for today.

339
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,098
Then I will see you tomorrow.

340
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,428
<i>Your move.</i>

341
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,838
What is it?

342
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,097
C-4...

343
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,151
explosive.

344
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,794
The whole place is wired.

345
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,455
Why ?

346
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,407
I don't know.

347
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,131
<i>Manual override achieved.</i>

348
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:57,319
<i>For pallet drop, enter 2-4.</i>

349
00:28:57,814 --> 00:29:00,345
<i>For station uplink, enter 3-2.</i>

350
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:04,078
<i>For mainland communication, enter 3-8.</i>

351
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:14,699
<i>The satellite dish is inoperable.</i>

352
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,696
<i>Communications are down.</i>

353
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:21,363
<i>For sonar access, enter 5-6.</i>

354
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:29,974
<i>Sonar is inoperable.</i>

355
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:34,887
<i>Has there been an incursion
on this station by the hostiles?</i>

356
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:38,243
<i>If so, enter 7-7.</i>

357
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:47,705
Keep your voice low
and your hands in front of you.

358
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,035
Stop right there.

359
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,318
Put the gun on the ground... now.

360
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:38,648
What are you doing?

361
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:39,895
It's her.

362
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:41,892
She was there!

363
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:44,826
She was at the dock.
She was there when we were kidnapped.

364
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:46,948
She knows where Jack is.

365
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,745
Are there any more of you here?

366
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:04,520
Let's take her upstairs.

367
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:07,691
Come on. John, we're coming up!

368
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:13,506
<i>Out here.</i>

369
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:17,527
Move.

370
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:26,824
This is simple.

371
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:29,296
Send her over to me,
and I will release him.

372
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:30,775
Then we all go our separate ways.

373
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:31,913
Don't listen to him.

374
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:33,962
If he was gonna kill me,
I'd be dead already.

375
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:34,985
Shut your mouth.

376
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:37,114
- Listen to me.
- Sayid, do not let her go.

377
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,342
I will execute you right here.

378
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,831
- He's not gonna do it.
- Be quiet.

379
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,249
- I'm the only thing keeping him alive.
- I swear to you--

380
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,254
Calm down, everyone.

381
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:47,998
I'll handle this John.

382
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:55,548
Don't let her talk to him!

383
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:00,509
Just do it, Mikhail!

384
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:13,978
Finish it!

385
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:18,779
Kill me.

386
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,086
Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.

387
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,245
Sorry you hustled me, you mean.

388
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,293
My mom had a table in her basement,

389
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:45,965
and I played a lot at the insti--

390
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,955
This place I hung out for a while.

391
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,627
- I got kinda good.
- Well, hooray for you.

392
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,425
Doesn't look like at last slam

393
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:59,037
caused any long-term damage
to your forehead...

394
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,888
and you got 3 points,
which is better than zero.

395
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,089
Something you want?

396
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:05,937
Came to give you back
some of your stuff,

397
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,434
'Cause, you know,
you're the kind of guy that needs stuff.

398
00:33:10,852 --> 00:33:11,852
You a shrink now?

399
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,143
She'll be okay, dude.

400
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,499
I know you're worried about her,

401
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,175
But she's with Locke and Sayid.

402
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:22,324
She's gonna be fine.

403
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,851
Yeah, well, thanks for the pep talk,

404
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:26,072
- Lump--
- Unh-Unh, dude.

405
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,121
It's Hurley...

406
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:30,287
or Hugo, if you want.

407
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:35,977
Get bent, Hugo.

408
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,232
You ready to go, Locke?

409
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,902
<i>I'll be there in a minute.</i>

410
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:53,447
<i>Has there been an incursion
on this station by the hostiles?</i>

411
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:57,647
<i>If so, enter 7-7.</i>

412
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:09,555
Tell me something.

413
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:13,224
Were you ever a member
of the dharma initiative,

414
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:15,839
or was everything you said a lie?

415
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,752
Of course I'm wasting my breath.

416
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:22,976
I was never a member,
but everything else I told you was true.

417
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,701
I moved into the station
after the purge.

418
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,498
The purge, in which a group
of scientists attacked your people?

419
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,989
Believe what you want,
but that is what happened.

420
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:34,989
Your friends-- did he kill them?

421
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,897
They're collecting whatever
may be useful from the farmhouse,

422
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,723
and now we have our ticket
to where the others live,

423
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:44,041
where we'll find your daughter and Jack,

424
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:47,445
and finally, perhaps, a way home.

425
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:52,681
There is nothing you could do to me
that would make me lead you there.

426
00:34:55,148 --> 00:34:57,937
I didn't say you were our ticket, did I?

427
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:08,626
This is a map
showing electrical and data cabling

428
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,462
running from the Flame, here,

429
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:15,052
to a place called "the Barracks," here.

430
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:19,326
It's comprised of houses
and dormitories with water and power,

431
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,106
large enough to accommodate
an entire community.

432
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:27,182
Sounds like a place
well worth visiting, don't you think?

433
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:31,014
There will come a time
when your guard is down,

434
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:35,788
and when it is, I will not hesitate
a moment before killing you.

435
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,696
- You should know this before--
- He's making an excellent point.

436
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,826
You have a map.

437
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,280
Why keep him alive?

438
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:16,538
After my husband and I
first arrived to Paris,

439
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,666
I was afraid
to ever leave our apartment.

440
00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:26,613
So I would stare out the window
into the alley,

441
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,619
and I would see this cat
looking for scraps.

442
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,532
One day, some children
came into the alley

443
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:36,576
and trapped him in a box.

444
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,377
I watched them light firecrackers

445
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,827
and drop them in the box.

446
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:48,735
I could hear him howl
from three stories above.

447
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:56,542
So finally,
I had a reason to leave my apartment.

448
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:02,172
I rescued this cat,
and I brought him home.

449
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:05,647
He sits with me when I read.

450
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,219
He sleeps with me,

451
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,483
and he purrs.

452
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:18,528
But.

453
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:24,369
every once in a while,
he will bite me or scratch me.

454
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,222
He does this

455
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:33,069
because sometimes

456
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:35,982
he forgets that he is safe now.

457
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,703
So I forve him

458
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,844
when he bites me,

459
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,052
because I know

460
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:47,616
what it is like to never feel safe.

461
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,227
And that is because of you.

462
00:37:58,391 --> 00:37:59,391
So today...

463
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:02,343
I ask only one thing of you.

464
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,474
I ask you now

465
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,408
that you show me the respect

466
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:13,272
of acknowledging what you did to me...

467
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:18,581
that it was you who questioned me,

468
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:21,263
that tortured me...

469
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,104
and that you rember me.

470
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:42,819
I remember you.

471
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:48,973
I remember your face.

472
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:55,443
Your face has haunted me
ever since I left Iraq.

473
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,361
I am sorry.

474
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:19,518
I am so sorry for what I did to you.

475
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,171
I am...

476
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:33,895
I forgive you.

477
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,476
When my husband returns,

478
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:46,091
I will tell him
I made a terrible mistake,

479
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:49,698
that it was not you...

480
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,564
and he will release you.

481
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
Why ?

482
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:01,036
Why are you letting me go?

483
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:07,038
We are all capable of doing
what those children did to this cat...

484
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:11,571
but I will not do that.

485
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,417
I will not be that.

486
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:29,430
We should kill him, Sayid.

487
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:31,968
He already told us
that he would kill us.

488
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,440
He's my prisoner.

489
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:44,833
I will decide his fate.

490
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,684
I can see
you didn't find anything worth taking.

491
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:56,656
Actually, I just played
that silly chess game again,

492
00:40:56,924 --> 00:41:00,066
and now I realize
why you didn't want me to beat it.

493
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:04,431
Meaning what ?

494
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,738
What have you done, John?

495
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,967
That place was our one hope
of communication with the outside world!

496
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,048
The computer said if there was
an incursion by the hostiles,

497
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,612
I should enter 7-7,

498
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,828
so I entered 7-7.

499
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:36,297
We should go.

500
00:41:36,947 --> 00:41:40,878
If anyone's around, this explosion
is going to attract their attention.
