1
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,701
- What's that?
- Cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.

2
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:33,503
You don't know where your boat is?

3
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:35,080
I know where it is.

4
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:50,764
Why do you fly directly
into the thunderhead?

5
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:54,234
Why don't you just sit back
and let me do my job?

6
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:03,109
Is that Penelope?

7
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,739
She told Charlie she didn't know
about this boat, correct?

8
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,183
What do you expect to find
when you get there?

9
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:13,274
Answers.

10
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,962
Damn it!

11
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,139
Hold on!

12
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,661
On your sodding feet!

13
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:48,238
Move, move!

14
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,576
What are you waiting for, Hume?

15
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,785
What's the matter, Hume?

16
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,863
Did you not hear me?

17
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,297
I'm sorry, sir.
I was having a dream, sir.

18
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:09,350
You were having a dream?
And what were you dreaming about

19
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,929
that it took you so sodding long
to get to your mark?

20
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,184
I was in a helicopter, sir.

21
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,363
And there was a storm, sir.

22
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,982
I don't remember the rest, sir.

23
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:30,237
Well, at least it was
a bloody military dream.

24
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,696
Right! All of ya!

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,447
In the yard! Four minutes!

26
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:41,865
And you can thank private Hume
for having to do it in double-time.

27
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,509
Move!

28
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,526
- One, two, three!
- Three!

29
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,392
- One, two, three!
- Four!

30
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:49,257
- One, two, three!
- Five!

31
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:51,076
100 crunches!

32
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,173
I hope your dream was worth this,
mate.

33
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,983
Sorry, pal. It's just...

34
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:03,265
I've never had a dream
that was so vivid.

35
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:07,525
- It was like I was actually there.
- Have you got something to say, Hume?

36
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:09,047
I asked you a question!

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,368
We're almost through it.
I see daylight.

38
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:25,417
What do you think you're doing?
Desmond, are you all right?

39
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,213
Who are you?

40
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,961
How do you know my name?

41
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:38,571
Here you go.

42
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,415
All right, they took off a day ago.

43
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,296
- Why haven't we heard from 'em?
- I'm gonna tell you again,

44
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:53,047
as I've been telling you all night,
I don't know!

45
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,799
You heard the same thing as I did
when we called the boat.

46
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,159
- What makes you think I know anything?
- Because you're not worried.

47
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,320
- Excuse me?
- Your boat's 40 miles off the coast.

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,233
It should've taken 'em, what...
20 minutes to get there?

49
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:06,959
So why aren't you worried?

50
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:11,605
Should I wring my hands together
and whisper a prayer on their behalf?

51
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,376
Come on.

52
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,760
Maybe we should just... tell 'em.

53
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,097
- Tell us what?

54
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,017
Let's not confuse anyone.

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,367
Well...

56
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,702
Daniel, maybe if you talk real slow,
we'll be able to follow.

57
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:35,946
Your perception of how long
your friends have been gone...

58
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:41,551
It's not necessarily
how long they've actually been gone.

59
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,166
- What does that mean?
- This is a mistake.

60
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,293
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

61
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,801
As long as Frank flew on the bearings
I gave him, if he stayed on it, it...

62
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,675
- It'll be fine.
- And what if he didn't?

63
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,532
Then there might be side effects.

64
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,425
- We're at 2,000 feet. Sit down!
- What am I doing here?

65
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,062
- What is it?
- It's Des...

66
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,023
- You know me?
- Hold him down!

67
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,025
- I'm trying!
- Let go of me!

68
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,776
Keep him away from the stick!
We'll be there in two minutes!

69
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,714
- What are you doing back?
- Who are they?

70
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,290
Survivors of 815.

71
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,739
So you brought them here.
What the hell were you thinking?

72
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,840
- Where am I?
- Easy, buddy.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,001
Who are you people?
What am I doing here?

74
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,261
- My friend is disoriented.
- I'm not your friend! I don't know you!

75
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,082
I don't know you!

76
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:28,684
- When did he start doing this?
- He was fine when we left.

77
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:32,604
And we hit some weather. Faraday told me
as long as I stayed on the vector...

78
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,094
Wait.

79
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,924
What's your name, my friend?

80
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,616
OK, Sayid. We're gonna take
your buddy down to the sick bay.

81
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,033
I'm going with him.

82
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,555
Let our doctor look at him first,
then you can come down.

83
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,372
You got my word on that, OK?

84
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,009
All right. Listen to me.
This is a mistake, right?

85
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,263
- I don't know these people.
- I understand.

86
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,057
No, but this is wrong!
I'm not supposed

87
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,349
to be here!

88
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,269
Twenty! Twenty-one!

89
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,146
- 22!
- "Here"?

90
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:14,814
- 23!
- "Here" what?

91
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,567
What the hell are you doing
on your feet?

92
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:21,595
Are you finished with your crunches
because you want to run?

93
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,198
Right! Squad!

94
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,665
On your feet!

95
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:28,859
Right face!

96
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:30,831
10 kilometers!

97
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,506
Get moving, or so help me,
I'll kill you myself.

98
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,586
What the hell's
the matter with you, Des?

99
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:48,196
If I told you, you'd think I was crazy.

100
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:50,385
I already know you're crazy.

101
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,966
This morning, when I was
in the yard doing crunches...

102
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,269
I left.

103
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,318
What do you mean, you left?

104
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,559
I was on a boat.

105
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:09,311
And then I was back here,
right where I started.

106
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,704
Des, if you're trying
to get tossed out of service...

107
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,582
Billy, I am telling you the truth, man.

108
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,922
Who else was on this... boat?

109
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,233
Anyone you recognize?

110
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,274
There was a photo.

111
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,516
- Penny was in the photo.
- What?

112
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,029
Des, where you going?

113
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,737
Thanks for this morning, Hume!

114
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:54,562
Watch your step.

115
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,787
Watch it. Watch your step.
Take it easy.

116
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:03,171
I'm not here.
This... This isn't happening.

117
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,592
You are here, and this is happening.

118
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,011
- Look, we'll take care of you.
- What am I doing here?

119
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,391
- You're gonna be OK.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

120
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,076
Who are you people?

121
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,011
My name is Keamy, and this is Omar.

122
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,412
I'm from Vegas, and he's from Florida.

123
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:23,779
- But as for where we are...
- We last ported in Fiji.

124
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:27,675
So at least we know
we're still in the Pacific.

125
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,828
All right, my friend.

126
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,621
Now you just relax, OK?

127
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:40,750
We're gonna go get the doc,
and he's gonna ask you some questions

128
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,788
to help us sort all this out.

129
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:46,047
What do you mean, sort out? Wait!
I'm not supposed to be here!

130
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,164
I'm not supposed to be here!

131
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,737
Open this door! Open this door!

132
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,176
It's happening to you too?

133
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,805
Isn't it?

134
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:15,077
soustitreslost@gmail.com

135
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:43,386
What's happening to Des?
Your friends know what's wrong.

136
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:44,857
They didn't tell me.

137
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:49,328
Can you share how we took off at dusk
and landed in the middle of the day?

138
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,256
Listen, I don't know what's happening
to your buddy, all right?

139
00:10:56,686 --> 00:11:00,645
But you gotta trust me when I tell you
I'm trying to help you.

140
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,496
You want to help me?

141
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,432
Give me your phone.

142
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,220
Let me call my people.

143
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,443
You give me that weapon,
and I'll give you this phone.

144
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:20,759
Be quick.
Don't go trying to call Baghdad.

145
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,146
Those phones only call each other.

146
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,488
<i>Jack? It's Sayid.</i>

147
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:37,785
<i>- I'm on the freighter.</i>
- Are you OK? Where have you been?

148
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,997
Something happened during the flight,
and now Desmond's in their sick bay.

149
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,084
Hold on, hold on.

150
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,198
All right, you're on speaker.

151
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,130
<i>On the helicopter,
something happened to Desmond.</i>

152
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,091
He doesn't appear to recognize me
or know where he is.

153
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:56,888
"Side effects"?

154
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,323
Wait, your friend Desmond, has he...

155
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,789
Has he recently been exposed
to high levels of radiation

156
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,272
or electromagnetism?

157
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,946
Okay, look, we don't know why,

158
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,092
but going to and coming from the island,
some people can get a little...

159
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:17,368
Confused.

160
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:19,218
So...

161
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,119
What? This is amnesia?

162
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,443
No, this is not amnesia.

163
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:34,457
Can you hear me?

164
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,684
Are you all right?

165
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,100
I was just on a ferris wheel.

166
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:51,186
See, Ray? I'm not crazy.

167
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,804
It's happening to him, too, Ray,
and it's gonna happen to you.

168
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,053
It's gonna happen to all of us,
everyone...

169
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,886
Once we start heading
to that island again.

170
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,989
Would you please step aside?

171
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,273
- I need you to relax for a minute.
- No!

172
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,796
No, it's not gonna stop it, Ray!
Nothing can stop it, Ray!

173
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,264
- And how are you feeling?
- What the bloody hell is going on?

174
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,714
- I understand you're disoriented.
- You won't stick me with that!

175
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,510
I don't wanna stick you with anything.

176
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,180
It's okay.
I just wanna check your eyes.

177
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,281
Why?

178
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,267
So I can help you.

179
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,665
What's your name?

180
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,845
Tell me about the last thing
you rem...

181
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:43,146
<i>What do you want, Desmond?</i>

182
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,513
Penny, listen. I'm...

183
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,433
I'm in trouble, and...

184
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:51,801
But I... I think
something's happening to me, and...

185
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,130
I'm confused and...

186
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:56,863
I need to see you.

187
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,230
<i>You broke off with me,
and then you joined the army,</i>

188
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:06,281
<i>and now you call with some expectation
that I still care about you?</i>

189
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,396
<i>Yeah, I'd say you are confused.</i>

190
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,097
No, I'm not. It's...

191
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,459
Look, I've got two days leave
starting tonight.

192
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,520
Can I come and see you?

193
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:20,647
<i>No, and don't bother showing up
at the flat either, 'cause I've moved.</i>

194
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:21,957
Moved? Where?

195
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,093
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

196
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:27,248
<i>Look, Desmond, I'm gonna go.</i>

197
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:30,360
<i>- Please, just don't call me again.</i>
- No, no. Listen! Penny...

198
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,810
Penny, I need you!

199
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:39,025
Did you just...
Experience something, Desmond?

200
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:45,335
What the hell? You're not supposed
to be here, and definitely not with him.

201
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:48,896
Faraday called from the island.
He needs to talk to the Scottish guy.

202
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,147
No, Faraday won't talk to my patient.
Get out!

203
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:53,057
But he's not your patient.

204
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,791
Give Desmond the phone.

205
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:58,144
Give him the phone now!

206
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,647
Desmond? My name is Daniel Faraday.

207
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:10,265
We met yesterday before you took off,
but I guess you don't remember that.

208
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:12,271
<i>- Am I right?</i>
- Took off? What?

209
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,811
<i>We don't have long to talk,</i>

210
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:17,398
so I need you to tell me
what year you think it is.

211
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:20,358
What do you mean, what year...
It's 1996.

212
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:28,700
All right, Desmond,
look, you gotta tell me. Where are you?

213
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,287
I'm in some kind of sick bay.

214
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:34,271
No, not right now.

215
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,581
Where are you supposed to be?
Where are you in 1996?

216
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,713
I'm at camp Millar.
It's a Royal Scots regiment.

217
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,712
<i>Just north of Glasgow.</i>

218
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:46,260
- Dan, you might wanna...
- Yeah. No. No, I'm thinking.

219
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:51,765
Desmond, listen, when it happens again,
I need you to get on a train.

220
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,226
<i>Get on a train
and go to Oxford university.</i>

221
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,207
Queen's college physics department,
all right?

222
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,417
What? Why?

223
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,445
Because I need you to find me.

224
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,035
Where is it?

225
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,495
- What?
- My journal, my journal.

226
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,083
I need my journal,
or I won't believe him.

227
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,024
Why does he think he's in 1996?

228
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,246
I don't know. It's unpredictable.
It's a random effect.

229
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:25,256
Sometimes the displacement's
only two hours, sometimes years.

230
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,641
Wait, this has happened before?

231
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,525
The phone now, please. Thank you.

232
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,573
- Are you still there?
- Doc? Are you okay in there?

233
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,149
Talk to him!
I can't hold them for long.

234
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,769
Yes, I'm here!

235
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:40,648
Okay, listen,
when you find me at Queen's college,

236
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:44,693
I need you to tell me
to set the device to 2.342.

237
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,612
- What?<i>
- All right, you got it? 2.342.</i>

238
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:50,156
And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz.

239
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,321
<i>You got it, Desmond?</i>

240
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:55,496
2.342, oscillating at eleven...

241
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:59,291
<i>Just remember,
2.342 at eleven hertz, all right?</i>

242
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:03,397
And one more thing, Desmond.
If the numbers don't convince me,

243
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:06,757
I need you to tell me
that you know about Eloise.

244
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,304
Easy, now!

245
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,973
<i>Desmond, tell me
that you know about Elo...</i>

246
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,695
... not a single piece
of original thinking...

247
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,715
... the concept of "original",

248
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,134
the opposite of derivative.

249
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:54,582
I am the one for you to impress,
Mr. Hollister, and I'm not impressed.

250
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:56,932
So go. Go try again.

251
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,895
Sorry, are you Daniel Faraday?

252
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,680
- You are?
- I'm sorry.

253
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,151
I'm Desmond Hume,

254
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,164
and I was told I could find you here.

255
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,241
And I think I've...
just been to the future.

256
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,750
The future?

257
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,789
I spoke to you there.

258
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,082
You told me to come here to Oxford.

259
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,775
I had to find you.

260
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,879
You said you'd help me.

261
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,965
Why didn't I just help you there
in the future?

262
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,811
- Sorry?
- Why would I put you

263
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,166
through the headache
of time traveling?

264
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:38,265
You now what I mean?
It just seems a little... unnecessary?

265
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,539
And don't you think
my esteemed colleagues

266
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,602
could've come up with something
just a little more believable?

267
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,356
What kind of a prank is that?

268
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,211
Time paradox...

269
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,053
So uninspired...

270
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:53,989
Set your device to...

271
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,145
2.342

272
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:58,619
and make sure it oscillates at 11.

273
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,182
Okay, now... Now you...

274
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,965
You're gonna tell me
who told you those numbers.

275
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,175
You did.

276
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:16,678
This is ridiculous.

277
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,627
I know about Eloise.

278
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,569
What is all this?

279
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,577
This is where I do the things
Oxford frowns upon.

280
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:40,202
All right, this... future version of...

281
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:43,296
me, he referenced this meeting,
right?

282
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:46,235
Obviously. So I would remember you

283
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:50,041
coming to Oxford, right?
I would remember this here, right now.

284
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,775
Actually... no.

285
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,092
- No?
- Maybe you just forgot.

286
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:58,178
Yeah, right. How would that happen?

287
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,697
- So... This is changing the future?
- You can't change the future.

288
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,311
- What's that for?
- Radiation.

289
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:12,442
- Do I get one?
- No need. For prolonged exposure.

290
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:14,746
I do this 20 times a day.

291
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,180
So what do you put on your head?

292
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:21,201
Yeah.

293
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:31,983
This is... Eloise.

294
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:42,563
What does this do?

295
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:46,768
If the numbers you gave me are correct,
what this will do...

296
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,522
Is unstick Eloise in time,

297
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,631
just like you.

298
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,262
- What happened?
- Wait. She's not back yet.

299
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,672
There she is.

300
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,135
Okay, here goes...

301
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:21,948
Everything.

302
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:28,348
That's it...

303
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,314
Come on. That's it.

304
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:46,994
It worked!

305
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:51,789
- This is incredible.
- How is a rat running through a maze

306
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:54,127
- so incredible?
- What is incredible

307
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:57,464
is I just finished the maze
this morning,

308
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:01,530
and I'm not gonna teach her
how to run it until hour from now.

309
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,789
So you sent her to the future.

310
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:14,606
No, her consciousness, her mind.

311
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,194
So how does that help me?

312
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:23,156
You? Help? I don't understand.
Am I supposed to help you?

313
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:26,576
- Didn't I send you back to help me?
- I don't know why you sent me here.

314
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:29,788
All I know about you is
you end up on some bloody island.

315
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,377
An island?
What island? Why would I go to...

316
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:37,004
Give me the phone.

317
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,465
Come on, everybody relax!

318
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,344
Daniel wanted to talk to the guy,
so we brought him the phone, that's all.

319
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:47,430
- You let Faraday talk to him?
- He said he could help.

320
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:50,100
Faraday can't even help himself!
Outside now.

321
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,395
- The captain wants to talk to you.
- And I wanna talk to your captain.

322
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:57,119
I'll be sure to let him know.
In the meantime, have a seat.

323
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:06,484
- I need to get back.
- Back where? The island?

324
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:09,661
He said he could help,
he'd tell me what I needed to do.

325
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:13,582
- Can you please explain to me...
- Desmond?

326
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:15,917
You're Desmond?

327
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,070
Do I know you?

328
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,466
I'm George Minkowski.

329
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:24,080
I'm the communications officer.

330
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,608
Before they strapped me down here,

331
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:29,306
all the calls to and from this boat
came through me

332
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:30,943
in the radio room.

333
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,567
And every so often,

334
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,877
I'd get this flashing light
on my console.

335
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,519
An incoming call.

336
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,653
We were under strict orders
never to answer it.

337
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:49,951
- So? What's that got to do with me?
- Those calls came from your girlfriend.

338
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:53,789
Penelope Widmore.

339
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,304
- What happened?
- You're back.

340
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:12,057
And you were out
almost seventy-five minutes.

341
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:13,642
Out?

342
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:17,248
You just... You went catonic
right in the middle of a sentence.

343
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:21,400
I had to carry you to the chair.
I take it you were in the future again?

344
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,071
- For how long?
- I don't know. Five minutes?

345
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:31,659
Why does this keep happening?

346
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,413
In your case, I'm guessing
the progression is exponential.

347
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:40,669
Each time your consciousness jumps,
it gets harder and harder to jump back.

348
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,213
I'd be careful crossing the street
if I were you.

349
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,098
- What happened to her?
- She died.

350
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:56,268
- I can see that. How?
- Brain aneurysm maybe. I don't know.

351
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,493
I'm gonna do an autopsy later.

352
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:02,006
- Will it happen to me?
- The effects seem to vary

353
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,936
from case to case, but...

354
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,890
Answer me! If this keeps happening,
am I gonna die?

355
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:11,700
I don't know.

356
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:18,664
I think

357
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,334
Eloise's brain short-circuited.

358
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,708
The jumps between the present
and the future...

359
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:28,008
She eventually... She couldn't tell
which was which. She had no anchor.

360
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:32,572
- What do you mean, "anchor"?
- Something familiar in both times.

361
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,308
All this, see? This is all variables.
It's random. It's chaotic.

362
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:40,493
Every equation needs stability,
something known. It's called a constant.

363
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,898
Desmond... You have no constant.

364
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,677
When you go to the future,
nothing there is familiar.

365
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:49,786
So if you want to stop this

366
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:53,398
then you need to find something there,

367
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,700
something that you really
really care about...

368
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,725
That also exists back here...

369
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,495
In 1996.

370
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,075
This constant...

371
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:11,384
Can it be a person?

372
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:13,161
Yeah, maybe.

373
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:16,798
But you have to make some kind
of contact.

374
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:20,519
Didn't you say you were off
on a boat in the middle of nowhere?

375
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:28,193
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling my bloody constant.

376
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,822
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnected.</i>

377
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:40,663
You okay?

378
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:48,852
You look a lot older now, huh?

379
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,805
Welcome back, Desmond.

380
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:57,178
- I need to call Penny.
- Calling her is not our priority.

381
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:01,038
Listen, brother, I don't know you,
but you seem to know me, so...

382
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,148
So if you and me are friends,

383
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,180
then I need your help.
I need to call Penny now.

384
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,068
You boys are getting
way ahead of yourselves.

385
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,862
Two days ago,
someone sabotaged all the equipment.

386
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:16,012
We lost all communication
with the mainland.

387
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:19,054
I probably could've fixed it,
but then...

388
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:21,913
- Then I went nuts.
- Where's the radio room?

389
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,538
It's one deck up.

390
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:25,977
I'll take you there. Come on.

391
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,637
And how do we get out of here?

392
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:32,835
Through the door.

393
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:39,629
Looks like you guys
have a friend on this boat.

394
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,985
Your nose.

395
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,506
It's clear.

396
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,202
Let's...

397
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:20,462
The <i>Black Rock</i> set sail
from Portsmouth, England,

398
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,928
on March 22, 1845,

399
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:25,497
on a trading mission
to the Kingdom of Siam

400
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,927
when she was tragically lost at sea.

401
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:30,566
The only known artifact of this journey

402
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:33,180
is the journal of the ship's first mate,

403
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,748
which was discovered
among the artifacts of pirates

404
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,239
on <i>Ile Ste Marie</i>, Madagascar,
7 years later.

405
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:41,379
The contents of this journal
have never been made public,

406
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,308
nor are known to anyone
outside the family of the seller,

407
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:45,682
Tovard Hanso.

408
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:49,122
We open the bidding on lot 2-3-4-2

409
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,331
at 150,000 pounds.

410
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,025
150,000, sir.

411
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:55,700
For 160?

412
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:57,967
Do I hear 160? 160, sir. 170, sir.

413
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,596
180 on the phone. 200,000 pounds.

414
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,598
220,000 pounds.

415
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:04,559
240?

416
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,018
260,000 pounds, sir.

417
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:08,182
280?

418
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,615
On the phone, I have 300,000...

419
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:13,233
320! 340,000 pounds.

420
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:14,359
360?

421
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,301
380...

422
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,405
It's on appointment only, sir.

423
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:20,054
Do I hear 400,000 pounds?

424
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:23,815
I just need to speak to the gentleman
over there just for a moment?

425
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:26,709
Sold for 380,000 pounds

426
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,601
to bidder 7-5-5. Thank you.

427
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,020
Just for a minute, all right?
Mr. Widmore.

428
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:35,964
- Desmond?
- Can I have a word, sir?

429
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:38,585
- Sorry, Mr. Widmore, he...
- It's fine.

430
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:41,761
- ... of Charles Dickens when he died.
- Walk with me.

431
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,680
We open the bidding on this lot...

432
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,882
Your word. Let's have it.

433
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,973
I need to get in touch with Penny.

434
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:01,990
I don't know how to reach her,
and her number's been disconnected.

435
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,008
there was a time when if you'd have
asked her to marry you,

436
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,244
I'm certain she would've said yes.

437
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:10,583
fortunately...

438
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,418
your cowardice won out instead.

439
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,429
I take it you've had second thoughts.

440
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:27,974
and you'd like her
to give you another chance.

441
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:30,435
Why do you hate me so much?

442
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,980
It's not me who hates you.

443
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:38,286
Here's her address.

444
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,198
I'll let her tell you herself.

445
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,763
I know. It's getting harder.

446
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,757
It starts happening faster too.

447
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,714
Come on, let's move.

448
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,647
How did this happen to you?

449
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,868
We were anchored here,

450
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:24,691
waiting for our orders,
bored out of our minds.

451
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:29,158
Me and Brandon,
he's one of the crew members,

452
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,327
we took out the ship's tender.

453
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:34,940
We just wanted to see the island.

454
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,335
But Brandon started acting crazy,

455
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,255
so we had to turn around.

456
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:43,099
- Where is he?
- In a body bag.

457
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:49,722
There.

458
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,132
Who did this?

459
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:55,797
You got me.

460
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,690
but when the captain finds out,
I feel sor...

461
00:33:03,354 --> 00:33:07,204
After your call, someone has to tell me
precisely what is going on.

462
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:12,655
- Can you fix it, brother?
- I need a minute.

463
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:17,333
Do you have the number
to make the call?

464
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,379
Wake up, brother.
You gotta come back!

465
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:25,215
Desmond, do you know the number?

466
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:30,179
You'd better remember it.

467
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:39,802
It's 2004.

468
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:44,152
I didn't realize
it was almost Christmas. It's been...

469
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:57,440
I can't...

470
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,076
get...

471
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:01,048
back.

472
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:14,474
What happened to him?

473
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,331
The same thing
that's gonna happen to me.

474
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:23,156
- What are you doing here?
- I had to...

475
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:25,628
I tried to call you,
but you disconnected your phone.

476
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:28,005
Yeah, because I moved.

477
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,888
I don't know if you get the signals,
but I'm trying to make

478
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,178
a clean break from you,
so if you don't mind...

479
00:35:34,418 --> 00:35:37,249
Pen, please wait. I just need to get
your new phone number.

480
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,981
- Why would I give you that?
- Because I made a huge mistake.

481
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:42,122
I should never have broken up
with you,

482
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:44,939
- I know that now, and I'm sorry and...
- Don't. Just don't...

483
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:49,527
I understand, and I know
it's too late to change things,

484
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,281
but I need to tell you something,
and I need you to listen to me.

485
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,378
I know it's gonna sound ridiculous,
but...

486
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,800
Please, Pen.

487
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,110
I need you to listen to me.

488
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,301
Just say what you need to say
and then go.

489
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:18,690
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make any sense to me,

490
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,818
but... eight years from now, I...

491
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:27,528
I need to call you, and I can't call you
if I don't have your number.

492
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:32,049
- What?
- Penny, just... give me your number.

493
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:35,689
I know I've ruined things, I know
you think we are over, but we're not.

494
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,453
If there's any part of you
that still believes in us, just...

495
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:41,204
Give me your number.

496
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:44,516
- And if you call me tonight? Tomorrow?
- I won't call...

497
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:46,945
for eight years.

498
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,859
December the 24th, 2004.

499
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,467
Christmas Eve.

500
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:57,898
I promise.

501
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,940
if I give you the number,
will you leave?

502
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:10,177
Aye.

503
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,508
7946

504
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:20,449
0893.

505
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,914
7946-0893. 7946...

506
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:27,950
All that, and you're not
gonna write it down?

507
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,255
It wouldn't do any good.

508
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:36,509
Keep that number.
You can't change it for 8 years.

509
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:39,494
- Get out!
- Just remember, December 24th, 2004.

510
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:41,389
Pen, if you still care about me,

511
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:44,469
You have to answer. I'm not crazy!
you have to believe me!

512
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:45,560
You have...

513
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,932
to trust me.

514
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,001
I do trust you,

515
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:52,524
but you still have to remember
that number.

516
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,611
7946...

517
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:58,376
0893. 7946-0893.

518
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,451
- It's a London number.
- Excellent timing.

519
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,413
The patch is done,

520
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,773
but I don't know
how long the battery will last.

521
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:13,004
I hope she's there.

522
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,339
I hope so, too.

523
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,300
Penny, you answered.

524
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:16,943
You answered, Penny.

525
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,697
Des, where are you?

526
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,498
I'm on a boat. I'm...

527
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,893
I've been on an island.

528
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,005
My God, is that really you?

529
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:41,133
Yes, it's me!

530
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:45,388
You believed me.

531
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:49,609
You still care about me.

532
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,683
I've been looking for you
for the past three years.

533
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:55,748
I know about the island.

534
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,832
<i>I've been researching...</i>

535
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,713
<i>and when I spoke
to your friend Charlie...</i>

536
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:04,198
<i>that's when I knew
you were still alive.</i>

537
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,644
That's when I knew I wasn't crazy.

538
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,360
- Des, are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here!

539
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,792
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, it's better.

540
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,093
I love you, Penny.

541
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,068
I've always loved you.

542
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:26,785
I'm so sorry.

543
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,387
I love you.

544
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:32,310
I love you too.

545
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:35,161
- I don't know where I am.
- I'll find you.

546
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:36,691
- I promise
- No matter what,

547
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,114
- I'll come back, promise.
- I won't give up, I promise.

548
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,450
I love you.

549
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:55,630
I'm sorry. The power source went dead.
That's all we have.

550
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,302
Thank you, Sayid.

551
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:14,028
It was enough.

552
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:18,739
Are you all right now?

553
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,785
Aye.

554
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:25,926
I'm back right there.
