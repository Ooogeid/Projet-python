00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:01,698
<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:01,852 --> 00:00:03,241
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:05,865
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him that.

4
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:08,513
The man in the house.
You said you seen him before?

5
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,369
On the video feed
from the pearl station.

6
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,983
Why are we continuing
to play this little game,

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,616
when we all know
it has moved to the next stage?

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,876
This is a map
showing electrical and data cabling

9
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,737
comprised of houses and dormitories.

10
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,773
Sounds like a place well worth visiting.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,768
I saw a lightning hit the roof.

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,446
You were electrocuted.

13
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:33,534
And when you heard Claire was in
the water, you drown trying to save her.

14
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:35,309
I dove in myself so you never went in.

15
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:38,029
I'm trying pal,
I tried twice to save you, but...

16
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,697
no matter what I try to do...

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,549
you gonna die Charlie.

18
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:31,904
Mom!

19
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:50,272
Oh look, Aaron!

20
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,895
Your mom has finaly decided to wake up.

21
00:01:57,323 --> 00:01:59,088
The only way I could get you to sleep in

22
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,738
was to borrow the midget.

23
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,036
And, what is all this?

24
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,206
An aperitive,
of mysterious island fruit.

25
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,546
Before the breakfast picnic

26
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,014
I have set up in your honor

27
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,291
a short walk down the beach.

28
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:18,610
What's gotten into you, Charlie?

29
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:19,834
Sorry?

30
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,761
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week,

31
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:25,788
and now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

32
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,530
I woke up this morning, and I thought,

33
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:30,743
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and seize the day,

34
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:32,727
and I can't think
of anyone I'd rather do

35
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,756
some day-seizing with than you.

36
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:39,506
So... What do you say?

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,277
Let's drop
the cherub off with auntie Sun

38
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,740
and uncle Jin, and you and I

39
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,061
go for a little stroll.

40
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,138
I would love to.

41
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,553
From the position of this stream,

42
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,644
we should be here,
and if the scale is right,

43
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:01,481
his people
are 2 miles in that direction.

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,752
I don't expect you to confirm that.

45
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,131
It's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

46
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,023
I'm not sure
it's as accurate as you think.

47
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,347
Well, it's certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

48
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:19,616
Hey, the stick
didget us to that station.

49
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,292
Oh, the station which
you accidentally blew up.

50
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:25,072
If you'd have warned me
that the basement was rigged with C-4,

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,914
I might've been a little more careful.

52
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,812
Why don't you just tell us
if we're going the right way?

53
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,008
You're going the right way.

54
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,859
Remind me why we're keeping him alive.

55
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,702
What do you suggest,
we shoot him like a dog?

56
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,535
No. I like dogs.

57
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:46,048
He's right. They would not trade
his life for your friend's.

58
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,992
- We should shoot him.
- Enough!

59
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:49,619
Nobody's shooting anybody.

60
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:52,927
The map says where they are,
and he says the map is right,

61
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,490
so just keep moving.

62
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,512
Okay, here we are, here we are.

63
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,048
Not bad, eh?

64
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,249
Not bad at all.

65
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,105
Well, if you'll take your seat,

66
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:15,160
we will begin with our first course,
which is cereal.

67
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:18,032
- We have fresh fruit salad--
- Good morning.

68
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:22,378
Good morning yourself.

69
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:25,015
What brings you down to the beach?

70
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:26,194
Boar are running thick.

71
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,139
I was hoping you might
want to join me on a hunt.

72
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,651
Oh. Well...

73
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,581
Thanks for the invite, but...

74
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:38,508
as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

75
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:40,727
Well, I think hunting might be a...

76
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,428
a better way to spend your day, Charlie.

77
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,783
I mean, of all the things
you could choose to do today,

78
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,802
hunting with me might be
your best option.

79
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,618
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,082
What is it?

81
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,184
I think I know
how to get us off this island.

82
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:21,484
Subtitles: swsub.com

83
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:25,431
Claire, what's the matter?

84
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,520
I need Jin's nets and fish.

85
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:30,288
We've gotta hurry. And buckets...
I'm gonna need those, too.

86
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,282
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

87
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,631
They just flew over, and they're
only gonna be here today,

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,247
so to catch one, we need to do it now.

89
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,636
Oh, this sounds like fun.

90
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,128
Can you get some nets?

91
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:42,613
Nets for what, Barb...

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,471
Nets for what, Claire?

93
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,969
Okay, five minutes ago,
a flock of sea birds flew over my head.

94
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,527
Seabirds are migratory, which means
they're gonna keep heading south.

95
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,875
I'm sorry. I don't understand
why we need to...

96
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,993
They're tagged.

97
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,079
Tagged?

98
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,171
Scientists tag these birds
so they can track them.

99
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:07,911
So when they eventually land
in Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

100
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,264
somebody's gonna gather them up.

101
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,547
We can send a message.

102
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,961
If we can catch one.

103
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,151
Okay, so here's the plan.

104
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:18,122
First, we've gotta cut up
these fish, make chum.

105
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,974
That'll get the birds
to settle in the water.

106
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,019
And then, um, we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,168
Charlie, can you go get some knives?

108
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:36,084
How do you even know
this stuff about birds?

109
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,858
I watched a lot of nature shows
with my mum.

110
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,729
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

111
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:46,304
I just-- I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

112
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,987
So what happened to seizing the day?

113
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,207
Sorry.

114
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,673
Don't see the point.

115
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,401
Hold still, dear. Just another second.

116
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,087
There.

117
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,891
We're through now.

118
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:25,390
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

119
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:28,406
Sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask you a few questions.

120
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,732
Can I ask you how the accident happened?

121
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,762
A truck forced us off the road.

122
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,358
Okay, and who was driving?

123
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,903
Me.

124
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,914
Has anyone contacted your father?

125
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,591
My father died when I was 2.

126
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:49,993
Sorry to hear that.

127
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:53,976
I spoke with the truck driver.

128
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,265
He's fine, by the way.

129
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,200
- He said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

130
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:02,696
About what speed would you say
that happened when you were driving?

131
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,180
It just came out of nowhere.

132
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:06,527
That's not the question
I asked, Ms. Littleton.

133
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:10,491
I don't know how fast I was driving.

134
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,311
Why are you even asking me
these questions?

135
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,713
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

136
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,491
My mother is in surgery.

137
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,385
She's not dead.

138
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,195
Right.

139
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:28,444
So she is.

140
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,223
You know, this is not my fault!

141
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,649
Didn't say it was.

142
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,510
Good day, Ms. Littleton.

143
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,451
Can I ask you something?

144
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,683
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

145
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:12,034
end you haven't asked me
a single question about her.

146
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,323
- You haven't--
- Your friend Jack,

147
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:17,524
you care about him?

148
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,369
Yes.

149
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,593
Imagine 16 years from now,

150
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,696
you're told he's still alive.

151
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:32,071
But in your heart,
you know that he wouldn't remember you.

152
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:33,853
He wouldn't know you.

153
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,208
Wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

154
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,823
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

155
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,324
because I do not want
to know the answers.

156
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,344
Water?

157
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,129
No, thank you.

158
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,225
So how'd you get here?

159
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,380
How'd you get onto this island?

160
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:21,689
Don't waste your breath.

161
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,562
Whatever he says will be a lie.

162
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,034
I was recruited when I was 24.

163
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,268
- I was approached by a man...
- I didn't ask you when I asked you how.

164
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,939
They brought me on the submarine.

165
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:35,377
So your people, they can just come
and go whenever they want?

166
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,530
Go, yes,

167
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:39,038
but two weeks ago,
our underwater beacon

168
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,867
stopped emitting its locator signal.

169
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:44,746
There was an event...
an electromagnetic pulse.

170
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,814
It would be impossible to come back.

171
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,243
Why would you want to come back?

172
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:49,632
You would not understand.

173
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,501
Try me.

174
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:56,407
I misspoke.

175
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,788
What I mnt to say is,
you're not capable of understanding.

176
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,222
And why am I not capable?

177
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,696
Because you are not on the list.

178
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,535
What list?

179
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:15,768
The man who brought me here,

180
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:17,794
who brought all of my people here,

181
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,006
he is... a magnificent man.

182
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,005
If Ben's so magnificent,

183
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,047
then why did he need one of us
to save him?

184
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,217
Ben? Ben is not...

185
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,999
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

186
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:38,188
You are not on the list
because you are flawed...

187
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,552
Because you are angry...

188
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:46,184
And weak and frightened.

189
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:48,730
The more I learn about your people,

190
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:52,023
the more I suspect you're not
as omniscient as you'd have us believe.

191
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,147
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

192
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,770
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah.

193
00:11:58,348 --> 00:11:59,348
How could I?

194
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:04,195
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

195
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,730
But you, John Locke,

196
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:12,859
you, I might have a fleeting memory of,
but I must be confused,

197
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,246
because the John Locke
I know was para...

198
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,973
Look at this.

199
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,188
Over here. Come on.

200
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,469
Well, looks like we're here.

201
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:22,122
- Will this work?
- Yes.

202
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,078
Work.

203
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,610
Please... Help.

204
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,080
Smells great.

205
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,674
Let's get it over with.

206
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,682
This was my mother's worst fear.

207
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,410
What do you mean?

208
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:59,134
That I would end up
doing something very much like this,

209
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,452
cutting bait.

210
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:02,523
She had high hopes for my future.

211
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,601
They did not include
me marrying a fisherman's son.

212
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,023
Well, I guess we don't always turn out
like our mothers want.

213
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,995
Of course,
mine never worked a day in her life.

214
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,619
My mom was a librarian.

215
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:24,948
Was?

216
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,529
We should get this stuff out there.

217
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,279
Where were you?

218
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,112
I went home to take a shower.

219
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,490
That must have been nice.

220
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,502
They said she was still in surgery.

221
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,450
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

222
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:14,564
Well, I'm glad
that you're feeling refreshed.

223
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,429
Good afternoon.

224
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,279
Are you the daughter?

225
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,576
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.

226
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:27,058
I'll be observing your mother
for the next few days.

227
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:28,138
How is she?

228
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,187
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries...

229
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,163
But your mother
suffered a severe head trauma.

230
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,451
We'll have to wait for the swelling
in her brain to go down

231
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,983
before we can determine
the full extent of her injuries.

232
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,264
But...

233
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,498
I'm afraid we're looking
at fairly widespread damage.

234
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,465
What does that mean?

235
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:54,010
It means that right now these machines
are sustaining her life.

236
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,718
But it won't always be...

237
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,639
I mean, when she wakes up, she won't...

238
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,759
I can't say with any real confidence

239
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:05,455
that she will wake up.

240
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:22,968
Can she hear us?

241
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:24,854
I like to think she can.

242
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,246
How long will she be like this?

243
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,903
Could be a day, a week or years.

244
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,010
We'll just have to wait and see.

245
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,343
But I can assure you,
she'll be well looked after.

246
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,033
Oh, that's very nice,

247
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,194
but we can't pay for that.

248
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:42,317
Don't worry. Her expenses
have already been taken care of.

249
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:48,704
By whom?

250
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,721
I've been asked
to keep that confidential.

251
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,107
One...

252
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,283
Two...

253
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:31,786
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,732
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,438
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,192
I was shooting at a boar.
I had no idea you were out here.

257
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,016
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
- He's back at the camp.

258
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,464
- I'm really sorry if I frightened--
- So it's just you?

259
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,244
- Aye, it's just me.
- Hunting,

260
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:50,235
in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

261
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,368
I was following a boar, Claire.

262
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,142
So it's just a coincidence, then.

263
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:58,658
Where is it?

264
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,514
It got away.

265
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,276
You don't want me to catch the birds,
do you?

266
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:13,360
You and Charlie-- what's going on?

267
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,082
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

268
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:32,516
What is it?

269
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,122
Don't touch it!

270
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,849
Don't even get near it.

271
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,309
What are these pylons?

272
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,474
What do you think they are?

273
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,059
A security perimeter.

274
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,580
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

275
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,673
if anyone passed between them.

276
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,959
It's an alarm system or a trap.

277
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:05,991
Either way,
we'll be safer going around it.

278
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:07,168
You are right.

279
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:09,202
It was a security perimeter,

280
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:13,077
but like everything else on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

281
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,338
Of course it hasn't.

282
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,103
If you wish
to waste your time, be my guest.

283
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,035
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

284
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,480
There is no going around them.

285
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,587
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

286
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,423
He appears to be telling the truth.

287
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:55,880
Thank you.

288
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,311
Oh, my god.

289
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,490
Sorry.

290
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,528
Looks like he suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

291
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:43,597
Why did you do that? We needed him!

292
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,364
They were never
gonna trade him for Jack.

293
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:49,627
- You don't know that.
- You don't know it, either.

294
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:52,636
What we do know
is that he shot one of his own people

295
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,721
who didn't want to be
in this exact situation,

296
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,621
- so I'm gonna stick with my opinion.
- We could have discussed it.

297
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,425
Nobody asked me about it when
we brought him along in the 1st place.

298
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,448
All right.

299
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:06,994
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had a sonic weapon fence.

300
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,815
I didn't know he was gonna die.
How would I know that?

301
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,581
Why are you really here?

302
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:13,870
Are you here for Jack?

303
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:16,646
Why else would I be here?

304
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,038
We'll talk about this later.

305
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,785
Fine by me.

306
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,054
Just tell me
how we're gonna go through this.

307
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,559
We're not gonna go through it.

308
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:26,722
We're going over it.

309
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,093
Sayid, where's the ax?

310
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,222
It's in his pack.

311
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,771
No, wait a minute. I got it.

312
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:33,829
Here, I got it.

313
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,765
I thought
you didn't know there was any c-4.

314
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:50,485
Well, I stand corrected.

315
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:52,813
Why did you take it?

316
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,596
You never know
when a little c-4 might come in handy.

317
00:21:57,962 --> 00:21:59,706
You'll have to do better than that.

318
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,471
Okay, there you go.

319
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:15,233
What's going on with you, Charlie?

320
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:19,354
- I just put Aaron down
- No, you and Desmond,

321
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:20,493
what's going on?

322
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,933
- What you're talking about.
- So you don't know anything about

323
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,286
Desmond shooting off his gun
and scaring away the birds?

324
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,374
I've been with Aaron all morning.

325
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,609
- You're lying to me, Charlie.
- I am not lying.

326
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,841
What happened to the guy
who woke up this morning

327
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,540
who wanted to go and have
a picnic and seize the day?

328
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,560
You really want to know the truth?

329
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,804
That glint you saw
could have been anything--

330
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,695
a piece of glass
stuck in the bird's foot...

331
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,939
or it could have been nothing at all.

332
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,756
I don't want to advocate false hope,
Claire, that's all.

333
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:58,274
Well, I'm sorry

334
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:01,641
I bothered you with my stupid ideas,
and, it won't ever happen again.

335
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:04,469
And, Charlie,
I don't want my baby around lies.

336
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,471
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

337
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,262
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

338
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,303
- I was wrong.
- No, Claire!

339
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:16,192
I'm on my own,
and at least I know that now.

340
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:18,916
Just go!

341
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:30,245
Morning, dear.

342
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,047
Oh, I like your new doctor.

343
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:33,548
What new doctor?

344
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,702
Oh, the American.

345
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:36,545
He's in with your mum now.

346
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,375
Excuse me.

347
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:01,927
The nurse said...

348
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,119
Are you a doctor?

349
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,330
Yes...

350
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,523
I'm very sorry. I shouldn't be...

351
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,699
disturbing you. I was just leaving.

352
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,394
What are you doing here?

353
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,798
I was just on my way out, Lindsey.

354
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,942
- If Carole knew you were here...
- She'd what?

355
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,912
What would she do?
She wouldn't be acting the way you are.

356
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:32,343
Aunt Lindsey,

357
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:34,726
what's going on here? Who is he?

358
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:37,669
It doesn't matter.

359
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:41,019
- Just go.
- Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.

360
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:44,129
- She deserves to know.
- Please, just leave us alone.

361
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,498
You are not the arbiter here.

362
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:49,038
- In these circumstances--
- You are taking advantage

363
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,924
- of my sister's situation--
- I believe Claire

364
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:52,759
- has every right to know--
- just stop it!

365
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:56,338
Are you the one paying the bills?

366
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:58,829
Are you the one taking care of all this?

367
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:03,512
Yes.

368
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:11,909
Then who are you?

369
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,136
I'm your father, Claire.

370
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,968
The system appears to fire a sonic pulse

371
00:25:58,438 --> 00:26:00,992
when an object
breaks the plane between two pylons.

372
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:02,123
So...

373
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,812
as long as we don't break the plane,

374
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,595
we should remain unharmed.

375
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,914
Why not just use
the plastic explosive you took?

376
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,231
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on there?

377
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,940
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

378
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:16,407
I'll go first.

379
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:21,962
Give me a hand.

380
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:24,730
I guess I'll go next.

381
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,143
Here you go.

382
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,970
Thanks.

383
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,445
You have every right to be upset.

384
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:11,254
It just doesn't make any sense.

385
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,260
Desmond's never gone
boar hunting before,

386
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,758
and the boar
never come that close to the beach.

387
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,072
Well, whatever is going on,

388
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:21,238
they're still talking about it.

389
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,376
Can you watch him?

390
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,328
What are you going to do?

391
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:35,034
Get some answers.

392
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:43,642
I'll be with you in a sec.

393
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:49,505
There you go.

394
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,579
It'll be 10 bucks.

395
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:04,880
What are you doing here?

396
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:06,837
Buy you a cup of coffee?

397
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,032
I have nothing to say to you.

398
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,523
I'm leaving tonight,
then I'll be out of your life forever.

399
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:18,031
Just one cup of coffee.

400
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:27,895
So it's true.

401
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,007
Yes, it's true.

402
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:40,700
How'd you find out about the accident?

403
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:43,073
A doctor friend here in Sydney told me.

404
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,799
I got the call the minute your mother
went into surgery.

405
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,749
Why did she tell me that you're dead?

406
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:55,275
Well, because I--no doubt--

407
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:58,116
left her
with so many wonderful memories.

408
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:03,417
Look, we had a fling.

409
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,525
I was back in Los Angeles
when she told me

410
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,954
that she was pregnant,
that she was going to have the baby...

411
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,594
- have you.
- You didn't--

412
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:12,741
You didn't want to see me?

413
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,935
No. I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

414
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:18,361
I stayed over,

415
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:20,657
gave you toys.

416
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,575
I sang to you.

417
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:26,972
Why'd you stop coming?

418
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,984
'cause your aunt hates me,

419
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,907
and your mother
didn't like the fact that I,

420
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:35,494
I had another family.

421
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:39,041
Why are you here now, then?
Why'd you come?

422
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:41,530
You could've just paid her bills
from the states.

423
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:44,371
I came over because I wanted to help.

424
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,793
Help with what?

425
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,121
Your mother is alive...

426
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,561
but she's not really living.

427
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,723
What that's supposed to mean?

428
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:59,312
It means that now may be the time

429
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:03,117
to look at other alternatives,
other ways to relieve her pain.

430
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:06,610
Now it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

431
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:09,710
but I know of ways
that can achieve the same effect

432
00:31:09,782 --> 00:31:11,766
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

433
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:14,113
- So...
You didn't come here to help me.

434
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,306
You came here to try and fix
a mistake that you made.

435
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,389
No, honey, that's not true.

436
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,250
You think that just paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

437
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,921
You come down here,

438
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,026
and you try and get me to kill her?

439
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,832
You know, just go.

440
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,964
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your real family.

441
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,111
You know...

442
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:43,742
You might be my father...

443
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:48,378
But I don't even know your name...

444
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,800
And I, um, I want it to stay that way.

445
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:58,861
Listen to me.

446
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:03,300
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

447
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:06,488
Now there is hope and there is guilt,
and believe me,

448
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:09,081
I know the difference.

449
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:18,538
Good-bye, kiddo.

450
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:21,197
It's great seeing you again.

451
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,623
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:08,672
You followed me.

453
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:12,970
Stay back!

454
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:14,751
It's one of the birds.

455
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:15,931
Stay back!

456
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,866
How did you know it was gonna be here?

457
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:37,961
I didn't.

458
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:39,415
Yes, you did.

459
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:40,967
You had to.

460
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:44,329
That's what you and Charlie
were arguing about.

461
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:47,226
You knew.

462
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,343
- How would I?
- I don't know,

463
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:52,330
but you know,
you walked straight here...

464
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:55,589
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

465
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,707
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock,

466
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:01,736
and low and behold, there's the bird.

467
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,335
What t hell is going on, Desmond?

468
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:16,206
See that spot over there?

469
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:23,455
That's where Charlie slipped
and fell in.

470
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:27,344
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

471
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:29,685
broke his neck.

472
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,191
What?

473
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:34,635
What--what are you talking about?

474
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:37,842
That's where Charlie died.

475
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,892
Look what Desmond found.

476
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,056
How about that?

477
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:58,769
It does have a tag.

478
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,516
You were right.

479
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:07,674
Desmond told me everything

480
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:12,825
about all his visions...

481
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:17,558
That he knew you were gonna get hit
by lightning,

482
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,771
that you were gonna drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean...

483
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:31,478
how you died trying to get me this bird.

484
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:34,366
You don't believe all that, do you?

485
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,468
Now who turned the telly off?

486
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,775
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

487
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:08,781
That's better.

488
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:14,029
So how are you today, mum?

489
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,090
Did you have an okay night?

490
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,895
Something I have to tell you,

491
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,972
something I should have told you
a long time ago.

492
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:50,436
I'm pregnant.

493
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,484
I'm giving it away.

494
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:03,962
It's for the best.

495
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,269
I wish...

496
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,292
I don't know how you did it--

497
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,346
raising me alone.

498
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:26,542
That must have been so hard,

499
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:30,126
and I was just...

500
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,209
awful...

501
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,171
So horrible to you.

502
00:37:45,576 --> 00:37:46,960
I'm so sorry, mum.

503
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:01,348
So sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car...

504
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:05,160
That...

505
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:07,930
I hated you...

506
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,224
and that I wished
you weren't my mother...

507
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:15,992
and that I wished you were dead.

508
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,483
It's all my fault--

509
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,981
the accident,

510
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,888
everything.

511
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,212
I'm so sorry, mom.

512
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,612
I'll see you soon, okay?

513
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:52,014
"To whom it may concern,

514
00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:55,733
"we are survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

515
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,937
"We have survived
on this island
for 80 days.

516
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,541
"We were six hours into the flight

517
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:06,256
"when the pilot said we were off course

518
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,204
"and turned back towards Fiji.

519
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:12,447
"We hit turbulence and crashed.

520
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:16,606
"We've been waiting here all this time--

521
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,829
"waiting for rescue that has not come.

522
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,818
"We do not know where we are.
We only know you have not found us.

523
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:29,467
"We've done our best
to live on this island.

524
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,679
"Some of us have come
to accept we may never leave it.

525
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:38,338
"Not all of us have survived
since the crash,

526
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,624
"but there is new life, too,

527
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,402
"and with it, there is hope.

528
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:46,784
"We are alive.

529
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,964
