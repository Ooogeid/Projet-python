1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,050
previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,350
how did you know my father?

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,230
He came to see his daughter.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,280
My daughter was on your plane.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,130
Her name was claire.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,940
We're here to geta blood sample
from you and one from your son aaron.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,710
Why?

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,450
To determine your
relationshipto the child.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,050
where you going, mommy?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,340
We're going on vacation, baby.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,390
Wait, you're in L.A.?

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,860
Of course I can meet, yeah.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,890
Hello, kate.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
you okay?

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,970
Get me to the car.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,710
- sayid, you've been attacked.
- Where's hurley?

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,960
The only wayto save the island,
john, is to get your people back here.

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,440
How? How am isupposed to do that?

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,830
- what?
- You've...

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,890
do you knowwhat's happening to me?

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,280
Charlotte? Charlotte?

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,490
Oh, you don't haveto whisper.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,000
When he's out, he's out.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,860
at least one of uscan sleep.

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,040
It's gonna takemore than two nights for
me to get usedto sleeping in a normal bed.

26
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,120
What are we gonna doabout him?

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,890
About aaron.

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,860
I don't know.

29
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,800
I've been thinking a lotabout him.

30
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,170
Did you know that clairewas flying
to L.A. To give him up for adoption?

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,440
No. No, I didn'T.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,370
I think we should sayhe's mine.

33
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,080
What?

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,530
We could say that I wassix months
pregnant when I was arrested

35
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,450
and that I ge birth to himon the
island. No one would ever know.

36
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,710
Kate, no. You don't have to...

37
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,030
there's other waystoo this.

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,370
After everyone we've
lost--michael, jin, sawyer...

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,450
I can't lose him, too.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,410
Sawyer's not dead.

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,900
No. But he's gone.

42
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,650
Good night, jack.

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,930
Kate...

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,100
if we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna
protectthe people that we left behind,

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,500
tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
haveto convince everyone to lie.

46
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,290
If it's just me,they're
never gonna go for it.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,820
So I'm gonnaturn to you first.

48
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,860
Are you with me?

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,620
I have always been with you.

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,750
<i>THREE YEARS LATER</i>

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,830
how does it fit?

52
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,510
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,780
Looks great on you.

54
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,760
are you sure you want to do this?

55
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,150
it was your idea.

56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Mommy!

57
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,240
Aaron, honey, mommy's
gonnarun out and do an errand.

58
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,510
I'll be right back. Okay?
And then we can go home.

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,870
don't worryabout us, kate.

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,380
There's candy in the minibarand
a hundred channels on tv.

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,110
We're going to bejust fine here.

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,210
Sun...

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,250
I don't know what I
would'vedone if you weren't here.

64
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,440
Thank you.

65
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,080
It's what any friendwould do.

66
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,220
Okay, well,I will be back soon.

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,120
Okay, you be good for sun. Okay, honey?

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,260
Good luck.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,820
delivery for you, ms. Kwon.

70
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,950
Thank you.

71
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,680
I'll be right back, honey.

Charlotte?

77
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,790
What the hell's wrong with her?
She's been out for ten minutes.

78
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,880
Stop shouting, james.

79
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,140
Hey, man.

80
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Thank you.

81
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,540
If there's something that you want to
tell me, daniel, now would be a good time.

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,030
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

83
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,550
She's asking if you know why
your girlfriend had a seizure.

84
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,870
Give us some space, would you?

85
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,520
She's like this 'cause
the sky keeps lighting up.

86
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,790
He knew this would happen and
he didn't say squat about it.

87
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,810
James... go away.

88
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,830
did you know that this would happen?

89
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,200
I thought... I thought it might.

90
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,540
I think it's neurological.

91
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,350
Our brains have an internal
clock, a sense of time.

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,210
The flashes... throw the clock off.

93
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,630
It's like really bad jet lag.

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,890
Really bad jet lag doesn't
make you hemorrhage, daniel.

95
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,050
You wanna tell me why it isn't
happening to the rest of us?

96
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,110
I don't know.

97
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,040
But thank god it's not.

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,260
thank you for waiting.

99
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,080
Did my assistant offer
you something to drink?

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,520
Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.

101
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,440
Good. Please, ms. Austen, sit.

102
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,980
So... how can I help you?

103
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:05,930
mr. Norton, when you came to mhouse looking
for blood samples from me and my son,

104
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,700
I asked you who your client was...

105
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,030
- and I said I couldn't tell you.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm here to offer you a deal.

107
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,450
I'll give you the blood samples, but
first, I wanna talk to your client.

108
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,770
Considering what you're asking
for, that's more than reasonable.

109
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,920
Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today,
and I will be sure to pass along your offer.

110
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,290
But I am pretty sure of what
the answer's gonna be-- no.

111
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,440
And the reason, of course, is that you're in
no position to be making any kind of deals,

112
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,430
and we both know it.

113
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,550
I have a signed court order compelling you to
let us confirm that you're the child's mother.

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,810
I could send the sheriff over there today and
make you do it, but my client insists that we...

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,110
handle the exchange of custody quietly.

116
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,500
What do you mean "exchange of custody"?

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,790
You know exactly what I mean.

118
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,380
No, I...mr. Norton,

119
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,850
I just wanna know who
is doing this to me.

120
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,340
You did this to yourself.

121
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,190
Now it is time you prepare
yourself, ms. Austen.

122
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,230
You are going to lose the boy.

123
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,940
We have to go back to the orchid.

124
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,520
Excuse me?

125
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,140
The orchid.

126
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,260
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

127
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,000
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

128
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,670
You said you had a zodiac
raft back at the beach.

129
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,980
We could take that, cut around the horn of
the island, be at the orchid in half the time.

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,160
And let me guess. You know exactly
what to do when we get there.

131
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,430
No, not exactly at all, but I know
that ben used it to leave the island.

132
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,810
And if I can do the same
thing, I believe I can save us.

133
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,720
And how you gonna do that?

134
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,580
This is all happeningbecause they left.

135
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,770
I think it'll stopif
I can bring them back.

136
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,390
- Bring who back?
- Jack, sun, sayid,hugo, kate.

137
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,880
The boat blew up, and that
chopper was probably on it.

138
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,020
They're not dead, james.

139
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,560
Says who?

140
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,700
That doesn't matter.

141
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,320
All that mattersis
they've gotta come back.

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,210
I have to make them come back...

143
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,550
even if it kills me.

144
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,490
Don't you want 'emto come back, james?

145
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Don't you want her to ce back?

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,730
It doesn't matterwhat I want.

147
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,280
She's waking up!

148
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,090
Are you okay?

149
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,850
- Who are you?
- It's me.

150
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
It's daniel.

151
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,050
Daniel.

152
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,490
oh, my head.

153
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,300
what happened?

154
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,720
There was another flash. You passed out.

155
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,790
How do you feel?

156
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,140
A bit dizzy, but...

157
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,950
- I'm fine.
- Good.

158
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,840
hooray. Everything's back to normal.

159
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,670
Now what?

160
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,790
I'll tell you "now what."

161
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,640
We're going to the orchid.

162
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,840
Oncologist on call to the I.C.U.

163
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,470
Dilation's almostback to normal.

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,790
Good. Now take this I.V.
Out of my arm, and let's go.

165
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,640
Sayid, you were unconsciousfor 42 hours.

166
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,880
You had the equivalent of threedoses
of horse tranquilizer in your system.

167
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,570
If you sent that man to hurley'shouse,

168
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,410
- we have to leave now.
- You need to relax.

169
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,080
Ben is not gonna hurt hurley.

170
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,270
Ben is on our side.

171
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,660
The only side he's onis his own.

172
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,540
Dr. Shephard?

173
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,980
I'm dr. Ariza,director
of clinical services.

174
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,010
A word with you, please?

What do you thinkyou are doing here?

177
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,490
I was treating a patient. I
apologize. It was an emergency.

178
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,490
you were suspendedon
charges of substance abuse.

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,660
Emergency or not, dr. Shephard,
you have no business being here.

180
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,740
I understand, and I take full
responsibilityfor my actions.

181
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,100
No, doctor. The hospital takes full
responsibility for your actions,

182
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,880
and that makes usliable for them.

183
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,060

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,270
I'm not letting youget

230
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,700
You have friends in trouble.

231
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,730
Let's get them to safety and
save the dirty linenfor later.

232
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,020
I'll drive.

233
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,070
After you get kate, meet us
atthe long beach marina, slip 23.

234
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,770
And, jack... hurry.

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,830

236
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,570

237
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Kate. What are you gonna say
to herto get her to come back?

238
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,660
I haven'tfigured that out yet.

239
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,060
Well, let metell you something.

240
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,660
She was pretty excited to hop on that
chopperand get the hell out of here.

241
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,610
What the hell is that?

242
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,800
Whatever it is,we
better stay clear of it.

243
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,300
Beach is this way.

244
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,030
Now you wanna takethe scenic route?

245
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,480
John... do you know when we are?

246
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,620
We need to keep moving.

247
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,220
How's your headache?

248
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,360
Better.

249
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,380
Nothing like sore feet to
takeyour mind off your head, eh?

250
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,810
well, don't worry.Once
we get to the beach,

251
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,400
we're gonna take the zodiac around
the other sideof the island and rest.

252
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,860
You're sweet, but you don't
needto baby me. I'm fine.

253
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,060
You okay?

254
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,590

255
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,330
Now what?

256
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,840

257
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,540

- I got this.

258
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,220
it knows I don't want it,and
I was gonna give it away.

259
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,900
Babies know that stuff.

260
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,960
Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen.

261
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,980
Do you want this baby?

262
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,680
Do you want itto be safe and healthy?

263
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,860
you're not alone in this. We are all
here for you. This baby is all of ours.

264
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,340
But I need you to push.

265
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,570
Okay?

266
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,090

What happened?

272
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,920
Did you see somethingout here, james?

273
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,850
Don't matter.

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,850
It's gone now.

275
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,550
you shaved your beard.

276
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,060
Yeah.

277
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
Just needed a change.

278
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,520
Look,jack,uh...

279
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,560
I don't know why you called,but I
can't be dealingwith this right now.

280
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,240
What's going on?

281
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,230
Nothing.

282
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,220
Just...

283
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,740
can you just go?

284
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,970
Why don't you just tell me?

285
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,220
Jack,please,just go.

286
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,330
Kate,please,tell me.

287
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,290
somebody wants aaron.

288
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,910
What?

289
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,730
There's a lawyer in there.

290
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,670
His clients--they
know we're lying.

291
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,990
They know I'm not his mom,and
they're gonna take him away.

292
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,330
Who's gonna take him away?

293
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,300
What--what
are you doing?

294
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,380
Look,I gotta go,all right?

295
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,210
Get in or don'T.

296
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,660
You ready to tell mewho
you saw back there?

297
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,860
Already told you.

298
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,040
It was nothin'.

299
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,890
You and I both know when
wwerebefore the flash,james.

300
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,370
So who was it you
saw?Charlie?Shannon?Yourself?

301
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,200
And how is it that you knew
when we were,johnny boy?

302
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,770
That light in the sky--it
wasfrom the hatch,wasn't it?

303
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,790
The night that boone died...

304
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,670
I went out there and started
pounding on itas hard as I could.

305
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,300
I was...

306
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,030
confused...

307
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,870
scared.

308
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,020
Babbling like an idiot,asking,why
was all thishappening to me?

309
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,460
Did you get an answer?

310
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,860
Light came on,shot up into the sky.

311
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,260
At the time,I thoughtit meant something.

312
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,320
- Did it?
- No.

313
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,590
It was just a light.

314
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,870
So why'd youturn us around then?

315
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,210
Don't you wannago back there?

316
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,420
Why would I wanna do that?

317
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,580
So you could tell yourselfto do things
different,save yourselfa world of pain.

318
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,140
No,I needed that painto
get to where I am now.

319
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,190
I just got a nosebleed.

320
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,530
What?

321
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,200
When?

322
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,820
Let's just notfreak out the others,okay?

323
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,210
Just tell me...

324
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,810
why--why
her?Why me?

325
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,670
I don't know.

326
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,830
Uh,I think it mighthave something
to do with duration of exposure.

327
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,850
You know,the amount of
timeyou'vepent on the island.

328
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,630
Doesn't make any sense.

329
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,910
Those yahooshave been here for months.

330
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,010
I've never been here
before two weeks ago.

331
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,740
Are you sure about that?

332
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,410
hello?

333
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,300
the camp's bac finally.

334
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,610
Anybody for a dharma beer?

335
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,840
Hello?

336
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,190
Anybody here?

337
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,160
Rose?Bernard?

338
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,000
I wonder how long agothis happened.

339
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,940
Son of a bitch!

340
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,840
What is it?

341
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,360
It's vincent'S.

342
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
Yeah?Well,where's the rest of the dog?

343
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,340
Where's the restof our people?

344
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,660
The zodiac's gone,too.

345
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,100
Maybe your peopletook the boat.

346
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,790
Why the hellwould they do that?

347
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,990
To get awayfrom whoever came in those.

348
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,240
where did these come from?

349
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,700
That's a good question.

350
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,270
They're pretty old.

351
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,370
Not that old.

352
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,630
Let me see that.

353
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,000

"Adg-uh-ruh"?

354
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,910
Ajira.It's an airline.

355
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,980
It's based out of india,but
they fly everywhere.

356
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,930
Great.Maybe they got a flightout
of here to vegas tonight.

357
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,140
Who came in these?

358
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,110
Other others?

359
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,180
Don't look at me.

360
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,120
My question is,when
are they coming back?

361
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,130
Let's not wait to find out.

362
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,560
this plan soundeda hell of a lot
better when we weregoing by motorboat.

363
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,590
How far is this place?

364
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,480
It's around that point.

365
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,900
Not more than a couple hours.

366
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,870
oh,joy.

367
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,120
You all right?

368
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,860
I saw kate.

369
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,170
What?

370
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,930
Last night,in the jungle.

371
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,070
Before the last flash.

372
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,700
She was deliveringclaire's baby.

373
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,370
But that was two months ago.

374
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,520
Time travel's a bitch.

375
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,530
get down!

376
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,080
paddle!

377
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,940
I think they want their boat back!

378
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,830
Move!

379
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,550
these your people?

380
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,850
No!Are they yours?

381
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,450
Shut up and keeping paddling!

382
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,220
little help!

383
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,670
Little help!

384
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,860
paddle harder!

385
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,900
They're getting closer!

386
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,360
thank you,lord!

387
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,100
I take that back!

388
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,500
Everybody,paddle!

389
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,330
Head for the shore!

390
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,110
kate,just because the guy told you that he wasmeeting
his client doesn't meanthat they're here in L.A.

391
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,330
He could've just told you
that to--to throw you off.

392
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,230
Or they're in that hotelright now.

393
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,310
Okay.

394
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,270
And what if they are?

395
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,030
What if the personwho wants to take aaron
is sittingin that hotel room right now?

396
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,300
Then what?

397
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,090
Come on.

398
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,080
Come with me.

399
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,120
We'll--we'll go get aaron,we'll put our
heads together,and we'll figure something out.

400
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,210
All right.

401
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh,my god.

402
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,120
it's claire's mother.

403
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,840
Wait.

404
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,060
What am I waiting for,jack?

405
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,780
Wait.I just...

406
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,090
- let's just think about this for a minute.
- She knows.

407
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,520
Maybe she doesn't know.

408
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,750
No,but she knows about aaron,and
that's all that matters!

409
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,660
t mego talk to her.

410
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,610
What?

411
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,980
If I can just explain to herwhy we did it--
maybe if I can get herto understand why...

412
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,040
she'll listen to me.

413
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,480
I can fix this,kate.

414
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,720
I can fix it.

415
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,220
Aaron is my family,too.

416
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,650
dr. Shephard?

417
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,080
Hello,ms.Littleton.

418
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,770
may I come in?

419
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,680
Of course.

420
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,140
you look drenched.

421
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,990
No,no.

422
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,430
No,I'm fine.

423
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:55,320
God,I haven't seen yousince
your father's funeral.

424
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,020
How did you even knowI was here?

425
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,340
I knew you were here,ms.Littleton,

426
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,950
because I followedyour lawyer.

427
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,560
Why would you do that?

428
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,770
I'm--I did it
because,um...

429
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,410
I understand thatyou
feel the need to do this.

430
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,190
But I need you to know that everything
that kate and ihave done--it was for aaron.

431
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,120
Who'S...

432
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,470
aaron?

433
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,950
I-I'm afraidI'm not following you.

434
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,500
Ms.Littleton,um...

435
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,250
what are you doing herein los angeles?

436
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,870
let's go.

437
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,870
Drive.

438
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,510
Then call sun and tell her to
bring aaronto the long beach marina.

439
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,730
We'll meet her there.

440
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,570
What--wh-whaare
youtalking about?

441
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,530
- What happened?
- Kate,we have to go now.

442
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,030
I'm not going anywhere
untilyotell me what just happened!

443
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,320
She doesn't know anything.

444
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,730
What?

445
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,480
She doesn't know.

446
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,500
She still thinksthat claire is dead.

447
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,780
she doesn't even knowthat aaron exists.

448
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,850
But the lawyer--she sued oceanic,and
she's in town to pick up her settlement.

449
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,210
What,and it's justa coincidence that her lawyer
happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?

450
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,070
I don't know.

451
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,730
But whoever's tryingto take aaron...

452
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,090
it's not her.

453
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,380
Then who is it?

454
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,530
Can I ask you something?

455
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,450
Why'd you take it upon
yourselfto rescue hugo?

456
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,740
I had to make surehurley was safe.

457
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,150
You can pull in over here.

458
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,640
mr. Linus.

459
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,060
Mr. Norton.

460
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,760
I looked into it,and they don't have
any kindof solid case against reyes.

461
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:22,560
The M.E.Said that the manfound outside
santa rosa was killed before reyes escaped.

462
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,860
That's very good news.

463
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,230
We have a prelim hearingin the morning.

464
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,420
The judge will neverlet it get past
that,and reyeswill be a free man.

465
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,200
Thank you,dan.

466
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,960
Anytime.

467
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,820
Who was that?

468
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,580
That's my lawyer.

469
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Okay!

470
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,610
remind menever to dthat again.

471
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,430
Where are we?

472
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,140
It's hard to saytill it gets light.

473
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,160
we didn't get a chanceto
finish our conversation.

474
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,380
What conversation was that?

475
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,160
The one beforethey
started shooting at us,

476
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,020
where you were about to tell
mehow it felt to see kate again.

477
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,930
I wasn't aboutto tell you anything.

478
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,830
why don't you tell me now?

479
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,140
I was close enoughto touch her.

480
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,290
If I wanted to,I could've...

481
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,730
stood right upand talked to her.

482
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,420
Why didn't you?

483
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,460
What's done is done.

484
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,020
Juliet?

485
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,360
What's wrong?

486
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,320
oi!

487
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,870
Come and look at this!

488
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,960
It's wreckage.

489
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,330
Looks like it just happened.

490
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,970
anybody speak french?

491
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,590
jack,why did you call me today?

492
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,610
I told you.I S...

493
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,060
I was worried.

494
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,470
But why?

495
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,320
Why wereyou worried?

496
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,330
Why today?

497
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,300
I don'T...

498
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,690
right before I called
you,sayid was attacked.

499
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,840
And the guy that did it--your
address was in his pocket.

500
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,900
Sayid?

501
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,970
What's he doing here?

502
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,470
That's not importantright now.

503
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,140
What matters is that we getyou
and aaron someplace safe.

504
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,520
safe from who?

505
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,910
hello,kate.

506
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,860
it's okay.

507
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,730
He's with me.

508
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,580
He's with you?

509
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:46,060
I know this is gonnabe hard to
understand,but he's here to help us.

510
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,410
To help everyonethat we left behind.

511
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,740
We all need to be together again.

512
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,560
It's him.

513
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,550
What?

514
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,680
It's him.

515
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
He's the one who's trying to take aaron.

516
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,140
No.No.

517
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,110
- You-- you don't understand.No,jack.-
She's right.It was me.

518
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,250
Sorry.

519
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,340
Who the helldo you think you are?

520
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,890
Why don't youjust stay away?

521
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,150
Why don't youleave me and my son alone?

522
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,360
Because he's not your son,kate.

523
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,570
robert...ça va?

524
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,070
no understand.

525
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,250
you speak english?

526
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,170
little.

527
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,950
Are you okay?

528
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
Yes.

529
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,000
How did you get here?
