1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,740
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,030
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,930
Yes! yes, I can hear you.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,030
Hey, are you on a boat? what--what boat?

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,070
Your boat. I'm not on a boat.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,670
Uh, na-Naomi, the parachutist.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,340
Who? who's Naomi?

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,850
I've got it. I've got a signal! it's gonna work.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,010
It's happening. we're gonna get off of this island.

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,410
Is Desmond there?

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,690
Penny!

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,990
No!

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,160
I'm telling you,

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,190
Making that call is the beginning of the end.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,880
Who is this? who is this?

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,770
I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815.

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,470
Can you get a fix on our location?

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,450
Sit tight. we'll be right there.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,240
It's almost 30 minutes now

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,750
Since the start of this high-speed chase.

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,570
We still have no information

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,630
About who's driving this vehicle.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,470
Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,770
Ruth, we're hearing reports that the pursuit began

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,170
Near the La Brea Area,

27
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
Then traveled through a warehousing district

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,930
South of the 10 freeway. can you see how many people are in the car?

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,680
It appears to be just the one-- the driver.

30
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,690
We're not sure if that's the owner of the car.

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,450
What you're seeing here

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,150
Are pictures of the 10 freeway south of downtown.

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,030
Is that a Camaro, Jeff?

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,120
Yes, it looks like a vintage, early '70s model.

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,640
Damn it.

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,040
Show us your hands!

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,150
Roll down the window and show us your hands now!

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
Now slowly open the door with your left hand.

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,470
Get out of the car!

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
Turn around... slow!

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,500
On the ground!

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,100
Now!

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,120
Stop!

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,750
Don't you know who I am?! stop! wait!

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,240
Don't you know who I am?! I'm one of the oceanic six!

46
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,690
I'm one of the oceanic six!

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,650
So five mimutes before you let ten cruiser on a chase across the city

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,020
you're minding your own business In a convenience store,

49
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,070
Until you see something and freak out.

50
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,680
Mr. Reyes, why'd you run like that?

51
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,820
Who'd you see in there?

52
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,660
Listen, buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store

53
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,460
That made you run away and go on a high-speed-- I wasn't running away 

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,760
from anyone.

55
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,060
If you think I care that you're a celebrity,

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,900
You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighborhood.

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,290
I'm not a celebrity.

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
Is that why you kept shouting,

59
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,870
"hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"?

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,920
You wanna know a funny coincidence?

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,150
Sure.

62
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,690
I knew somebody on your plane.

63
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,530
Really?

64
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,130
Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez.

65
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,730
She was my partner before I made detective--

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,300
Dark hair...

67
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,080
Gorgeous.

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,460
Maybe you knew her.

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,750
Maybe you met her on the plane...

70
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,910
Before it took off?

71
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,530
Sorry. never met her.

72
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,240
Why don't you watch the tape?

73
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,520
Maybe it'll spark something.

74
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm gonna get a doughnut.

75
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,550
You want one?

76
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,410
No, thanks.

77
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,740
And when I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.

79
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,840
Help!

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
Help!

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,890
Help! let me out!

82
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,420
What the hell is wrong with you?

83
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,320
What are you doing, Reyes?

84
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,440
Huh? you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse?

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,480
Because if that's what you want,

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,850
I can make that happen right now, my friend. you can?

87
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,240
Oh, thank you!

88
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,760
Thank you. thank you.

89
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Jack? you there, dude?

90
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,710
Beach to Jack.

91
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,640
Right here, Hurley. what's up?

92
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,810
Hey, uh, did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?

93
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat.

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,880
They're on their way to pick us up right now. seriously? it worked?

95
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,830
Seriously. we're all on the way back to the beach right now,

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,620
So you better pack your bags, buddy.

97
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,440
Dude, that's great!

99
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,140
Any luck?

100
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,770
Nothing. no sign of him.

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,680
It's like he just disappeared.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,430
Why would Locke kill her? he hadn't even met her-- because he's crazy.

103
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,870
So what if he comes back?

104
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,550
If he comes back, I'm gonna kill him.

105
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm gonna get everybody together.

106
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,340
The sooner we get back to the beach, the better.

107
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,600
Are we really going home?

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,850
Yeah, we're really going home.

109
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,350
I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby

110
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,690
In a hospital.

111
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,820
Oh, rub it in, why don't you? oh, no.

112
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,570
You ladies need a hand? no, we're just wrapping things up, thanks.

113
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,410
You know, you must be very proud of Bernard.

114
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,040
I hear he's quite the hero.

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,770
Look, everyone up here knows

116
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,180
That the real hero is your man, claire.

117
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,140
If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be

118
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,500
Getting a busy signal on that fancy phone.

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,270
So you better make sure you treat him real good

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,050
When we get back.

121
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,560
Rose!

122
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay, thanks. I have enough.

123
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,720
I need you to do me a favor.

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,140
I need you to take Alex

125
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,220
And get as far from here as possible.

126
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,080
What? listen to me. we don't have time for this.

127
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,510
Everyone who stays here is going to die.

128
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,890
Now get Alex and get away right now.

129
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,380
I don't care where you go. just go.

130
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,600
I will not have my daughter--

131
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,590
She's not your daughter.

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,860
Did I ever tell you I won the lottery?

133
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,870
I got, like, $150 million.

134
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,940
Worst thing that ever happened to me.

135
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,240
Oh, yeah, who needs $150 million, right?

136
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,330
Now it'll all be gone, cause they all think I'm dead.

137
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,080
When we get rescued,

138
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,520
And I go back...

139
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm gonna be free.

140
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,300
I wanna do a cannonball.

141
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,120
I've been walking up and down this beach every day

142
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,780
And looking out at this water,

143
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,670
And I wanna do a cannonball.

144
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,450
Hurley...

145
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,240
You wanna do a cannonball,

146
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,040
Cannonball.

147
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,790
Are you all right, Desmond?

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,220
We need to get to Jack.

149
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,780
We can't let him get in touch with that boat.

150
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,570
Easy, Scotty. everything's cool. boat's on the way. what? on the way? no.

151
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,970
Hey, where's Charlie? no, that woman--Naomi-- she lied.

152
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,660
Look, the people on the boat aren't who they say they are! what?

153
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,720
Then who are they? Desmond, where's Charlie?

154
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,660
Desmond-- I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack now!

155
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,630
It's all right. we can call him. we have a walkie. it's okay. well,

156
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,490
where is it? get it.

157
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,240
What do you mean the people aren't who they say-- where's Charlie?!

158
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm--i'm--i'm sorry, brother. i...

159
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,840
You think that's our ride?

160
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,610
Hello?

161
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,570
Hey, Jack. this is George Minkowski.

162
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,480
We're trying to get a lock on your signal there,

163
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,530
But we're getting some rf interference.

164
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,240
We're gonna need to rejigger some of the settings

165
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,440
On your sat-phone.

166
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,020
Uh, sure. okay. just tell me what I gotta do.

167
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,890
How about you put Naomi on?

168
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,790
Naomi went to get some firewood.

169
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,370
Can you hold on for a second? let me see if I can...

170
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,950
Where is she?

171
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,140
I don't know.

172
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,360
Look, we gotta call the doc.

173
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,540
Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand--

174
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,270
Look, I'm sorry he's dead, but I don't even know

175
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,310
What the hell "not Penny's boat" means. calling Jack accomplishes nothing.

176
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,740
It would accomplish warning him.

177
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,380
it also means warning the people on the freighter

178
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,800
That we're suspicious of them. I have no doubt they're

179
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,330
Monitoring our communications. if we call Jack-- you know what?

180
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,140
I got the walkie. I'm making the call. hey!

182
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,690
We better get goin'.

183
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,810
Going where?!

184
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,590
I found blood--the girl's trail. probably crawled away.

185
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,280
Can't be more than ten minutes ahead of us.

186
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,540
We should go now and find her. we're taking him with us.

187
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,120
And why would we do that?

188
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,510
Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.

189
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,630
All right, listen up.

190
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,710
I need all of you to head back down to the beach,

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,070
And when these people show up, we wanna make sure

192
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,580
That we're real easy for them to find, okay?

193
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,120
You look worried, Jack.

194
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,940
The only thing I'm worried about

195
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,400
Is missing our ride home.

196
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,000
I found her trail. she's headed west across the island.

197
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,500
Rousseau already found it. we're going after her right now.

198
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,860
What? are you sure it's hers?

199
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,070
Unless someone else is bleeding.

200
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,210
Okay, but if she didn't want us to find her,

201
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,990
Then she could've created a dummy trail.

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,340
I think we should follow both just in c-- Kate, six hours from now,

203
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,750
We're gonna be sitting

204
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,050
Laughing about the fact that there was one final thing

205
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,960
That we couldn't agree upon.

206
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,900
Naomi is hurt. she ran into the jungle.

207
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,000
She's not thinking about leaving fake trails.

208
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,590
You're right.

209
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,840
I'll track her down.

210
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,140
Why don't you get everybody back to the beach? you got it.

211
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,710
Be careful, okay?

212
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,810
What the hell's gotten into you, Hugo?

213
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,010
They'll all be back in the morning. if we just wait--

214
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,780
You don't wait with warnings. you... warn.

215
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,240
Here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.

216
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,500
You almost got me that time.

217
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,130
How about best out of seven?

218
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,160
Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Oh, by the way,

220
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,100
You have a visitor.

221
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,190
Mr. Reyes.

222
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,270
Hello. my name is Matthew Abbadon.

223
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,050
I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines.

224
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,150
Can we talk for a few minutes?

225
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,640
Okay.

226
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,430
I'm here, mr. Reyes,

227
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,540
Because we've heard about your recent... episode.

228
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,080
Your arrest, your incarceration here--

229
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,350
Frankly, we feel terrible about it.

230
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,090
So on behalf of oceanic,

231
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,600
I'd like to extend you an invitation

232
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,160
For a little upgrade.

233
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,760
What... kind of upgrade?

234
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,750
To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls,

235
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,680
Where you'd have your own bathroom.

236
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,630
You can see the ocean from-- I don't wanna see the ocean.

237
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,340
No problem.

238
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,150
Actually, thanks.

239
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm... I'm fine right here.

240
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,070
Are you fine, mr. Reyes?

241
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,460
What do you mean?

242
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,520
You're in a mental institution.

243
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,980
Who'd you say you were again?

244
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,750
I'd like to see a business card.

245
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,580
I must have left them at home.

246
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Then we're done, dude.

247
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,940
Are they still alive?

248
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,480
What?

249
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,620
You heard me.

250
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,020
Nurse! nurse! get out of here!

251
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,150
You better get outta here! help me! help me!

252
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,910
He's after me. easy.

253
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,930
No, no, no, no. that guy's after me! help me! okay, okay.

254
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,360
You all right there, Hugo?

255
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,030
Yeah, dude, I'm fine.

256
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,020
You wanna talk about it?

257
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,370
Talk about what?

258
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,800
Charlie.

259
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,330
I mean...

260
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,840
You two were buddies. I just thought...

261
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,810
We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.

262
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm gonna head up and tell them to slow down a little.

263
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,750
I can keep up.

264
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,280
All right, ese.

265
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,800
Just... holler if you need me.

266
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,450
Guys?

267
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,350
Guys!

268
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,000
Guys!

269
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,180
Guys!

270
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,950
Guys!

272
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,690
The blood trail ends here.

273
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,020
What do you mean?

274
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,020
It ends.

275
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,150
What, are you telling me that she stopped bleeding here?

276
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,740
No, I'm telling you that she fooled us and doubled back.

277
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,170
Better call the boat,

278
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,500
Tell 'em she's getting a really big bundle of firewood.

279
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Where is it?

280
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,830
Okay, I probably should have told you

281
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,810
That I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack.

282
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,500
I owed you one. what are you talking about?

283
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,760
Kate took it when she hugged you.

284
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,770
She found the right trail, too, but you wouldn't listen to her,

285
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,420
So I guess she's taken matters into her own hands.

286
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,830
But look on the bright side. at least

287
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,220
Somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.

288
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,150
Hello?

289
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
Who's this?

290
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,330
Uh, this is Kate.

291
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,600
You with Jack?

292
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,460
No, no, he's not here. where's Naomi?

293
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,460
Uh, we're looking for her.

294
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,670
What do you mean, you're looking for her?

295
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,250
Give me the phone.

296
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,860
Give me the phone.

297
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,880
Naomi, listen to me. you're hurt. let me help you.

298
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,110
Help me? I just spent the last three days

299
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,130
Trying to get you people rescued,

300
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,730
And you throw this knife in my back.

301
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,390
No, that was not us.

302
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,690
Who?

303
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,080
His name is John Locke. what?

304
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,460
He said that you weren't who you said you were.

305
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,890
I swear to god we would never hurt you. you know us.

306
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,140
Please, we need your help. please help us.

307
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,770
Give me the phone.

308
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,170
George, it's Naomi.

309
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,740
Naomi, where have you been?

310
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,770
What's going on over there?

311
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,870
I had an accident.

312
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm hurt.

313
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,490
What? a-an accident? what--what--what accident?

314
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,840
What happened?

315
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,670
Naomi!

316
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,970
Hello?

317
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,450
Hello?

318
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,320
I hit a tree branch

319
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,330
When I parachuted in.

320
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,490
Took it through my gut.

321
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,840
Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?

322
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,940
I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me

323
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,930
Till I could talk to you myself. we've lost our signal,

324
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,620
and we can't come get you.

325
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,660
Can you change your tracking frequency?

326
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,860
Yeah.

327
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,340
Try it now.

328
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,720
Clear as a bell. hang on, Naomi.

329
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,470
We'll--we'll get you back here asap, okay?

330
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,480
I'm sorry, George.

331
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,140
Just tell my sister that I love her.

332
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,990
Hello?

333
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,930
Help!

334
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,050
Help!

335
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,810
Help!

336
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,490
There's nothing here.

337
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,960
There's nothing here. there's nothing here.

338
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,940
There's nothing here.

341
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,370
Hello, Hugo.

342
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,680
You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo.

343
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,610
How did you get separated from the group?

345
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,680
I just...

346
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,050
Fell behind, I guess.

347
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,720
Is that why you were shouting for help?

348
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,440
Well, I got scared.

349
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,640
What Desmond said happened down in that station--

350
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,720
"not Penny's boat"...

351
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,100
Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?

352
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,150
Jack should never have called those people.

353
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
I couldn't agree more.

354
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,470
It's gonna be hard to...

355
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,000
Talk him into thinking they're not coming here

356
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,070
To rescue us.

357
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,480
Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo,

358
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,270
Because if we

359
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,060
Can't talk him out of it...

360
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,740
Then Charlie died for nothing.

361
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,470
Where the hell you been, Hugo?

362
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,790
Sorry. I was just, uh, I got lost.

363
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,450
What are you doing here?

364
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,120
I came here for the same reason you did--to warn Jack

365
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,770
About the people on that boat.

366
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,740
I already gave it a shot,

367
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,450
But I figured I might have better luck with some support.

368
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,540
You want my support?

369
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,160
You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.

370
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,420
Jin-Soo Kwon

371
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,720
Still in one piece.

372
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,380
Rambo. ow.

373
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,860
I'll tell her.

374
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,180
He's dead.

375
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,170
Charlie's... dead.

376
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,360
No.

377
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,960
I'd watch out if I were you.

378
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,890
What are you talking about, dude?

379
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,110
There's a guy over there. he's staring at you.

380
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,890
What guy? that guy.

381
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,640
Hey, man.

382
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,830
Don't run.

383
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,890
Hurley.

384
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,350
Just...

385
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,670
Just... sit down.

386
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,420
I wanna talk to you.

387
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,230
Come on. don't do what you did in the store.

388
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,540
Okay?

389
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,630
There's no need to... freak out.

390
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,630
No need to freak out?

391
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushee,

392
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,410
And suddenly you're standing there over by the ho hos.

393
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,680
You're dead. what do you expect me to do?

394
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,430
Can we just... sit down?

395
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,150
I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead,

396
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,190
And I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.

397
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,110
I am dead.

398
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,220
But I'm also here.

399
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,450
Okay, prove it.

400
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,640
Okay. okay.

401
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,750
Did you know you were going to die

402
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,140
When you swam out there?

403
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,930
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,320
Because you would have tried to stop me.

405
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,920
And since I was gonna do it anyway,

406
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,230
I thought I would spare you all the drama.

407
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,160
And now you have to do something.

408
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,300
But you're hiding from it.

409
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,850
That's the real reason you ran

410
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,560
When you saw me in the store.

411
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,970
You knew I was here to tell you--

412
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,510
No, I'm not listening to this.

413
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,300
No, cause you're not here.

414
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,040
I am here. you're being a baby.

415
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,530
I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five,

416
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,510
And when I open 'em, you'll be gone. I am here.

417
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,170
One... don't do this.

418
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,590
Two... they need you.

419
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
Three... they need you, Hugo.

420
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,240
Four! you know they need you.

421
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,680
Five!

422
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,070
What... what happened?

423
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,700
I mean, how-- how did he...

424
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,350
He was trying to help us.

425
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,050
Jack.

426
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,640
You're not gonna shoot me, Jack...

427
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,860
Any more than I was gonna shoot...

428
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,460
It's not loaded.

429
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,200
Let's do it!

430
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,400
Do you know what he did? yes, I know what he did!

431
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,670
All I did...

432
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,210
All I have ever done...

433
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,590
Has been in the best interest of all of us.

434
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
Are you insane?!

435
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,120
I know i... I have a lot of explaining to do.

436
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,060
But I never did anything to hurt any of you.

437
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,590
I even risked my life to tell you that there was

438
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,730
A traitor in your midst. she helped us, John.

439
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,690
All you ever did was blow up every chance we had

440
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,260
Of getting off this island. you killed Naomi!

441
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,160
Well, technically, he didn't kill her yet.

442
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,780
Yes, he did.

443
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
She just died.

444
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,970
She didn't give you up, John.

445
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,480
She covered for us,

446
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,940
And she fixed this. they're on their way.

447
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,680
She didn't cover for anyone.

448
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,690
She wants her people to come here.

449
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,690
And trust me, when they do,

450
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,390
We had better be far away from here.

451
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,500
I'm going to the barracks. the others abandoned them.

452
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,550
It's the only place on the island with any form

453
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,870
Of security right now. it'll have to do

454
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,490
Until I can think of something else.

455
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,020
Until then, if you want to live, you need to come with me.

456
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,610
No one's going anywhere with you, John,

457
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,810
Because they're not crazy. he's not crazy.

458
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,030
What about Charlie?

459
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,110
Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued.

460
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,540
And whatever he did down there...

461
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,320
It worked.

462
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,280
But then something must've happened.

463
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,690
He must have heard something before he...

464
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,350
I don't know why,

465
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,580
But it changed his mind.

466
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,340
Because the last thing he did

467
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Was to warn us

468
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,750
That the people on that boat are not who they said they were.

469
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,880
So I'm not listening to you.

470
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,410
I'm listening to my friend.

471
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,850
I'm listening to Charlie.

472
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,890
Anyone else?

473
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,930
There isn't much time.

474
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,130
Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.

475
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,660
He's all yours.

476
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,090
You said we'd never leave the island.

477
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,330
If you, uh,

478
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,250
You wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind ya.

479
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,820
I'm not going anywhere with that man.

480
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,450
What are you doing?

481
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,450
Same thing I've always done, Kate...

482
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,190
Survivin'.

483
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,110
You know where to find us when you change your mind.

484
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,910
You ever miss?

485
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,460
Jack.

486
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,250
Yeah. I was, uh, on my way back from a consult.

487
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,880
Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit.

488
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,410
Horse?

489
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,670
You're on.

490
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,090
So... consult, huh?

491
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,190
Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?

492
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,520
Yeah.

493
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,390
"h."

494
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,330
Reporters leaving you alone?

495
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,350
Yeah. still have to sign some autographs

496
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,810
When I go out for coffee, but...

497
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,880
Thinking about growing a beard.

498
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,210
You'd look weird with a beard, dude.

499
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,110
That's h-o.

500
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,970
So...

501
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,000
What are you really doing here, Jack?

502
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,130
I was just checking on you,

503
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,840
Seeing if everything was okay.

504
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,820
You're checking to see if I went nuts,

505
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,750
If I was gonna tell.

506
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,690
Are you?

507
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,570
You're up.

508
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,760
Nah, you win. i, uh...

509
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,480
I gotta run.

510
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,040
It was great seeing you, Hurley.

511
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,670
I'm sorry.

512
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm sorry I went with Locke.

513
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,830
I should've stayed with you.

514
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,700
It's water under the bridge, man.

515
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
I don't think we did the right thing, Jack.

516
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,190
I think it wants us to come back. Hurley...

517
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,880
And it's gonna do everything it can-- we're never going back.

518
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,980
Never say never, dude.

519
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,430
Are you thinking of Charlie?

520
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,300
Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together.

521
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,350
How did this happen?

522
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,950
Thunder's getting louder.

523
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,590
That's not thunder.

524
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,240
Come on.

525
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,030
Come on.

526
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,610
Are you Jack?
