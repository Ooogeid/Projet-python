1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,060
Previously on "lost".

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,900
I put sayid and desmond
on that chopper.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,870
It was my call.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm going after it whether
they're on it or not.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,440
Oh, my god.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,590
Lapidus!

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,420
Yeah!

8
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,650
Where'd they go?

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,400
They're up by some greenhouse,
perched up there, waitin' to stch linus.

10
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:21,010
If you can move the island
whenever you wanted,

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,010
why didn't you just move it befo
the psychos with guns got here?

12
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:25,830
It's a measure of last resort.

13
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:27,010
You're gonna go into
that greenhouse.

14
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,633
The elevator takes you down
to the actual orchid station.

15
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,183
I'm sorry, man, but maybe I missed
the part where you explained

16
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,593
what I'm supposed to do
about the armed men inside.

17
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:37,160
How many times do I
have to tell you, john?

18
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,181
I always have a plan.

19
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:42,231
These aren't jack or sawyer.

20
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,592
Whoever you are, come out now!

21
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,861
My name is benjamin linus.

22
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,163
I believe you're
looking for me.

23
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:57,951
Ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of oceanic 8-1-5.

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,970
Is it possible there
are any other survivors

25
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,053
from the crash yet
to be discovered?

26
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:06,651
No, absolutely not.

27
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:16,713
Why did you call me, jack?

28
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:22,800
I was hoping that you'd heard,
that maybe you'd go to the funeral.

29
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,090
Why would I go to the funeral?

30
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:29,063
- This is not gonna change...
- no,I'm sick.

31
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:30,572
Of lying.

32
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,092
I have to go.

33
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:34,400
- He's gonna be wondering where I am...
- don'T.

34
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:40,311
We were not supposed to leave.

35
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,113
Yes, we were.

36
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:45,980
Good-bye, jack.

37
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,071
We have to go back, kate.

38
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,121
We have to go back!

39
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,570
"we have to go back"?

40
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:28,223
"We have to go back"?

41
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,763
- Now hold on...
- who you think you are?

42
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:35,652
You call me over and over again for two
days straight, stoned on your pills!

43
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:40,030
And then you show up here with
an obituary for jeremy bentham.

44
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:47,601
When he came to me and I heard what
he had to say, I knew he was crazy.

45
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,123
But you.

46
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,812
You believed him.

47
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:51,641
Yes.

48
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,983
Him, of all people.

49
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,341
Yes, kate, I did, because he
said that that was the only way

50
00:02:56,405 --> 00:03:00,432
that I could keep you safe...
you and aaron.

51
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:06,990
Don't you say his name.

52
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:13,452
I still have to explain to him why
you are not there to read to him,

53
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:17,090
so don't you say his name!

54
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,173
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:29,891
I've spent the last three years trying
tforget all the horrible things

56
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,340
that happened on the
day that we left.

57
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:40,731
How dare you ask me to go back?

58
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,081
You sure we're
going the right way?

59
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,192
Lapidus said they were
headed northeast.

60
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:18,810
You might wanna
slow down a little,

61
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,260
'cause you look like you're
about to keel over, doc.

62
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:20,962
I'm fine.

63
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:21,870
Of course you're fine.

64
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,113
You're always fine.

65
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,590
Is this it?

66
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,862
I don't know.

67
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:34,662
So what's the plan, sundance?

68
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,952
The plan is we wait till...

69
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,692
- hugo?
- Sawyer!

70
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:49,830
You all right?

71
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:50,892
Dude, you came back.

72
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,091
How'd you know where I was?

73
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:00,060
It's good to see you, hurley.

74
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,421
Yeah.

75
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,351
Yeah, man. You, too.

76
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,853
So where the hell is he?

77
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,903
Locke!

78
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,240
Hello, jack.

79
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:59,321
There's enough c4 here to blow
up a bloody aircraft carrier.

80
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,773
When I was in the army.

81
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:11,003
I did six months explosive ordnance
disposal, whh, as the saying goes,

82
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,931
is just enough time to
lea how to bloyourself up.

83
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,711
Is it on a timer?

84
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,493
And why hasn't it gone off et?

85
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,503
This is a-a radio
receiver. It'S.

86
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,243
It's like a walkie-talkie.

87
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,543
You send it a signal, and, uh.

88
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:26,821
It... It triggers
the bomb remotely.

89
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,413
So can we.

90
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,803
Turn off?

91
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,450
This is A.

92
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,800
This is a trip wire.

93
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,031
Move it, and.

94
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:41,573
Boom.

95
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,081
This is dummy wiring.

96
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:44,642
If you cut the wrong one.

97
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:48,352
Boom this is multiple
firing systems.

98
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:50,610
You disable one, the next one.

99
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,531
Boom.

100
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:54,330
Um, this.

101
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:56,422
Battery's the power source.

102
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,310
- If you disconnect it.
- boom.

106
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,072
What are you doing in here?

107
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:30,413
There's a-a dharma station below us,
and, um, I'm looking for a way to
get in.

108
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,670
Get in and do what?

109
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,701
Hugo, james,
would you mind if I spoke to jack alone?

110
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:38,830
Don't bother.

111
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:40,261
We just came back for hurley.

112
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,881
Let's go.

113
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:43,463
Jack, you need to hear
what I have to say...

114
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,180
No, what I need to do is to
walk back to the chopper,

115
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,553
get on it, and get the rest of
our people off this island.

116
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:54,212
Uh, dude,
probably not the best idea righnoW.

117
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,343
Those rambo guys are taking
ben to that helicopter.

118
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:59,172
He surrendered himself to
'em about an hour ago.

119
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,450
Now why the hell
would he do that?

120
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,190
So tell me something, ben.

121
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:21,133
What is it that makes
you so important, hmm?

122
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,973
I'm curious.

123
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:28,883
I'm curious as to why

124
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,743
Mr. Widmore would pay me so much
money just to come out here

125
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:36,632
and capture you and
bring you back alive.

126
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:41,242
Charles widmore tell
you to kill my daughter?

127
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,242
How'd he get the toolbox?

128
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,963
Damn.

129
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:57,960
Who gave you the
toolbox, frank?

130
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,703
Well...

131
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:09,270
You're good right there.

132
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,000
Who are you?

133
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:15,420
I'm kate.

134
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,312
I'm one of the passengers
of flight 815.

135
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,740
Why are you running?

136
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,152
I'm being chased.

137
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,702
By his people.

138
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,071
Kocol.

139
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:29,153
Lacour.

140
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:31,443
Redfern on flank.

141
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,452
Come here.

142
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:37,821
Get on your knees.

143
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:41,590
Hands above your heads,
both of you.

144
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,500
Now! Spray it!

145
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,030
Ben, stay close.

146
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,910
Run! Run.

147
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,262
Grenade!

148
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,852
Get up. Come on.

149
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,511
Thank you for coming, richard.

150
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,092
My pleasure.

151
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,581
Could you cut me free, kate?

152
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,812
What was the arrangement?

153
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:21,632
They, uh, help us free you,
and we let 'em off the island.

154
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,692
Fair enough.

155
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,691
The helicopter is yours.

156
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,933
You and sayid have
a safe journey back.

157
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,701
So we can go?

158
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,491
Off the island?

159
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,522
That's it?

160
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,140
That's it.

161
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,593
Thank you, miss.

162
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,963
Are you hurley?

163
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,261
Yeah.

164
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,341
Are you dangerous?

165
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,101
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

166
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:09,892
No, you don't know me.

167
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,481
But you know my grandson.

168
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:19,970
Nowe've traveled all the way across
country just so he could see you.

169
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:24,530
I need to know if you're
gonna do anything crazy.

170
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,361
I won't do anything crazy.

171
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,123
Hey, walt.

172
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,663
Hey, hurley.

173
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,080
You're getting big, dude.

174
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:12,721
You know, when you came back,

175
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:18,720
I was waiting for one of you to
come see me, but. Nobody did.

176
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,090
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,832
Do you know who
did come see me?

178
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,981
Jeremy bentham.

179
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:35,350
I don't undetand why
you're all lying.

180
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,491
We're lying.

181
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:54,222
Because it's the only way to protect
everyone that didn't come back.

182
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,010
Like my dad?

183
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,393
Like your dad, yeah.

184
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,543
What the hell they talkin'
about in there, anyway?

185
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't know. Leader stuff?

186
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,581
Where'd you get that?

187
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,312
Came from a box ben dug
up out of the ground.

188
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,550
They're good.

189
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:49,403
Thanks for coming back for me.

190
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,031
Ah, you got it.

191
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:55,572
Claire and the baby okay?

192
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:05,392
What did you wanna talk
to me about, john?

193
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:10,883
I want you to reconsider
leaving the island, jack.

194
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,401
I would like you to stay.

195
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,252
You'd like me to stay.

196
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,510
Yeah, that's right.

197
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,562
You threw a knife into the
back of an unarmed woman.

198
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,970
You led half of our people across the
island and got most of them killed.

199
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:29,202
Well, jack, you put a gun to my
head and you pulled the trigger.

200
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,972
I was hoping we could
let bygones be bygones.

201
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,023
Well, I' tell you what.

202
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,550
You stay here in your little greenhouse,
but the rest of us are going home.

203
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,190
But you're not
supposed to go home.

204
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:45,150
And what am I supposed to do?

205
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:47,793
Oh, I think I remember.

206
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:50,903
What was it that you said on
the way out to the hatch...

207
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,751
That crashing here
was our destiny?

208
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,600
You know, jack.

209
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,332
You know that you're
here for a reason.

210
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,393
You know it.

211
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,751
And if you leave this place,

212
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:10,020
that knowledge is gonna eat
you alive from the inside out.

213
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:13,551
Until you decide to come back.

214
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,371
Good-bye, john.

215
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,562
You're gonna have to lie.

216
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,680
Excuse me?

217
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:28,652
If you have to go,
then you have to lie about everything.

218
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:35,060
Everything that happened
since we got to the island

219
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,212
it's the only way
to protect it.

220
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,121
It's an island, john.

221
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:46,001
No one needs to protect it.

222
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,972
It's not an island.

223
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,351
It's a place where
miracles happen.

224
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:57,092
And... And... if you... if you don't
believe that, jack, if you can't
believe that,

225
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,301
just wait till you see
what I'm about to do.

226
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:09,493
There's no such
thing as miracles.

227
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,512
Well.

228
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:16,790
We'll just have to see
which one of us is right.

229
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:22,221
Am I interrupting?

230
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:29,073
Nice to see you, too, jack.

231
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,661
Couldn't find the anthiums,
could you?

232
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,971
I don't know what
they look like.

233
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,051
What are you doing?

234
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,703
Didn't you tell him?

235
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,830
I tried.

236
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,301
Sayid and kate are waiting
for you at the helicopter.

237
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:55,962
I understand that your
people from the beach

238
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,111
are being brought to the
freighter even as we speak.

239
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:58,793
What?

240
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,750
I'd love to fill you in on
everything you missed, jack,

241
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,191
but you, hugo, james,
you need to get moving.

242
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:07,650
If I were you, I'd want to be
on that boat within the hour.

243
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,273
Good-bye, jack. Let's go.

244
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:17,943
Lie to them, jack.

245
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:23,151
If you do it half as well as you lie
to yourself, they'll believe you.

246
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:48,871
Michael?

247
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:51,083
What's going on down there?

248
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,711
Did you tell anybody?

249
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,643
No, michael. I-I didn'T.

250
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,572
Can you.

251
00:20:58,616 --> 00:20:59,973
T-turn it off?

252
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:01,830
It isn't even on yet.

253
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:08,822
But, yeah, if what's in this tank does
what it's supposed to do, we're gonna
be okay.

254
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:11,062
Look, I'll send jin upstairs.

255
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:15,440
There's no need for him to be down there
with me when he can be up here
with you.

256
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:19,580
I'm pregnant.

257
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,891
Congratulations, sun.

258
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:39,852
You're gonna what?

259
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,150
Freeze it.

260
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,672
This is liquidgeitroN.

261
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,461
We use it in the
refrigeration hold.

262
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,022
The bomb needs a charge from
the battery to detonate, right?

263
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:53,922
And the battery runs on
a-a chemical reaction.

264
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,122
I spray the battery.

265
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,742
I can keep it cold.

266
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,330
No reaction.

267
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,161
And what's the catch?

268
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,431
The catch is we only
have one canister.

269
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,302
We use it up,
we're right back where we started.

270
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,933
Well, shouldn't we save it
till the light turns red?

271
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:14,631
If we see that light turn red and
the battery's not already cold,

272
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:16,920
that is the last thing
we will ever see.

273
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:22,313
Either way, at least we'll have a
warning, buy ourselves some time.

274
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:24,872
All right, um,
freeze the battery.

275
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:27,833
Jin, help me trace
back these wires,

276
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,512
make a list of where
each of them goes to.

277
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,060
Boat!

278
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:56,383
Thank you.

279
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,002
Did you get them
all to the boat?

280
00:22:58,148 --> 00:22:59,112
Yeah, everybody's safe.

281
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:00,181
Are they coming closer?

282
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,471
They fixed the engine,
and they're gonna get

283
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:03,562
as close to the island as they
can without hitting the reef,

284
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,090
so the next trip
shouldn't take so long.

285
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:07,110
I'm just gonna get some water,
and I'll come back in a minute.

286
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:08,733
Okay, I'll get the next
group ready to go.

287
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:09,500
Thank you.

288
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:10,612
- Dan!
- Yeah?

289
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,220
Thanks for helping us.

290
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:15,262
Absolutely.

291
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,121
Okay, let's go!

292
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:27,740
Uh, who told you you
could eat those peanuts?

293
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,242
May... May I eat these peanuts?

294
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:37,122
I'm gonna keep my
eye on you, shorty.

295
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:41,492
Miles.

296
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,010
Somethin' wrong with your neck?

297
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:45,433
Follow me, please.

298
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:46,973
Dan, you're back.

299
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,181
What's wrong?

300
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the
next group of people to the freighter.

301
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,760
You need to make se that you're
with me on that raft, all right?

302
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:58,050
Well, don't worry about me,
'cause I'm gonna stay.

303
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,370
Miles, no, uh, uh,
I don't think I'm getting across the

304
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:03,141
direness of the circumstance.

305
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,301
Oh, no, you're very dire,
but I'm still gonna stay.

306
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:09,081
Hey, ten minutes.

307
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:09,922
Yep.

308
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,110
I'm surprised you wanna leave.

309
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,232
Sorry?

310
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:18,812
It's just weird.

311
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,482
You know, after all that time you
spent trying to get back here.

312
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:25,463
What do you mean,
get back here?

313
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:30,692
What do I mean?

314
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,513
How deep is the station?

315
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,711
Deep.

316
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,781
Is this the magic box?

317
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,402
No, john, it's not.

318
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,040
What is all this stuff for?

319
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,651
Same things that all the
dharma stations are for.

320
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,172
Silly experiments.

321
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:53,980
What kind of experiments?

322
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:55,681
You know what, john?

323
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,903
Why don't you watch this
very informative video

324
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:04,690
that will answer some
of your questions?

325
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:08,531
And I'll take care
of some business.

326
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,212
Hello.

327
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,301
I'm dr. Edgar halliwax.

328
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:37,221
And this is the orientation film for
station six of the dharma initiative.

329
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:42,432
As you've no doubt surmised,
station six, or "the orchid, " is not.

330
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,750
A botanical research unit.

331
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:48,183
The unique properties.
Of this island

332
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,063
have created a kind
of casimir effect,

333
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:58,460
allowing the dharma initiative to
conduct unique experiments in both space
and time.

334
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:04,301
This. Is "the vault,

335
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:07,773
" constructed adjacent to a
pocket of what we believe.

336
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:11,512
To be negatively
charged "exotic matter.

337
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:15,582
" Great care must
be taken to avoid

338
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:19,950
leaving inorganic materials.
inde the chamber.

339
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:26,630
The electromagnetic energy within the
island can be highly volatile
and unpredictable.

340
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,090
Now for your own safety and
the safety of those around you,

341
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:36,050
metallic objects must never.
Be placed within the vault.

342
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,511
In our first demonstration,

343
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:46,051
we will attempt to
shift the test subject

344
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:49,901
100 milliseconds ahead in
four-dimensional space.

345
00:27:50,406 --> 00:27:51,832
For the briefest. Of moments,

346
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:56,992
the animal will seem to disappear,
but in reality.

347
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,471
Hey.

348
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:20,082
Was he talking about what I
think he was talking about?

349
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,871
If you mean time-traveling bunnies,
then yes.

350
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:29,382
You do know that he said specifically
not to put anything metal in here.

351
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:50,761
You expecting someone?

352
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,683
May I have my weapon back?

353
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:13,792
Sayid!

354
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:16,223
Kate!

355
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,672
Good to see you, dude.

356
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:36,450
He say somethin' to
tick you off, freckles?

357
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,272
Didn't kill that one.

358
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,932
Well, which one did you kill?

359
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,182
Where's the baby?

360
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:47,780
He's with sun, and they should
be at the freighter by now.

361
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:50,932
Are you okay?

362
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,782
I am now.

363
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:57,832
Hey, kenny rogers.

364
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,431
What you trying to do there,
pick a lock?

365
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:02,932
You got a better idea?

366
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,090
Hacksaw.

367
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,330
For the handcuffs, right?

368
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:15,400
Ok

369
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:17,700
- Take it easy. -
All right, all right.

370
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:20,233
Sayid, how'd you get back?

371
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,512
I took the zodiac
from the freighter.

372
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:23,853
Is it safe?

373
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,771
A body from the boat
washed up on the beach.

374
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:30,042
It's safe now.

375
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:35,400
All right!

376
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,291
Let's get the hell outta here!

377
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,323
Let's go, freckles.

378
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,693
I've seen enough of this rock.

379
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:01,940
After we drop everyone
off at the boat,

380
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,681
we can come back and
look for claire, right?

381
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:04,953
Absolutely.

382
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,391
Hands and feet
inside the vehicle!

383
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:12,363
Let's go for a ride!

384
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:20,250
Properties of this island have
created a kind of casimir effect.

385
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,263
I know you're down here, ben.

386
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:29,821
Crouching in the dark,
just waiting to take a shot at me.

387
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:33,590
This. Is "the vault".

388
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,631
Well, you better aim
for the head, ben!

389
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:44,122
You know, like your boyfriend who
shot me in the back like a coward!

390
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:53,673
This body armor's, um, been known to
take a bullet or two in its time.

391
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:05,213
But before you take your shot,
ben, let me tell you about this.

392
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:08,573
See that?

393
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:13,653
I took out a bit of a-a
life insurance policy, ben.

394
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:22,352
It's a heart rate monitor, and it's
connected to a radio transmitter.

395
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,783
W-we call it a "dead man's trigger,
" ben.

396
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,682
If my heart stops beating.

397
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:34,560
It sends a little signal
to the 500 pounds of c4

398
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:39,321
that I've got hardwired
out there on the freighter

399
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,150
that'd kill a lot of
innocent people, ben.

400
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,840
If you think I'm bluffing,
need I remind you of, uh.

401
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:51,991
How your daughter
oked as she bled out?

402
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,412
Facedown in the grass?

403
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,902
Who the hell are you?

404
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:09,620
My name is john locke,
and I have no.

405
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,662
Conflict with you.

406
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,263
And neither do the
people on that boat.

407
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,781
So.

408
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:24,020
Why don't you put
your knife down?

409
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,141
We can talk about this.

410
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,513
Well, john locke.

411
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:38,102
I've never really
been one for talk.

412
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:45,941
You killed my daughter.

413
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,410
You killed my daughter!

414
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:48,751
Ben! Ben! Ben, stop!

415
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:49,933
No, no! Stop!

416
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:55,671
Ben, what did you do?

417
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,752
You just killed
everybody on that boat.

418
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:09,731
So?

419
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:14,250
Hey, charlotte!

420
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:18,751
Listen, uh, I wanted to say before
you get on the boat, please...

421
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,781
I'm gonna stay, daniel.

422
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:24,582
For now, anyway.

423
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:28,003
Charlotte.

424
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:32,771
There is no "for now. "

425
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:36,361
If you don't come with me,
"for now" could be forever.

426
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,402
Nothing's forever.

427
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:43,962
Why?

428
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:51,722
Would it make any sense if I told you I
was still looking for where I was born?

429
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,253
N-no.

430
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:04,100
Good-bye, daniel.

431
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,693
Let me guess.

432
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:24,640
You're not coming.

433
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:29,272
I promised I wouldn't leave until I got
everyone here safely off this island.

434
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:30,652
Relax.

435
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,622
I'll still be here
when you get back.

436
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:36,131
Right, right.

437
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,190
When I get back.

438
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:49,541
Okay. Everybody ready?

439
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,902
Let's get started.

440
00:36:58,027 --> 00:36:59,390
Off we go.

441
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,753
I think I might have something.

442
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:10,171
Okay, so.

443
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:12,713
So if. If I cut this wire, it.

444
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:16,370
It should disconnect
the firing mechanisms.

445
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:19,672
Stop!

446
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,501
No good.

447
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,993
Damn it!

448
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,082
I-I just don't know enough.

449
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:34,103
H-how do we even know your little
freezing trick's doing anything?

450
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:36,653
We'll know if that light turns
red and we're still here.

451
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:40,463
How much stuff do we have left?

452
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,143
We got a quarter tank.

453
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,112
What happens if we can't
deactivate the bomb?

454
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:54,771
We better get everybody
the hell off this boat.

455
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:21,110
What's the matter?

456
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,301
We're losing fuel.

457
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:24,572
What?

458
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:25,490
We're losing fuel!

459
00:38:25,618 --> 00:38:26,132
Look outside!

460
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:27,740
Tell me if you see anything!

461
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:39,523
We have a fuel leak!

462
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,503
A bullet must have
pierced the tank!

463
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,443
We gotta find a place
to set her down!

464
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,231
No, don't land!

465
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:48,070
- What? -
There's no fuel on the island!

466
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:50,711
We've gotta get to the boat,
or this chopper's useless!

467
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm telling ya,
I don't see the boat!

468
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:54,650
Well, then keep looking!

469
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:07,481
We gotta get every ounce of extra
weight off this chopper now!

470
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:11,231
Anythi that's not bolted down,
toss it out!

471
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:29,112
Now what?

472
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:30,013
Is that enough?

473
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:31,240
Can we make it?

474
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:36,691
I'd feel a hell of a lot better if
we were a few hundred pounds li ter!

475
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:44,593
Well, if we don't maket, we're still
close enough to ditch it on the beach.

476
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:47,050
Hey! Do not go back
to the island!

477
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:49,693
We might not have
a choice, doc.

478
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,451
Hey.

479
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,312
Why are you telling me this?

480
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,683
Just do it, freckles.

481
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:33,682
Sawyer!

482
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:18,992
Excuse me, sir.

483
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:19,952
I'm sorry to bother you.

484
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:21,492
But do you have
the time, please?

485
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:22,542
Yeah.

486
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,641
It's eight fif...

487
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:02,783
Hello, hurley.

488
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:08,680
I think visiting
hours are over, dude.

489
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:10,793
This isn't a visit.

490
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,552
I want you to come with me.

491
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:15,303
Come with you where?

492
00:42:15,406 --> 00:42:16,891
Somewhere safe.

493
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:19,153
And why would I go
anywhere with you?

494
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:21,793
I haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

495
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:24,220
Because circumstances
have changed.

496
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,773
What circumstances?

497
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:28,993
Bentham's dead.

498
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:32,583
What?

499
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,321
Two days ago.

500
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,131
What happened?

501
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:38,922
They said it was suicide.

502
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,683
What do you mean,
they "said" it was suicide?

503
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,593
And why are you
calling him "bentham"?

504
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:46,300
- His name is...
- don't say it.

505
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,242
We're being watched.

506
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:56,552
Dude, I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

507
00:42:56,946 --> 00:42:59,513
The last thing I need
now is paranoia.

508
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:04,110
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

509
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,733
I'm finding paranoia
keeps me alive.

510
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:13,653
We're not going back, are we?

511
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:15,850
No.

512
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:17,763
Just somewhere safe.

513
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:24,191
Okay then.

514
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:29,371
Hold on a sec.

515
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,842
Checkmate, Mr. Eko.

516
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:50,231
Where's the freighter?

517
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,252
I don't know.
I stayed on course.

518
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:54,033
They must have it
on the move again.

519
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:58,473
How much fuel?

520
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:03,413
Four, five minutes worth,
unless somebody else wants to jump.

521
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,083
As soon as we get to the boat,
we'll go back for him.

522
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:18,140
There it is!
The boat! I see it!

523
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,890
Behind us!

524
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,420
Ben, help me.

525
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:46,361
If he dies,
everybody on that boat dies.

526
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,193
That's not my problem, john.

527
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:54,183
Hang on, man. Hang on!

528
00:44:55,897 --> 00:44:57,790
Wherever you go.

529
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:02,760
Widmore.

530
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:08,190
He'll find you.

531
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:14,280
Not if I find him first.

532
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:20,282
No. No.

533
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,601
You two need to go now.

534
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:36,360
Get everybody off the boat.

535
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:39,171
We have maybe five
minutes left in the tank.

536
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:40,430
Go!

537
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:42,730
You go. Go.

538
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:46,030
I stay.

539
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,732
Oh, bloody hell.

540
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:30,182
Don't land!

541
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:31,740
You can't land!

542
00:46:31,846 --> 00:46:32,680
Don't land!

543
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:38,810
Don't land!

544
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:41,260
There's a bomb!

545
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,010
There's a bomb!

546
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:45,593
Get away! There's a bomb!
You can't land! Go back!

547
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:46,623
Did he say "bomb"?

548
00:46:46,796 --> 00:46:48,152
Don't land!

549
00:46:48,937 --> 00:46:49,870
What are you doing?

550
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,913
I don't care what the
hell he's screaming!

551
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:55,022
I'm flying on fumes!
I gotta put this bird down!

552
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:57,810
No! Don't land!

553
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,903
No! No!
Look, you don't understand!

554
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,810
Jin and michael are doing everything
they can, but there's no time!

555
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,790
You've gotta get
off the boat now!

556
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:18,740
How long till we can fly again?

557
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,570
Somebody patch the other hole
where the bullet came out!

558
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:21,280
Give it to me. I'll do it.

559
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,010
Here!

560
00:47:22,128 --> 00:47:22,972
Somebody pump some gas!

561
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:23,861
I'll handle the fuel.

562
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:25,943
Get that life raft right there!
Come on!

563
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:27,550
Let's go!

564
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:31,401
Hey, sun!

565
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:33,450
Sun! Where you going?

566
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:34,962
We gotta go.
Jin's below with michael.

567
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:35,771
- I can't...
- no,no,there's no time!

568
00:47:35,805 --> 00:47:37,683
- There's no time.We have to go.
- I won't leave him!

569
00:47:37,715 --> 00:47:38,552
Okay.

570
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:39,601
You get the baby
on the chopper.

571
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,082
I'll get jin. All right?

572
00:47:41,247 --> 00:47:42,640
Just keep pumping till
I get it started!

573
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:44,423
That'll be enough to
get us to the island.

574
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:56,322
Jin, you gotta go.

575
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:57,830
There's nothing more
we can do, man.

576
00:47:57,835 --> 00:47:59,611
- No,I can find...
- hey,come on.

577
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:00,743
It's over.

578
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:02,330
I'm almost out of this stuff.

579
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:04,982
Listen, you are a father now.

580
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:08,263
Get to yr wife
and get her home.

581
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,990
Thank you, michael.

582
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:13,303
You're welcome.

583
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,221
Go.

584
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,073
Hey! Not yet!

585
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:26,332
Your buddy said we got five
minutes as of three minutes ago.

586
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,440
If you're going, this is it.

587
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:28,072
Let's go!

588
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,170
- Kate!Come on!
- Jin's still inside!

589
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:34,883
Jin's still inside.

590
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:35,720
We can't leave him behind.

591
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:37,470
Come on.
Listen, I'm not leaving without you.

592
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,252
We gotta get out of here now.

593
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:41,590
Let's !

594
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:51,042
Give me a minute!

595
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:52,052
No! Wait!

596
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,390
Where's jin?

597
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:08,622
It's jin!

598
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:13,602
No!

599
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,192
Jin! Jin!

600
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:16,663
We have to go back!
Turn around!

601
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:17,750
We can't do it!

602
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:19,920
We have to! We need to go back!

603
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:39,840
You can go now, michael.

604
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:41,650
Who are you?

605
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:48,410
Jin!

606
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:59,163
Jin!

607
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:07,920
We have to go find jin!

608
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:09,413
Sun, there's nobody down there!

609
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,970
You can't see
anything from here!

610
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:12,643
- We didn't get enough fuel!We can't go back!
- Go lower!

611
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:15,091
- I know he's there!
- Sun,I'm...sun,I'm so sorry.

612
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:15,981
- He's not...
- he's down there!

613
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:17,571
- I know he's down there!
- we gotta go!

614
00:50:17,936 --> 00:50:19,570
No! I'm not leaving him!

615
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,131
- can't get to him!
- No,we're not leaving him!

616
00:50:22,315 --> 00:50:23,903
We're not! Turn back around!

617
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:25,301
Sun! Sun!

618
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:28,483
It's gone!

619
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,811
He's gone.

620
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:46,863
Lapidus!

621
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,131
Fly us back to the island.

622
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:51,372
You got it.

623
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,510
No!

624
00:50:54,808 --> 00:50:59,900
No! No! No!

625
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:09,262
Hello

626
00:51:09,476 --> 00:51:12,130
hello! someone wants
to talk to you!

627
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,933
Say hello to your mother JIYEON

628
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,430
mama mama

629
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:17,943
hello my love

630
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:19,670
where are you?

631
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,131
I'm in London I leave tonight

632
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,060
just finishing a
little business

633
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,281
fly safe

634
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:28,561
***

635
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,033
all right, guys. Thanks.

636
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:44,402
Excuse me.

637
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:45,800
Mr. Widmore?

638
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:47,010
Yes.

639
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,443
I'm sun kwon.

640
00:51:48,586 --> 00:51:49,862
Mr. Paik's daughter.

641
00:51:50,017 --> 00:51:52,331
I'm the managing director
of paik industries.

642
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:53,662
Yes, of course.

643
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:54,831
How is your father?

644
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:56,552
Excellent, thank you.

645
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:57,980
Quite the golfer.

646
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,330
I believe I owe him dinner
after our last game.

647
00:52:03,025 --> 00:52:06,182
Are you really going to pretend
that you don't know who I am?

648
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:09,853
I'm afraid I don't know what
you're talking about, ms. Kwon.

649
00:52:09,987 --> 00:52:12,183
Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore.

650
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:14,880
Just like you know we've been
lying all this time about

651
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:18,712
where we were and what
happened to us there.

652
00:52:21,627 --> 00:52:23,952
You and I have
common interests.

653
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,752
When you're ready
to discuss them.

654
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:31,081
Call me.

655
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:38,641
As you know, we're not the
only ones who left the island.

656
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:44,571
Ms. Kwon?

657
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,042
Why would you want to help me?

658
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:56,470
Why?

659
00:52:57,148 --> 00:52:58,350
"Why" what?

660
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,490
Why did you kill him when you
knew it would destroy the boat?

661
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:03,860
Well, john,
I really wasn't thinking straight.

662
00:53:04,606 --> 00:53:06,220
Sometimes.

663
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:12,711
Good command decisions get compromi
d by bad emotional responses.

664
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:20,032
I'm sure you're gonna do a much better
job of separating the two than I
ever did.

665
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:28,201
What are you doing?

666
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,152
I asked you a question!

667
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:35,000
If I were you, I'd duck.

668
00:53:51,348 --> 00:53:53,193
I better change.

669
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,631
Nice day for a swim.

670
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:31,841
What are you doing here?

671
00:54:32,558 --> 00:54:34,112
Decided to take a dip.

672
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,801
Whatcha cebratin'?

673
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:42,752
I'm not celebrating.

674
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,532
Is that our boat?

675
00:55:01,016 --> 00:55:02,551
It was.

676
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:19,912
What's that for?

677
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,833
I'm going somewhere cold.

678
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:24,750
Then where is mine?

679
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:27,580
You don't need one because
you're not going with me.

680
00:55:27,776 --> 00:55:29,252
Yes, I am going with you.

681
00:55:29,347 --> 00:55:30,780
No, john, you're not.

682
00:55:30,845 --> 00:55:32,722
Jacob told me what
we had to do.

683
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:34,151
- You don't get to make all the decisions...
- he told you what to do

684
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:35,771
But he didn't tell you how

685
00:55:35,888 --> 00:55:38,843
but he didn't tell you how because he
wants me to suffer the consequences.

686
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:40,660
What consequences?

687
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:50,541
Whoever moves the island
can never come back.

688
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:56,510
So I'd like you to get on the elevator,
john, and go back up.

689
00:55:56,626 --> 00:56:00,141
Richard and my people will be
waiting 2 miles east of the orchid.

690
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,501
Waiting for me?

691
00:56:03,597 --> 00:56:08,533
Ready, willing and able
to share what they know.

692
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:14,171
And then they will
follow your every word.

693
00:56:17,075 --> 00:56:19,050
Good-bye, john.

694
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,400
I'm sorry I made your
life so miserable.

695
00:56:36,918 --> 00:56:38,742
What do I tell 'em to do?

696
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:45,971
You'll find your way, john.

697
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:48,041
You always do.

698
00:57:26,548 --> 00:57:28,191
Hello, john.

699
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:38,311
Welcome home.

700
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:40,370
I hope you're happy now, jacob.

701
01:00:53,005 --> 01:00:54,792
Yeah, what is that?

702
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:07,742
Where's the island?

703
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:10,393
Where's the island?

704
01:02:15,508 --> 01:02:17,390
Where the hell's the island?

705
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,931
It's gone.

706
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,580
Where the hell am I
gonna land this thing?

707
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:31,053
There's another smaller island
close by they took us to!

708
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:35,680
I got news for ya, doc there's
nothing but water in every direction!

709
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:39,831
Doesn't matter now.

710
01:02:39,846 --> 01:02:42,782
That's it, people!
We're out of fuel!

711
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:55,533
Get your life vests on!
We're going in!

712
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:05,693
Brace yourselves!

713
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:11,143
Desmond! The life raft!

714
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:14,671
Hold on!

715
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:42,570
Where's jack?
Kate! Where is he?

716
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:50,332
-Are you okay?
-Hurley,carry the baby.

717
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,271
Sayid, are you all right?

718
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,263
Yes! Jack!

719
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,881
Where's desmond?

720
01:03:56,905 --> 01:03:59,803
-get the baby.
-I got him.

721
01:04:06,996 --> 01:04:09,400
Desmond!

722
01:04:11,466 --> 01:04:14,350
Jack! Give me a hand!

723
01:04:18,076 --> 01:04:20,541
Here you go.

724
01:04:29,195 --> 01:04:31,243
We've gotta get
him in the raft.

725
01:04:31,276 --> 01:04:32,141
Is he breathing?

726
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:35,302
Oh, my god. Is he breathing?

727
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:47,421
Oh, my god.

728
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,291
Oh, come on, desmond.

729
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:20,743
Yeah, you're all right.

730
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:23,451
You're all right, man.
You're okay.

731
01:05:24,335 --> 01:05:25,780
Desmond. That's it.

732
01:05:25,816 --> 01:05:29,300
You're all right. That's it.

733
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:49,782
It's okay. It's okay.

734
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:51,832
We're alive.

735
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:30,062
Hello?

736
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,083
Hello? Who's there?

737
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:04,672
Don't move.

738
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,561
Don't you touch my son!

739
01:07:17,527 --> 01:07:19,750
Claire?

740
01:07:22,177 --> 01:07:26,380
-How did y...
-don't bring him back,kate.

741
01:07:30,727 --> 01:07:34,641
Don't you dare bring him back.

742
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:20,241
I'm sorry.

743
01:08:25,036 --> 01:08:27,511
I'm sorry.

744
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:43,923
-is he okay?
-He's fine.

745
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,152
It's a miracle.

746
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,341
I can't believe he did it.

747
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:57,153
Who did what?

748
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:59,320
Locke.

749
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:02,242
He moved the island.

750
01:09:02,718 --> 01:09:04,580
No, he didn'T.

751
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:08,890
Oh, really?

752
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:13,551
'Cause. One minute it was there,
and the next it was gone, so.

753
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:17,772
Unless we, like, overlooked it,
dude, that's exactly what he did.

754
01:09:19,097 --> 01:09:23,440
But. If you've got another explanation,
man, I'd love to hear it.

755
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:33,901
God almighty.

756
01:09:35,235 --> 01:09:37,630
There's a boat.

757
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:41,050
There's a boat out there!

758
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:45,221
There's a boat out there.

759
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:48,292
Hey! Over here!

760
01:09:48,307 --> 01:09:49,752
Does it see us?

761
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,712
I think it does!

762
01:09:54,726 --> 01:09:56,892
It is turning?

763
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,422
It's turning!

764
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,073
We're gonna have to lie.

765
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:06,501
What?

766
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:08,773
We're gonna have to lie.

767
01:10:09,858 --> 01:10:11,273
Lie about what?

768
01:10:11,297 --> 01:10:16,403
Everything, all of it, every moment
since we crashed on the island.

769
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:21,512
Jack. Now I know I'm new to
this group and everything,

770
01:10:21,528 --> 01:10:24,622
but isn't this the place where everybody
starts jumping up and down and hugging
each other?

771
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:26,082
Your freighter.

772
01:10:26,106 --> 01:10:29,612
Those men came to the island to kill us,
all of us.

773
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:33,241
You said that our plane was
discovered on the btom of the ocean.

774
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:37,560
Well, someone put it there... Someone
who wants everyone to think that
we're dead.

775
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:43,030
So what do you think's gonna happen to
us when we tell them that that wasn't
our plane?

776
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,750
What do you think's gonna happen
to the people that we left behind?

777
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:54,980
Jack, we can'T.

778
01:10:56,268 --> 01:10:58,341
We can't pull it off.

779
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:03,693
Just let me do the talking.

780
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,421
Dmor throw them a rope!
Take them 'round to the stern!

781
01:11:36,897 --> 01:11:37,723
Neh! Aqui!

782
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:39,132
D? Uma olhada aqui!

783
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:42,390
H* uma jangada dos povos,

784
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,970
Penny?

785
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:11,843
Penny! Penny!

786
01:13:07,735 --> 01:13:13,722
-are you okay?
-I'm...I'm fine.I'm fine.

787
01:13:16,086 --> 01:13:18,310
H-how did you find me?

788
01:13:18,325 --> 01:13:20,371
Your phone call.

789
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:24,330
I have a tracking station.

790
01:13:28,407 --> 01:13:30,460
I love you, penny.

791
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:34,822
And I'll never leave you again.

792
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,973
This is... This is penny.

793
01:13:50,986 --> 01:13:55,131
This is, um,
kate and then aaron.

794
01:13:57,586 --> 01:14:02,113
And this is sun, sayid, hurley.

795
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,091
This is frank.

796
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:09,282
And jack. Jack, this is...
this is penny.

797
01:14:09,305 --> 01:14:11,790
It's nice to meet you, penny.

798
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:16,181
But we need to talk.

799
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:26,563
One week later

800
01:14:29,038 --> 01:14:31,130
What's this place called?

801
01:14:31,827 --> 01:14:33,572
Membata.

802
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:35,932
Membata.

803
01:14:39,957 --> 01:14:41,962
Why are we doing this, dude?

804
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:45,153
Sailing 3,
000 miles to another island?

805
01:14:45,706 --> 01:14:48,921
Because it's the only
way to keep them safe.

806
01:14:58,375 --> 01:14:59,681
How long till we'll hit land?

807
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:02,412
Well, if the wind's
not too brutal.

808
01:15:02,426 --> 01:15:04,850
Eight, nine hours.

809
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,401
Just long enough to give you a nice,
convincing sunburn.

810
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,650
It's been a pleasure, frank.

811
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:13,472
I hope we never see
each other again.

812
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:16,293
Roger that, doc.

813
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:22,421
Bye, sweetheart.

814
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:35,580
Are you sure about
this, brother?

815
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:39,360
Are you sure?

816
01:15:40,807 --> 01:15:43,013
As long as I've got penny.

817
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:46,543
I'll be fine.

818
01:15:48,058 --> 01:15:50,441
Don't let him find
you, desmond.

819
01:15:57,897 --> 01:16:00,892
I'll see you in
another life, brother.

820
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:08,231
Aye. I guess you will.

821
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,520
All right.

822
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,841
Let's go home.

823
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:13,640
Sleeping on your belly
you break my arms,

824
01:18:13,658 --> 01:18:17,631
you spoon my eyes been
rubbing a bad charm

825
01:18:17,645 --> 01:18:23,783
with holy fingers gouge
away you can... niffles

826
01:19:59,788 --> 01:20:02,091
hello, jack.

827
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:05,761
Sorry.

828
01:20:05,786 --> 01:20:07,811
Didn't mean to scare you.

829
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:12,733
Did he tell you that
I was off the island?

830
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:18,391
Yes, he did.

831
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:26,541
When did you speak to him?

832
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,543
About a month ago.

833
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:35,081
-And kate?
-Yeah.

834
01:20:36,186 --> 01:20:38,700
Yeah, he came to see her, too.

835
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:41,171
And what did he y to you?

836
01:20:42,036 --> 01:20:52,032
He told me. That after I left the
island, some very bad things happened.

837
01:20:54,456 --> 01:20:59,423
And he told me that it
was my fault for leaving.

838
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:05,520
And he said that I
had to come back.

839
01:21:06,058 --> 01:21:09,562
Yes, I heard that you've been
flying on passenger planes.

840
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:13,390
Hoping that you'd crash.

841
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:18,731
It's dark, jack, very dark.

842
01:21:18,747 --> 01:21:21,342
Why are you here?

843
01:21:22,307 --> 01:21:26,403
I'm here to tell you that the
island won't let you come alone.

844
01:21:33,747 --> 01:21:36,581
All of you have to go back.

845
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:38,821
Are you.

846
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:44,263
Sayid... I don't even
know where sayid is.

847
01:21:44,306 --> 01:21:48,670
Hurley. Is insane.

848
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:51,310
Sun blames me for.

849
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,072
And then kate.

850
01:21:57,756 --> 01:22:00,383
She won't even talk
to me anymore.

851
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,802
Perhaps I can help
you with that.

852
01:22:06,076 --> 01:22:08,390
This is the way it
has to be, jack.

853
01:22:08,415 --> 01:22:10,862
It's the only way.

854
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:15,410
You have to do it together,
all of you.

855
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:18,253
How?

856
01:22:18,697 --> 01:22:21,660
I have a few ideas.

857
01:22:35,496 --> 01:22:39,342
Jack. I said, all of ou.

858
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:43,920
We're gonna have
to bring him, too.
