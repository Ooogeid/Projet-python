00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:02,084
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,890
There's a rental car parked out front.
Got to Sue city.

3
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:07,644
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower motel.

4
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:10,154
Wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,281
I love you.

6
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:12,624
I love you, too.

7
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,557
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,097
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

9
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,851
Obviously,
the circumstances have changed.

10
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,263
He may not want to be rescued.

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,039
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,479
We came here to rescue Jack,
and that's what we're gonna do.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,477
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:37,478
I came to get you.

15
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,791
Get outta here.

16
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:40,508
Don't hurt her!

17
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:43,638
I made a deal with them.

18
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,368
They're gonna let me go.

19
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,033
Where?

20
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,317
Home.

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,412
Jack, we need to go.

22
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,732
Hey, hold it right there!

23
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:56,737
Get your hands up! Get down!

24
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,173
I said get down!

25
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,408
What are you doing here, John?

26
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,409
I'm sorry, Jack.

27
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:02,531
Sorry for what?

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,235
I was just bringing you
something to eat.

29
00:01:58,642 --> 00:01:59,753
Enjoy your sandwich.

30
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:20,251
Been on the road a while, huh?

31
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:21,898
How long is it gonna take?

32
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,733
Well, your fan belt's shot.

33
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,454
I'll take two days, maybe three.

34
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,838
Three days for a fan belt?

35
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:30,956
Welcome to Iowa.

36
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:36,567
My name is Johnny.

37
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:38,442
I'm Lucy.

38
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,795
All 18-karat gold.

39
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,495
Cheapest one in retail for 500 bucks.

40
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,983
Come on. Those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

41
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:57,642
What do you mean, they don't look real?

42
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,030
My uncle's going out of business.

43
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:02,079
If you need a lift into town,
I'm finished up here in an hour.

44
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,939
- I call the cops.
- Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

45
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,150
Is there a problem, buddy?

46
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,817
Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem.

47
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,905
I'm getting scammed here,
that's the problem.

48
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:12,147
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?

49
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,082
If you don't want to buy them,
don't buy them.

50
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,014
Those are fake necklaces,
and you're a rip-off artist.

51
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,149
They're real.

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,582
I call the cops.

53
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,652
You don't want them,
I'll find somebody else.

54
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:22,766
Hey, let me see those.

55
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,631
My father owns a jewelry store.

56
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,175
I think I can spot a fake.

57
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:29,752
How much?

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
60 bucks.

59
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,946
I'll take the one on the end.

60
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,775
Whatever.

61
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:40,394
Thanks.

62
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,336
Can I get my money back?

63
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:56,773
Why'd you help me?

64
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,311
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

65
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,758
Or you're stranded here,

66
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:05,133
and for some reason, you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

67
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,599
I'll give you a ride into town.
You buy me a drink.

68
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,478
What?

69
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:37,391
What are you doing?

70
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,085
Did they capture you?

71
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:41,210
Yes, but...

72
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:43,781
Only temporarily.

73
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,847
I came to say good-bye.

74
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,317
Good-bye?

75
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,663
I'm leaving with them.

76
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,693
What the hell is going on?

77
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,195
I mean, what are they doing to you?
Are you brainwashed?

78
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,254
Where did Jack go?

79
00:04:58,273 --> 00:04:59,923
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

80
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:02,566
He's gonna have
to stay behind, like you.

81
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:04,921
You can't trust them.

82
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:07,504
If they told you that
they're gonna take you home,

83
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,699
- they're lying...
- I don't want to go home.

84
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,447
I want you to know,
I made a strong case for you.

85
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,610
I told them
that you were a good person...

86
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:19,274
reliable, smart, honest.

87
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,233
And then they told me
who you were and what you had done.

88
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,111
Let's just say, forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

89
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Good luck.

90
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,964
John, where are you going?

91
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:36,990
Coming out!

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,776
Where is Jack and where is Sayid?

93
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,570
Have you seen Rousseau?

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,383
John, please. What's happened to you?

95
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,776
I'm sorry, Kate.

96
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:11,704
Subtitle: swsub.com

97
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,952
What the hell's wrong with you?

98
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,479
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

99
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,678
I'm not supposed to be here.

100
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,679
Good. Then scram.

101
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:34,377
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

102
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,127
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

103
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,366
Well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

104
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,043
A vote for what?

105
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,291
To decide whether or not to banish you.

106
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,117
Banish me?

107
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,560
- Where?
- Well, there was debate about that,

108
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,522
but the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

109
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,230
Consensus?

110
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,873
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it--

111
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,924
to, like, make amends.

112
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:03,429
I don't do amends.

113
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,668
You might want to ask yourself

114
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:09,487
about all the good stuff that comes
from being
part of this... society.

115
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,081
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

116
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,418
You use our latrine,

117
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,160
drink the water that Steve brings
every morning to the trough...

118
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:19,244
What?

119
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:24,265
You know how for 3 days, 10 h and 15 min
I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

120
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:30,609
Well, you, sir... Hugo,
are rotund,

121
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,492
annoying,

122
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:34,581
and you're ruining my damn view.

123
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,102
How's that for amends?

124
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,945
You're making a big mistake, dude.

125
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:42,868
Banish me...

126
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,227
How about you tell me your name?

127
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,768
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

128
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,815
Next time somebody asks,
you don't think about it.

129
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,203
- I didn't think--
- Not even for a second.

130
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,904
So why Lucy?

131
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:27,652
She's a saint.

132
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,829
I had to memorize them all
in Sunday's school,

133
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,275
so I figure they're probably still
rattling around my brain.

134
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:35,003
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

135
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,424
A few months ago,
I killed my stepfather.

136
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:48,018
I escaped from the marshal
who arrested me for it.

137
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:52,527
Why?

138
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,609
'cause he was a bad guy.

139
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,560
So...

140
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,296
what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

141
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,251
I want to talk to my mother.

142
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:14,058
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that,

143
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,232
because if you did
what you just said you did,

144
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,097
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

145
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,596
I'll figure something out.

146
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:23,322
- Oh, you will, huh?
- What, you want to help me?

147
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,261
Absolutely.

148
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:34,574
Why?

149
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,898
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

150
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,044
and then I gave him my life savings.

151
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,823
He conned me and embarrassed me.

152
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,736
He was a bad guy.

153
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,136
So...

154
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:58,721
I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom... Lucy,

155
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,971
because one of us
deserves something good.

156
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,587
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote...

157
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,615
Come on, come on!

158
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,831
Hey, let's do it!

159
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:03,437
Do what?

160
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,696
I'm ready to do it: make amends,

161
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:08,182
change the vote.

162
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,964
I don't wanna be banished, okay?

163
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:13,248
You happy?

164
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:15,242
Dude, you stink.

165
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:17,492
What is that, fish?

166
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,747
Did you try to gut one yourself?

167
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,041
How have you not learned that by now?

168
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,215
I mean, we've been here, like,
three months.

169
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:28,785
Could we just do this?

170
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,187
Do what?

171
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:32,944
Make nice?

172
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,069
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

173
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,027
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

174
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,336
- Really?
- You're worse than a girl.

175
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:50,611
Come on. Let's spread the love.

176
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:23,438
What the hell am I doing here?

177
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,228
- Why don't you tell me?
- I don't know.

178
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,311
I don't know either!

179
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:28,432
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

180
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,555
So what the hell happened?

181
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:55,935
I was making a cup of tea.

182
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,909
Canister came in through the window.

183
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,792
So what'd you do to piss them off?

184
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:06,506
You're wasting your time.

185
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,284
The knife is too big.

186
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,430
We need something smaller.
A safety pin...

187
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,875
- We're going back.
- What?

188
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,993
They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

189
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,387
You say "they"
like you didn't lock me in a cage

190
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,076
and watch me break rocks all day.

191
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:26,264
We're going back to your village because

192
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:29,188
my friends were probably gassed,
just like us.

193
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:30,874
Your people are gone anyway.

194
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,332
- I saw them all pack up and leave.
- What?

195
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,890
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

196
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,775
They were taking off,
going somewhere else.

197
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,048
Going? Going where?

198
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:41,992
He didn't exactly tell me.

199
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:48,919
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

200
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,679
On the ground!

201
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,239
Get down! On the ground!

202
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:25,216
Let me see those hands!

203
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,707
Let me see those hands!

204
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,170
Long time no see, Austen.

205
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:42,072
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling bibles!

206
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,054
Hi.

207
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,749
They questioned me for half an hour.

208
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,843
He confiscated my case.

209
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,818
He was asking me about
selling bibles and...

210
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,446
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

211
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,542
Yeah, now we know
what we're up against, right?

212
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:29,678
Yeah, now we know

213
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:32,747
that there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy

214
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,635
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

215
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,568
Figure it out? That marshal...

216
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,819
I don't know what you did to him,

217
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:43,131
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

218
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,040
Look, if you've changed your mind,

219
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:47,112
if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

220
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,303
No, I do wanna help you,

221
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:50,889
but if I'm lying to federal agents,
Lucy,

222
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,116
so that you can have
a chat with your mom...

223
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,949
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

224
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,031
He...

225
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,028
He... used to get drunk

226
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:07,877
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

227
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,867
I...

228
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:12,403
Made it look like an accident...

229
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,104
a gas leak.

230
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,123
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

231
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,741
for her.

232
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:22,979
Set her up for life.

233
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,482
And then she gave me up.

234
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:32,554
Chose him over me.

235
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,933
So the reason
I need to talk to her is...

236
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:40,653
someone I love...

237
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,964
Someone who's supposed
to care about me betrayed me,

238
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,621
and I wanna know why.

239
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,179
Well...

240
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:54,645
then let's go find out.

241
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:01,734
What are you doing?

242
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,518
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail.

243
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,269
It'll lead us back to where
we came from.

244
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:07,485
Let's go.

245
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:09,542
It's gonna rain.

246
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,499
Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

247
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,462
Why?

248
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:25,774
Why what?

249
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,652
Why would they handcuff you to me

250
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,873
and then drag us all the way
out into the jungle?

251
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,811
Ben has a thing for mind games.

252
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:35,330
Is that why he left you behind?

253
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,032
Do we really have to talk?

254
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:39,215
Nope.

255
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,840
Come on.
If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

256
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:52,429
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

257
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:57,066
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack,

258
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:00,533
because I was standing right there

259
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,288
when he told you not to come back,

260
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,709
and now that you've ruined his
chance to get off the island...

261
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:21,524
You done?

262
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,529
I said, are you done?

263
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,706
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

264
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,812
What the hell was that?

265
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,054
- Get up!
- You dislocated my shoulder!

266
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:54,932
Come on!

267
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:03,454
Wait! Come here.

268
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:08,884
Okay. Get down.

269
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:11,084
What the hell...

270
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,806
Are we safe?

271
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:02,854
You tell me.

272
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:17,294
I ain't kissing no damn baby.

273
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,124
Claire's, like, really influential.

274
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:21,304
If she votes for you to stay,
you're home free, dude.

275
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,948
Why wouldn't she vote for me?

276
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,242
It's not like I ever done
anything bad to her.

277
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,999
Nah, but you never did
anything good for her either.

278
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,561
And have you ever
even asked how Aaron is?

279
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,865
I know how he is.

280
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,253
He cries loud, and he smells.

281
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:37,118
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

282
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,835
You're sarcastic.
People don't like that.

283
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,879
All right.

284
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:41,791
So I go over...

285
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,989
And do what?

286
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:47,471
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

287
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:52,158
So go over there,
say something nice, call her "Claire".

288
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:53,932
And give her this.

289
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,867
I know you can do it, dude.

290
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:04,066
Hey, Claire.

291
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,847
Hey there... little baby...

292
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,429
Aaron.

293
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,135
Is there anything I can do for you?

294
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,976
No. I just came by...

295
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,789
to see your baby.

296
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:29,140
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

297
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,329
Yeah, I... guess he's not. Thanks.

298
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,227
Oh, and... this is for you.

299
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,890
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

300
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,073
blankets.

301
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:52,214
Well, good night.

302
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,664
Good night.

303
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:05,921
Do you think it's gone?

304
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:09,088
- Are we safe?
- Are you serious?

305
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,033
- What?
- You've never seen that?

306
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,106
If you don't believe me,

307
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:14,602
you can always pull
my other shoulder out of its socket.

308
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,743
- I was... I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

309
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,173
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

310
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,317
Give me your hand.

311
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,415
- Why?
- 'cause I want you to pop it back in.

312
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,980
- No, I'm not gonna--
- You're gonna.

313
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,504
Right, now it feels

314
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:45,864
like there's broken glass under my skin,
and if it weren't for you,

315
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,915
I would be on my way home right now.

316
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,064
Jack told me
not to come back to protect me,

317
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:53,587
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

318
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,245
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

319
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,452
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...

320
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,226
all of them.

321
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,475
He saw you...

322
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,102
you and Sawyer.

323
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:14,869
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

324
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,647
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

325
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,113
It was because you broke his heart.

326
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,352
So...

327
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:29,808
grab my wrist,

328
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,986
push up and twist.

329
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:55,669
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

330
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,879
You asked me to help you
catch a boar.

331
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:01,375
Well, this is when they break
cover to eat.

332
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:05,234
Looks like they picked
a day to sleep in.

333
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,091
So what's your angle, brother?

334
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,709
- My angle?
- Well, you...

335
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:12,496
Haven't spoken three words to me,
and then...

336
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:15,305
suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

337
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:17,737
My angle...

338
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:21,068
is I got hearts and minds to change,

339
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,840
and politics is all about bribes.

340
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:28,524
Since money don't mean
squat on this island,

341
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,176
I gotta give the people
something they like...

342
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:35,118
And people like meat.

343
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,036
How's your shoulder?

344
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:04,215
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

345
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:17,049
Thank you.

346
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:19,551
You're welcome, sweetheart.

347
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:39,715
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

348
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,498
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

349
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,554
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

350
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,048
Thank you.

351
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:08,173
Hi, mom.

352
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:12,673
What are you doing here, Katherine?

353
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,486
You look good.

354
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:20,785
I asked you what you were doing here.

355
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,214
I want to know why you
told them what I did to Wayne.

356
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,572
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

357
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,458
I'm not sorry.

358
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,633
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog and you...

359
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,902
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

360
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:50,602
And for good or bad, I loved him.

361
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:53,867
And you burnt him alive.

362
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:57,125
You turned on the gas,
and you lit a match.

363
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,973
You murdered him in cold blood.

364
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:03,614
I did it for you.

365
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,259
What you did, you did for yourself.

366
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,404
I have to go back to work.

367
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,120
Because you are my daughter,

368
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:22,129
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

369
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,154
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here,

370
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,714
but I swear to god, Katie...

371
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,227
if I ever see you again,

372
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,446
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

373
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,128
Good-bye.

374
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,530
Did he say that to you?

375
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,002
Sorry?

376
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:00,905
That I broke his heart.

377
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,692
He didn't have to.

378
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,822
You don't know anything about him.

379
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:11,216
I know where he was born.

380
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,128
I know what his parents
did for a living.

381
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:16,993
I know that he was married
and who he was married to.

382
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,635
I know why he got a divorce.
I know how his father died.

383
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:25,270
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday and his blood type.

384
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:29,974
What do you know about him, Kate?

385
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:37,565
Let's go.

386
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,567
Run.

387
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:47,764
Run!

388
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,099
Get up! Get up!

389
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:08,230
Run! Run! Come on!

390
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,018
What are you doing?

391
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,108
I know what happens
when you set those things off!

392
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,463
We will go alongside them.

393
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,836
We don't need to!
We can go around there-- off!

394
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,192
Damn it!

395
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,186
You're gonna want to be over here.

396
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:35,903
Kate, come on!

397
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:21,529
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fences.

398
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:22,918
You had a key!

399
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,675
They left me behind, too.
They gassed me.

400
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,012
I know that you don't care,

401
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:32,187
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with

402
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:33,568
they just left me!

403
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:39,369
I thought that maybe...

404
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,834
Maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together...

405
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,167
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

406
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:28,078
It's delicious!

407
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:30,723
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika...

408
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,384
I hope you'll remember
this little barbecue

409
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:37,235
- at your meeting later.
- Oh, what meeting?

410
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,613
Hurley told me about the vote.

411
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:44,414
Vote? Since when
did anyone around here vote?

412
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,002
You son of a bitch!

413
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:58,319
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

414
00:33:58,447 --> 00:33:59,447
But...

415
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,524
Wasn't it nice...

416
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:03,370
Being nice?

417
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,282
You tricked me into being decent?

418
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:07,963
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons!

419
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:09,314
It wasn't a con, dude.

420
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,571
If you're gonna be our temporary leader,
you need to do some damage control.

421
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:13,631
Leader?

422
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,312
What the hell are you smoking?

423
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,993
Jack's gone. Locke's gone.
Kate and Sayid...

424
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:22,134
You're all we got.

425
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,249
When Paulo and Nikki died,

426
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:26,089
we all looked to you.

427
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,570
Then again, you totally tried
to steal their diamonds,

428
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:30,093
but we wanted to look to you.

429
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:31,580
Look around.

430
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,098
You made everyone happy.

431
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:37,474
Just for today,

432
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,309
they can eat boar,

433
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:42,057
laugh and forget
that they're totally screwed.

434
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,173
And you did that for them, dude... You.

435
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,098
And what if I don't want
to be the leader?

436
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,631
Yeah, well, I don't think
Jack wanted to, either.

437
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:58,552
Sucks for you, dude.

438
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:34,177
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there.

439
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:35,662
I'll go get him.

440
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,072
You should get Jack.

441
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:58,797
Jack, wake up. It's me.

442
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,183
What happened?

443
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:11,684
They all left.

444
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,781
All left?

445
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,746
- What?
- Because of me.

446
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:27,058
I'm so sorry.

447
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,676
I should've listened to you.

448
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:31,809
I never...

449
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,605
I wanted to come back to help you...

450
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:43,801
but you didn't need me to.

451
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:50,846
And now because of me, you can't go...

452
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm so sorry.

453
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:16,417
They just...

454
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:19,432
Left?

455
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,617
Even Juliet?

456
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,079
No, they left her, too.

457
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:40,192
Why?

458
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,531
You know her better than I do.

459
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,550
Now what?

460
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,116
Now...

461
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:05,988
Now we go back.

462
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:43,551
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

463
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,531
So... this guy who ripped you off...

464
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,627
You wanna give me his name,
tell me where I can find him?

465
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,128
You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy.

466
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:58,266
I wanna help you.

467
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,146
I'm pregnant.

468
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,102
It's his. The baby's his,

469
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:10,310
and I still love him.

470
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:13,284
So call the cops. Have him locked up.

471
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:16,006
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

472
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,490
No, I won't.

473
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:31,533
Thanks, Lucy.

474
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:34,114
My name's Kate.

475
00:40:54,362 --> 00:40:55,362
You okay?

476
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:57,751
Yeah. You?

477
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,946
I've checked all the houses.
Everyone's gone.

478
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,432
No weapons, no trail.

479
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:24,116
It's like 50 people
disappeared into thin air.

480
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,149
We should take what we can find

481
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:29,261
and head out while we still got light.

482
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:35,657
She is not coming with us.

483
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:40,398
Yes, she is.

484
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Why?

485
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,979
Because they left her behind, too.
