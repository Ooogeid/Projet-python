00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,334
<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,169
Now talk.

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,297
Think of the island like a record
spinning on a turntable...

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,924
Only now, that record is skipping.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,594
Whatever Ben Linus did
down at the Orchid station

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,305
it may have

7
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,389
dislodged us.

8
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:16,974
Dislodged us from what?

9
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,184
Time.

10
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,591
Come on!

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,566
It's not stopping!

12
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,701
We have to go back to the Orchid.

13
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:38,329
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

14
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,206
This is all happening
because they left.

15
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,291
I think it'll stop
if I can bring them back.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,086
- Bring who back?
- Jack, Sun, Sayid,

17
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,337
Hugo, Kate.

18
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,297
Don't you want her to come back?

19
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,677
Sure you don't want us
to lower you down?

20
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:54,261
Where would be the fun in that?

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,855
John! Damn it, hold on!

22
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,071
I think you can let go of that now.

23
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,958
James, don't.

24
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,459
Come on! Help me!

25
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,382
Stop.

26
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,135
We can't help him.

27
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,510
Wherever John went, he's gone.

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,036
And wherever we are
is before that well was ever built.

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,269
Yeah, I'd say way before.

30
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,439
What makes you...

31
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:08,890
Can you hear me?

32
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,478
Can anyone hear me?

33
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,958
What the hell was that?

34
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:50,722
That one was different. It was...

35
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,680
That was more like an earthquake.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Wait!

37
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:10,136
Great.

38
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,362
My headache is gone.

39
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,911
Yeah, mine is too.

40
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,704
And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.

41
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,632
I think it's over.

42
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,636
I think John did it.

43
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,352
Now what?

44
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,816
Now we wait for him to come back.

45
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:57,427
For how long?

46
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,284
As long as it takes.

47
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:36,878
Are you kidding me?

48
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,361
I'm gone 10 minutes,
and you have a hootenanny?

49
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:43,157
Don't be such a bummer, man.
Rosie was just droppin' off brownies.

50
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,802
You should thank her.

51
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:48,309
She shouldn't be here, Jerry.
We're on the clock, man.

52
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,835
Mellow out, Phil.

53
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,761
What's gonna happen?

54
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:54,388
The polar bears are gonna figure
a way out of their cages?

55
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,674
That's not the point.

56
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,172
- If Lafleur finds out...
- He's not gonna find out anything.

57
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,584
- I'm gonna have to answer to him.
- Relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.

58
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,709
Guys?

59
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,834
What...

60
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,369
- Is that a hostile?
- I don't know.

61
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,316
Is that...

62
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,146
Horace?

63
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,633
He's got dynamite.

64
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:41,048
- Get her out of here now!
- Rosie, you gotta get outta here.

65
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,507
Don't tell anyone you were here.
Just go. Go!

66
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,321
Okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.

67
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,638
- We gotta get Lafleur.
- 3 AM. You want to wake him up?

68
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,723
- Of course not...
- We can handle this ourselves?

69
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,810
And maybe Horace blows himself up,
and Lafleur kills us for not waking him.

70
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,971
We gotta go now!

71
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,990
- Do you wanna knock?
- You knock.

72
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:09,597
Fine.

73
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,713
What?

74
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,591
Mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you, but
we got a situation out at the pylons.

75
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:29,068
What kind of situation?

76
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,930
It's Horace.

77
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,988
He's got dynamite,
and he's blowing up trees.

78
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,765
Son of a bitch.

79
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:59,825

80
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,832
Relax! I'm comin'!

81
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,365
- Hey, boss.
- Evening, Enos.

82
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,976
- You got your zapper with ya?
- Yep.

83
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,855
You wanna tell me why I need it?

84
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,523
'cause our fearless leader
is out blowing up trees.

85
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,751
Why's he doing that?

86
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,486
'cause he's loaded.

87
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:28,087
Since when does Horace drink?

88
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:31,116
He doesn't, so we're gonna
keep this on the down low.

89
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,710
Oh, man.

90
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,716
All right.

91
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,552
You put out that fire. Pack up
this dynamite. I'll take him home.

92
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,847
Why don't you put out the fire,
pack up, and I'll take him home?

93
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,016
You wanna tell Amy
where we found him?

94
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,939
Help me get him up.

95
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,880
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

96
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,698
- You tell me.
- Bring him inside.

97
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:16,795
The couch. The couch is fine.

98
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,256
- Where'd you find him?
- By the Flame,

99
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,323
blowing up trees with dynamite.

100
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,304
Wanna tell me why?

101
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,470
We had a fight.

102
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,336
Must've been a doozy.

103
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,807
Please, Jim.

104
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,518
- It's personal.
- Personal?

105
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,931
You think this isn't gonna get out?

106
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,106
It'll be on the coconut telegraph
by breakfast.

107
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:50,195
It was about Paul.

108
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:53,782
Go on.

109
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,703
What's the matter? You okay?

110
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,924
The baby... it's coming.

111
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,754
Oh, hell.

112
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,912
I'm not gonna tell her.

113
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,074
Don't even tell her. I won't.

114
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,365
- Where's Red?
- I don't know.

115
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,530
- I won't do it. Won't...
- Daniel?

116
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:35,662
You okay?

117
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,162
I'm not gonna do it.

118
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,134
I'm not gonna tell her.

119
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,625
Daniel, where's Charlotte?

120
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,002
She's not here.

121
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:52,591
She's gone.

122
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,241
Where?

123
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,263
She's... Dead.

124
00:09:58,922 --> 00:09:59,934
She's dead.

125
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,525
There was another flash, and...

126
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,158
And she was...

127
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:06,730
She was just gone.

128
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,967
Her... Body just...

129
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,530
disappeared.

130
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,745
She moved on, and we stayed.

131
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:26,621
I'm so sorry.

132
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,240
Hold on. Wait a minute.

133
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,464
We "stayed"?

134
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,589
We're not traveling through time
anymore? You saying it's over?

135
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,374
Of course it's over.

136
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,718
Wherever we are now...

137
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,695
Whenever we are now...

138
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,604
We're here for good.

139
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,378
I won't do it. I won't.

140
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:04,538
Okay. Swell.

141
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,838
Until Dan checks back in,
I say we head back to the beach.

142
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:10,687
When Locke gets back with everybody,
that's where they'll be looking for us.

143
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:14,506
The beach? What, you didn't get
enough flaming arrows shot at you?

144
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,301
And your camp is gone.

145
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:18,635
Why bother?

146
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,180
Sawyer's right, Miles.

147
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,434
We should go back to the beach.
We survived there before.

148
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,936
- We can do it again.
- Or maybe when we get there,

149
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,147
You'll wanna go back
to the Orchid again.

150
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,316
When that gets boring,
we head back to the beach.

151
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,337
It's the only two plans
you people have.

152
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:35,676
Hey, zip it.

153
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,612
I'm heading back to the beach.

154
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,365
If our stuff's there, great.
If not, we build new stuff.

155
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,686
You don't like the plan, good luck.

156
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,456
Who put him in charge?

157
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,721
Thanks for getting my back
for that whole beach issue.

158
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,389
You should thank me.
It was a stupid idea.

159
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,020
Well, what does that say
about you agreeing with me?

160
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,085
Any plan is better than no plan.
Besides, if I hadn't agreed with you,

161
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,724
we'd still be arguing
about where to go next.

162
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,266
I just hope you figure out
something better before we get there.

163
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:21,990
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

164
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,548
Oh, no! No, Paul!

165
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:46,098
Oh, God! Oh, God! No, no, no, no!
No, please! We didn't know!

166
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,227
Paul, please,
please do something. No, no.

167
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,401
No, no, no.
We were just touring this park.

168
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:56,316
We didn't mean anything.
We were just having... Paul, please.

169
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,767
Oh, my God! No!

170
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:04,991
No, Paul, please. Please.

171
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:06,451
Who do you think they are?

172
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,340
Who cares who they are?
We don't even know when they are.

173
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,209
We don't get involved, right?

174
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,159
That's what you said.

175
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,298
It doesn't matter what we do.

176
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,509
Whatever happened, happened.

177
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,431
Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato.
I'm going over there.

178
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:30,809
- You still got my back?
- Absolutely.

179
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,273
- Talk to me, Paul!
- On your feet!

180
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,733
- No, I can't! I can't!
- Come on, get up! Now!

181
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,270
All right, drop the gun!

182
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,724
It's all right.

183
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:13,126
It's okay. You're safe.

184
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,020
It's over.

185
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,353
Who are you?

186
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,420
Her friend's wearing
a Dharma jumpsuit.

187
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,503
That put us '70s, '80s.

188
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:42,297
- The guys with the bags... Others?
- Beats me.

189
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,467
- What, y'all don't know each other?
- Before my time.

190
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,929
Walkie.

191
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:51,982
We need to go.

192
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,266
I'm on it.

193
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:58,563
Listen, sweetheart,
we gotta get moving now.

194
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,826
Who are you people?

195
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,919
Our ship wrecked here
on the way to Tahiti.

196
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,831
But that ain't important right now,

197
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,841
'cause whoever's
on the other end of this...

198
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,117
Those two might've given 'em a call
before we saved you.

199
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,036
We have to bury them.

200
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,463
Bury them?
We ain't got time to bury nobody.

201
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:17,832
We have to. The truce.

202
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,669
Oh, God. We have to bury them.

203
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,453
And we have...

204
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,093
And we have to bring it...
him back home.

205
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,103
We have to bring Paul back with us.

206
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,556
Please.

207
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,482
I'll carry him.

208
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,612
We'll put these guys in the ground
and carry your friend back,

209
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:50,400
but we better do it fast.

210
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,735
He wasn't...

211
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,159
my friend.

212
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,183
He was my husband.

213
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,721
All right, listen up.

214
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,307
When we get there,
there's gonna be a lot of questions.

215
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,601
Keep your mouth shut.
Let me do the talking.

216
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,353
You really think you can convince them
that we were in a boat wreck?

217
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,796
I'm a professional.
I used to lie for a living.

218
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,025
Daniel! Stop!

219
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,546
Turn it off.

220
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,506
Turn what off?

221
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,009
It looks like some sort
of sonic fence or something.

222
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,425
Where did you say
your ship was going?

223
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,524
Listen, sister, we're the ones who just
saved your life and hid those bodies.

224
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,811
So how about you trust us
and turn that damn thing off?

225
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,442
Okay, fine.

226
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,099
"Sonic fence"?

227
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:23,124
- Didn't I say let me do the talking?
- Dan would've fry his brain.

228
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,542
His brain's already fried.

229
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,170
Okay, it's off.

230
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,345
You first.

231
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:43,407
See? It's fine.

232
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,940
All right, let's go.

233
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,235
And going forward, we should all
do a better job of trustin'...

234
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:10,881
It hurts!

235
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,967
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
Just try and relax.

236
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,890
Where's Horace?
Does he know his wife's in labor?

237
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,015
He's unavailable.

238
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,351
Amy's in a very dangerous situation.
The baby's breech.

239
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,270
- What does that mean?
- It's upside down.

240
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,939
- She needs a cesarean.
- Don't tell me about it. Just do it.

241
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,607
I'm not an obstetrician.

242
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,944
Our women deliver on the mainland.
Amy was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

243
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,446
The baby's two weeks early.

244
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:39,075
Can you deliver this baby or not?

245
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,015
I don't know.

246
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:52,281
Hey, man. Where is she?

247
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:05,894
- What's up?
- Amy's having her baby.

248
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:07,803
What?

249
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,098
Did you hear me?

250
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,650
She's in trouble.
Doc says she needs a cesarean.

251
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:15,904
We had an agreement.

252
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,819
Screw our agreement.

253
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,991
He ain't never done one.
I'm guessing you have.

254
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,575
Don't you understand

255
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,528
that every time I try to help a woman
on this island give birth,

256
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,540
it hasn't worked?

257
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:31,002
Well, maybe whatever made that happen
hasn't happened yet.

258
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,642
You gotta try. You gotta help her.
You're the only one that can.

259
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,061
The baby's breech.

260
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,072
Did you try
an external cephalic version?

261
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:51,356
It's probably too late.

262
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:53,277
I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel,

263
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,552
14-gauge sutures,
half-round if you've got them,

264
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,320
and an epidural anesthetic.

265
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,572
You're gonna need?
Where is Horace?

266
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,659
I'm speaking for Horace now,
and I say she's delivering this baby.

267
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,578
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- I want her.

268
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,247
I want her to do it.

269
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,307
You heard the lady.

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,926
Listen, you're gonna do great.

271
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,095
I know you are.

272
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:44,734
Is everything okay?

273
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,420
Amy went into labor.

274
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,019
I know.

275
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,398
Is she okay?

276
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,878
I don't know. There's a problem.

277
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,171
I pulled her out of retirement.

278
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,468
Any luck?

279
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:04,679
We finished grid 1-3-3 today.

280
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,829
No sign of our people. No one.

281
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,997
1-3-4 then.

282
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,816
How long do we look, James?

283
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,278
As long as it takes.

284
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,296
What happened?

285
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,276
It's a boy.

286
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,125
He's okay? She's okay?

287
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:38,402
Everyone's okay.

288
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:02,904
How's your head?

289
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:05,323
It hurts.

290
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:10,620
- Where are my people?
- They're fine.

291
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,832
Amy told me what happened in the jungle,
and I really appreciate what you did.

292
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:18,033
Well, y'all got a funny way
of showing your appreciation.

293
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,505
Look, we have
a certain defense protocol.

294
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,715
There are hostile indigenous people
on this island,

295
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,888
and we don't get along with them.

296
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:28,437
Why don't you tell me
who the hell you are?

297
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,477
My name's James Lafleur.
You can call me Jim.

298
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:36,838
How'd you get to the island, Jim?

299
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:40,692
If my friends are safe,
why are you asking me all the questions?

300
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,652
They told me I need to talk to you,

301
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,174
that you're the boat captain.

302
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:50,062
We got caught in a storm.
Our ship wrecked.

303
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:52,306
Must've hit the reef.

304
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,820
Thankfully, we washed up on shore.

305
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,013
- What kind of ship?
- A salvage vessel.

306
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,172
Searching for a famous lost wreck.

307
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:06,000
It's an old slaver
out of Portsmouth, England,

308
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,741
called "the black rock."

309
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,679
You heard of her?

310
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:11,507
Can't say that I have.

311
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,438
Once you got washed ashore, why were you
then wandering around in the jungle?

312
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:22,240
Some of our crew were missing.
We were looking for them.

313
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,616
That's when we came upon
your girl instead.

314
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,074
I tell you what.

315
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,618
If your crew shows up,
we'll send 'em along with ya.

316
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,287
Send 'em where?

317
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,520
There's a submarine that leaves
this island first thing in the morning.

318
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:39,698
You and your friends,
you're gonna get on it.

319
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:41,878
It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti.

320
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,356
You can find your way home
from there.

321
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:45,965
Hold on a minute, chief.

322
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,345
We just saved that woman's life.

323
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,554
Doesn't that earn us a week or two
to find the rest of our people?

324
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,422
Only people that are allowed
to stay on this compound

325
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:56,684
are members
of the Dharma Initiative.

326
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,146
And look, I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, please, Jim, but

327
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,690
you are not Dharma material.

328
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:09,795
We're screwed.

329
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,128
He's probably trying to explain
time travel by now.

330
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:16,245
- Sawyer's gonna be fine.
- What are you looking at?

331
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,421
I lived here for over three years.
That was my house over there.

332
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,799
You were in the Dharma Initiative?

333
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:32,113
The others took over these barracks

334
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,697
and wiped out most of the people
living in them.

335
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,140
They brought me here on a sub
a long time after that.

336
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:40,837
Well... Welcome home.

337
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,133
No more flash?

338
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,032
No more flash.

339
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:57,161
The record is spinning again.

340
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,609
We're just not on the song
we wanna be on.

341
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,158
- Where's dad?
- Come on, luv.

342
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:23,887
Charlotte.

343
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:31,100
Somebody will be along shortly
to show you to your rooms.

344
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:35,167
In the meantime, Mr. Lafleur here
can fill you in on the situation.

345
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:41,581
- "Mr. Lafleur"?
- It's Creole.

346
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:44,597
- I improvised.
- What happened in there?

347
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:47,461
He believed my story.
But we're getting punted.

348
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:51,299
Bastard's putting us on their sub
tomorrow and shipping us off to Tahiti.

349
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:53,072
How's that bad news?

350
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,055
- You guys, come on! Now!
- Let's go!

351
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,773
Get in! Get in! Move!

352
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,158
Come on! Inside! Move! Now!

353
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,156
Heather, keep an eye on them.

354
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:28,193
Hello, Mr. Alpert.

355
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:32,309
- Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.
- I wish you would've told me

356
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,568
you were coming.
I would've turned the fence off.

357
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
That fence may keep
other things out, but not us.

358
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,575
The only thing that does keep us out,
Horace,

359
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:43,332
is our truce...

360
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,288
Which you've now broken.

361
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:48,082
I don't know
what you're talking about.

362
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,600
Where are my two men?

363
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:56,841
You know what?

364
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,201
Getting on that sub
is starting to sound like a great idea.

365
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:03,080
- What do you say? Sub anyone?
- Hold your horses, Banzai.

366
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,692
No one's getting on a sub.

367
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,527
Okay, Lafleur, how well
did you bury those bodies?

368
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,772
That depends on how hard he looks.

369
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:15,735
Call the Arrow.
Tell them we're at condition one.

370
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,112
Take the heavy ordnance,
and make sure

371
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,272
- the fence is at maximum.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:28:21,152 --> 00:28:23,075
- Let me talk to him.
- Excuse me?

373
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,502
Your buddy with the eyeliner,
let me talk to him.

374
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:28,029
We had a truce with these people.
You don't understand.

375
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:30,190
I understand I'm the one
that killed his men,

376
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:33,127
- and I'm gonna tell him why I did it.
- I can't let you do that.

377
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:36,339
It's a good thing
I ain't asking your permission.

378
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,009
James, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

379
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,471
Not yet.
But I'll figure something out.

380
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,527
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

381
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:02,314
I'm the guy that killed your men.

382
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:09,155
Heard some gunshots, saw two men
throwing a bag over a woman's head.

383
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,875
Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons
and walk away,

384
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,961
but one of them took a shot at me,
and I defended myself.

385
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,043
- Is that so?
- That's so.

386
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,521
Your people know
that you're telling me this?

387
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,055
They ain't my people, hoss.

388
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,921
So if you got some kind of a truce
with them, it ain't been broken.

389
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,312
If you're not a member of the Dharma
Initiative, then what are you?

390
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,238
Did you bury the bomb?

391
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,702
- Excuse me?
- The hydrogen bomb with "Jughead"

392
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,411
- written on the side. Did you bury it?
- How...

393
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:50,776
Yeah, I know about it.

394
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:55,174
I also know that 20 years ago,
some bald fella limped into your camp

395
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:57,957
and fed you some mumbo jumbo
about being your leader.

396
00:29:58,566 --> 00:29:59,866
And then poof...

397
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,342
He disappeared right in front of ya.
Does it ring a bell?

398
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,785
That man's name is John Locke,

399
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,600
and I'm waiting for him
to come back.

400
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,605
So... You still think I'm a member
of the damn Dharma Initiative?

401
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,630
I guess I don't.

402
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:28,886
But no matter who you are,
two of my men are dead.

403
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:32,659
And my people need
some kind of justice.

404
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,333
What are we gonna do about that?

405
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,792
How are you doing, Amy?

406
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,086
Is he gone?

407
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,917
- Alpert?
- No, he's not gone.

408
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:04,587
- We told him where the bodies were.
- You told him? Why?

409
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,113
We had to.

410
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:09,263
It was the only way
to maintain the truce.

411
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,161
Jim here worked it out
with him, but...

412
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:15,623
He's gonna need
something from us now.

413
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,919
He needs to take Paul's body
back with him.

414
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:32,289
Listen, we've been friends
for a long time, yeah?

415
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:34,181
So,

416
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,889
this is completely your choice.

417
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,718
If you don't wanna give him to them,

418
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:42,623
then we will suffer
the consequences.

419
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,920
They can take him.

420
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,376
He would want to keep us safe.

421
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,592
Can I have a minute, please?

422
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,663
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:49,049
You need some help?

424
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:52,662
Nah, I've got it. Thanks.

425
00:32:56,537 --> 00:33:00,087
The sub leaving tomorrow morning...
It returns in two weeks.

426
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,863
Until then,

427
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:05,316
you can stay
and look for the rest of your crew.

428
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:21,562
I bought us two weeks.

429
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,740
Horace said we can wait
for the next sub.

430
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:28,146
Any luck, Locke'll be back by then.

431
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:30,178
And then what?

432
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,615
What do you mean, "then what"?

433
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:36,847
Locke said he was leaving
to save us.

434
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,750
The flashes have stopped.

435
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:42,332
They're over.

436
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:46,523
No more bloody noses...
We're already saved.

437
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,801
That sub behind you brought me here.

438
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,652
I've been trying to get off
of this island for more than 3 years

439
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,627
and now I've got my chance.

440
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,277
I'm going to leave.

441
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:05,667
You do realize

442
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,536
it's 1974,

443
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:10,910
that whatever it is
you think you're going back to...

444
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:12,466
It don't exist yet.

445
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,427
It's not a reason not to go.

446
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:20,974
What about me?

447
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,938
You really gonna leave me here
with the mad scientist

448
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,090
and Mr. "I speak to dead people"?

449
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:29,400
And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy

450
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,409
but not exactly
the greatest conversationalist.

451
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:33,612
You'll be fine.

452
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:36,659
Maybe...
But who's gonna get my back?

453
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,019
Come on.

454
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,303
Just give me two weeks,
that's all I'm asking.

455
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,043
Two weeks.

456
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:04,810
All right. Two weeks.

457
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,623
Something smells good.

458
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:55,755
Hey there.

459
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,251
Is that for me?

460
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,119
You were amazing today.

461
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,977
Thank you for believing in me.

462
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:43,925
I love you.

463
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:47,364
I love you, too.

464
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:03,428
Wake up, boss.

465
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,851
How's your head?

466
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,601
It hurts.

467
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:15,738
I got good news and bad news.

468
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,776
What you want first?

469
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:20,845
Good news.

470
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,156
You're a daddy.

471
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:27,619
Bad news is you missed it.

472
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:30,495
Gosh.

473
00:37:31,337 --> 00:37:33,479
Amy... She had the baby?

474
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,303
It's a boy.

475
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
A boy?

476
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,058
Now how about you tell me why you're
too busy drinking and blowing up trees

477
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,222
to see him be born?

478
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:54,094
I was...

479
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,682
I was looking for a pair of socks,

480
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,988
and all of mine were dirty, so I went
to grab a pair of Amy's, and...

481
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,849
I found this...

482
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:12,336
In the back of her drawer.

483
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:14,047
It was Paul's.

484
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,669
- You got in a fight over a necklace?
- I know.

485
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:21,659
But...

486
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:24,075
It's only been three years, Jim.

487
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:27,796
Just three years
that he's been gone.

488
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:31,605
Is that really long enough
to get over someone?

489
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:42,027
I had a thing for a girl once.

490
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,333
And I had a shot at her,

491
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,132
but I didn't take it.

492
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:54,373
For a little while,
I'd lay in bed every night, wondering

493
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,421
if it was a mistake.

494
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,186
Wondering if...

495
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,590
I'd ever stop thinking about her.

496
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:11,357
And now I can barely remember
what she looks like.

497
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,030
I mean, her face is...

498
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:17,804
She's just gone,

499
00:39:19,118 --> 00:39:21,218
and she ain't never coming back.

500
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,710
So...

501
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:28,699
Is 3 years long enough
to get over someone?

502
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,353
Absolutely.

503
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:05,758
What?

504
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:09,307
Wait. What?

505
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,790
Don't bring 'em in.

506
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,829
Just meet me in the north valley.

507
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,610
Who was it?

508
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:27,790
- What's going on?
- It was Jin.

509
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,151
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah...

510
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,228
I gotta go.
