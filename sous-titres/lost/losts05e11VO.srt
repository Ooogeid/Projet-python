<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:03,586
This is your daughter.

3
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:05,546
Her name's Clementine.

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,048
Those are
fake necklaces.

5
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:09,467
- I'll take the one on the end.
- Why'd you help me?

6
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,386
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

7
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:19,310
- Why are you telling me this?
- Just do it, freckles.

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,689
I think we should say he's mine.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,566
There's other ways to do this.

10
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:27,693
After everyone we've lost,

11
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,695
I can't lose him, too.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,760
My client insists that we...

13
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,493
handle the exchange
of custody quietly.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,787
You are going to lose the boy.

15
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,914
That's Claire's mother.

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,542
Everything that Kate and I have done,
it was for Aaron.

17
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,878
Who's... Aaron?

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,260
I'm Ben.

19
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,221
It's nice to meet you, Ben.

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:58,349
If I let you out,

21
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,184
will you take me with you

22
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,645
- to your people?
- That's why I'm here.

23
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,903
- Jin?
- What are you doing here?

24
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:22,864
<i>Hello, Jin?</i>

25
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:24,974
<i>Are you there?</i>

26
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,887
<i>Jin, can you hear me?</i>

27
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,434
<i>Jin? It's Phil, man.
Where have you been?</i>

28
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:37,191
<i>The hostile escaped.
We're searching the east grid.</i>

29
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:38,889
He's headed north.

30
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,277
<i>How the hell do you know that?</i>

31
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,047
Because he attacked me.

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,444
<i>What? Where are you?</i>

33
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,440
<i>Jin? Are you still there?</i>

34
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,666
Please help.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,761
Okay, everybody, listen up.

36
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,896
We don't know yet
if another attack is coming.

37
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:23,550
So everybody needs to be ready
for your security assignments, okay?

38
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,700
Make sure you're in contact
with your team leaders.

39
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,084
Lafleur's got search parties out,

40
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:32,234
but the hostile's got
a good jump on us.

41
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,197
We're pretty sure he used this fire
as a diversion in order to escape.

42
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,179
Is he talking about Sayid?

43
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,216
If he was locked up,
how could he start the fire?

44
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,108
- Who are you?
- Jack Shephard. I'm...

45
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,709
I'm new.

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,546
Well, Jack, the way he started the fire
is he had help.

47
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,465
Okay?
Somebody torched that van,

48
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,842
and then that somebody
let him out of his cell.

49
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,220
And since the security cameras
didn't pick up

50
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,222
any hostiles crossing the perimeter,

51
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,475
that means it was one of us.

52
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,313
Baxter, I want a full report
on cleanup ASAP.

53
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,917
You got it, Horace.

54
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:16,869
Hey, you.

55
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:19,578
Yeah, you.

56
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,478
You're in the motor pool, right?

57
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,679
Do you mind running
that winch for me?

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,629
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

59
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:30,835
Okay, no worries.

60
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:33,921
Just throw this lever. When I tell you
to stop... Just pull it up.

61
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,631
- All right.
- See? Simple.

62
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,508
- Don't do it till I'm ready.
- Okay.

63
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,017
All right, crank her up.

64
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,145
So they just stuck you in the motor pool
when you got here?

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,107
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah, same thing happened to me.

66
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,777
Wait, hold it there.
That's good. Right there.

67
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:59,451
I guess they couldn't sucker
anybody into getting on that sub

68
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,867
if they told us we were gonna be
grease monkeys and janitors.

69
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,826
Well, you gotta start
somewhere, right?

70
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,084
- What's your name?
- I'm Kate.

71
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:12,459
Welcome aboard, Kate.
I'm Roger. Roger Linus.

72
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,645
It's nice to meet you, Roger.

73
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,143
That's my kid.

74
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,739
That's my kid!

75
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,523
Hi, handsome.

76
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,977
Did you have a good sleep?

77
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:19,481
Yeah, that's my boy.

78
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,671
- Oh, my god!
- Hi, Cassidy.

79
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,890
Oh, my god!
I saw you on the news!

80
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,766
I told all my friends,
"I know that woman!"

81
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,936
- This is Aaron.
- Hi, Aaron.

82
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:55,539
Say hi.

83
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,439
You survived a plane crash.

84
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,109
It's amazing.

85
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,820
I never thought I'd see you again.
What are you doing here?

86
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,310
Sawyer sent me.

87
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:28,972

88
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:34,059
So that son of a bitch
is still alive?

89
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,812
He was when I left.

90
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:40,774
And he asked you to come here
and give me an envelope full of money?

91
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:44,551
Well, he told me
where to find you, and...

92
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,516
said to take care of Clementine...

93
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,414
- His daughter?
- She's asleep in her crib right now.

94
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,413
Want me to wake her up?

95
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,045
I shouldn't have bothered you.

96
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,381
I could've sent it,
and I probably should have.

97
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,355
Why did you tell me all this?

98
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,238
Why'd you trust me?

99
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,222
Because I thought your daughter had
a right to know that her father cared.

100
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,601
Why didn't he come back
with the rest of you?

101
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:20,221
The helicopter that we were on
was running out of gas,

102
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,317
so he jumped
so that we could make it to the boat.

103
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,363
What a coward.

104
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,950
He was trying to do the right thing.

105
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,203
He was trying to get away from you.

106
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,065
I told him he had a daughter.

107
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,667
He never so much as lifted
a finger to try to call her.

108
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,875
So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero
because he told you to help us?

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,257
Hell, I bet this money's
not even his, is it?

110
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,067
They gave us a settlement
after the crash,

111
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:55,010
- and I didn't need it all...
- You don't have to explain it, Kate.

112
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:59,144
You got the same look on your face
I did when he ditched me.

113
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,275
All I have for you is sympathy.

114
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,283
Is it his?

115
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,031
- What?
- Your son.

116
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,826
Is it Sawyer's?

117
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,753
No, I was...

118
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,144
pregnant before I met him.

119
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,843
That's not your baby, is it?

120
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,814
Kate, you just told me
that you and your friends

121
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:40,686
cooked a story for the whole world
about what happened on that island.

122
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,856
So you tell me the truth about that?

123
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,497
Why are you lying to me about him?

124
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,886
Because I have to.

125
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,071
What happened?

126
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,365
- What the hell are you doing here?
- That was Ben.

127
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,231
That kid who was shot was Ben.

128
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,358
Was it Sayid?
Did he shoot him?

129
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:31,695
You need to keep your mouth shut
and stop asking questions.

130
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,573
'cause putting any attention on yourself
is the last thing I need right now.

131
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,784
- Now scram. I don't want you here.
- I just wanna know what's going on.

132
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:44,082
What...
What's she doing here?

133
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:46,955
- This is...
- I'm Kate.

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,921
Kate.
She's new over at the motor pool.

135
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,201
I was seeing if she saw anything
suspicious, but she didn't, so...

136
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,759
You can run along, thanks.

137
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,255
Have you checked out
the hostile's cell yet?

138
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,768
I was a little busy trying to keep
the town from burnin' down.

139
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,686
Okay. Well, then let's do it.

140
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,781
He didn't break out.
Somebody let him out.

141
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,447
These are janitor's keys.

142
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:18,945
We've only got three janitors.
There's Roger,

143
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,079
Willie and, that new guy.
I just met him.

144
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,357
- His name's Jack.
- Yeah.

145
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,528
I just brought him in from the sub.
I'll talk to him.

146
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,127
- Miles, you wanna come with me?
- Yeah, sure, boss.

147
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,519
All right, I want you to find Jack
and Hurley and Kate as quick as you can.

148
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,951
- Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.
- What for?

149
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:41,165
I don't want 'em talking to anybody.
Things start to spin out of control.

150
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,284
- All right, I got it.
- All right, go.

151
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,487
Who did this?
Do you know who did this to my son?

152
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:54,161
- We're working on it. How's he doing?
- I don't know.

153
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,274
Juliet told me to wait out here.

154
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,824
- Let me see if I can get an update.
- Thanks, Jim.

155
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,919
- You happen to have your keys with you?
- Yeah. Why? What do you need?

156
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,669
I must've left them at the house.

157
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,892
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

158
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,628
More gauze.

159
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,472
Here's some gauze.

160
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,485
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging,
we're just gonna have to pack the tract.

161
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,327
Where's the doctor?

162
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,441
At the looking glass station
till Friday.

163
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,723
- How is he doing?
- Not well.

164
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:35,652
Hook him.

165
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,822
He's still bleeding in there somewhere,
and I can't fix it.

166
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,436
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

167
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,038
Someone needs to get in there

168
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:45,381
who can find the damage
that bullet did and fix it.

169
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,955
He needs a real surgeon.

170
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:57,257
You're telling us
we're under house arrest?

171
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:00,123
No, you're all free to leave
whenever you want...

172
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,678
But I'll shoot you in the leg.

173
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:06,641
- And whose idea was this?
- Who do you think?

174
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,145
Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.

175
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:19,321
- What the hell are you doing, tubby?
- Checking to see if I'm disappearing.

176
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,907
- What?
"Back to the future," man.

177
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,202
We came back in time to the island
and changed stuff.

178
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,399
So if little Ben dies,
he'll never grow up to be big Ben,

179
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,624
who made us come back here
in the first place.

180
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,906
Which means we can't be here.
And therefore, dude,

181
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:35,170
we don't exist.

182
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,328
You're an idiot.

183
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:41,968
- Am I?
- Yeah. It doesn't work like that.

184
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,220
You can't change anything.

185
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:48,061
You're maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus.
That is what always happened.

186
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,226
It's just...

187
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,085
We never experienced
how it all turns out.

188
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:59,319
- This is really confusing.
- Yeah, well, get used to it.

189
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:03,007
But the good news
is that Linus didn't die,

190
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,963
so that means the kid can't either.
He'll be fine.

191
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:10,064
Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.
What if you're wrong?

192
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,092
Well, if I'm wrong,
then I guess we all stop existing,

193
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,710
and none of it
matters anyway then, does it?

194
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,183
Doc, I need you to come with me.

195
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:23,718
Where?

196
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,636
Juliet said the kid's losing blood,
and we got none to put back in him.

197
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,074
So we need you to show us
where he sprung a leak.

198
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,150
What?

199
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,318
No, I'm not coming with you.

200
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,697
If you don't come with me, Jack,
that kid's gonna die.

201
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,670
Then he dies.

202
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,808
What are you doing?

203
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,031
Making some sandwiches. I figured
everybody'd be getting hungry by now.

204
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,443
He's just a boy, Jack.
You can't just let him die.

205
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,188
You heard miles.

206
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,074
We can't change what's already happened.
This has nothing to do with me.

207
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:30,118
Unless you're supposed to save him.

208
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,597
30 years from now,
that boy's gonna be a man

209
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:37,375
that locks me in a cage
because he needs surgery.

210
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:41,101
And then you're gonna come in
and beg me to operate on him

211
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:44,009
because he's threatening
to murder Sawyer.

212
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,626
I've already done this once.

213
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:50,096
I've already saved Benjamin Linus,
and I did it for you, Kate.

214
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,320
I don't need to do it again.

215
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,246
This is our fault.

216
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,734
We brought Sayid back.
We caused this.

217
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:05,917
When we were here before, I spent
all of my time trying to fix things.

218
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,129
But...

219
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,408
Did you ever think that maybe the island
just wants to fix things itself?

220
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:13,965
And maybe I was just...

221
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:16,324
Gettin' in the way?

222
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,419
You know, I don't like the new you.

223
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,163
I liked the old you,

224
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:25,674
who wouldn't just sit around
and wait for things to happen.

225
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,092
You didn't like the old me, Kate.

226
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,361
Where are you going?

227
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:50,907
Just relax.

228
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,250
You're okay.

229
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:57,228
I'm sorry. Juliet?

230
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,454
One of the new people is here.

231
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,678
She heard Ben need blood,
says she's a universal donor.

232
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,888
This might hurt for a second.

233
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:17,462
Good.

234
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,802
Very brave.

235
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:24,780
James told me that Jack wouldn't help,
but he didn't say why.

236
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,663
If I knew why Jack does what he does,
I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.

237
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,532
Off island,
did something happen with you two?

238
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:35,493
We were engaged.

239
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,163
Does that count?

240
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:44,448
- What's going on?
- Roger, I asked you to wait outside.

241
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,876
What's going on with my kid?

242
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,174
Kate is giving us some fresh blood
so we can transfuse Ben.

243
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:54,063
- Well, I'm not waitin' outside.
- You know, he could stay with me,

244
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,986
and you could check on Ben,

245
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:59,476
and Roger here could keep me company,
make sure I don't pass out.

246
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,731
Okay. Roger, have a seat.

247
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,239
- Thanks.
- Sure.

248
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,954
- He stole my keys.
- Sorry?

249
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,491
Lafleur asked me where my keys were.

250
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,947
That bastard doesn't ask any questions
he doesn't know the answers to...

251
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,514
Which means my son stole my keys

252
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:32,092
so he could bust
that animal out of jail.

253
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,552
Why would he do that?

254
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:38,279
Because of me.

255
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,106
You got kids?

256
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,345
I thought I was gonna be
the greatest father ever.

257
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,306
You know?

258
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:00,216
I guess it didn't work out that way.

259
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:03,740
What about his mother?
Is she still around?

260
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,257
No, she's dead.

261
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,621
She died the day he was born.

262
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,018
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:14,690
Yeah, me, too.

264
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,501
I tried to do what I thought
she'd want me to do,

265
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:22,521
but...

266
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,854
I guess a boy just needs his mother.

267
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,197
- What's going on?
- He's going into hypoxic shock.

268
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,867
- What does that mean?
- He needs more oxygen. Get out of here.

269
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,702
- What?
- Get him out of here!

270
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,037
- Please, Roger, just wait outside.
- Wait a minute.

271
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:49,894
Let me get this straight.

272
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,505
All this already happened.

273
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:57,694
So this conversation
we're having right now...

274
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,232
We already had it.

275
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,632
Then what am I gonna say next?

276
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:06,603
- I don't know.
- Then your theory is wrong!

277
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,921
For the thousandth time, you dingbat,
the conversation already happened,

278
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:13,825
but not for you and me.
For you and me,

279
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,695
it's happening right now.

280
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,697
Okay, answer me this.

281
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,630
If all this already happened to me,

282
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,370
then...
Why don't I remember any of it?

283
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,207
Because once Ben turned that wheel,

284
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,695
time

285
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:31,901
isn't a straight line for us
anymore.

286
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,421
Our experiences in the past

287
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,790
and the future

288
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:39,874
occurred before
these experiences right now.

289
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,332
Say that again.

290
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,011
Shoot me. Please. Please?

291
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,192
I can't shoot you.

292
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,194
Because if you die in 1977,

293
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,739
you'll never come back to the island
on the freighter 30 years from now.

294
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,741
I can die, because

295
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,063
I've already come to the island
on the freighter.

296
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,286
Any of us can die

297
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:08,961
- because this is our present.
- But you said Ben couldn't die

298
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,376
because he has to grow up
to become the leader of the Others.

299
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,121
Because this is his past.

300
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,987
But when we first captured Ben,
and Sayid, like, tortured him,

301
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,914
then why wouldn't he remember
getting shot

302
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,289
by that same guy when he was a kid?

303
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,694
I hadn't thought of that.

304
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,458
How is he?

305
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,397
- He's stable.
- Is he gonna be okay?

306
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:56,399
He's got some fresh blood running
through him, which is a good thing.

307
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,519
I need you to go out
to the medical station.

308
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:01,412
There're some supplies there
that we don't have here.

309
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:04,201
Okay. I just wanna say...

310
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:08,275
I wanna say thanks. I know
that you're doing everything you can...

311
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,850
To save him, and...

312
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:15,058
All right, I'm gonna go, okay?

313
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,456
Is he any better?

314
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:26,436
He is stable now.

315
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,539
But I can't...

316
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,630
I can't fix it.

317
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,964
What about the sub?
Can we take him somewhere?

318
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,169
No.  It won't be back
for a couple of months.

319
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,880
- But he can't die, right?
- He is going to die.

320
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,051
He is in a medical situation
that is not resolvable.

321
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,212
Well, we can't just sit here
and do nothing.

322
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,306
There's got to be someone
who can help him. We have entire...

323
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:54,776
What?

324
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,278
Maybe there's something they can do.

325
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:04,530
"They"?

326
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,889
The Others.

327
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,590
You got him?

328
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,009
- Ready?
- One, two, three, go.

329
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,645
Okay, let's go.

330
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:41,038
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

331
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:42,521
If something goes wrong

332
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:45,185
it doesn't matter for me,
but you've got a whole life here.

333
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,680
And besides, if Sawyer knew I got you
involved in this, he'd kill me.

334
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,555
How are you gonna manage?

335
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:53,027
I'll manage. Don't worry.

336
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:57,600
Kate, Sawyer's gonna find out
Ben's gone,

337
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,752
and I'll have
to tell him what happened.

338
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:03,256
But I'll give you as much
of a head start as I can.

339
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:04,590
Good luck.

340
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,167
There's someone...

341
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:19,439
Someone here in Los Angeles.

342
00:23:20,203 --> 00:23:21,816
- Let me take you to them.
- Who?

343
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,599
The same person that's gonna show us
how to get back the island.

344
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,134
Is that what this is about?

345
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,238
- You knew about this.
- No. I was...

346
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,475
That's why you pretended
to care about Aaron,

347
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,655
- to convince me to go back?
- I wasn't pretending!

348
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,249
This is insane. You are crazy.

349
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:39,622
Jack, don't!

350
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,486
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

351
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,048
I need some milk.

352
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,342
Do you want chocolate milk
or regular milk?

353
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,644
Juice box.

354
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,759
- You don't want milk anymore?
- Juice box.

355
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,367
Excuse me.
Where are you juice boxes?

356
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,289
- Aisle 5.
- Thank you very much.

357
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,376
Excuse me, have you seen my son?

358
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,898
- I'm sorry?
- A little 3-year-old blond?

359
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,868
Excuse me. I've lost my son.

360
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:08,256
- He's 3, a little blond boy.
- Don't worry, ma'am.

361
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,345
- I'll make an announcement.
- No, you have to seal off the store...

362
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:18,891
Honey, is this your mommy?

363
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,126
I found him in the fruit section.
He looked lost.

364
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,432
I was getting ready
to make an announcement.

365
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,360
Thank you very much.

366
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,111
It's okay, honey, mommy's got you.

367
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:37,958
Mommy's got you.

368
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:10,141
- Tell my...
- Try not to talk, okay?

369
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,019
Tell my dad
I'm sorry I stole his keys.

370
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:39,972
I know you gotta stop me...

371
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,443
But I can't just let that kid die.

372
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,349
Damn it, freckles.
I ain't here to stop you.

373
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:52,276
I'm here to help you.

374
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:11,036
- Hi, auntie Kate!
- Hi, Clementine.

375
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,574
- Is your mommy home?
- Sure. I'll go get her.

376
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,650
They're going back?
To the island?

377
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,536
Why in God's name
would they wanna do that?

378
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,037
I don't know.

379
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:24,600
Jack says
that we weren't supposed to leave.

380
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:28,104
Well, Jack sounds
like a piece of work.

381
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:30,898
You look exhausted. Drink this.

382
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,235
Curl up on my bed. Take a nap.
I'll watch your fella.

383
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,273
I lost him.

384
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:42,348
What?

385
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,213
I don't know what happened.
We were in the supermarket,

386
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:49,413
and I turned around for one second,
and he was gone.

387
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,289
And, you know,
the crazy thing is, is that...

388
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,030
As scared as I was...

389
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,080
I wasn't surprised.

390
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,629
All I could think was,

391
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:07,122
it's about time.

392
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,010
Why would I feel that way? I mean,
why would I expect him to be taken?

393
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:19,702
Because you took him, Kate.

394
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:24,596
No, I...

395
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:27,401
Claire was gone.

396
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,207
I mean, she left him.

397
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:32,605
I had to take him. He needed me.

398
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,517
You needed him.

399
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,170
Sawyer broke your heart.

400
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,859
How else
were you supposed to fix it?

401
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:06,150
Figure out how you were gonna
carry him out there by yourself?

402
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,136
The line's just right over there, right?
The others are on the other side.

403
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,290
Well, they ain't
right on the other side.

404
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,293
We better get movin'.

405
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:18,347
Why are you doing this?
Why are you helping me?

406
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:24,238
When I found out Ben was gone,
and Juliet told me what you were up to,

407
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,723
I asked that exact damn question...
Why are you helping Ben?

408
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:32,566
And she said...

409
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,501
No matter what he's gonna grow up to be,
it's wrong to let a kid die.

410
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:41,797
So...

411
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,076
That's why I'm doing this.

412
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:50,746
I'm doing it for her.

413
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:08,055
Where's Jack?

414
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:11,350
He's in the shower, I think.
Is he in trouble?

415
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,316
I just need to talk to him.

416
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,229
You two mind giving us some privacy?

417
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,957
Ask me more questions
about time travel.

418
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,831
I needed you.

419
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:35,617
I'm sorry?

420
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:38,377
That kid was bleeding out.
You're a surgeon,

421
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,838
- and I need you.
- That kid is Ben.

422
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,132
That's not Ben yet.
He's just a kid.

423
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:46,015
Juliet, I'm sorry.

424
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,681
- I can't help you.
- I'm not asking for your help.

425
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,764
You made it pretty clear
you weren't interested.

426
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:54,351
It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.

427
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:57,897
- What?
- She's trying to save him,

428
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:00,065
and I sent James after her to help

429
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,485
because they actually care.

430
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:07,031
I came back here because I care, Juliet.
Because I was trying to save you.

431
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,325
We didn't need saving!

432
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:12,200
We've been fine for three years.

433
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:14,790
You came back here for you.

434
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,130
At least do me the courtesy
of telling me why.

435
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,459
I came back...

436
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:32,297
Because I was supposed to.

437
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,868
Supposed to do what?

438
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:38,993
I don't know yet.

439
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:43,954
Well, you'd better figure it out.

440
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,342
You know,
I can take him for a while.

441
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:00,668
Sure you can.

442
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:07,025
You know, his father said
that you think Ben broke Sayid out.

443
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:12,133
Kid'll do almost anything
if he's pissed off enough at his folks.

444
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:15,057
Is that why you asked me
to take care of your daughter?

445
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:22,601
Did you?

446
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:24,636
Of course I did.

447
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:28,245
Go ahead and tip his head back.

448
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,629
- What's she like?
- Clementine?

449
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,473
Yeah. Clementine.

450
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:35,309
Oh, she's beautiful.

451
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,574
Looks just like you when she smiles.

452
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:42,960
She's growing up fast.
Already has a little attitude.

453
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,333
I bet you and Cassidy
had a lot to talk about.

454
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:51,247
She had an interesting theory
on why you jumped off the chopper.

455
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:53,262
Yeah? What's that?

456
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:56,223
She thought you were worried
about what would happen if you didn't.

457
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,483
You and me would've never
worked out, Kate.

458
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,767
I wasn't any more fit
to be your boyfriend

459
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:15,294
than I am to be
that little girl's father.

460
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,798
You seem to be doing
all right with Juliet.

461
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:25,783
I've done a lot of growing up
in the past three years.

462
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,589
Hands up!

463
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:32,244
Do not move.

464
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,348
I said don't move.
This is a violation of the truce.

465
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,060
- You're over the line.
- We know. This kid's been shot.

466
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,298
That's both of our problems.
So unless you want to go to war,

467
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,483
you're gonna take us
to Richard Alpert,

468
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:49,513
and you're gonna do it now.

469
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:09,334
Mrs. Littleton, I'm Kate Austen.

470
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,008
I know who you are.

471
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:17,971
Come in.

472
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:19,981
Thank you.

473
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:29,358
Your friend, Dr. Shephard,
came here last night,

474
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:32,653
going on and on
about some person named Aaron.

475
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,895
When I asked him who that was,

476
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,243
he ran out of here
like the room was on fire.

477
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,018
He's your grandson.

478
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,511
And your daughter Claire...

479
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,216
is alive.

480
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,173
What are you talking about?

481
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:03,892
- Claire died in the plane crash.
- No, she survived.

482
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,646
When we crashed, your daughter
was eight months pregnant, and...

483
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:10,899
She's the one who gave birth
on the island, not me.

484
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,485
We lied.

485
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,864
There were other survivors, too.
We just left them behind.

486
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,111
Why?

487
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,327
Why would you leave her there?

488
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,247
Because she disappeared,

489
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,709
and she left the baby behind.
We looked everywhere, but...

490
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,005
That's when I started
taking care of Aaron.

491
00:35:36,563 --> 00:35:38,606
And when we were rescued,
we didn't...

492
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,018
We had to decide
what to do with him.

493
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:44,892
And I knew that she had wanted him
to be adopted, but I couldn't.

494
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,956
I had to protect him,

495
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:51,507
so I said he was mine.

496
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,453
Why did you lie?

497
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:57,780
Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

498
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:03,930
Because I need him.

499
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:10,788
I'm sorry.

500
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:18,842
You're gonna see
that he's so sweet and kind and good.

501
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,809
Where is he?

502
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:31,621
I checked in two doors down.
He's asleep.

503
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:35,485
I know that this is
a lot for you to handle.

504
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
But...

505
00:36:39,272 --> 00:36:42,207
When you're ready,
he's waiting for you.

506
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,315
I told him
that you're his grandmother,

507
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:51,124
that you'll take care of him
while I'm gone

508
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,370
and that I'll be back soon.

509
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:57,334
Where are you going?

510
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,738
I'm going back
to find your daughter.

511
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,493
Bye-bye, baby.

512
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:32,204
Don't worry.
We got 'em right where we want 'em.

513
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:33,885
Shut up and keep movin'.

514
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,759
What's it look like I'm doing?

515
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:36,980
Hello there, James.

516
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:41,860
Where did you come from?

517
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,529
You asked my people
to bring you to me. Here I am.

518
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:48,302
Is that Benjamin Linus?

519
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:50,702
You two know each other?

520
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,667
- What happened to him?
- He was shot.

521
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:59,586
- And who might you be?
- She's with me.

522
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,381
Why are you here?

523
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,205
'cause we need you to save his life.

524
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:06,802
Can you?

525
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:22,442
If I take him, he's not ever
gonna be the same again.

526
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:26,538
- What do you mean by that?
- What I mean is that...

527
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:30,192
He'll forget this ever happened,
and that...

528
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,981
His innocence will be gone.

529
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,876
He will always be one of us.

530
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,384
You still want me to take him?

531
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,918
You shouldn't do this
without asking Ellie.

532
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,468
- And if Charles finds out...
- Let him find out.

533
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:07,628
I don't answer to either of them.

534
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:09,689
Where are you taking him?

535
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:15,191
Come on.

536
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,191
Hello, Ben.

537
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,783
Welcome back
to the land of the living.
