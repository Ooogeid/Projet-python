1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,440
Previously on "lost"... you gotta trust when I tell you this.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,060
-I am trying to help you. -Do I know you?

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,630
I'm george minkowski. I'm the communications officer.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,070
-Where's the radio room? -I'll take you there.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,460
And how do we get out of here?

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,790
Through the door.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,690
Looks like you guys have a friend on this boat.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,900
You're pregnant.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,050
Juliet--she was their fertility doctor,

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,300
Studying pregnant women.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,090
The reason the others wanted her baby was for research.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,420
-What happens to pregnant women on this island? Does the--- -they die.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,200
You want me to help you and your baby.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,650
I have answers to your questions,

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,730
-But you have to come with me right now. -The baby isn't Jin's.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,380
I'm gonna look at your baby

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,820
And determine the date of conception.

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,370
If you got pregnant here...

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,990
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,720
The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago.

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,340
You got pregnant on the island.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,280
So how long do I have?

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,160
Most of the women made it

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,780
Into the middle of their second trimester.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,600
Nobody made it to their third.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,950
Pidus!

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,030
You ready?

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,260
I'll be up.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,150
Don't be late, Frank.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,340
Regina.

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,860
Frank.

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,140
I didn't hear you.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,670
Sorry. I didn't mean to spook ya.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,340
-Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub. -okay.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,050
You know, your book's upside-down.

36
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,600
Just tryin' to help.

37
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,320
I thought I'd check in on you guys, bring you some food.

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,460
How you feeling, by the way?

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,210
Yeah, much better, thanks. why are we being held captive?

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,430
We had nothing to do with minkowski's death.

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,340
This has nothing to do with minkowski.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,720
The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,880
To bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,290
We didn't bust out. The door was left open.

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,490
We assumed it was you.

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,780
Why the hell would I do that?

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,830
Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,020
No luck. Something must've happened to their phone.

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,410
Lima beans?

50
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,560
Sorry. We had a little problem in the kitchen.

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,180
Just stay put, all right?

52
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,030
I still want to talk to the captain.

53
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,100
No, you don't.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,940
Regina.

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,820
What's wrong?

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,640
Sayid and Desmond left three days ago.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,170
Why haven't they come back?

58
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,360
Perhaps they are returning with the ship.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,240
Now come on...

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,730
We have more important things to talk about.

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,550
Like what?

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,950
Let's talk about baby names.

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,370
Good. you're getting better.

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,680
Hmm. But, no, Jin.

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,770
It's bad luck to talk about baby names now.

66
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,930
Superstitious?

67
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,290
I don't want to Jinx him.

68
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,810
You mean her.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,910
Oh, it's going to be a girl, is it?

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,450
Ji Yeon.

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,310
I want to name her Ji Yeon.

72
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,280
I don't want to talk about names.

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,070
You don't like Ji Yeon?

74
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,470
No, it's beautiful.

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,240
I'll tell you what.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,530
Let's get off the island first.

77
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,750
Then we can pick a name.

78
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,300
Deal.

79
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,870
Emergency services.

80
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,770
I need an ambulance...

81
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,470
What seems to be the problem?

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm pregnant...

83
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,570
and I think something's wrong.

84
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,930
Can I help you?

85
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,570
Is there something you're looking for?

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,930
Yes...a panda.

87
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,650
This way, please.

88
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,140
Good.

89
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,280
Give me that one.

90
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,110
Would you like it gift wrapped?

91
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,250
No, I have to get to the hospital.

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,260
How much is it?

93
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,500
Fifty thousand won.

94
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,740
Maternity ward?

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Yes.

96
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,550
Why didn't you say so?

97
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,370
You must be very happy...

98
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,440
Boy or a girl?

99
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,530
I...I don't know yet.

100
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,630
Don't worry.

101
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,940
Everyone loves a panda.

102
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,690
Yes, yes. I'm on my way...

103
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,660
I'm on my way.

104
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,100
I understand.

105
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,500
Good luck.

106
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,130
Jin!

107
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,600
Jin!

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,860
Kate and Jack are back.

109
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,020
What happened?

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,970
You mean before or after the redhead knock me out?

111
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,560
She hit you?

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,550
When I ran into them on my way back from Locke's camp.

113
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,350
Why would she do that?

114
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,170
I guess she didn't wannhave to explain

115
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,530
Why she was on her way to a poison gas factory.

116
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,390
Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.

117
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,790
Why would julietie about that?

118
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,070
Force of habit?

119
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,150
Why were they going there?

120
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,120
To turn it off, to deactivate the gas.

121
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,350
I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.

122
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,160
Do you think they're really going to rescue us?

123
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,680
In all the time they've been here,

124
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,150
They've talked about a lot of things,

125
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,140
And none involved rescuing us.

126
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,220
Good morning.

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,520
Good morning.

128
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,010
I hope they resolve their kitchen issues.

129
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,280
Sayid.

130
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,600
What's that?

131
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,520
It's a note.

132
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,050
Three days ago,

133
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,690
When I was in locke's camp,

134
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,710
Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.

135
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,590
Don't trust captain

1
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,810
Hello.

2
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
My name is Sun.

3
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,610
Hi, Sun hi. I'm Daniel.

4
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,830
Something I can help you with?

5
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,530
I'm two months pregnant.

6
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,880
Oh, you're...

7
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,210
Wow, that's...

8
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,730
Congratulations.

9
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,290
So are you here to rescue us?

10
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,010
It's a simple question.

11
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,310
Are you or are you not going to rescue us?

12
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,080
The thing is, ...

13
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,500
It's not really my call, sun.

14
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,310
Then whose call is it?

15
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,730
Thank you.

16
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,990
Uh, can you pass, uh, the cereal?

17
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,110
Pretty good english, Jin.

18
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,180
Thank you.

19
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,330
.. I understand better than i, uh, speak.

20
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,270
Mm.

21
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,910
Has sun been teaching you, or are you just picking it up?

22
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,460
Uh, sun teach me.

23
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,580
Uh, Sawyer, too.

24
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,720
Sun is... better.

25
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,460
I bet.

26
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,400
Hey, sun

27
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,560
How you feeling?

28
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm good. thank you.

29
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,320
The morning sickness has stopped,

30
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,480
Which has been nice.

31
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,310
That's good.

32
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,180
Well...

33
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,350
If you need anything, just let me know, okay?

34
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,510
Would you like some breakfast?

35
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,780
Jin

36
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,990
You need to do as i say and not ask questions.

37
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,800
What's the matter?

38
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,330
You need to find food for two days.

39
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,210
Meet me at the tent in twenty minutes.

40
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,170
Why?

41
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,760
What's happened?

42
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,510
We're going to Locke's camp.

43
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,500
What are you doing?

44
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,410
I needed another bottle of those vitamins you gave me,

45
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,150
The--the prenatals.

46
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,740
You could've just asked.

47
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,750
You're right. I should have.

48
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,240
What happened to the last ones I gave you?

49
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,040
Sorry?

50
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,580
The last bottle I gave you. there should be 20 left.

51
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,980
Are you planning a trip?

52
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,620
Please, just give me the vitamins.

53
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,380
Where are you going,Sun?

54
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,890
We're going to Locke's camp.

55
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,840
What?

56
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,440
Why?

57
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,210
Because I don't trust these people.

58
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,550
Whether you trust them or not, you can't go there.

59
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,900
Locke doesn't want to leave the island,

60
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,480
And I've told you, sun, pregnant women...

61
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,690
They don't survive here.

62
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,370
Yes, you did tell me that.

63
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,320
You don't believe me.

64
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,740
Look, I know that I have been less than truthful

65
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,210
About certain things since coming here,

66
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,410
But I promise you, sun, I promise you...

67
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,350
I'm not lying about this.

68
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,470
After everything you've confided in me,

69
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,660
I should at least have your trust.

70
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,090
Claire's baby is fine.

71
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,820
I feel fine.

72
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,910
All I have are your stories that I'm going to get sick.

73
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,340
I'm going to do what's best for me and for my baby,

74
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,720
Because, no...

75
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,480
I don't trust you.

76
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,090
It's okey. It's going to be okay.

77
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,990
Is that...?

78
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,340
Yes. Oceanic Six.

79
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,860
Stop! What are you doing?

80
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,310
We remove all jewelry.

81
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,750
It's for the swelling.

82
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,290
No! Not my ring!

83
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,740
Nothing will happen to it.

84
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,160
It's okay.

85
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,970
Mrs. Kwon, I'm Dr. Bae.

86
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm on duty for Dr. Park.

87
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,560
Where is he? What's happening?

88
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,500
He's away at a conference...

89
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,370
Give her something for the pain.

90
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,310
Now let me take a look...

91
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Is something wrong with my baby?

92
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,120
It is in distress.

93
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,410
What's wrong?

94
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,610
I don't know yet.

95
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,600
That's what I'm going to find out.

96
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,270
Is there anyone we should contact?

97
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,650
You husband? Your parents?

98
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,720
Just get Jin...  my husband...

99
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,430
Jin...

100
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,720
Just get Jin...

101
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,860
I'll try to reach him.

102
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,670
Get my...husband...

103
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,900
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

104
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,130
Jin...

105
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,610
Taxi

106
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes, I'm on my way...Hello?

107
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,200
Hello...

108
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,740
Hey! What is this?

109
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,520
Stop!

110
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,730
You bastard!

111
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,790
I will kill you.

112
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,300
If I find you!

113
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,090
I will hunt you down and rip your head off!

114
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,090
I need another panda!

115
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm sorry, that was the last one.

116
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,300
What about that one?

117
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,780
It's right behind you!

118
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,340
That one is on hold.

119
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,540
They're quite popular.

120
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,020
How much do you want?

121
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,930
It's already paid for.

122
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,670
What about this..

123
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,790
In the year of the dragon,

124
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,330
It brings good luck.

125
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,180
I need the panda.

126
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Don't lose this one.

127
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,840
Once you hit the stream,

128
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,550
You wanna head northwest,

129
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,990
Pretty much in a straight line for about a day and a half. thank you.

130
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm gonna have to tell jack.

131
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,520
But I'll give you guys a nice, long head start.

132
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,040
I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.

133
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,820
No, he wouldn't

134
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,630
You'd better get going

135
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,910
-Be safe, okay? -Thank you.

136
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,490
She's not going anywhere.

137
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,090
Sun,this is a bad idea.

138
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,170
What concern is it of yours?

139
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,080
Do you understand your wife's medical condition right now?

140
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
Translate for me.

141
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,090
No.

142
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,620
Your wife is very sick.

143
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,720
If she doesn't get off this island in three weeks,

144
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,170
She will die.

145
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,650
If you let her go,

146
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,750
Your wife is in danger.

147
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,530
Jin... danger.

148
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,460
Wherever sun go..

149
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,410
I go.

150
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,810
Sun.

151
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,700
Please.

152
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,230
Jin.

153
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,770
Your wife had an affair.

154
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,600
What?

155
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,410
Sun was with another man.

156
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,210
She thought the baby was his.

157
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,560
Jin...

158
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,470
Jin...

159
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,500
Talk to me. Let me explain.

160
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,740
It was a lone time ago.

161
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,410
Look at me.

162
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,700
Just look at me.

163
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,790
I understand you're angry.

164
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,490
And I have no excuse.

165
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,560
Please let me explain.

166
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,710
let me explain.

167
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,640
Jin...

303
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,800
Hey. you are fishing?

304
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,610
Uh, do you mind if i... tag along?

306
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, I am sorry. i-i didn't mean to interrupt.

307
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,740
No. come.

308
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,480
You sure?

309
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,370
Yes.

310
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,150
Come.

311
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,440
You realize we're the only two married guys on the island?

312
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,930
Married.

313
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,770
Married.

314
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,530
Yeah, well, no, not to each other. no.

315
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,160
You got it.

316
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,280
It's not easy, iit?

317
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh, I mean, it's--it's wonderful,

318
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,000
But... let's face it.

319
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,750
Every decision that you make takes twice as long

320
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,590
Cause you always gotta talk them into it.

321
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,790
Rose...

322
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,380
Has cancer.

323
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,640
She's sick.

324
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,940
Dying.

325
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,280
Well, at least, she was dying.

326
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,310
She says she's better now.

327
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,390
She says it's this place...

328
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,630
The island.

329
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,850
But when the camp split up,

330
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,790
I was sure that she'd want to go with locke.

331
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,140
Why would she want to leave the island

332
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,230
And risk getting sick again?

333
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,390
Uh, then why do you stay with jack?

334
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,320
Because it was the right thing to do.

335
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,470
Locke? 

336
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,000
He's a murderer.

337
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,010
See, it's all about karma, jin.

338
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,130
Do you know karma?

339
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,020
You make bad choices, bad things happen to you.

340
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,420
But you make good choices, and then good--

341
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,420
Hey! hey, hey, hey! you got one.

342
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,190
Yeah. here, pull it .

343
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,690
Wow, look at that!

344
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,720
Ah, you see? now that's karma.

345
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,520
We must be the good guys, huh?

346
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,320
How long's that gonna go on for, eh?

347
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,990
Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?

348
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,010
That sound is not mechanical.

349
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,640
What, you think somebody's doing that?

350
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,350
Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?

351
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,600
That's exactly what I think.

352
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,260
Gentlemen...

353
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,230
Thanks for your patience.

354
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,640
The captain would like to see you now.

355
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,490
Where's the helicopter?

356
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,560
Lapidus is running an errand.

357
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,350
What kind of errand?

358
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,590
I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.

359
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,270
Did he go to the island?

360
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,020
You know anywhere else he could land?

361
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,670
What's he going to do?

362
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,930
I said I'm just a doctor.

363
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,490
What did lapidus say?

364
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,020
He didn't say anything. what is she doing?!

367
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,290
That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!

368
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,610
Don't just stand there! what's the matter with you people?!

369
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,340
Get a rope! why aren'tou doing anything?! bring a rope!

370
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,600
Get a rope! get a pe!

371
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,190
Stop! she just jumped!

372
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,350
It's over. she's gone.

373
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,170
Everybody get back to your posts.

374
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,700
That was an order.

375
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm captain gault.

376
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,490
I suppose you two have a few questions.

377
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,180
So what can I do for you? what?

378
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,930
You boys said you wanted to speak with me. let's just start with

379
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,740
Why a woman jumped over side of your ship,and you did nothing to stop it

380
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,150
I didn't jump or order my crew to jump in

381
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,740
Because I didn't want to lose any more peoe.

382
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,490
What exactly is going on here?

383
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,660
Some of my crew has been dealing with...

384
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,440
What might best be described

385
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,880
As a heightened case of cabin fever.

386
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,100
I think it's got something to do

387
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,750
With the close proximity of the island. why don't you turn around, then?

388
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,460
I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board,

389
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,660
And he's de one hell a job on my engines.

390
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,520
I've got my creworking around the clock to repair them.

391
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,240
And then you'll take our people home?

392
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,400
Then we move to safer waters.

393
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,890
That all are my orders.

394
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,440
And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?

395
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,080
Sure, I ll. charles widmore.

396
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,650
This is charles widmore's boat?

397
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,170
That's right. you know him.

398
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,950
Do either of you know what this is?

399
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,110
It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.

400
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,700
That's exactly what it is.

401
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,300
Now here's the funny thing.

402
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,140
This black box comes from oceanic flight 8-1-5.

403
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,920
A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean.

404
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,960
It took a considerable amount of mr. widmore's resources

405
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,120
To procure it.

406
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
It was found with the wreckage of the plane,

407
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,830
Along with all 324 dead passengers.

408
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,900
That's not the complete story,

409
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,670
As you are well aware, mr. jarrah,

410
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,840
Given the fact that you're standing here, breathing.

411
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,220
The wreckage was obviously staged.

412
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,320
Now can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower

413
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,730
Go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude?

414
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,140
Faking the recovery of a plane crash?

415
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,580
Putting 324 families through a grieving process

416
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,870
Based on a lie?

417
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,060
But what's even more disturbing--

418
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,140
Where exactly does one come across

419
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,860
324 dead bodies?

420
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,380
And that, mr. jarrah, mr. hume,

421
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,390
Is just one of the many reasons

422
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,540
We want benjamin linus.

423
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,970
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,920
I had to stop you any way I could.

425
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,750
It wasn't your place to stop us

426
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,670
I know you don't trust me,

427
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,810
But you need tget off is island. we all do.

428
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,920
You want to leave?

429
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,450
More than anything.

430
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,060
I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not,

431
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,200
But it's something.

432
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,750
I need to go home.

433
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,710
So do you.

434
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,720
Sun...

435
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,570
In about three weeks,

436
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,050
You'll be in an almost constant state of nausea.

437
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,260
A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath

438
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,420
That won't go away.

439
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,050
A week after that, you will lose consciousness

440
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,130
And slip into a coma.

441
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,390
And then, sun, you will die.

442
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,690
And when your heart stops beating...

443
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,570
So will the baby's.

444
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,690
And that, sun, is why it is my business,

445
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,300
Because you are my patient.

446
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,890
If you go...

447
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,680
You will die...

448
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,750
And your baby will never be born.

449
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,640
I have to perform a C-section

450
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,860
No

451
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,120
You don't understand...

452
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,470
The medication makes a natural birth difficult

453
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,620
No, no! Not until Jin

454
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,020
We've got to get to surgery!

455
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,370
Where's my husband?

456
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,590
He's not here yet.

457
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,030
We cannot wait

458
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,120
Jin

459
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,490
Jin

460
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,830
Dr.Bae

461
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,010
The baby is crowning

462
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,790
Okay, Sun. You need to push now.

463
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,410
That's it...Push! Push!

464
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,030
You can do it!

465
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,500
That's it...Push!

466
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,890
You did it

467
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,320
Congratulation

468
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,620
You have a baby daughter.

1
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,570
So what'd you think of the captain?

2
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,020
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

3
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,730
Yeah, he tell it like it is. just don't piss him off.

4
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,190
You know what I mean?

5
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,150
I think you'll like your room.

6
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,390
It's on a quiet part of the ship.

7
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,870
Th ship isn't moving.

8
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,590
Well, if you say so.

9
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,970
That shouldn't still be there. damn it.

10
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,280
Hey, johns. it that you?

11
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,060
Johnson?

12
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,240
Yeah.

13
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,870
Mop this up.

14
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,020
Sorry. I gotta go up on deck.

15
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,090
No, you're gonna mop this up!

16
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,570
Kevin, this is, uh...

17
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,560
S-sayid.

18
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,150
Desmond.

19
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,800
Kevin johnson.

20
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,600
Nice to meet you, kevin.

21
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,460
I made... dinner.

22
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,850
I thought you had left me.

23
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,880
Will you let me try to explain?

24
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,870
It won't matter.

25
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,730
Just listen, maybe...

26
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,880
I know why you did it.

27
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,710
I know the man...

28
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,540
I used to be.

29
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,340
Before this island.

30
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,050
I withheld my affections...

31
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,570
And I know...

32
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,260
that whatever you did...

33
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,630
you did to that man.

34
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,500
His action caused this.

35
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,390
so I forgive you.

36
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,430
So I will go to Locke's camp with you.

37
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't want to go there anymore.

38
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,760
Why?

39
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,420
Juliet was very convincing.

40
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,380
We have to get off this island.

41
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,590
These people had a helicopter.

42
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,850
We have to try.

43
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,090
I'll do all it to protect you and the baby.

44
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,160
I promise.

45
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,460
Thank you.

46
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,050
There's just one thing.

47
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,110
And please, the truth...

48
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,390
Anything.

49
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,250
Is... the baby...

50
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,590
Mine?

51
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,660
Yes,Jin.

52
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,060
I swear the baby is yours.

53
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,130
It's yours.

54
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,480
I love you very much.

55
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,620
I thought I had lost you.

56
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,080
I love you too.

57
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,910
And you will never lose me. 

58
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
I am Jin-Soo Kwon.

59
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,540
 
60
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,410
Yes.

61
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,790
I heard the Ambassador is now a grandfather.

62
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,170
I came to present a gift.

63
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,570
Wait here.

64
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,290
Excuse me.

65
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,650
Is it a boy or a girl?

66
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,290
A boy.

67
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,640
Yes?

68
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,050
Mr Ambassodor...

69
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,930
This panda is a symbol of Mr. Paik's eagerness...

70
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,650
to do business in the great country of China.

71
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,660
Please accept his congratulations.

72
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,430
Thank Mr. Paik for me.

73
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,650
Tell him I'll call.

74
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,640
Leaving so soon?

75
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,570
It wasn't my baby.

76
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,690
Well, maybe someday...

77
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,070
Don't rush me.

78
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,850
I've been married two months.

79
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,540
I can't believe you came all this way.

80
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,630
Are you kidding? is anyone else coming?

81
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,230
No.

82
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,610
Good.

83
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,760
So... where is she?

84
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,620
Come here.

85
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,930
She's awesome.

86
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,400
Thank you.

87
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,080
Would you like to hold her?

88
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,360
I don'know. i... I kind of have two lt hands.

89
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,750
I trust you.

91
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,870
She looks just like jin.

92
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,840
Yes...

93
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,420
She does.

94
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,740
So...

95
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,060
I guess we should, like, go see him.

96
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,090
Of course.

97
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:03,950
Jin...

98
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,710
You were right.

99
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,990
It's a girl.

100
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,360
The delivery was hard on me...

101
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,020
The doctor said I was calling out for you...

102
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,010
I wish you could've been there.

103
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,660
Jin...

104
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,830
She's beautiful.

105
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,710
Ji Yeon

106
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,480
I named her just like you wanted.

107
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,530
I miss you so much.

108
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,000
I miss you so much.
