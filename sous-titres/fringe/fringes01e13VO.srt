1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we will soon been starting our inflight movie.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We will be coming through with Hazas which are available for purchase for 4 dollars.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And of course exact change's always appreciated.

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
You should put keys on your back.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,130
Excuse me?

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,170
It's an old wive's tale

8
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,400
to stop the bloody nose.

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,940
Yeah?

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
Actually,I tried it once.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,040
It doesn't work.

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,180
It's all bull.

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,580
Excuse me.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,390
Excuse me.

15
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,990
Excuse me,I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,090
Yes,sir,I'll be with you in one moment.

17
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,090
No,now!

18
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,060
Please.

19
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,600
I'll be right back.

20
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,110
- What's the problem?  - I'm in trouble.

21
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,510
There's something happening to me,

22
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,580
that I don't have the time or permission

23
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,610
- to explain to you.  - What is it?

24
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,210
You need to listen to me very carefully.

25
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,850
I need you to go to the passengers,

26
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,480
I need you to collect as many sedatives

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
or tranquilizers as you can.

28
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,050
Okay,sir,I need you to take a deep breath.

29
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,320
This isn't a panic attack.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
This is real.

31
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,360
We will die,all of us,if you don't do what I say.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,660
Sir,a threat like that is in violation of FAA...

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,360
Do I look to you like I care about that?

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,370
Oh,my God.

35
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,800
I need you to get those drugs for me.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,710
Do you have any weapons,a gun?

37
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,010
Go call the captain.

38
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,580
Sir,I'm going to need you to calm down.

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,040
You're going to scare the passengers.

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,780
They should be scared. What weapons do you have?

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,810
Yeah,it's Melissa.

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,110
What weapons?!

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,410
We have a man here,who's claiming to be in...

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,750
We have a Taser in the cockpit,

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,120
which I will use on you if you don't calm down.

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,220
Taser won't do a thing. It'll just piss me off.

47
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,790
He wants drugs,but he seems to be on something already.

48
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,760
I need you to do what I say.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,230
I'm going into that bathroom.

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,260
You keep me in there. You keep that door closed.

51
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,470
Get whatever sedatives you can as soon as you can.

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,070
You can go in that bathroom,sir.

53
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,970
I am not messing around!

54
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,470
When you get the drugs,

55
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,170
you come back,you knock.

56
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,370
If I don't answer,

57
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,140
or if I do,and what you see isn't me anymore,

58
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,640
you keep that door closed.

59
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,880
You hear me?

60
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,780
You keep me in there,away from the other passengers.

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,880
Get the drugs. Quick.

62
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,850
Yes,sir. I'll do that.

63
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,620
Yes,sir,but I think 40 minutes is too long.

64
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,800
Ladies and gentlemen,we have a passenger

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,870
who is having a hard time...

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,170
Please remain calm.

67
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,970
Everything's going to be just fine.

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,410
Ah! Uh!

69
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,750
Ah! Agh! Ah!

70
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,750
What's he doing in there?

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,550
I don't know.

72
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,760
It just got quiet.

73
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,920
Maybe he passed out.

74
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,790
The captain says we should restrain him.

75
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,930
I've only...

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,530
Seatbelts. Seatbelts.

77
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,960
Well,hello.

78
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,870
Look,aunt Liv,I'm beautiful.

79
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,830
You are beautiful.

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,400
Yes,you're beautiful.

81
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,740
But why don't we put this down and take these off?

82
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,610
Here,give me...  what else do you have here?

83
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,780
I'll take that.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,950
All right. Go wash that off.

85
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,350
Okay.

86
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,620
Sorry.

87
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,490
Oh,please. That's fine.

88
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,620
Do you remember when we had that sleepover at aunt Missy's?

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,190
And then you found the perfume and poured it all over...

90
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,460
Was it Lola?

91
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,300
- No,Lola was the hamster. Roxy was the dog.  - Right.

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,570
Liv,what is this?

93
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,170
Is this mom's?

94
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,770
"always?"

95
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,510
This isn't mom's.

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,940
No.

97
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,480
It's from John.

98
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,450
John...

99
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,750
Your partner,John?

100
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,180
Yeah.

101
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,020
You told me that you guys were...

102
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,250
He asked you to marry him?

103
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,020
Uh,no.

104
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,890
He didn't. It was a mistake.

105
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,330
Suffice to say that it never actually happened.

106
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,100
Uh,no. You can't do that.

107
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,560
- Well,I have to.  - I am your sister.

108
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,000
And I have told you...

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Every excruciating detail of my failed marriage.

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,340
- There's nothing that you can...  - He was a traitor.

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,040
The people that he was working with,

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,680
They still don't even know who they were.

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,580
But whoever they were,he was bad.

114
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,550
And whatever was between us was a lie,

115
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,220
So that he could gain my trust,

116
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,950
So that I didn't see him for what he was.

117
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,420
God,Liv...

118
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,990
I'm so sorry.

119
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah.

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,190
Me too.

121
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,130
And I thought Greg was a jerk.

122
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,540
Uh,Greg is a jerk.

123
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,570
Yeah. Greg is a jerk.

124
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,170
Hello?

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,180
Where?

126
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Flight 718 went down a little after 6:00 pm.

127
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,750
Witnesses say the plane just fell out of the sky.

128
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,050
Once we recover the black box,we'll know more.

129
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,450
So why are we here?

130
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,120
Shouldn't NTSB be taking point?

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,790
According to Air Traffic Control,

132
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,060
They got a distress call from the pilot,

133
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,130
But it was cut off and they lost communication.

134
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,490
Whatever happened up there,I'm guessing...

135
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,830
... has something to do with what I'm about to show you.

136
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,030
It's burned badly.

137
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,500
Forensics thought it was an animal at first.

138
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,570
They were mistaken.

139
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,040
No one's ever seen an animal like this.

140
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,840
I can understand the confusion.

141
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,910
This creature has...

142
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,010
Pelage characteristic of an animal.

143
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,180
And yet...

144
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,330
Mm.

145
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,960
I will say this...

146
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,330
Our friend here didn't start out this way.

147
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,530
Hey,Liv.

148
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,640
Hey.

149
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,570
Hey.

150
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,670
Copies of the manifest passports.

151
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,310
147 passengers.

152
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,710
It's going to be a long few days...

153
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,540
For the poor folks tasked with trying...

154
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,710
To identify the remains.

155
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,550
So is there anyone of any interest?

156
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,280
Not at first glance,no.

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,780
Does the elder bishop have any ideas about that?

158
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,990
Not yet.

159
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,220
Or if he does,he isn't saying.

160
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,860
So the official word right now is engine failure.

161
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,160
The pilot tried to bring it in for an emergency landing.

162
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,270
The way this thing works...

163
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,130
- Works...  - What it does to you?

164
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,370
It's a horror show.

165
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,400
It's far worse than you can even imagine.

166
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm telling you,this stuff...

167
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,540
It's a horror show,John.

168
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,110
What? You find something?

169
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,080
Yeah,I think this is our guy.

170
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,680
- The fried dog man?  - Yeah.

171
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,650
Marshall Bowman.

172
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,190
We need to pull everything we can find on him.

173
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390
How can you know that?

174
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,930
Call it my gut.

175
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,730
You're good.

176
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,710
I would expect whatever caused this mutation...

177
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,550
Would've completely alter his internal organs.

178
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,420
Though the kidneys appear normal.

179
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,420
It also gave him four extra nipples.

180
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,220
Maybe he mutated into a opossum.

181
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,990
No,opossum's have 15 mammaries.

182
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,730
Unlike most mammals,who have an even number of nipples.

183
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,500
Hence,the one half rule regarding nipples.

184
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,060
The one half nipple rule?

185
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,100
You just had to ask,didn't you?

186
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,070
The typical number of young in a litter is usually equal...

187
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,570
to half the number of nipples on the animal.

188
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,840
The number of nipples being the maximum litter size.

189
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,340
Humans,for example,

190
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,580
One child is the typical.

191
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,380
Maximum,twins.

192
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,390
Barring extraordinary cases.

193
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,860
In which case,numerous nipples would be warranted.

194
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,220
God,I hope I never have to hear him say the word "nipple" again.

195
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,960
Evidence of an extradural hematoma.

196
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,930
Possibly epistaxis.

197
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,070
Meaning,he had a colossal nosebleed.

198
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,300
I know.

199
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,170
Hm.

200
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,940
There's something hard inside here.

201
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
Scalpel.

202
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,320
Forcep.

203
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,500
What is it? A tumor?

204
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,800
Not unless a tumor is made of glass.

205
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,340
I need someone Overat Vertusair,right now.

206
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,140
Yes,this is about 718. What do you think?

207
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,680
Look through all the internal reports

208
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,510
on structural breakdown...

209
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,020
Here's everything we have on Marshall Bowman

210
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,150
42-years-old,worked at a credit cortier in Marseilles.

211
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,250
Managed their corporate accounts.

212
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,290
Has doctor Bishop been able to make a positive ID yet?

213
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,690
No,but we should contact the bank,

214
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,660
- and see what they can tell us about him.  - Done.

215
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,790
Last page has Bowman's clients from the U.S.

216
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,270
He outdid himself this time.

217
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,940
And he's gonna get impatient to sell it off.

218
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,010
So you have to get the money lined up fast.

219
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,780
What?

220
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,310
Olivia,you okay?

221
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,220
People,we got something.

222
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,150
Simmons,patch me in through public address.

223
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,690
Wilson sent over the black box recording,

224
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,920
the last 60 seconds of the flight.

225
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,290
Play it.

226
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,030
New York center,this is Vertusair 718 heavy.

227
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,300
We have a report that there...

228
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,500
Tower to Vertusair 718,other aircraft calling,

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,570
say again?

230
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,870
Our purser's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin.

231
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,840
There seems...

232
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,210
It's trying to get in.

233
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,380
New York,we need an emergency land...

234
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,880
718... we have something on board...

235
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,380
It's already killed at least three...

236
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,180
Dear god,hold that back!

237
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,890
That's it... Tech is trying to recover more.

238
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,360
Let's back to work,people.

239
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
Charlie.

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,130
- Hm?  - Come here a second.

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,570
See this guy?

242
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,570
Daniel Hicks,he owns an import export company

243
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,240
Based in Chelsea.

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,940
He's the guy that Marshall Bowman

245
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,680
was flying in to meet.

246
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,310
So we need to bring him in for questioning.

247
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,720
This your gut again?

248
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,690
What's going on,Liv?

249
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,930
Okay,this is going to sound insane.

250
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,330
So let's just put it in the category

251
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,700
of "crazy things happening in Walter Bishop's lab."

252
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,330
Okay.

253
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,970
John Scott and I shared consciousness.

254
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,080
Our minds were connected through a procedure

255
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,280
before he died,and...

256
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,450
Some of his memories are still in my head.

257
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,550
His memories?

258
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,520
And sometimes I get flashes.

259
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,190
I see what he saw in the memory.

260
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,690
And in one of these flashes,

261
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,190
I saw him with Marshall Bowman

262
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,560
and this guy... Hicks.

263
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,900
I think they were all working together.

264
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,930
On what?

265
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
A weapons sale of some kind?

267
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,740
Okay.

268
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I'll bring him in.

269
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,040
That's it?

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
Despite the thousand questions I have

271
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,140
in my head right now,

272
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,810
I'm going to bite my tongue.

273
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,380
Thank you.

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,160
Bishop's house of horrors.

275
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,890
Hey,how we doing?

276
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,260
Good,we got the bloodwork back.

277
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,030
You were right,it is Marshall Bowman.

278
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,570
Anything else?

279
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,270
Yeah,Walter seems to think he was dosed

280
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,900
with some kind of designer virus.

281
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,970
So,it was intentional.

282
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,600
Hard to say it was an accident,

283
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,740
this stuff doesn't exist in nature.

284
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,010
And whoever did it,would have to have

285
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,310
a deep understanding of cutting-edge genetics.

286
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,740
I mean,it completely rewrote Bowman's DNA.

287
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,480
Even if the plane hadn't of crashed,

288
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,780
he wouldn't have survived the transformation.

289
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,820
And...

290
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,080
There's something else.

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,750
And this falls under the heading of "what the hell?"

292
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,490
But we found something in his left hand.

293
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,850
Here,I'll stream it to you.

294
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,230
It's a glass disk,about the size of a nickel.

295
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,760
I don't believe it.

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,160
We found a similar disk

297
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,970
on the D.E.A. agent a few months back.

298
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,400
I thought you told me that Bowman was a banker.

299
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,500
Now you're telling me he's some kind of agent?

300
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,710
Uh,I don't know.

301
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,010
But Charlie is bringing in a guy

302
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,140
who might be able to give us some answers.

303
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,680
Tell us about your business,Mr. Hicks.

304
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,380
My business...

305
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,550
It's import and export.

306
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
But you know that already.

307
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,990
You just came from my office.

308
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,720
Why don't you indulge us,Mr. Hicks?

309
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,290
What do you import and export?

310
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,890
Furniture,mostly.

311
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,360
Mostly French. 18th and 19th century.

312
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,400
Look,I'd like to know what this is all about.

313
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
I run a clean business.

314
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,740
How do you know Marshall Bowman?

315
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,040
He's my banker,overseas.

316
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,480
Why,has he gotten into some kind of trouble?

317
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,550
This is wonderful. Don't you agree?

318
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,480
It's just like a good detective movie.

319
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,420
Mr. Hicks,have you heard what happened on flight 718?

320
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,890
Yeah,that's the plane that crashed,right?

321
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,760
Mm-hmm.

322
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,590
This might be hardto recognize,but...

323
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,760
This is Marshall Bowman.

324
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,330
He was on board that plane.

325
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,440
I... I don't understand.

326
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,540
I believe you do,Mr. Hicks.

327
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,410
I believe you know how that happened.

328
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,080
I believe that you and Marshall Bowman

329
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,280
conspired to distribute a deadly virus,

330
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,480
And this is the unintended result.

331
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,250
Look...

332
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,620
I think you have mistaken for someone else.

333
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,290
Your nose is bleeding.

334
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,130
Can we have a box of tissues,please?

335
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,000
No.

336
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,130
No,tissue won't help.

337
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,540
Find me some sedatives.

338
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,740
Now!

339
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,070
I need help.

340
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,070
Ah!

341
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,980
Walter,what's happening?

342
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,820
I expect the same thing that happened

343
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,880
To that manin the airplane.

344
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,550
Here.

345
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,620
I may be able to suspend the process.

346
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,360
No! Not yet.

347
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Not until he talks.

348
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,530
Please!

349
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,730
You want help? I want answers.

350
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,400
We... must... Have... been... dosed.

351
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,640
I want to know the name. Who dosed you?

352
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,970
Conrad.

353
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,340
Ah!

354
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
Oh,I don't think that's working.

355
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,030
I checked the dhs database,

356
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,730
Nothing came up on a "Conrad," first or last name,

357
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,500
When cross-referenced with a daniel hicks.

358
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,400
Well,so far,there's no mention of a "Conrad"

359
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,840
In John's old files,either.

360
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,570
Hm.

361
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,810
Why don't you let me take a turn?

362
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,740
Thank you.

363
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,750
Anything?

364
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,120
Yes.

365
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,350
As often is the case,has good news and bad news.

366
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,750
He is transforming,

367
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,220
But I placed him in a medically-induced coma,

368
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,990
- to slow the process.  - Which is that? The good,or the bad?

369
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,460
- Huh?  - Which is it?

370
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,760
The good news,or the bad news?

371
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,100
That's the bad news.

372
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,370
The good news,is that I've already synthesized

373
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,470
A preliminary sample of an antidote.

374
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,040
I'm testing it on tissue samples as we speak.

375
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,540
And... a watermelon.

376
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,440
As a control group.

377
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,180
And will it be ready in time?

378
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,010
That depends on your definition of time.

379
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,220
If you mean before he turns into a beast,

380
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,850
I wouldn't wager on it,no.

381
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,520
Wonderful.

382
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,430
Cut open his hand.

383
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,700
What?

384
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,770
I want to see if there's a disk in it.

385
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,040
Like Bowman's.

386
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
I like cutting.

387
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,350
Where did you get these?

388
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,650
One of them was in Bowman's palm.

389
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,620
The other one was on Hicks.

390
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,290
We've seen one of these before.

391
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,820
Did the N.S.A Everdetermine what it was for?

392
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,890
A data storage device.

393
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,500
Apparently used to transport information.

394
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
I want authorization to exhume John Scott's body.

395
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
John Scott?

396
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,570
I think he may have one of these on him,too.

397
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,840
I think he was working with Bowman and Hicks.

398
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,010
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

399
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,380
Well,then make it possible.

400
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,810
- Excuse me?  - I know it's

401
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,050
against protocol,but right now,

402
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,180
- frankly,I don't give a damn.  - Stop.

403
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,380
And if you don't want to ask Harris,then...

404
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,280
- I said stop.  - I'll go and ask him,myself.

405
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,730
I can't deliver John Scott's body.

406
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,330
And that other disk?

407
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,800
It didn't go to the N.S.A.

408
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,230
Where did it go?

409
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,040
One of the advantages

410
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,610
Of being the defense department's biggest contractor

411
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,180
Is the massive dynamic has money to develop technologies

412
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,780
Generations beyond that of the US government.

413
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,610
So when we were unable to retrieve the information

414
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,020
Off the disks,I requested Nina's help

415
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,620
But I suspect that you telling me this

416
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,920
Isn't the only reason that we're here.

417
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,820
Agent Dunham.

418
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,790
Miss Sharp.

419
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,760
For what it's worth,it was not my decision

420
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,800
To keep this from you.

421
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,090
As you suspected,

422
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,560
We discovered a glass disk identical to the others,

423
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,100
Embedded in agent Scott's hand.

424
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,300
While he may appear to be alive,I assure you he is not.

425
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,110
We've kept him in a suspended state of...

426
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,910
We believe that the information stored in the disks

427
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,810
Self-destructs when the disk's host dies.

428
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,920
We attempted to utilize agent Scott's body...

429
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,690
His blood,his DNA...  to try to retrieve the data.

430
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,690
The small amount of information we were able to gather

431
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,230
Seems to implicate agent Scott

432
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,070
As part of a bio-terror cell.

433
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,870
There were also references to a Conrad.

434
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,810
We believe he's a scientist.

435
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,710
Designing chemical and biological weapons for sale

436
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,080
On the black market.

437
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,110
CIA has received scattered intel on him in the past

438
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,250
Nothing concrete.

439
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,720
We don't even know his full name.

440
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,290
So a plane full of people are dead.

441
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,560
And our best lead is... nothing?

442
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,360
A chemist,who's name we don't even know?

443
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,630
It gets worse.

444
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,000
Three hours ago,French Intelligence related to D.C.

445
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,340
That an informant of theirs claims a major weapons sale

446
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,870
Is about to go down in Chicago.

447
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,570
However,what the informant was unable to say

448
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,380
Is exactly where,or when,the sale is going to take place.

449
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,880
What the informant did know is that the man behind the sale

450
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,780
Is known as Conrad.

451
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,520
Hello?

452
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,890
I'm on my way back. Is Walter there?

453
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,430
Yeah,why?

454
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,100
I just got word that Conrad's planning on selling this virus.

455
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,670
- What? When?  - I don't know.

456
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,870
But if I'm right,and John was working with these guys,

457
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,840
Then he has the answer in his memory.

458
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
Which means that it's in mine.

459
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,100
Olivia...

460
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,240
You know how dangerous this is...

461
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,910
Tell walter to prep the tank.

462
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,180
I'm going back in.

463
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,660
- You are ok?  - Yeah

464
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Be careful.

465
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,160
We're online.

466
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,970
All right.

467
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,900
Olivia,

468
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,210
Can you hear me?

469
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,640
Yes.

470
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,210
You must listen to my voice at all times.

471
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,280
It is your connection,your lifeline.

472
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,180
- Understood?  - Understood.

473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,020
I am going to try and guide you

474
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,750
Through John scott's memory

475
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,290
In an attempt to take you back

476
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,190
To the place where he met our comatose friend,here.

477
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,930
Now,picture yourself

478
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,230
At the top of a steep flight of stairs.

479
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,570
As you descend,step by step,

480
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,340
You'll become progressively more,and more relaxed.

481
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,950
Now,here come the last five steps.

482
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,350
Four...

483
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,220
Three...

484
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
Two...

485
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,760
One.

486
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,630
Where are you?

487
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,530
I'm in a bedroom.

488
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,030
No,it's not a bedroom.

489
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,040
This is where we used to meet.

490
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,010
John and I.

491
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,990
Oh,man. This is crazy.

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
- Absolutely,this will never happen again.  - No.

493
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,100
Ask her what she sees.

494
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,200
What do you see?

495
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,270
Me and John.

496
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,940
Don't worry,he can't see you.

497
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,180
Remember,you're observing a memory.

498
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,720
I'll be right back.

499
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,640
Hi,Liv.

500
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,240
Olivia,what's happening?

501
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,640
John's talking to me.

502
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,350
That's not possible,olivia.

503
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,910
He can't see you.

504
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,550
We'll try to take you elsewhere.

505
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,920
Where John and his accomplices met.

506
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,360
- Don't move.  - Liv,what's wrong?

507
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,760
Stop.

508
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,460
Don't. Don't move.

509
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,770
Olivia,focus on the sound of my voice.

510
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,570
I said stay there.

511
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,440
I miss you.

512
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,270
Don't move.

513
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,210
I'm going to ask you a question,

514
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,050
and you're going to give me the answer.

515
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,320
You were working with a man named Conrad.

516
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,390
He developed a biological weapon.

517
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,090
I want to know who he is,

518
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,960
and who he's planning on selling it to.

519
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,890
Liv,put the gun...

520
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,430
Stop lying to me,John.

521
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,360
I know that you're part of a terrorist cell.

522
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,100
We have your partner in custody.

523
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,630
Hicks.

524
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,540
He's dying. And Bowman is already dead.

525
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,470
They were infected with some kind of a virus.

526
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,570
- Liv...  - No!

527
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,510
What just happened?

528
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,380
I don't know.

529
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,050
We need to get her out,now.

530
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,450
We can't. It's too dangerous.

531
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,780
She's in deep rem.

532
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,290
We need to reconnect before we pull her out.

533
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,660
Olivia,can you hear me?

534
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,760
Olivia?

535
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
Olivia,can you hear...

536
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,270
Olivia?

537
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,360
Walter?

538
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,140
Olivia.

539
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,110
I want answers,John.

540
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,170
There he is.

541
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,970
Who?

542
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,270
Conrad.

543
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,310
He's a monster,Liv.

544
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,910
Capable of creating horrible things.

545
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,740
Weapons,which he does for no other reason

546
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,280
than because he can.

547
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,880
'Cause he's curious.

548
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,520
Then he sells them to the highest bidder.

549
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,220
That's him.

550
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,950
And that's me.

551
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,420
Problem was,we were hunting a man

552
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,430
none of us had ever seen before.

553
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,030
If I'd have known I had him in my sights,

554
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,830
I could've taken him out right then and there.

555
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,060
It was my most important mission.

556
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,900
And I failed.

557
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,740
I let that monster get away.

558
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,100
I didn't know it was him.

559
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,680
What mission?

560
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,110
Who were you working for?

561
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,330
Bowman and Hicks...

562
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,370
The truth is,they were and they are...

563
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,730
government agents.

564
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,900
NSA,secret task force.

565
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,070
And so was I.

566
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,910
I don't believe you.

567
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,240
It's the truth,Liv.

568
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,940
No,not again.

569
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,450
If you want me to believe you,then you need to prove it to me.

570
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,650
I can't,Liv.

571
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,850
It was Black Ops,a deniable operation.

572
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,220
If we were to take out Conrad,

573
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,520
there could be no record of our involvement.

574
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,220
That's why I could never tell you.

575
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,390
Even though I wanted to.

576
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,330
If that's the truth,then help me.

577
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,560
Tell me where the sale is going down.

578
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,600
What sale?

579
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
The virus.

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,100
We believe that Conrad's planning on selling it.

581
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,370
I don't know what's going on

582
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,140
inside Conrad's organization anymore.

583
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,170
But Hicks would know.

584
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,810
You need to talk to Hicks.

585
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,810
He was privy to all that information.

586
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,240
- He has it right in his hand.  - John?

587
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,510
John?

588
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,850
Liv,trust Hicks.

589
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,380
He can help you.

590
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,920
John?

591
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,990
John.

592
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,850
John?

593
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,520
- We have to pull her out.  - John!

594
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,560
Prepare 30 CC's of dextroamphetamine.

595
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,640
- Oh,Peter.  - You're okay.

596
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,070
You're going to be fine.

597
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,610
I understand.

598
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,920
Thanks for checking.

599
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,690
My contact at NSA. Couldn't confirm

600
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,990
a single thing that John said.

601
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,260
Of course,John said they wouldn't be able to.

602
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,960
Well,that's the perfect alibi.

603
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
One that you can't confirm.

604
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,690
Uh,yeah.

605
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,830
How's it coming?

606
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,400
His cell sample's membranes still aren't

607
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
absorbing the inhibitor.

608
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,070
We don't know if the antidote's working yet.

609
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,540
But it might.

610
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,970
We could try it and see.

611
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,310
You want to wake up Hicks?

612
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,810
Even though he could transform just like Bowman did?

613
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,050
Well,Conrad could be selling this virus as we speak.

614
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,080
And Hicks is the only one who can tell us

615
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,180
how this is going to go down.

616
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
And you're willing to take John's word

617
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,520
that you can trust Hicks?

618
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,320
It finally happened.

619
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,090
I'm now referring to a dead guy,

620
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,060
- who only exists in your mind.  - Boy!

621
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,800
I need another bag of midazolam right away.

622
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,770
What if he's still lying to you?

623
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,600
Have you considered that?

624
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,640
If Hicks and John are working with Conrad,

625
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,040
that maybe John is using you to tip Conrad off?

626
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,280
Maybe he wants to get you killed.

627
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,750
This is a bad idea,Olivia.

628
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,820
My mother always says

629
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,090
I stick my nose in places it does not belong.

630
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,900
I know we haven't known each other that long.

631
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,070
But you are one of the best judges

632
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,200
of character I've ever met.

633
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,970
So,I guess the question is

634
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,170
what's your instinct?

635
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,640
When you were with John,

636
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,910
when you were looking in his eyes,

637
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,650
was he for real?

638
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,260
Prep Hicks.

639
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,900
Ready or not,we're administering the antidote.

640
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,840
An experiment...

641
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,740
How exhilarating.

642
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,640
This is Agent Dunham.

643
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,070
I need to talk to Broyles.

644
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,610
Sorry to wake you.

645
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,420
Little worse than adrenaline.

646
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,250
Except,perhaps,lice,which is a nightmare.

647
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,490
Mr. Hicks,try and breathe normally.

648
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,560
Can you hear me?

649
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,230
This is an antidote.

650
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,030
While I can't guarantee that it'll actually work,

651
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,530
I do have a recorded I.Q.

652
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,470
Of... 196.

653
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,940
Really?

654
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,340
We know about the work you were doing with John Scott.

655
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,280
Now we need your help.

656
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,850
For those of you not in the know,

657
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,280
information has come to this agency

658
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,780
about a weapons buy.

659
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,980
The goods?

660
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,450
The same virus responsible for Flight 718.

661
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,260
I know this label gets slapped on pretty much all we do,

662
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,160
but preventing this transaction from taking place

663
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,090
is our highest priority.

664
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,160
The prospective buyer of this weapon

665
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,130
landed in the United States this morning.

666
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,930
0700 hours,O'hare airport.

667
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,330
And we were there.

668
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,840
That suspect is now in custody.

669
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,870
And no surprise to anyone,refuses to cooperate.

670
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,670
But we do have someone else in custody.

671
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,680
An informant with extensive information

672
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,580
on the players we will be dealing with

673
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,010
his name is Daniel Hicks.

674
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,250
And he has agreed to relay all necessary information

675
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,580
to Agent Dunham

676
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,850
using an encrypted and untraceable two-way radio,

677
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,590
which we implanted earlier this afternoon.

678
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,060
Agent Francis will coordinate surveillance.

679
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,990
The informant disclosed that the meet

680
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,260
is scheduled for 1600 hours,at the Fairchild Hotel.

681
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,560
Room 1021.

682
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,460
The seller,a man known as Conrad will not be there.

683
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,270
But his intermediaries will.

684
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,700
We have agents standing by

685
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,740
to move in in corresponding rooms.

686
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,040
Per regulations,no raid will be ordered

687
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,110
until Agent Dunham has visual on the weapon.

688
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,840
When she does,she'll give the go signal.

689
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,380
That signal will be...

690
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,250
Christmas.

691
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,520
Now we all look forward to seeing

692
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,650
how she works that into conversation.

693
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,690
Okay,people,let's get it done.

694
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,890
Listen up.

695
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,790
Spotted the seller.

696
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,100
The seller is making a phone call.

697
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,900
Stand by.

698
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,440
You didn't have to come with me,you know.

699
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,310
Shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my m.o.

700
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,710
And typically,

701
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,080
if someone is going to kill you,

702
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,280
it's a good idea to have an ally in the room.

703
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,680
I'm not scared.

704
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,610
Being fearless doesn't mean you're being safe.

705
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,760
- Astrid,how're we doing?  - Hey.

706
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,720
Hicks is on board and ready to go.

707
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,730
I'm putting you on speaker.

708
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,800
So far so good,Olivia.

709
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,100
140 over 90,not bad

710
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,630
Considering 3 cc's of adrenaline.

711
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,070
Are they going to expect bona fides?

712
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,270
Hicks,tell me what I need to know.

713
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,110
Well,they're going to be suspicious

714
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,910
Why they've never seen you before.

715
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,540
You tell them you used to work with Anderson.

716
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,610
Anderson,okay. Got it,what else?

717
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,920
You tell them Ernesto flew in for the meeting,

718
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,780
But he got called back to the basement,

719
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,090
And he couldn't come.

720
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,990
What do you mean,"called back to the basement?"

721
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,890
Just say it,he'll understand.

722
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,460
You're not messing with me,are you,Hicks?

723
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,730
You trusted John Scott,right?

724
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,960
Then trust me.

725
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
He's on the move.

726
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,900
Seller's heading inside.

727
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,210
That's him.

728
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,180
Here we go.

729
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,020
Liv...

730
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,550
You be careful.

731
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,890
You're Gavin. Susan.

732
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,030
I used to work with Anderson.

733
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,600
I was expecting someone else.

734
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,340
Well,Ernesto flew in,

735
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,800
But he was called back to the basement,

736
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,470
So he couldn't make it.

737
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,270
Mm.

738
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,340
Who's he?

739
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,980
Who are they?

740
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,610
We'll sweep you and get to business.

741
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,120
Good.

742
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,210
She's clean.

743
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,510
The money please.

744
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,790
Just a formality,I assure you.

745
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
It will only take a moment.

746
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,440
Have we met before? You look familiar.

747
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,940
Did you work with Anderson,too?

748
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,240
He's testing you.

749
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,480
You tell him

750
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,610
Peter met Anderson at new college at Oxford.

751
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,480
They met at Oxford. New college.

752
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
Isn't that right?

753
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,020
What does it matter to you where I met anyone?

754
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,820
Where did you meet? On campus?

755
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,990
I'm sorry,I have no idea where they actually met.

756
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,430
We met at the White Horse.

757
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
On wheatly road,you know it?

758
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,640
I don't recall.

759
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,270
You would. Thai food... it's fantastic.

760
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,610
That's where I met Anderson.

761
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,680
I could tell you what each of us was wearing,

762
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,810
If you want to hear it.

763
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,010
Where the hell did he come up with that?

764
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,350
I have no idea.

765
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,790
It's all here.

766
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,960
Have a seat.

767
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,830
I have to admit...

768
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,530
I was skeptical that you'd come at all.

769
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,230
Well,of course we came.

770
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,540
I thought it would be Paris all over again.

771
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,800
Tell him that was because of

772
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,640
The French intelligence report,and he knows it.

773
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,810
That was because of the french intelligence report.

774
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,580
You know that.

775
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,180
True.

776
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,390
But this is a larger purchase.

777
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,500
Hello?

778
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,940
Okay.

779
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,470
Conrad would like to see you.

780
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,880
When?

781
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,980
Now.

782
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,110
He's on his way.

783
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,790
What's going on?

784
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,320
Do they have the package?

785
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,460
Why isn't she calling the raid?

786
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,020
Because Conrad's coming.

787
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,130
So what?

788
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,630
So she doesn't want to scare him off.

789
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,360
She wants to get him.

790
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,330
She's waiting for Conrad.

791
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,370
We've included this with the purchase.

792
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:02,200
It's a reverse mutator. An antidote.

793
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,740
It would take you years to reverse engineer an antivirus.

794
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,680
It's why the purchase price is so high.

795
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,050
The formula in itself is deceiving in it's complexity

796
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,520
Well,we shouldn't have a need for that.

797
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,150
It's only in case of accidental exposure.

798
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,490
Which,I assure you,would be fatal.

799
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,130
Now why wouldn't Ernesto call me back himself?

800
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,860
And tell me someone else was coming to meet?

801
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,040
Uh-oh.

802
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,410
Oh,god.

803
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,740
Get me a tranquilizer quickly.

804
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,810
It's happening to him.

805
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,350
Hicks is transforming.

806
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,010
Well,how would I know?

807
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,720
I'm not Ernesto's mother.

808
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,020
At least tell me who he was meeting.

809
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,520
Agh.

810
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,050
Eh.

811
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,160
Ah!

812
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,160
Quickly! Quickly!

813
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,990
What the hell is going on?

814
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,070
I asked you...

815
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,740
a simple question.

816
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,310
Who was Ernesto meeting?

817
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,710
I need a name.

818
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,410
Somebody,anybody else in your operation.

819
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,710
Oh,no.

820
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,380
Oh,god. Hicks is out.

821
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,010
I'll ask you again...

822
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,040
Who was your colleague meeting?

823
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,220
Sir,should we move in?

824
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,320
Okay,whoa,whoa,whoa. Okay,okay.

825
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,630
That's enough. Now,just tell them!

826
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,890
Tell them,I'm not getting greased

827
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,030
over Ernesto's dirty little secret.

828
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,360
What secret is that?

829
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,330
- Shut your mouth!  - Ernesto is sick.

830
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,370
He's... he's dying...  sick,okay?

831
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,040
He just doesn't want anybody to know.

832
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,770
Damnit,Liv. Give the signal.

833
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,510
- What the hell is wrong with you,he asked you...  - What the hell is wrong with me?

834
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,810
I got a gun in my face,for starters.

835
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,440
Enough of you. Shut up!

836
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,880
Get that gun out of my face right now.

837
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,850
Gavin!

838
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,820
Who are these people?

839
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,520
According to them,Ernesto's sick.

840
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
It's true.

841
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,090
He found out the day before Christmas.

842
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,430
I spoke to Ernesto this morning.

843
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,570
He's fine.

844
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,970
Kill them both right now.

845
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,840
FBI!

846
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,880
Put the gun down!

847
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,040
Put the gun down!

848
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,810
Hands on the table. Get down.

849
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,690
John Ccott says hi.

850
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,860
Turns out,Conrad's a French citizen.

851
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,370
Conrad Etienne Moreau... Wanted in connection

852
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,800
with at least half a dozen biological attacks.

853
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,070
And those are just the ones we know about.

854
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,870
He's been manufacturing biological weapons

855
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,880
and distributing them on the black market for years.

856
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,150
And you caught him.

857
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,050
I would think you could at least let yourself

858
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,620
crack a smile about that.

859
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,950
Well,I didn't do it alone.

860
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,130
You know...

861
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,130
Despite the successful outcome of this case,

862
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,200
John Scott's status remains the same.

863
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,670
As far as this department is concerned,

864
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,240
He's a traitor.

865
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,970
Even if he was telling the truth.

866
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,140
There's no way to confirm it.

867
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,550
That's all right.

868
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,220
I know the truth.

869
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,820
And that's enough.

870
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,870
Hello?

871
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,770
Anyone here?

872
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,290
Agent Dunham?

873
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,420
Where is everyone?

874
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,930
They took that gentleman that was here

875
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,490
to the hospital,to recover.

876
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,830
So the antidote worked?

877
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,800
He started improving almost as soon

878
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,300
as I administered it.

879
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,470
Which is more than I can say for my own concoction.

880
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,970
Any case,I was just about to read

881
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,280
- a bedtime sto...   - Walter...

882
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,380
I was hoping you'd do me a favor.

883
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,050
Even if you did go back in,

884
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,360
I'm dubious you'd even be able to find him.

885
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,790
What do you mean?

886
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,730
Your brain wave patterns are returning to normal.

887
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,260
Your mind is finally succeeding

888
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,830
Purging itself of agent Scott.

889
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,500
Even if you perfectly reconnect,

890
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,370
it would be for seconds,minutes at best.

891
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,240
And then you would never see him again.

892
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,040
Then we need to do this now.

893
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,950
It's beautiful out here,isn't it?

894
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,570
We caught him today.

895
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,700
Conrad.

896
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,040
Really?

897
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,770
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

898
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,540
I should've trusted you.

899
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,820
No,it wasn't your fault.

900
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,890
I always meant to tell you.

901
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,290
I guess I ran out of time.

902
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,160
There was one other thing.

903
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,650
I know we can't ever be together,

904
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,080
Not really.

905
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,490
Maybe I won't know the difference.

906
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,420
I love you,Liv.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
