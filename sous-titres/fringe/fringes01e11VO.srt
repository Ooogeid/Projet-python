1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,175
Walter, what are you doing?

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,535
I'm dosing a caterpillar.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,435
Dosing, as in lsd?

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,105
Well, it's a special blend.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,930
I see.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,600
Hey, guess what just happened.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,375
Finding out that my father's giving drugs to bugs

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,075
Somehow just became a typical moment in my life.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,535
It's wonderful, isn't it?

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,905
Hey, have you heard from olivia this morning?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,335
No, why? What's up?

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,700
She's missing.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,530
Who are you?

14
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,288
What do you want?

15
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,205
This won't take long.

16
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,730
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Turn her over.

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,775
Listen up.

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,275
One of our own has been abducted.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,675
The vehicle of agent olivia dunham

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,735
Was found abandoned on graniteville road in westford

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,735
Three miles northeast of little hill.

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,205
I want everyone doing everything,

24
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,575
Surveillance cameras checked,

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,875
Local officers and agents questioned,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,205
Anyone who might have seen anything.

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,275
P.D., d.W.P., a.A.A.--

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,905
I don't care what acronym it is,

29
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,875
You get 'em, you talk to 'em, and you find dunham.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,205
For those of you new to this office,

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,605
This is agent charlie francis.

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,135
He's my second in command.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,120
You got anything, you come to me or him.

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,170
Try not to move.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,405
Sir, did it work?

36
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,775
I hope so.

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,705
Get my car ready. I'm going back to the office.

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,460
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,690
Can i please have some water?

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,535
If you're going to kill me,

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,530
Then can i please have some water?

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,900
Please.

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,005
I need to... I need to sit up.

44
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,960
Please.

45
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,060
Oh, thank you, thank you.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Thank you.

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,735
And pull agents from albany, mr. Clark,

48
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,335
And get them to boston, or do i need to remind you

49
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,975
How i started this conversation?

50
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,905
I have a sanford harris, line six.

51
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,635
Just get it done.

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,605
Sanford.

53
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,335
Listen, we, uh...

54
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,035
We're having something of a crisis here.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,075
Yeah, well, your crisis is why i'm calling.

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,305
Look, phillip, we go back too far.

57
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,335
I say something diplomatic, you'll see through it

58
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,975
Before the end of my sentence.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,635
You're calling about olivia dunham?

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,805
I'm calling about fringe division.

61
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,375
Internal affairs is sending me in

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,075
To do a full review of your office,

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,005
Make sure things are running as they should.

64
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,930
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

65
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,735
This is agent dunham.

66
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,135
I need to speak to broyles.

67
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,305
What the hell happened to you?

68
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,675
I'm in watertown.

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,075
There was a building that we need to raid.

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,105
I need agents, maybe 20.

71
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,835
Have them meet me in 30 minutes

72
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,175
At the end of talcott street.

73
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,675
Are you okay?

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
Not yet, i'm not.

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,675
The building i was being held at is two miles...

76
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,005
Hands behind your head and drop to the floor.

77
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,235
Where's broyles?

78
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,035
Do it!

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,335
What's going on here?

80
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
Freeze right there!

81
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,560
Quite a day, agent dunham.

82
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,860
You're in boston hospital.

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,460
You probably didn't think you'd see me again so soon.

84
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,275
Don't take this the wrong way, mr. Harris,

85
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,405
But, uh, i don't think about you all too often.

86
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,430
Really?

87
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,835
Well, you must get some satisfaction

88
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,705
From what you did to me.

89
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,375
My conviction wasn't a point of pride for you?

90
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,705
Why am i cuffed to the bed?

91
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,075
Because this is the kind of authority that I have here.

92
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,055
You see,

93
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,595
My conviction on sexual assault

94
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,830
that you so ably prosecuted was overturned.

95
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,895
And homeland security, for whom I consult,

96
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,135
Has assigned me to review fringe division.

97
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
Just like that?

98
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,905
Which gives me the prerogative to question your sanity, your loyalty,

99
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,035
Your worthiness to serve.

100
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,225
And it seems to me the people you surround

101
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,360
Yourself with have failed those tests at every turn.

102
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,335
Beginning with your former partner...

103
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,360
And lover, john scott.

104
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
John!

105
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,140
An agent who betrayed you

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,365
and who turned out to be a traitor against this country,

107
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,735
A traitor whose life you went to considerable lengths to save.

108
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,185
If you're suggesting that I know anything about... you went

109
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,875
To iraq to recruit a man to help you save agent scott's life.

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,635
Peter bishop, arrested seven times.

111
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,405
I needed peter.

112
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,660
To assist you in freeing his father from a mental institution.

113
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,585
Walter bishop, who was sent to st.

114
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,385
Claire's because he was deemed unfit to stand trial for manslaughter,

115
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,765
A man who spent most of his adult years running

116
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,735
Questionable scientific experiments on human subjects.

117
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,175
He's out of his mind, miss dunham.

118
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,605
These are the people you surround yourself with.

119
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,905
A traitor, a criminal, and a lunatic.

120
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,230
What does that say about you?

121
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,900
Am I under arrest?

122
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,435
It goes without saying that you are not to investigate your own abduction.

123
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,700
Understood?

124
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,400
Liv.

125
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,405
Are you okay?

126
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,700
Yep.

127
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,265
Hey, liv, you know I had nothing to do with the way you were taken in,

128
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,735
Right?

129
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,475
Yeah, I know that.

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,035
That son of a bitch harris, he molested three women.

131
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,735
I put him away, and that's what this is about.

132
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,075
I am not gonna ask him for a thing.

133
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,735
I'm gonna go to that building myself.

134
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,860
We sent a team to the address, to the building where you were being held.

135
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,635
It was empty.

136
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,705
There was nothing there.

137
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,305
What about the phone I got?

138
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,735
The car I took? Did you trace...

139
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,675
They're clean.

140
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,860
The only prints were you.

141
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,135
Oh, there's something else.

142
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,475
There's a woman here to see you...rachel.

143
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,875
She says that you're expecting her.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,460
Who is she?

145
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,400
She's my sister.

146
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,835
How are you?

147
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,805
Oh, oh, you look great.

148
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,875
- I don't really. - Come on, you do.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,805
I don't. You're always so hard on yourself.

150
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,435
I know, whatever. Thank you.

151
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,075
You are just a giant person.

152
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,735
Hey, aunt olivia. Hello.

153
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,275
When did you get so big?

154
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,375
What happened to your face?

155
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,475
Oh, it's, um, a scratch.

156
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,635
I brought this for you.

157
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,060
She wanted to bring you something from her room.

158
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,275
I have really, really needed one of these.

159
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,160
Thank you so much.

160
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,405
Are you sure you're okay?

161
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,805
It's a long story.

162
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,875
I, uh... I'm working on a case.

163
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,675
Go, go, we're good.

164
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,675
Is it okay if we still stay with you tonight?

165
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,875
'cause if it's not okay... yeah, yeah.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,135
No, of course.

167
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,405
I'll meet you back here at 5:00.

168
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,135
Perfect. Go, save the world.

169
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,335
All right. I love you.

170
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,605
- I'll see you at 5:00. - Thank you so much.

171
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,430
Mwah. Bye.

172
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,175
Peter, it's me.

173
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,935
Olivia, thank god.

174
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,675
Are you okay? How are you?

175
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,335
- Where are you? - I'm on my way to you.

176
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,035
So can you meet me outside in ten minutes?

177
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,830
And bring your father. I think we'll need him.

178
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,900
Do I have to?

179
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,835
They...they gave me a spinal tap.

180
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,005
They put electrodes or sensors on my head.

181
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,635
Why would they do that?

182
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,005
I mean, what would they want with me?

183
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,275
What were they doing? Who could they be?

184
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,435
You're like the question machine.

185
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,205
And there was nothing there when they checked the building?

186
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,235
No.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,535
They'd cleared the building.

188
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,105
But I took something before I left, something from one of their labs,

189
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,735
And I hid it to keep it safe.

190
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,230
What was it?

191
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,405
Walter, can you identify what it is?

192
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,830
Yes.

193
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,135
I'm afraid I can.

194
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,065
Which means if your high school bio teacher told you that

195
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,675
Humans sit at the top of the food chain, he or she was dead wrong.

196
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,715
Literally millions and millions of organisms feed on us,

197
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,860
Reproduce within us.

198
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,695
Viruses, bacteria, protozoa,

199
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,960
And fungi... the four musketeers of the pathogenic world.

200
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,530
Dr. Kinberg?

201
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,635
Dr. Kinberg?

202
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
Somebody call an ambulance.

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Someone help him.

204
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,030
Somebody help him.

205
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Agent dunham, I know you've already had quite a day.

206
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,830
But there is an event that requires our attention

207
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,240
Okay, where

208
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,075
Internal hemorrhaging.

209
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,875
Rapid cell deterioration.

210
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,605
It appears that he suffocated from within.

211
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,405
Well, maybe that's 'cause a giant, slimy,

212
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,975
Spiky slug came out of his mouth.

213
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,400
Yes.

214
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,035
And I have a theory as to what it might have been.

215
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,705
I'm sure you do. Care you share?

216
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,375
Eventually.

217
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,605
Peter, anything?

218
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,335
No, it always takes a second for the thermal cameras to calibrate.

219
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,575
What do we know about our guy?

220
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,075
Only what I was told outside.

221
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,915
His name's miles kinberg, immunologist, cutting edge work,

222
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,605
An expert in his field.

223
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,935
That's all I know.

224
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,035
Whatever it was, it ripped through his esophagus on the way out.

225
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,275
At least he died teaching, a righteous profession.

226
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,875
Hold on a sec.

227
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,275
I got it.

228
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Stay there.

229
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,475
Right there.

230
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,535
Right there, right there.

231
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,160
Look.

232
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,375
Simian hemorrhagic fever.

233
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,835
The infected cells have a definitive spiderweb look.

234
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,235
Makes hiv look like a common cold by comparison.

235
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,260
Walter.

236
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,635
Ebola.

237
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,005
First the headaches then the skin turns to rice pudding.

238
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,205
Walter, please.

239
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,560
No time for the immune response.

240
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,375
I lost it.

241
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,005
What do you mean you lost it?

242
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,505
Either it can vanish or it's fast.

243
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,005
It's really fast.

244
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,005
There.

245
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,005
Cover the doors!

246
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,505
It's going down.

247
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,675
There!

248
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,135
Get it!

249
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,305
There! There!

250
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,600
Get it, get it. Get it.

251
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,330
Things like this used to happen in the lab all the time.

252
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,500
Makes me nostalgic.

253
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,435
Spirited, isn't it?

254
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,335
Well, have you considered, I don't know, killing it?

255
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,335
We can always kill it, son.

256
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,035
We can't always bring it back.

257
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,705
You probably could.

258
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,105
That is true.

259
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,905
Do you know what I could go for?

260
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,135
Don't say food.

261
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,330
Cheese steak.

262
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,635
How can he even think about eating?

263
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,975
I know. It's disgusting, right?

264
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,205
And yet...

265
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,605
Ha, you want one too?

266
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,305
Extra provolone, please.

267
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,035
Like father like son.

268
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,400
Oh, come on, don't say that.

269
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,275
My theory is correct.

270
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,675
I knew it.

271
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,055
This organism was developed from the same

272
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,675
Material that olivia stole from her captors.

273
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,905
We must let her know.

274
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,705
You sure?

275
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:32,975
My boy,

276
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,205
I'm not even sure that we all exist on the same plane of consciousness.

277
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,500
But yes, I believe so.

278
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,535
I've been briefed on how you brought in olivia dunham.

279
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,775
Oh, I had reason to suspect she might be dangerous.

280
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,035
I agreed to let you question her, not tranq her like a rabid dog.

281
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,075
What you did was unacceptable.

282
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,805
Dunham's been nothing but an exemplary agent, and this is my office.

283
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,875
Well, then you need to be corrected on two counts.

284
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,875
The jury's out on dunham.

285
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,775
I'm not convinced she's the superstar you claim she is.

286
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,875
How could you be?

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,435
You're on a vendetta against her.

288
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,625
Secondly, while I'm here on active investigation,

289
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,275
This division is under my purview.

290
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,905
Active investigation?

291
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,075
This morning it was a review.

292
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,505
Well, the pentagon is concerned, phillip.

293
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,305
Well, think of how this office was thrown together.

294
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,105
Flight 627 lands, and suddenly you're in charge of two dozen agents?

295
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,935
Somehow I think none of that's the reason you're here.

296
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,035
This isn't a witch hunt.

297
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,385
I'm not here to punish some j.v.

298
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,935
Agent who tried to ruin my life for chasing a little tail.

299
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,775
I'm here to do my job.

300
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,800
Why don't you do the same?

301
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,235
Did you see anyone unusual?

302
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,675
Anyone in your class?

303
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,805
No.

304
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,375
And did he mention anything to you?

305
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,675
Anything in private?

306
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,005
Why would he?

307
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,475
'cause you were his teacher's assistant. Oh.

308
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,135
I thought that he might have mentioned if something unusual had happened.

309
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,535
No, he didn't. Nothing.

310
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,105
We've been trying to track kinberg's whereabouts over the past week.

311
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,335
We spoke to his wife, and she said that he had arrived home the last two nights.

312
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,205
But according to his schedule, his last class started at 6:00.

313
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,535
He's had extended office hours this week.

314
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,675
Well, could I get a list of the students he talked to?

315
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,900
It was drop-in. I'm not really sure.

316
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,335
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,075
After what happened today, I feel like nothing's real.

318
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,005
That was crazy. It was... how long were you seeing him?

319
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,160
Professor kinberg.

320
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,505
Three months.

321
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,575
I knew he was gonna take the job.

322
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,005
He hadn't even told his wife about it yet.

323
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,605
What job was that?

324
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,005
I shouldn't.

325
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,605
He wasn't supposed to tell me.

326
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,435
It's okay.

327
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,060
The c.d.c.

328
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,275
Centers for disease control.

329
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,305
They offered him this big job, which meant moving to atlanta.

330
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,705
So I figured that was gonna be it for us.

331
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,105
And what exactly was the job?

332
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,275
Task for to oversee the country's preparedness to fight off an epidemic.

333
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,700
It sounded like a big deal.

334
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,735
Can I come in?

335
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,975
I hate that... knocking and asking while you're coming in.

336
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,095
Dr. Kinberg

337
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,125
The professor who died at boston college,

338
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,175
Was offered a job at the c.d.c.

339
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,465
To co-chair a classified task force whose

340
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,205
Sole responsibility was to respond to epidemics.

341
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,335
And?

342
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,175
He wasn't the only scientist asked.

343
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,905
There was another one... dr. Russell simon from cambridge.

344
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,575
I'm trying to locate him now.

345
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,405
What, you think he's a target too?

346
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,735
I do.

347
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,555
And I also think that the people who

348
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,975
Killed kinberg are the same people who took me.

349
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,835
And how'd you make that leap?

350
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,105
Walter, he thinks the thing that killed

351
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,195
dr. Kinberg is genetically similar to some

352
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,335
Evidence that I grabbed from the people who abducted me.

353
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,935
But why abduct you? What's the link?

354
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,475
And why kill kinberg like that?

355
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,705
I don't know yet.

356
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,725
But so far I figured why kill an

357
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,435
Epidemiologist unless you're looking to start an epidemic?

358
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,805
Get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire.

359
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,735
And why am I just now hearing of this?

360
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,255
Because your friend Sanford Harris

361
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,405
Forbade me from investigating my own abduction.

362
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,430
Harris.

363
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,535
He's put everything on hold.

364
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,805
Has requested that I run all operations past him before we move.

365
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,875
Is that even possible?

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,505
Apparently.

367
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,475
Sir, I'm asking you to save a man's life.

368
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,605
Are you telling me that you don't have the authority to let me do my job?

369
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,935
Find Simon.

370
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,335
Get him in protective custody now.

371
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,335
Thank you.

372
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,335
I'll handle Harris.

373
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,775
I know you will.

374
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,105
Hey, rach, it's me.

375
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,675
Can we just meet at the apartment?

376
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,075
- Is that okay?
- yeah, sure.

377
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,305
I have the key. Is everything okay?

378
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,405
Yeah, I'm fine. I won't be too late.

379
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,865
And if you get hungry, there's food in the fridge,

380
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,715
Or there are some menus by the phone

381
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,775
In the kitchen if you want to order in.

382
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,075
Don't worry about us at all.

383
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,375
Ella's having a blast.

384
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,705
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

385
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,935
I love you.

386
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,535
You too.

387
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,035
I'm going to cambridge to pick up Russell Simon.

388
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,305
Who's that?

389
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,635
A man we're taking into protective custody.

390
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,235
I'll give you the details on the way.

391
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,675
Oh, I'm going with you?

392
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,660
- Ye
- Meet you downstairs.

393
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,305
Hey, mitch.

394
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,205
Listen, olivia, your abduction.

395
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,935
I'm gonna coordinate the investigation.

396
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,105
I assume everything you remember is already in your debrief.

397
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,575
Yeah.

398
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,875
If I find anything, I'll let you know.

399
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,005
We'll find 'em.

400
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,130
That's great, mitch. Thank you.

401
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,335
Thank you so much, dr. Simon, for cooperating.

402
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,175
I suppose I should be thanking you.

403
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,105
Fbi tells you they're here to save your life, you listen.

404
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,975
Well, I know it must be confusing.

405
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,635
Well, it's certainly shocking.

406
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,305
Miles was a dear friend.

407
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,505
I am sorry.

408
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,175
Know that we're doing everything we

409
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,375
Can to bring those responsible to justice.

410
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,705
The c.d.c. Wasn't expecting me for three months.

411
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,475
Who else kneyou were planning on taking this job?

412
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,535
Well, no one. Just my wife.

413
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,635
I was instructed not to tell anyone.

414
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,005
And is there anyone you can think of who might be targeting you?

415
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,060
Maybe students whose grades they might have felt were undeserved.

416
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,805
Will you excuse us for a moment?

417
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,235
I need to talk to my agents.

418
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,660
Sure.

419
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,275
Can you give us a minute?

420
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,915
So I understand that you have requested placing dr.

421
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,105
Simon in protective custody.

422
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,335
I believe that his life may be in danger.

423
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,965
Yeah, well, that's taxpayer dollars, miss dunham,

424
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,605
And I haven't approved that.

425
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,835
Let me ask you a question.

426
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,455
Not that I don't enjoy having you here,

427
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,635
But how long are you planning on sticking around?

428
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,985
Until I have made a full assessment

429
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,805
Of how this office conducts its business.

430
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,935
Did Broyles approve your request?

431
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,130
No, he did not.

432
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,585
Harris, you don't like me, you don't respect me,

433
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,605
And you think I'm bad at my job.

434
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,775
But please, don't let that get in the way of doing the right thing.

435
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,805
That man in there may likely die if we don't keep him safe.

436
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,105
I'm not asking you to like me.

437
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm asking you to do the right thing.

438
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Yeah, we'll keep him safe.

439
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,130
Thank you.

440
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,005
This is dunham.

441
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,425
Walter's still trying to determine

442
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,305
What that thing is that came out of kinberg.

443
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,435
But I think we made a breakthrough.

444
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,935
Okay, so what is it?

445
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,705
It seems to be activated by a liquid.

446
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,035
What does? The parasite?

447
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,365
The yellow powdery stuff in the vials that you stole, they're like eggs,

448
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,005
But the catalyst is stomach acid.

449
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,535
So the victim just needs to ingest it?

450
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,030
Exactly right, and then it grows... fast.

451
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,205
Thank you.

452
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,830
No problem.

453
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,475
And is there any way to trace it, where it came from?

454
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,500
Walter doesn't seem to think so, no.

455
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,435
Dr. Simon, with your permission, I'd like to take you to our field office.

456
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,635
We'll debrief you, go over your options.

457
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,605
Then we'll move you to a safe house.

458
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,275
You okay?

459
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,505
Yeah.

460
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,260
There'll be agents there on call 24 hours a day.

461
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,430
Breathe.

462
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,605
This is agent francis.

463
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,435
I need medical attention in room six.

464
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,200
I called medical assistance.

465
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,330
Oh, my god.

466
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,605
It's viral.

467
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,335
Nasopharyngitis, albeit a gargantuan specimen.

468
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,635
What... what does that mean?

469
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,375
This organism is a single specimen of a virus for the common cold.

470
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,705
So you're saying that this is one single cell?

471
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,935
It's not unprecedented.

472
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,575
The ostrich egg is a single cell, and it can grow up to five pounds.

473
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,575
They supersized the common cold, which, as it turns out, is disgusting.

474
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,475
Obviously somebody's playing with us.

475
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,635
Yeah, they're showing off.

476
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,735
Killing epidemiologist with the common cold.

477
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,035
It is impressive.

478
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,205
What I want to know is what they wanted from you.

479
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,105
Oh, who cares about me? I want to know who's next.

480
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,535
I care about you.

481
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,795
If we can figure out why they needed you,

482
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,300
Then maybe we can figure out who's next.

483
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm gonna keep looking for someone who's connected to kinberg and simon.

484
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,535
She is beautiful, isn't she?

485
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,960
Who?

486
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
The slug.

487
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,150
You know, I could have cooked for you.

488
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,735
Uh, no, thanks. I've tasted your cooking.

489
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,405
Hey, I've gotten really good, you know.

490
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,375
Oh, yeah?

491
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,435
Yeah.

492
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,575
No, I haven't.

493
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,075
I didn't think so.

494
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,360
Hard day?

495
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,475
Uh, I honestly wouldn't know what to tell you.

496
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,375
And if I did, it would be a felony.

497
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,575
You have a crazy job.

498
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,575
Yeah, I have a crazy job.

499
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,105
Cheers.

500
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,560
Cheers.

501
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,200
Have you heard from Greg?

502
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,905
I don't know how to do this alone.

503
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,975
Ella is beautiful, and smart, and strong, and she gets that from you.

504
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,135
Me? No.

505
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,875
You've always been the strong one, you have.

506
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,500
Rach.

507
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,975
I've only done one thing right in my life.

508
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,935
Then you need to be strong for her.

509
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,975
Whatever you need, I'm here.

510
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,730
And you guys can stay here as long as you want.

511
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,030
Thank you.

512
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,435
Is there something else?

513
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,705
Something you're not telling me?

514
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,930
No.

515
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,330
No, there's nothing else.

516
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,675
How goes it?

517
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,805
Horrible.

518
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:51,105
We'll find 'em, whoever's responsible for what happened.

519
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,300
Maybe this'll help.

520
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,775
I need to talk to you.

521
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,005
Charlie, I think I know who killed Simon.

522
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,575
And I think it's the same person who abducted me.

523
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,000
Who?

524
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,075
Mitchell Loeb.

525
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,335
Don't ask me how I know. I'll tell you later.

526
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,305
Livvy, that can't be right.

527
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,535
It is.

528
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,035
And I can prove it.

529
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,175
But I've got Harris watching me like a prison guard.

530
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,630
I can't do this myself.

531
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,830
What do you need?

532
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,005
Walter, is that lsd?

533
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,375
Lsd, why would i... it's a decongestant.

534
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,475
She is a giant cold virus after all.

535
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,800
Right.

536
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,405
Peter.

537
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,360
You got a moment?

538
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,605
What's up?

539
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,675
Olivia may have a lead on who abducted her.

540
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,775
Only she can't pursue it without some help.

541
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,205
I can't help her.

542
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,635
Why not?

543
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,565
Suffice it to say that sometimes a problem with being

544
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,875
In law enforcement is that you gotta obey the law yourself.

545
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,975
And you think I'm the guy to break the law for you?

546
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,575
I'm sorry, I didn't... no, look, you're right.

547
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,875
I am the guy to break the law for you.

548
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,060
What do we need?

549
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,335
I need a wiretap.

550
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,360
On who?

551
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,975
Mitchell Loeb.

552
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,400
FBI.

553
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,400
Hello?

554
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,905
Samantha.

555
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,935
Olivia, hi.

556
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,905
I was just in marlborough.

557
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,675
I thought I'd drop by and check to see if you're okay.

558
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,705
I don't understand.

559
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,305
I don't know.

560
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,400
I guess I hadn't talked to you since Mitchell's surgery.

561
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,460
Well, how sweet of you.

562
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,475
Would you like to come inside?

563
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,905
Have a cup of tea?

564
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,930
Yeah, thank you.

565
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,575
I've been thinking a lot about you and

566
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,835
Everything that you and Mitchell went through.

567
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,105
It's really lovely having him back at the office.

568
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,975
Oh, yes, he's really glad to be back.

569
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,560
His recovery seemed to go smoothly.

570
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,435
What were you doing in Marlborough?

571
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,135
I'm working on a case.

572
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,705
Well, what's the case?

573
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,130
Suspicion of a double agent.

574
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,160
Excuse me.

575
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,205
I'll get the tea.

576
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,200
Mind if I use your bathroom?

577
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,375
It's down the hall.

578
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,800
Thank you.

579
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,575
Kyle.

580
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,675
Hey, man. Can you grab me that phone?

581
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
All right, go ahead.

582
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,005
Okay, so I enter the phone number and then just punch in that code?

583
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,005
Kyle, you are the greatest, man.

584
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,575
Have I told you that lately?

585
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,305
Yeah, thanks. You too.

586
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,305
He used to work at the phone company,

587
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,735
but I never really understood why.

588
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,735
The guy's a genius.

589
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,135
Yeah, right.

590
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,060
Wouldn't want to waste any of that potential.

591
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,075
He tapped into the Loebs' home phone number.

592
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,960
We should be able to pick up any outgoing calls that make from their house.

593
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,135
This is Mitchell.

594
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,735
Olivia Dunham is in our house.

595
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,075
Why?

596
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,260
She claims she was here to check on you.

597
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,530
Is it working?

598
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,630
No.

599
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,505
Hey, Kyle, it's not working.

600
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,605
All I'm getting is buzz. I don't hear anything.

601
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,035
I think she knows.

602
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,905
I don't know how she could.

603
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,035
I don't know what to do.

604
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,075
Well, I do.

605
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,405
And you have to move fast.

606
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,030
What?

607
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,905
You need to kill her.

608
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,300
Right now.

609
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,975
Her office might know that she's here.

610
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,275
How can I just... Dunham's already under suspicion for being unstable.

611
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,005
They think she's dangerous.

612
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,230
All right, I'll try it again.

613
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,405
We can say she came after you, that it was self-defense.

614
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,275
There has to be another way to do this.

615
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,535
There isn't, honey. There's one way.

616
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,875
You cannot let Dunham leave there alive.

617
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,575
In the entry closet, top shelf, in the back, there's a gun.

618
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,900
Contact me when it's done.

619
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,405
What is it? Olivia's in trouble.

620
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,360
What happened? Hold on a second.

621
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Come on, pick up, pick up.

622
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,875
It's me.

623
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,675
Get out of the house. She's gonna kill you.

624
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,735
What?

625
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,235
Samantha Loeb is going to kill you.

626
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,460
Get out of the house right now.

627
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,560
Olivia.

628
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,060
Tea's ready.

629
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,230
Olivia?

630
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,405
Samantha.

631
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,705
Turn around and put the gun on the ground.

632
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,000
Put the gun down.

633
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,235
Now get down on the ground.

634
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,575
Samantha.

635
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,535
Please, don't hurt me.

636
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,875
Get on the ground, samantha.

637
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,075
I was just doing... samantha, get down on the ground now.

638
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,435
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

639
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,405
What are you gonna do to me? Are you gonna hurt me?

640
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,475
Damn it, samantha, shut the hell up and get down on the ground.

641
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
Don't do it. Please get down!

642
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,675
There's nothing here.

643
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,905
Loeb knew he was gonna cut and run.

644
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,535
Based on what you've found, you have nothing to trace.

645
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,935
No, nothing yet.

646
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,755
I'll need more time to trace the origin of the virus,

647
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,175
But even then it will be impossible to know the exact origin.

648
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,605
Liv, I hate to even ask you this.

649
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,275
Anything you remember from when they had you?

650
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,435
No, there's nothing that I heard, nothing that I remember.

651
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,235
There's no other way to track loeb's cell phone?

652
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,805
Tech services tried everything.

653
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,275
Wait a minute, not everything.

654
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,505
The agents at loeb's house,

655
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,735
They're surveilling the area, right?

656
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,005
No sign of loeb? Not yet.

657
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,475
So he doesn't know about his wife.

658
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,605
No, he doesn't.

659
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,475
Meaning that she could still contact him.

660
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,935
I'm ahead of you. I'll get a team.

661
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,805
What happened? I missed it.

662
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,535
Okay, we need samantha loeb's cell phone.

663
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,105
I think inventory has it. I'm on it.

664
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,900
Nice work. Thanks.

665
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,705
It's all rather tense, isn't it?

666
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,105
He's gonna come.

667
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,505
Assuming, of course, they text each other.

668
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,575
Do you see him yet?

669
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,600
No, not yet.

670
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,635
Peter was really worried about you when you were gone.

671
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,875
Walter. You were.

672
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,005
Well, of course I was worried.

673
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,630
He was really worried.

674
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,300
We got him.

675
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,660
Okay, you stay here.

676
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,435
Mitchell, put it down! Put it down!

677
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,900
Freeze!

678
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,405
Drop it.

679
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,200
Drop your weapon.

680
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,060
You're under arrest.

681
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,960
Nice work.

682
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,260
Thank you.

683
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,760
Who are you working for?

684
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,575
Don't be an idiot, loeb.

685
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,735
This is your one chance to cooperate.

686
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,275
I'd say to you that you have no idea how

687
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,855
Hard we're gonna come down on you,

688
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,435
Except you do.

689
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,075
I want to see my wife.

690
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,205
You're not getting a thing until you talk.

691
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,375
Then you're outta luck.

692
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,335
Why'd you kill them, kinberg and simon?

693
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,605
Any why like that?

694
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,305
I mean, there are easier ways to take somebody out.

695
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,305
You're getting nothing.

696
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,005
She can't do it.

697
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,505
She won't get a confession.

698
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,975
I'd say the evidence in his house is plenty.

699
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,605
Well, I'd say evidence is no confession.

700
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,435
Ask as many questions as you want.

701
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,735
Why take me?

702
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,935
And that spinal tap, what did you want?

703
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,475
Loeb, this is your last chance to cooperate.

704
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,030
Or what, you'll torture me?

705
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,100
Can you leave me alone with him?

706
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,375
What's she doing?

707
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,705
You want your wife, mitch?

708
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,800
Yeah, olivia, I do.

709
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,930
Okay.

710
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,130
Okay.

711
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,730
And do you want to know who pulled the trigger?

712
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,560
Mitch.

713
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,300
You're looking at her.

714
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,260
Did you kill them?

715
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,535
Did you? Yes!

716
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,335
Do you not understand the rules?

717
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,675
What we're up against?

718
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,335
Who the two sides are?

719
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,075
Tell me at least you know that. Who's we?

720
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,735
We had a plan here, lady.

721
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,575
We had a shot.

722
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,575
And you just blew it.

723
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,935
Why did you kidnap me?

724
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,405
Kidnap you?

725
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,175
Idiot.

726
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,805
We saved you.

727
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:26,805
Saved me from what?

728
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,405
We were going to let you go.

729
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,435
We saved you.

730
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,935
You... you have no idea what you've done.

731
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,030
Not a clue.

732
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,160
There's your confession.

733
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,935
You need to get some rest.

734
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,435
I think you've earned it.

735
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,905
I'll see you tomorrow.

736
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,530
Thank you.

737
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,775
Thank you.

738
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,575
He's right.

739
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,305
You should get home.

740
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,175
What did he mean he saved me? What the hell was that?

741
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,635
He was messing with you.

742
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,735
Well, I don't know.

743
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,075
I mean, did you see him?

744
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,135
There was something about the way he said that.

745
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,235
The man's insane, olivia.

746
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,875
I concur, and in the category of takes one to know one...

747
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,575
That man did seem disturbed.

748
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,875
But then why take me?

749
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,305
Because they wanted to hurt you.

750
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,875
They knew that you were investigating them.

751
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,105
They wanted to take you out.

752
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,935
Then why not just kill me?

753
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,565
You're talking about a man

754
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,205
Who infects people with giant viruses.

755
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,875
If you hadn't escaped, Who knows what they would have done to you.

756
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,305
Listen to me, you'd just told him that you killed his wife.

757
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,935
He said that to you to try and get a reaction out of you, to get to you.

758
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,335
Let it go.

759
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,175
You got his confession.

760
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,835
Go home.

761
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,035
I was worried, too, when you were taken.

762
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,030
Thank you, walter.

763
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,635
Not as much as him, of course.

764
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,030
Walter. It's true.
