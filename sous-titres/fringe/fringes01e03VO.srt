00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,369
forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.

3
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,938
it's been three months
since i've confessed.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:24,950
go on, my son.

5
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:34,116
do-

6
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:39,215
do you believe that god
can speak to you, father?

7
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,941
of course i do.

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,012
the lord speaks
to all of us

9
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,052
who are willing
to listen.

10
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,874
what about the devil, then?

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:52,467
do you want
to confess something, my son?

12
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:56,789
i'm a good man, father. i-

13
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,503
i try to be a good man.

14
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:00,479
but i-

15
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,105
i see things.

16
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,575
i s-
see things.

17
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:32,369
i don't know why he chose me,

18
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:35,186
but it's happening again.

19
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,761
it's happening again,
and i'm scared.

20
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,380
scared of what?

21
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,428
of what's going
to happen on the bus.

22
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,485
i want it to stop.
please.

23
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,701
i just want it
to stop.

24
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,876

hurt someone?

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,971
son, come back. roy!i know it is you.

the souls of the just
are in the hand of god.

33

and no torment shall touch them.

34
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,023
they seemed,
in the view of the foolish,

35
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,661
to be dead.

36
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,090
and their passing away
was thought an affliction.

37
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,682
d their going forth from us,
utter destruction.

38

39
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,271
you know,
you being here, libby

40
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,189
you did
the right thing.

41
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:39,440
yeah.

42
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,523
the man betrays his country,
turning over state secrets

43
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:42,622
to god knows who,

44
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,012
and here we are,
pretending he's a hero.

45
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:45,557
i know.stop.

46
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,489
bureau's got
one black eye as it is.

47
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:49,106
the last thing
we need right now

48
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,689
is another
espionage scandal.

49
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:52,258
you made it through.

50
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:54,738
it's over now.

51
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,921
did you see
john's mother?

52
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,833
she wouldn't stop
looking at me.

53
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:01,620
his mother.

54
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,921
yeah, like she was

55
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,706
blaming me
for what happened to him.

56
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,709
like it was my fault
he was dead.

57
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,058
as far as
john's mother knows,

58
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:11,169
her son died a hero
servin' his country.

59
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:13,297
a hero.

60
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,298
he used me, charlie.

61
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,142
and he told me
he loved me.

62
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,308
i wasn't gonna
tell you this,

63
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:28,931
but he said
he loved me too.

64
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,435
agent dunham.

65
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:39,574
agent francis.

66
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:42,040
i need you to come with me.

67
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:45,402
thank you.

68
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,796
you brought
your own sweetener?

69
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:05,402
don't be ridiculous.

70
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:07,417
it's my medication.

71
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,654
you're not on any
medication, walter.

72
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,041
of course i am.

73
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,075
i been making it
myself in the lab.

74
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,796
oh, i wish
you were joking.

75
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,430
you're self-medicating.
with homemade drugs.

76
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,456
simple combination
of dextromethorphan,

77
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:24,988
clonazepam,

78
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,288
and some fluoxetine.

79
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,470
those are psychotics, walter.
all of them.

80
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,416
of course they are.
that's the point.

81
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,356
i have been
in a mental facility

82
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:38,355
for the past
17 years.

83
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,124
it's put me quite
out of balance.

84
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:44,491
stay here
for a second, would you?

85
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:46,031
what if i need
to use the bathroom?

86
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,858
just hold it.
i'll be right back.

87
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:07,988
hey!
what're you doin'?

88
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,729
what, you thought
i didn't see you all day?

89
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,256
you were supposed
to check in

90
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,821
before you came home.

91
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,722
if you tell
anybody else that i'm here,

92
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,722
you're the first one
of the bunch

93
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,561
i'm gonna come after.

94
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:40,837
it was moving.
but i stopped it.

95
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,669
there was something important.

96
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,268
i've decided
on the pancakes.

97
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,083
blueberry.

98
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,888
that's great, walter.

99
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,450
did somebody call me
on the phone?

100
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:59,941
that's what was important.

101
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,413
something about a bus.

102
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,165
the incident occurred

103
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:06,382
at 8:14 am.
middle of rush hour.

104
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:07,722
first responders
were worried

105
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,021
it was bioterrorism.

106
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,256
ghosts of the sarin subway
incident in tokyo in 1995.

107
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:14,479
they called
in the cdc,

108
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,689
confirmed the attack
isn't biological in nature.

109
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,763
there's no contingent.

110
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,973
and you said there wasn't
any good news.

111
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:20,867
excuse me.

112
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,390
team's coming in
to transfer this bus

113
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,388
to a secure area.

114
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,785
i want you to extend
the perimeter

115
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,654
outside the tunnel
another 50 yards.

116
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:34,732
it's horrible.

117
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:37,620
they're like mosquitoes
trapped in amber.

118
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,936
if this was some sort
of attack, why not

119
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,292
just use
something conventional,

120
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:45,631
like plastic explosives?

121
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:46,906
a pipe bomb?

122
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:48,757
impact.

123
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,925
whoever did this
wanted attention.

124
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,280
i mean, look at that.

125
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:55,925
or it's not
an attack at all.

126
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:57,156
and it's something
else entirely.

127
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:57,945
meaning what?

128
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,406
if i knew that,
you wouldn't be here.

129
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,997
i imagine that
the material was released

130
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:04,162
in gaseous form
before solidification.

131
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,401
i need to study it
back in my lab.

132
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:06,927
can i have some?

133
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:08,923
we'll have to dig out
their personal effects

134
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,303
so we can id them.

135
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,945
notify their next of kin.

136
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:34,601
it's not here.

137
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:40,302
in eius telephoni non fuit.

138
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,822
quomodo pergemus?

139
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:37,316
roy?

140
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,571
what is that?

141
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,619
i don't know.

142
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:57,159
hu

143
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,713
any idea
what it is yet?

144
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,989
tricky. very tricky.

145
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,265
all i've been able to discern

146
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,989
is that it starts
as a silicon-based aerosol,

147
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,043
and it solidifies somehow.

148
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,723
you could be
of assistance to me.

149
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,456
i would love
to hear some bach.

150
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,978
mass in a minor.

151
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:26,118
will you play it
for me?

152
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,390
i'm sure the young lady
down there

153
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:30,634
would get us a piano.

154
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,798
that young lady
is an fbi agent, walter.

155
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,923
her name is astrid,
and this is the 100th time

156
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,221
you've forgotten
her name.

157
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:42,038
no. i don't think
i can get you a piano.

158
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,439
you always resisted
your lessons too.

159
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,049
lack of commitment, son.

160
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,957
was always
your problem.

161
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:50,654
imagine that's why

162
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:52,718
you still haven't
chosen a profession.

163
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:54,490
i suppose i should've
followed in your footsteps.

164
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,041
'cause your work
has obviously

165
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,458
brought such joy
to the world.

166
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,161
who was he, peter?

167
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,070
sorry?

168
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,485
the man in the restaurant.

169
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,563
you in some kind of trouble?

170
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:10,555
it was nothing.

171
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,973
he was harassing the waitress.

172
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,481
i just told him to cut it out.

173
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,145
oh i see.

174
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,052
'scuse me.

175
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,225
can you please
extract this camera?

176
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,928
i want you to note all
the people on this video.

177
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,574
cross-check them
with the victims.

178
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,902
if we're lucky,
maybe she caught whoever did-

179
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,079
stop. go back.

180
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,255
can you close in on that woman?

181
00:13:58,323 --> 00:13:59,482
what is it?

182
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:00,494
that backpack.

183
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,338
i just saw that woman,
that backpack wasn't there.

184
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:04,503
has anyone seen

185
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:06,756
a blue backpack
with the other personal effects?

186
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,529
so someone
took the bag from her?

187
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,336
got off the bus
before the attack?

188
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,492
who is she?

189
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,935
evelina mendoza.

190
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,730
she's a federal employee.

191
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,896
what's her job?

192
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:29,565
oh, my god.
she's dea.

193
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,616
the woman who died on the bus,
whose backpack was stolen,

194
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,010
she was
a drug enforcement agent.

195
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,804
undercover.

196
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,755
she had a handler,
grant davidson.

197
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,283
i wanna bring him in
for questioning.

198
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,089
i apologize if i wasn't helpful
on the phone.

199
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,970
i needed to ask
my superiors

200
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,857
for clearance
to talk to you about eve.

201
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,649
our condolences.

202
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,161
from her records
she seemed

203
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:54,304
like an exemplary agent.

204
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,585
ah, she was.

205
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,565
can you tell us about the case
she was working on?

206
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,562
uh, three months ago
she was tasked

207
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,889
to infiltrate
the east coast representatives

208
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,885
of a nicaraguan
drug cartel.

209
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,290
we'd been bangin' on them
for over a year.

210
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,364
she called me.

211
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,423
said she wanted me
to pull her out.

212
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,188
she was scared.

213
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:19,057
said she heard
members of the cartel

214
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,162
discussing something
about the pattern.

215
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,802
i told her i never
heard of it.

216
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,921
and, uh, we set up a meet
but she never showed.

217
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:29,223
it appears whoever
attacked the bus this morning

218
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,624
was interested
in one of her effects.

219
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:33,376
do you have any idea
what she could've been carrying?

220
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,249
i wish i could
be more helpful.

221
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,338
you have been,
agent davidson.

222
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,370
thank you.

223
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:44,513
uh, i've been asked
to officially i.d. her body.

224
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,634
i suppose that won't
be a problem.

225
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,692
have you spoken
with her family?

226
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,124
uh, there's a brother
she doesn't talk to.

227
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:03,913
i didn't realize how hard
this was gonna be.

228
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,634
you don't
have to explain.

229
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,390
i know what it's like
to lose someone

230
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,872
you've worked with closely.

231
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:13,778
i'd uh-
i'd like to say good-bye.

232
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,109
of course.

233
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:50,678
should i bother
to ask?

234
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,828
music helps
him process.

235
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:53,721
it works too.

236
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:54,989
as soon as peter
started playing,

237
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:56,437
walter just kinda
locked in.

238
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,323
he was able
to recreate the material

239
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,620
from the crime scene.

240
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,218
hey.

241
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:03,541
i hear you
play the piano.

242
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,516
he doesn't
just play.

243
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:07,184
he's good.
you should hear him.

244
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,290
no. maybe some other time.

245
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,299
olivia.

246
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,178
you'll be pleased to hear
we figured it out.

247
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:14,356
the material, the gas that was
released on the bus,

248
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,421
turned solid
when it met

249
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,146
the nitrogen in the atmosphere.

250
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,878
instantly immobilizing

251
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:22,497
and suffocating
the passengers.

252
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,954
so who would
have the know-how

253
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:26,623
to manufacture
something like this?

254
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,288
i'll give you
six guesses.

255
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,722
and the first five
don't count.

256
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,789
massive dynamic.

257
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:34,139
three chemical companies
in the u.s.

258
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:35,965
supply those compounds.

259
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,889
all of them fully-owned
subsidiaries

260
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,994
of massive dynamic.

261
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:40,730
charlie? what's up?

262
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:42,048
we've got something.

263
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,864
i think you're gonna
wanna see it.

264
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:46,351
tip got called in

265
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:48,142
from a priest
over at st. anne's.

266
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,581
says the guy
that lives here

267
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,671
mentioned a potential incident
about the bus.

268
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:53,989
before it happened.

269
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,583
so what do we know
about him?

270
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,121
name's roy mccomb.

271
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,590
high school graduate.
no criminal record.

272
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,156
apparently he's been
pushin' papers

273
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:02,355
over at an escrow company

274
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,563
for the last
couple of months.

275
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,849
got bpd picking him up
from there right now.

276
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:09,092
that doesn't seem like
the profile of a mass-murderer.

277
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:11,343
no.

278
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:13,693
i didn'thk so either.

279
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,608
what?

280
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:27,716
you're looking
at depictions

281
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,150
of dozens of attacks,
accidents, disasters,

282
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:32,579
we've seen
over the past year.

283
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,205
and look.
all of them are dated

284
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:45,803
before the incidents
took place.

285
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,475
was that the flight
from hamburg?

286
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,612
so this guy
drew flight 627,

287
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,048
the angel suicides
in baltimore,

288
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,809
and the birmingham bridge
collapse.

289
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,864
clearly, the man
is disturbed.

290
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:14,997
but do you
really think

291
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,459
that he could be
involved in all this?

292
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,835
no. i don't.

293
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,831
but that doesn't make me
any less interested

294
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,546
to know where he got
his information.

295
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,653
several of those incidents
have never been made public.

296
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,028
and based on the evidence,

297
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,733
every one of them
was either drawn

298
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,452
or constructed before
the event depicted.

299
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:37,396
mr. mccomb.

300
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:40,384
i'm special agent
charlie francis of the fbi.

301
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:41,953
i wanna tell you
you're not officially

302
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,833
being charged
with anything right now.

303
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,519
i'd like to ask you
a few questions.

304
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:46,534
is that okay?

305
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,958
um, yeah. that's-
okay. sure.

306
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,002
call me roy.

307
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,237
okay roy.

308
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,666
start with this
drawing of yours.

309
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,743
14 different
chemical compounds

310
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:03,040
were used in the material
responsible for the incident

311
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:03,695
on the bus.

312
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,965
three of them
manufactured exclusively

313
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,969
by your subsidiaries.

314
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,822
you've done
your homework.

315
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:12,035
we supply them to a dozen labs
around the world.

316
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,442
it could've been stolen
from any one of them.

317
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:15,221
i'll need a list
of those labs, then.

318
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,869
of course.
anything you need.

319
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:24,478
so? is there
anything else?

320
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:27,819
when we first met,
you said

321
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,179
that science and technology
had advanced

322
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:33,460
to such a state that,
your words,

323
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,562
"they were running
out of control."

324
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,078
that sounds
about right.

325
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:40,446
well so far, all of
the science and technology

326
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:44,216
that i've come across
has been very tightly controlled

327
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,416
by massive dynamic.

328
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:49,288
every case i investigate
has a tie back to this company.

329
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:51,715
well, i think maybe
you have it backwards.

330
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,460
massive dynamic is...
well, so massive

331
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,739
that just about everything

332
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,307
in the world
of science and technology

333
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,505
has a tie back to us.

334
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,388
of course, i could say
something of the same

335
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:06,331
for you, couldn't i?

336
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,890
you've been
investigating these cases

337
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:09,985
for a very short while now.

338
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,106
at least three of them
have occurred

339
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,406
right in your own
backyard.

340
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,133
i might suspect

341
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:18,592
that you yourself
were somehow responsible.

342
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,563
i hope it will
help you find

343
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,599
whoever's behind
these attacks.

344
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:32,482
attacks?

345
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,733
apparently broyles
hasn't told you.

346
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,049
yes, the technology
was used once before

347
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,245
in prague, although there were
fewer casualties.

348
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:43,415
then, i suppose if you had
access to the case files,

349
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,289
you'd know that
we'd already shared

350
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:47,691
all the information we have
with the government.

351
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,062
thank you.

352
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,174
for the information.

353
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,114
what about this one?

354
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,433
this one gonna
happen too, roy?

355
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,919
look.

356
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:06,975
i know

357
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,852
that this
sounds crazy.

358
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,733
in fact,
i think i am crazy.

359
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,665
but i can be

360
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:19,954
anywhere,
at home or at work,

361
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:22,000
and, uh-

362
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:26,514
just all of a sudden,
i get this-

363
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,421
i don't know
how to describe it.

364
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:31,125
this feeling.

365
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:35,418
and the only way
that i can get it out

366
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:37,721
is get rid of it.
is to-

367
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,708
to try to draw
what i see.

368
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:44,504
or to try
to build it.

369
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:45,735
sometimes that works.

370
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,828
how long have you been
getting these feelings?

371
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,659
maybe nine months.

372
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:53,133
nine months.

373
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:59,005
roy's feelings-
or whatever they are.

374
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:01,717
began roughly when
we became aware of the pattern.

375
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:03,685
meaning what?

376
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,150
i'm not entirely sure yet.

377
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:07,819
but it's hard
to say he's lying.

378
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:08,533
he's not.

379
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:10,066
i like to consider
myself to be

380
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:11,426
a fairly good
poker player,

381
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,195
which requires me
to have the ability

382
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,467
to read
my opponent's tells,

383
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:15,994
know when he's bluffing.

384
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:18,071
he's not bluffing.

385
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,578
regardless of what
the actual explanation is,

386
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:22,662
he sincerely believes
that what he's saying

387
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:23,385
is the truth.

388
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,805
in that case,
what do you suggest?

389
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,630
how has he learned
of these incidents?

390
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:27,825
i don't know.
hey.

391
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,744
i just saw charlie.
he told me-

392
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:30,505
occam's razor.

393
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:32,964
all other things being equal,

394
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,461
the simplest solution
is the best.

395
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,715
and what is that?

396
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,870
the man's psychic.

397
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:41,189
theoretically,
it's all quite possible.

398
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:44,797
so you're saying
roy can read peoples' minds.

399
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,745
i posit that roy has no control
over his abilities.

400
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,386
that he is linked,
psychically, with someone,

401
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,140
or less likely
but still possible,

402
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:55,010
a small group
of people responsible

403
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:56,607
for these events.

404
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:57,440
equally possible,

405
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:59,811
someone who's merely
discussing them.

406
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,189
perhaps he's communicating
with you, agent broyles.

407
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,948
forgive me, dr. bishop.

408
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:10,146
i like to think
i have an open mind.

409
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:13,360
but i have a hard time
accepting that that man

410
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:15,148
is hearin'
another person's thoughts.

411
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:16,538
oh, yes.
so do i.

412
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,121
which is why i would like
to prove it.

413
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,825
and here we go.

414
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,219
and how would you do that?

415
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,945
am i required
to keep him alive?

416
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,414
that would probably be best.

417
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:37,060
can we, uh,
talk a moment?

418
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:40,091
go ahead.

419
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:41,776
nina sharp
just told me

420
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,758
that this isn't
the first time that material

421
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:44,937
from the bus
has been used.

422
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:47,746
i'd normally be skeptical
of anything coming from nina,

423
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,429
but in this case,
she's correct.

424
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:52,129
so what?

425
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,148
i don't even have clearance
to know background

426
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,486
on a case
i'm investigating?

427
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:57,545
agent dunham,

428
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,274
if i'm not always completely
transparent with you,

429
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:00,880
there's a reason.

430
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:04,033
this little task force that you
and i call our day job now-

431
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,246
it sometimes requires some-

432
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:08,240
shall we say,
bureaucratic maneuvering

433
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:10,223
to keep it alive and free
from political meddling,

434
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,053
which means sometimes
i don't tell you everything

435
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:14,292
for your own protection.

436
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,704
with all due respect,

437
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,411
that's not good enough.

438
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:20,536
now, i've been trained
for a lot:

439
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,557
hostage crises,
terror campaigns,

440
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,526
suicide bombers,
chemical attacks,

441
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:27,711
but you know the things
i've seen since i started

442
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:28,508
working for you.

443
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:30,501
if i'm gonna
do this job,

444
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,333
i need to know what it is
i'm dealing with.

445
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,845
and you will.
when you're ready.

446
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,199
until then, i suppose
you'll need to trust me.

447
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,143
so what're we looking for?

448
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:50,132
if my hypothesis
is correct,

449
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,027
if he is picking up
the thoughts

450
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,146
of another
human being,

451
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,470
it will leave
a distinct signature.

452
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,180
and you think
we'll be able to identify

453
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,490
whose thoughts
they are?

454
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,790
that's preposterous.

455
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,940
but they may be able
to intercept them.

456
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,230
<i>magnificent machine.</i>

457
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,820
do you mind if we view
the axial images?

458
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,700
his vitals are spiking.

459
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,890
what's happening?

460
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,840
no idea.

461
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,450
but i'm extremely interested
to find out.

462
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,350
something's wrong!

463
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,130
shut it down, now!

464
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,460
h- help!

465
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,670
velcro ripping]

466
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,590
get up.
you okay?

467
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,510
i- i think so.

468
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,990
<i>what did that?</i>

469
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,320
something in the blood.

470
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,680
a magnetic compound
of some kind.

471
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,200
dormant-
perhaps a parasite.

472
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
what's he saying?
i don't understand.

473
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,130
the machine is basically
a gigantic magnet,

474
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,200
and you've got metal
in your blood.

475
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,340
if we hadn't o' turned it off,

476
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,900
it woulda ripped
your body apart.

477
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,080
woulda been
quite a mess.

478
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,460
why would there be
metal in his blood?

479
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,800
that's not normal, right?

480
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,550
you wanna see
everything from 1989.

481
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,440
no.

482
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,540
perhaps '79.

483
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,530
fantastic.

484
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,650
<i>that's very helpful.</i>

485
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,010
oh, stop.

486
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,260
i was right.

487
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,690
belly and i worked
on this very problem.

488
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,490
belly?

489
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,250
yeah. as in william bell.

490
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,590
founder of massive dynamic,

491
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,030
and one of the richest
men on the planet.

492
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,620
he and walter used to
share a lab together.

493
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,290
<i>loved cloves.</i>

494
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,630
awful odor.

495
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,330
we posited

496
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,830
a spectrum of waves
lying outside of the range

497
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,660
of those already discovered.

498
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,230
we hypothesized
that these waves

499
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,710
could be used
to communicate information.

500
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,430
<i>the government,
of course,</i>

501
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,850
<i>was extremely interested.</i>

502
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,920
it was a brilliant idea.

503
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,230
a theory,
but a good one.

504
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,980
they wanted to use
the network

505
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,740
to send their most
clandestine information.

506
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,660
because if no other government
knew the spectrum existed,

507
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,370
<i>they wouldn't be listening in. yes.</i>

508
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,380
and they called it
the ghost network.

509
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,210
but they asked us

510
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,630
<i>to take it
one step further.</i>

511
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,960
<i>to develop a method</i>

512
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,940
<i>where they could
transmit directly</i>

513
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,720
<i>from one person
to another.</i>

514
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
<i>i surmised
that i could introduce</i>

515
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,990
an iridium-based,
organometallic compound

516
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,340
into the subject's brain.

517
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,970
you have got to be kidding me.

518
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,080
what?

519
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,080
roy mccomb was one
of your test subjects.

520
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,260
of course. yes!

521
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,180
that explains it, doesn't it?

522
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,660
explains it?

523
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,810
yes, that explains why
he almost died today.

524
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,970
because you injected something

525
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,850
<i>into his brain
nearly 20 years ago.</i>

526
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,980
no, what i gave him
was not nearly enough

527
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,090
to cause that reaction.

528
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,590
the compound must have
multiplied in his bloodstream

529
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,570
over time.

530
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,190
environment,
perhaps diet.

531
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,860
he was a sophomore volunteering
for psych experiments.

532
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,380
did you ever even bother

533
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,980
<i>to explain to him
what you were doing?</i>

534
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,950
well it
wouldn't have been

535
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,840
a very secret experiment
if i had.

536
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,330
what's going on?

537
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,540
<i>how's roy mccomb?</i>

538
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,170
roy mccomb will be fine.

539
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,600
no thanks
to my father's attempts

540
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,960
to turn him into
a human walkie-talkie.

541
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,720
wait a second.

542
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,510
don't you try
and change the subject!

543
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,110
what you just said

544
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,440
<i>is on subject.</i>

545
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,960
the iridium-based compound
that multiplied

546
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,060
in his bloodstream has turned
him into some kind of receiver.

547
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,610
a receiver of what?

548
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,980
transmissions.

549
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,160
someone else, it seems,

550
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,700
and i'm somewhat
jealous of this,

551
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,950
has perfected
our ghost network.

552
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,960
and is using it
to communicate.

553
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,150
our dear roy is merely
overhearing what they say.

554
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,480
<i>you will note that
the rotary movement</i>

555
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,630
gives the impression
of a three-dimensional tunnel,

556
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,040
when in fact it is not.

557
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,620
next slide, please.

558
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,890
<i>ah, it's an oldie
but a goodie.</i>

559
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,790
<i>as you observe this image,</i>

560
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,870
<i>your brain perceives
first a duck,</i>

561
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,740
<i>then a rabbit,
then a duck again.</i>

562
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,880
it always comes back
to the duck.

563
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,180
in truth,
the image is neither.

564
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,950
<i>but it illustrates
the brain's need</i>

565
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,380
<i>to take random sensory input
and construct it</i>

566
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,890
<i>into a meaningful whole-
great.</i>

567
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,670
<i>despite-
thank you.</i>

568
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,530
we get it.

569
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,680
uh, i'm sorry.
i don't think i do get it.

570
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,040
well neither do i.
i just want him to stop.

571
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,300
i'll get the lights.

572
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,760
i suspect someone

573
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,770
<i>has continued
my research.</i>

574
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,760
<i>but they've taken
the easy way out.</i>

575
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
merely using the ghost network

576
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,590
as a secure
telecommunications channel.

577
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,230
you're suggesting
that roy's listening in

578
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,560
to someone's telephone network.

579
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,910
yes. but no, not listening.

580
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,530
roy's brain is trying

581
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,320
to interpret
the sensory input.

582
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,220
much as our brains

583
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,620
grapple with
the duck rabbit,

584
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,310
i told you.

585
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,460
it always comes back
to the duck.

586
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,670
so if roy's receiving
this frequency,

587
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,050
is there any way that
we can tap in and hear them?

588
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,080
or maybe even i.d. them?

589
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,480
construct a receiver
using that spectrum,

590
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,780
it's possible, of course.

591
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,930
<i>but it would
take months.</i>

592
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,810
<i>but it may be possible</i>

593
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,980
to redirect the transmissions
from his visual centers

594
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,130
<i>to his auditory cortex.</i>

595
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
wait, you want
to rewire his brain?

596
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,490
not without his permission.

597
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,760
it would be a minor surgery.

598
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,500
<i>minor brain surgery.</i>

599
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,300
emphasis not on the minor.

600
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
<i>i would need a specific
piece of equipment.</i>

601
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,350
magnetic neurostimulator
i built in 1983.

602
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,360
with a few adjustments,
it would work.

603
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,980
all right.

604
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,100
we'll just go back in time
and get it for you.

605
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,880
<i>no need to.</i>

606
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,810
it's most likely
where i left it 17 years ago.

607
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,780
hidden in a wall
in our old house in cambridge.

608
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,660
blast from the past.

609
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,260
what's the game plan here?

610
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,960
<i>we just gonna knock
on the door,</i>

611
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,360
<i>ask 'em if we can
tear out their walls?</i>

612
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,510
pretty much.

613
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,440
i guess the badge

614
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,040
is the "pretty please"
in that equation.

615
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,780
there's no lights on.

616
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,050
i'm gonna call in.

617
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,860
see if we can track down
the owner for consent.

618
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,520
what're you doing?

619
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,110
what?

620
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,210
this is barely even a crime.
i used to live here.

621
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,270
normal pupil response.

622
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,650
taking any medications,
prescribed or illicit?

623
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,750
you can be truthful.
i won't judge.

624
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,450
in fact, if the answer is no,
i may encourage some drug use.

625
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,460
no, none.

626
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,440
any food allergies?

627
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,270
not that i'm aware of.

628
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,650
good, good, good.

629
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,000
this all checks out.

630
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,850
strap him down.
we'll get started.

631
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,260
oh, god.
strap me down?

632
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,160
there's nothin'
to be worried about.

633
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,230
i guess, uh-

634
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,110
it must seem
pretty silly.

635
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,060
thinking god is talking
to me and everything.

636
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,140
what were you
supposed to think?

637
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,520
that i was just crazy.

638
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,870
i considered that, too.

639
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,070
it's gotta be
sort of a relief, right?

640
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,500
knowing there's
a rational explanation?

641
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,600
i wouldn't exactly
call any of this rational.

642
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,290
do you really think

643
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,980
that this is going
to help you catch the guys

644
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,390
that killed those people
on the bus?

645
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,340
you're our best lead.

646
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,510
no pressure, huh?

647
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,910
we lived here
when i was a kid,

648
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,880
but after walt
was institutionalized,

649
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,310
my mom couldn't afford
the mortgage.

650
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,090
so we moved down
to an apartment in austin.

651
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,650
so where's your mother now?

652
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,130
that's a story
for another time.

653
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,760
so tell me.

654
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,560
of all the possible
career choices,

655
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,180
how did a girl like you
end up in law enforcement?

656
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,850
well, i pretty much knew
this was what i wanted to do

657
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,540
by the time i was nine.

658
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,720
when i was nine years old,

659
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
i think i wanted to be
a brontosaurus.

660
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,350
they say the psych profiles
of cops and criminals

661
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,880
are pretty much identical.

662
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,940
ever consider
a life of crime?

663
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,440
no dental.

664
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,480
nothing.

665
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,200
<i>of course.</i>

666
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,340
huh.

667
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,010
what?

668
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,490
my mom had this
covered up.

669
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,940
used to hide in it
all the time.

670
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,470
you'll need to be awake
for the procedure.

671
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,620
but i'm going to give you
a mild sedative

672
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,430
to reduce any anxiety.

673
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,780
dr. bishop,

674
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,360
you look
really familiar to me.

675
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,260
hmm.

676
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,340
i hear that a lot.

677
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,360
in the mental institution
where i lived.

678
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,220
he'll need a moment.

679
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,560
<i>oh. you've returned.</i>

680
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,930
how was the old house?
how is rufus?

681
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,360
well, the house
is just like we left,

682
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,930
but we put rufus to sleep
almost 20 years ago, walter.

683
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,800
oh. that's terrible news.

684
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,630
we found your equipment.

685
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,730
oh, this brings back
some memories.

686
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,330
of what?

687
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,230
i think it's time for some
intracranial penetration.

688
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,950
this won't hurt.

689
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,530
just feel

690
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,330
a touch odd.

691
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,130
okay.

692
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,400
is this poli sci 101?

693
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,450
not remotely.

694
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,550
who was it?

695
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,880
freshmen.

696
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,870
i need you
to keep this dial

697
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,040
eady at 60 hertz-
10 gauss

698
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
until i tell you otherwise.

699
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,290
i believe there are
clusters of metal

700
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,200
in the visual centers
of your brain.

701
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,270
i'm going to attempt
to move them

702
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,540
to those regions
which process sound.

703
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,800
you'll be shown
a series of images.

704
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,960
<i>i need you
to tell me</i>

705
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,460
any sensations you experience
as you see each image.

706
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,980
sounds easy enough.

707
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,910
<i>first image, please.</i>

708
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,500
<i>it's a horse.</i>

709
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,360
wonderful.

710
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,930
50 gauss.

711
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,190
what the hell was that?

712
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,860
oh, that was your body's
normal muscle response.

713
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,130
it's perfectly natural.

714
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,540
you may also experience
an involuntary bowel movement.

715
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,860
great.

716
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,650
<i>next image, son.</i>

717
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,630
oh, man.

718
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,830
mmm, oh, this is bad.

719
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,520
<i>oh, this is weird.</i>

720
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,290
uh, i-
i'm- mmm-

721
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,120
i'm tasting, uh, dirt.

722
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,600
<i>uh, no wait,
it's uh, gasoline.</i>

723
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,660
we've reached
the gustatory cortex.

724
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,030
we're getting close.

725
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,730
<i>next image, please.</i>

726
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,630
<i>i don't know.</i>

727
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,140
it's a beach.

728
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,110
well, no sensations at all?

729
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,300
i don't think so.

730
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,150
dammit,
don't you feel anything?

731
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,680
uh, i'm a little scared.

732
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,810
i don't understand.
this should be working.

733
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,100
walter, take a deep breath.
it's gonna be okay.

734
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,380
<i>nuntia adhuc...

736
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,800
don't do that!
stop, i said!

737
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,790
quando fiet.

738
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,590
what did you say?

739
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,430
i don't know.
i can hear voices.

740
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>una hora</i>

<i>i think that's latin.</i>

743
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,070
it is.
he just said, um-

744
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,550
damn, what's that word?

745
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,720
hora, um-
hour.

746
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,730
something's happening
in an hour.

747
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,570
<i>how in the world</i>

748
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,940
can you possibly know that?

749
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,090
i majored in linguistics.

750
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,000
my latin's admittedly
a bit fuzzy.

751
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,090
okay, keep going.

752
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,380
<i>ad stationem</i>

753
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,160
ad stationem,
that means station.

754

758
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,980
an exchange is being made. um-

759
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,080
an exchange at south station.

760
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,830
i think someone's meeting
at south station

761
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,900
to make an exchange in an hour.

762
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,480

763
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,060
he just said,
"good, where was it."

764
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,440
ab initio

765
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,740
<i>in eius corpore fuit.

766
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,810

it was on her person.

767
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,000
um.

768
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,180
<i>it was on her from the start?
maybe or-</i>

769
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,720
she had it on her
the whole time.

770
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,360
oh, yeah,
that's a possible translation.

771
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,180
hey!
where ya goin'?

772
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,430
<i>there was a three-inch incision</i>

773
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,930
in evelina's right palm.

774
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,830
whatever she had on her,
davidson cut it out.

775
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,580
<i>she was hiding it in her hand.</i>

776
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,260
i'm heading
to south station now.

777
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,890
i think he's planning
a hand-off at 5:00.

778
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,040
we have to assume davidson's
workin' for the same people

779
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,790
who hit the bus.

780
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,990
i'll notify ci.

781
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,230
but in the meantime, i'm sending
the field assist your way.

782
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,040
but plainclothes only.
we don't want to tip him off.

783
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,910
<i>oh, my god.</i>

784
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,390
what's wrong?

785
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,330
i believe
with proper demodulation,

786
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,660
you could receive satellite
television for free.

787
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,460
okay. fun time's over.
astrid, let's get him unhooked.

788
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,700
it's me, i'm at the station.

789
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,500
where am i meeting your man?

790
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,370
excuse me?

791
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,930
i'm getting something.

792
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,510
<i>it's in english.</i>

793
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,030
we can see you.

794
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,730
<i>outside south station.</i>

795
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
<i>we're verifying you haven't
been followed.</i>

796
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,260
then we'll instruct you further.

797
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,740
<i>that's it.</i>

798
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,690
it's olivia.

799
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,790
hey, roy's talking again.

800
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,530
are you at south station?

801
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,550
yeah. why?

802
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,650
so are they.

803
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,940
<i>did you get anything else?</i>

804
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,980
they're checking to make sure
that davidson wasn't followed.

805
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,070
i think that's it for now.

806
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,700
okay. thanks.

807
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,070
could i get
a drink or something?

808
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,120
yeah.
i'll get you a glass of water.

809
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,430
go ahead.

810
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,960
<i>we're clear on our end.
go inside.</i>

811
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,960
here you go.

812
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,830
and head
to the dewey square exit.

813
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,990
you got that?

814
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,200
how will i recognize
the person i'm meeting?

815
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,260
they'll recognize you.

816
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,210
yeah.

817
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,290
it's happening now.

818
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,660
he's headed
to the dewey square exit.

819
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,100
got it.

820
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,610
francis.

821
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,470
<i>we got him.</i>

822
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,450
he's at the south end
of the terminal.

823
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,630
turn around

824
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,760
and put your hands
in the air now.

825
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,210
what happened?

826
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,230
he's been shot.

827
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,060
he's not breathing.
call in a medevac!

828
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,030
the case.

829
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,060
they've made the exchange.

830
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,140
he's running.

831
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,240
stay with him.

832
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,360
fbi!

833
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,680
put the case on the ground.

834
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,590
<i>drop the gun now!</i>

835
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,730
put your hands
where i can see them.

836
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,370
<i>all that trouble for this.</i>

837
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,980
so any idea
what it is?

838
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,860
not yet.

839
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,930
but i'm hoping
our friends at the nsa

840
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,540
will be able to tell us.

841
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,000
so 11 innocent people
die today,

842
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
we risk losing another
by drilling through his head,

843
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,530
all for something
we know nothing about?

844
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,030
do you ever smile, dunham?

845
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,030
we id'd the shooter.

846
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,380
matthew ziegler.

847
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,860
when we ran his fingerprints,
he popped up

848
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,930
on two other
pattern-related cases.

849
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,360
we're digging into his
financials, travel records.

850
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,920
linkage, dunham.

851
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,130
not only can we now
put a face to these people,

852
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,900
but we know
they're communicating.

853
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,260
and how.

854
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,090
i'd say that's
an impressive day's work.

855
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,560
which brings me to this.

856
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,520
<i>what is it?</i>

857
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,270
of all the models
in roy's apartment,

858
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,330
three of them are incidents
that we haven't been aware of.

859
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,460
pattern cases.

860
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,190
<i>it would seem so.</i>

861
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,480
<i>take a look.
if you want.</i>

862
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,200
let me know
if you have any thoughts.

863
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,830
i'll do that.

864
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,950
i'll see you tomorrow.

865
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,390
how are you feeling?

866
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,590
my head hurts a little,
but, um,

867
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,160
dr. bishop gave me
something for the pain.

868
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,390
vicodin.

869
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,200
that's it.
i promise.

870
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,960
so no more transmissions.

871
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,070
no.

872
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,060
my guess is once you arrived
at south station

873
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,140
with the cavalry, they realized
the ghost network

874
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,650
was compromised,
and stopped broadcasting on it.

875
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,820
well just in case,

876
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,310
if you hear anything else,

877
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,850
do me a favor,
gimme a call.

878
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,820
i will.

879
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,640
it felt really nice
to be able to help.

880
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,060
thank you.

881
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,290
you're welcome.

882
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,880
i have a few release forms
i need you to sign,

883
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,200
and then i can take you home. okay.

884
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,310
<i>dunham.</i>

885
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,930
any requests?

886
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,090
how 'bout some bach?

887
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,660
bach?

888
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,760
no, that's
way too stuffy.

889
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,910
<i>what you need
is some jazz.</i>

890
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,030
well i'll take
what i can get.

891
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,310
i'm sure you can understand why

892
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,540
i don't wanna go
through channels.

893
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,970
if i know you at all, this isn't
the only reason you're here.

894
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,500
is this because of our interest
in agent dunham?

895
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,330
seems a bit early
to be poaching

896
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,590
my newest hire,

897
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,130
with only a three-case resume
under her belt.

898
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,630
i didn't achieve my position
without the ability

899
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,000
to evaluate
someone's talents immediately.

900
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,790
neither did i.

901
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,490
oh, you feel protective of her,
don't you?

902
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,830
i'm in the business
of protecting all my agents.

903
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,860
i want nothing
but the best for her.

904
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,160
of course you do.

905
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,480
we found another one.

906
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,000
let's see what we have.

907
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,160
well, crystalline structure's
intact.

908
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,460
no detectable oscillations.

909
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,030
this may just be what we need
to break the encryption.

910
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,230
speaking of which,
i'm told you've made progress.

911
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,550
see for yourself.

912
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,630
we finally
stabilized the link.

913
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,430
we've been pulling
information from the disk

914
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,190
for the last 72 hours.

915
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,067
let me know
when it's finished.

916
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
