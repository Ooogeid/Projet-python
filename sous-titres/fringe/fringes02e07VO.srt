2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,513
A series of events has occurred.
It's been referred to as "the pattern."

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:08,341
Anybody you need, you can have.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,733
His name's Walter Bishop.
He worked out of Harvard,

5
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,887
in an area called fringe science.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,965
Certain private individuals
have been granted clearance

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,891
regarding the pattern,
including Nina Sharp.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,812
Massive dynamic is one of the ten
largest economic entities in the world.

9
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:24,624
No matter where
my investigations take me,

10
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,020
they always come back here.

11
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:30,071
You should know what you're
getting into, agent Dunham.

12
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:31,895


13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,697
Get out of the car!
Hands on your head!

14
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,446
This is officer Williams.
Hostage appears unharmed.

15
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,282
I said get out of the car, now!

16
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,558
Step away from the car.
Then on your knees.

17
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,215
You okay?

18
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,871
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

19
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,229
Is that right?

20
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,238
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,325
Gibson, I'm talking to you.

27
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:03,666
We're running the security photos
through facial recognition software.

28
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,018
We should have the kidnappers' names
within the hour.

29
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,759
Preliminary ballistics confirms that
officer Williams fired all three shots.

30
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:12,431
- Including the one that killed her?
- Self-inflicted.

31
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,194
As far as we can tell,
the kidnappers don't even have guns.

32
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:18,717
- Who's the kid?
- Tyler Carson. 15 years old.

33
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:21,898
According to NYPD,
he disappeared 36 hours ago.

34
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,432
They're still running leads.

35
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,831
Remember that conversation we had
about personal space?

36
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:28,585
I'm bored.

37
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,384
No cadavers at this crime scene.

38
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:32,785
Or food.

39
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,881
Walter, they're transferring
the bodies to your lab now.

40
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,205
There's no need...

41
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,873
I've already formed an hypothesis
as to what happened here.

42
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,542
Mesmerism. Hypnotism.

43
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,725
The victims have obviously been
subjected to subliminal suggestions

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,309
of a violent nature.

45
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,563
Hypnosis can't make you do anything
that you don't want to do.

46
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,107
Take a look at this.

47
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,485
The kidnapped kid's father...
he works for Fleming-Monroe.

48
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,233
The aerospace division
of Massive Dynamic.

49
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,156
I already have a call in
to Nina Sharp.

50
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,397
Ms. Sharp's office
is right this way.

51
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,697
Dr. Carson is in there
waiting with her now.

52
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,272
Miss?

53
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,794
The screen in the elevator said
there are 73 laboratories.

54
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,155
Is that right?

55
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,603
It's amazing.

56
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:51,958
Dr. Carson,

57
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,086
why didn't you call
the police sooner?

58
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,527
I didn't even know he was gone
until I got the call from them...

59
00:04:57,802 --> 00:04:59,188
The men who took him.

60
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,177
Tyler and I don't talk much.

61
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,122
I just figured
it's because of his age.

62
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:08,224
You know what teens are like.

63
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,770
I guess that's just
an excuse, isn't it?

64
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,485
So what did the kidnappers say?

65
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,909
Just to wait
for further instruction.

66
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,592
Ms. Sharp, the two men identified
in those photographs,

67
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:28,107
are you absolutely certain they have
no connection to your company?

68
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:31,186
We cross-referenced their names
with our employee database.

69
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,058
Patrick Hickey and Tom Dobbins
have never worked for us,

70
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,891
And they've had
no peripheral involvement

71
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,545
with any of our clients or partners.

72
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,339
According to the police,
they're used car salesmen.

73
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,341
There's been no indication
of their demands?

74
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,517
No, not yet.

75
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,714
So is it possible
that these men are trying

76
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,558
to extort secrets
from Massive Dynamic?

77
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,821
We have come to the same conclusion.

78
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,728
Well, would you care to share
what kind of secrets?

79
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:59,657
Dr. Carson performs

80
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:02,461
sensitive and highly-classified work

81
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,906
on military aircraft designs,
piloting software,

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,301
guidance systems.

83
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,454
What I do here,

84
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,400
it's my life.

85
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,561
It's the only...

86
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:19,155
Tyler's mother died
when he was just a boy.

87
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,389
And now if...

88
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:25,259
if I lose him,
I don't know what I'd do.

89
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,829
I'll get him.

90
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,752
Excuse me.

91
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:39,520
Dr. Carson, we will do everything
we can to try and find your son.

92
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:43,689
What are you doing?

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Massive Dynamic...

94
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,011
It was just a name until now.

95
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:57,250
Did you know that I once shared
a laboratory with William Bell?

96
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,372
You might have mentioned that
once or twice.

97
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,700
Look how much he's achieved.

98
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,757
You know, he introduced me to her.

99
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:15,726
To whom?

100
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,299
Your mother.

101
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:22,306
After the neurobiology
conference in berlin.

102
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,687
It was our idea, you know,

103
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,071
that belly and I would one day
form a company together.

104
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:39,091
He just couldn't wait, I suppose.

105
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:44,664
But thankfully
she was still there for you

106
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,241
while I was gone.

107
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm hungry.

108
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,818
Give me all the cash
in the register.

109
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,955
You kidding me?
You don't even have a gun.

110
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,662
Just do it,
before somebody gets hurt.

111
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,364
Hey, buddy is there gonna be
a problem here?

112
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,752
You really don't want
to get involved in this.

113
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:24,711
I think I just did.

114
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,008
Get out of my store.

115
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,972
You should have just
given up the money.

116
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,922
Remind me to never get a job
as a convenience store clerk.

117
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,307
Any witnesses?

118
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:54,193
Both victims are in intensive care
at university hospital.

119
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,512
So no statements anytime soon.

120
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:00,035
Stealing food and knocking over
convenience stores?

121
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,311
These kidnappers don't really seem
like they have much of a plan.

122
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,563
No. There's a second feed
on the door.

123
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,235
- He looks so scared.
- So why doesn't he run?

124
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,717
He could just make a break for it.

125
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:16,235
Far too soon for stockholm syndrome
to have kicked in.

126
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,022
Well, maybe your father's right.

127
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,895
Maybe one or both of them
are controlling people

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,596
through hypnotic suggestion.

129
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:25,625
Then they could just get the clerk to
give 'em the cash. Why all the carnage?

130
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:27,700
Maybe they're silencing
the witnesses.

131
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,654
They don't want us to know
how it works.

132
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,684
Just talked to the owner of the car
dealership where the kidnappers worked.

133
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,835
<i>Said hickey and dobbins
were his best salesmen.</i>

134
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,716
So is there anything out of the ordinary
about these two guys?

135
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,936
<i>Model employees.</i>

136
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:48,064
The owner was completely mystified
as to how they got mixed up in this.

137
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,174
Says they each made a sale
that morning,

138
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,777
took one of his loaner cars out
for lunch, and never came back.

139
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,233
Broyles says the suspects
were good at their jobs.

140
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,589
No criminal record.
Boss loves 'em.

141
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,854
So how do these two
become kidnappers?

142
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,374
You think they could be spies?

143
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,417
Maybe they're hiding out
in plain sight.

144
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,225
Foreign intelligence agents
often take mundane jobs

145
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,768
so they can blend in while
they're gathering information.

146
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,847
There's certainly nothing more mundane
than being a used car salesman.

147
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,389
So throw in massive dynamic
and your father's theory

148
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,410
on hypnotism
and it all starts to add up.

149
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:26,773
Chicken.

150
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,595
You serious?

151
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,186
Just a hypothesis.

152
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,535
What do you think, more like pork?

153
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,207
Truthfully, I don't really
spend a lot of time

154
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,323
thinking about what
human brains would taste like.

155
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,788
Then why did you ask?

156
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,956
I was asking what you expected
to find with this brain.

157
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:48,976
And normally

158
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,880
hypnosis would simply...

159
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,030
boost the alpha wave

160
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,448
of the brain with no visible effect.

161
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,889
But given the extreme nature
of the suggestions

162
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,058
in this policewoman's case,

163
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,325
I suspect there might be
lesions on the brain.

164
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,847
And visible damage.

165
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,416
Thank you.

166
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:27,219
Now,...

167
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,833
this is not hypnosis.
It is mind control.

168
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,752
- There's a difference?
- Peter was right.

169
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,930
Hypnosis can only go so far...

170
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,236
suggesting,
but not forcing behavior.

171
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,593
Look, look, look.

172
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,193
Hematomas on the brain matter.

173
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:44,138
Indicating actual trauma.

174
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:47,606
The result of conflicting
neural impulses.

175
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,978
A conflict of mind and body.

176
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,438
Is that what killed them?

177
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:56,067
The bullet took care of that.
No,...

178
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:00,392
but mind control
could cause brain damage.

179
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:05,550
I theorize that the power operates
through the cochlear nerve.

180
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,078
- You mean sound.
- Yes.

181
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,706
An auditory trance
is a far more effective

182
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,125
path manipulation
than the other senses.

183
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,026
But again, it's just a hypothesis.

184
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,867
Even if we find out where they are,

185
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,342
nobody can get near them
as long as they have this talent.

186
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,394
Then I need you
to work out how to block it.

187
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,114
The ransom call could come
at any minute, and we need to be ready.

188
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,442
Right. Right. Right.

189
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:30,237
I don't understand.
Why are we just standing around?

190
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,880
- Shouldn't we do something?
- Dr. Carson...

191
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:36,231
I have my very best agents
on the case.

192
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,577
But you need to be here
when the kidnappers call.

193
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,571
Special agent Broyles?

194
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,286
We've just received a call
for Dr. Carson.

195
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,545
It's his son.

196
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:51,004
We're ready, sir.

197
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:59,213
- Hello?
<i>- Dad...</i>

198
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,095
<i>- It's me.</i>
- Tyler, are you okay?

199
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,001
<i>Just give them what they want.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

200
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,958
<i>You've seen that
we won't hesitate to do</i>

201
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>whatever's necessary in order
to get what we want.</i>

202
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,641
Please, listen, I'll do anything
you need... anything!

203
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,071
<i>$2 million, unmarked bills.</i>

204
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:16,272
<i>The industrial park off I-78,
Western Newark Airport.</i>

205
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,472
<i>5:00 P.M.</i>

206
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,629
<i>If you're even a minute late,
your son dies.</i>

207
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,195
No, please, listen...

208
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:26,741
No luck sir.

209
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,168
He hang up too soon.

210
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,810
Money?

211
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:35,926
All they want is money?

212
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,014
I can sell the house.
Cash in my stock options...

213
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,159
Massive dynamic will cover
any ransom.

214
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,521
They're trying to squeeze
a major international corporation

215
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,789
with a kidnapping.

216
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,510
It doesn't add up.

217
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:48,834
Money's the distraction.

218
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,266
They want something else.

219
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,434
<i>They took your son for a reason.</i>

220
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:55,978
So what now?

221
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,940
We set a trap.

222
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,392
Peter, we're running out of time.

223
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,357
You don't have any idea
what your father's looking for?

224
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:13,621
No. He just muttered something
about my childhood.

225
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,003
Here it is.

226
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:26,148
It generates white noise,

227
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,369
Which simulates the sound
of being in utero.

228
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,966
Just what we need
to block the mind control.

229
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:38,437
<i>A teddy bear versus
mind control spies?</i>

230
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,314
Bad guys don't stand a chance.

231
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:44,584
Dr. Carson will meet the kidnapper
with the briefcase.

232
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,947
So take no action
until the exchange is complete.

233
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,284
We want clean shots only.
We want them alive, if possible.

234
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,286
But the boy's safety comes first.

235
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,870
This is exciting.

236
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,221
You think the fbi will
ever give me a gun?

237
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,946
Dr. Bishop will now explain
how to use the equipment

238
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,420
that you've been provided.

239
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:05,241
Hello.
I am...

240
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,079
Dr. Walter Bishop.

241
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,858
You've been given

242
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,619
a set of audio-adapting
earphones like this,

243
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:15,007
which will give off
a steady stream of white noise.

244
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,361
The headphones will make it
so the kidnappers can't

245
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:20,648
control you with sound. Now,
put 'em on. We gotta do a sound check.

246
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,654
My son Peter's teddy bear
emits a sound...

247
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:37,006
As you listen, you may feel
a sense of deep tranquility,

248
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,582
as if you returned
to your mother's womb.

249
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,309
- You're gonna need this.
- Thank you, Peter.

250
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,756
You will now be able
to hear my voice.

251
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,127
<i>Each of your team leaders
will have a microphone</i>

252
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:50,288
<i>like this one.</i>

253
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:54,129
<i>You will not be able to communicate
with each other directly.</i>

254
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,507
<i>All commands will come
through the headphones.</i>

255
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,144
<i>Once you're given the order
to put on the headphones,</i>

256
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,633
<i>do not remove them
under any circumstances.</i>

257
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:06,067
<i>If you do, you may die
a gruesome and horrible death.</i>

258
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,903
Thank you for your attention.
And have a nice day.

259
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,378
<i>Alpha team in position.</i>

260
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,541
<i>Bravo team in position.</i>

261
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:36,097
<i>Agent Dunham, we have a brown sedan
entering in on the north side.</i>

262
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,004
Do you see Tyler in the vehicle?

263
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,006
<i>That's a negative.</i>

264
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:43,296
All teams stand by
and hold position.

265
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,027
Bravo team, what's your status?

266
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,981
<i>We have somebody moving in on foot.</i>

267
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,574
<i>Copy that. Possible suspect
en route to Dr. Carson.</i>

268
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,698
All units, headphones on.

269
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:00,538
Team leaders, move communication
to microphones.

270
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,051
<i>Contact made.</i>

271
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,053
<i>Can anyone see the hostage?</i>

272
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,098
<i>This is alpha leader.
Negative.</i>

273
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,522
<i>I've got nothing.</i>

274
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,302
<i>Bravo.
Negative on my end too.</i>

275
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,606
<i>All units, move! Move!</i>

276
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,546
Help me!

277
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,765
Help me.

278
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,695
You can lose the stupid headphones.

279
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,283
They don't work.

280
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:05,410
Take me to your car.

281
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,527
Agent Balik?
This is Agent Dunham.

282
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:16,788
<i>Copy. Go for Balik.</i>

283
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:18,786
Any sign of Tyler Carson?

284
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,971
<i>Negative.
We did two full sweeps.</i>

285
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,852
<i>- This place is abandoned.</i>
- Olivia.

286
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:27,602
- Where is he?
- Tyler? We're still looking for him.

287
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,812
No, no, no, I don't mean Tyler.
I mean Peter.

288
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,186
- I thought he was with you.
- He's gone.

289
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,032
I can't find him anywhere.

290
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:40,334
Has anyone seen Peter Bishop?

291
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,574
<i>I told you,</i>

292
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,597
we were the hostages in that car.

293
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:47,555
Tyler Carson wanted you
to kidnap him?

294
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm saying he made us do it.

295
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:52,069
He worked us like puppets.
He forced us to drive.

296
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,337
He made us watch
all those people die!

297
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,730
- What about the ransom call?
- I told you,

298
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,078
- he made us say what he wanted!
- How did he do that, exactly?

299
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:04,096
I don't know how he does it. You think
I wanted to saw off my own finger?

300
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,432
He made me do it
when I tried to get away.

301
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,691
And that friend of yours
you keep talking about.

302
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:10,742
You better pray
he's not with that kid.

303
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,904
Head hurts pretty bad, huh?

304
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,573
That's what happens
when you try to fight it.

305
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:24,784
I can make it stop
if you do what I say.

306
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,864
Keep driving straight.

307
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,795
You know, your father's
worried about you.

308
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:37,968
Awesome.

309
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:42,639
- Come on, kid, let's pull over...
- Bad idea!

310
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,977
What are you doing?

311
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,897
Let's see how fast
this piece of junk can go.

312
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:58,109
Kid, you're gonna get us killed!

313
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,947
Are you ready to behave?

314
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,298
Just so we're clear...

315
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,050
I can make you do whatever I want.

316
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:26,201
I can control all of you,
or just part of you.

317
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,058
You know what, kid...

318
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:32,711
You're a real son of a bitch.

319
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,868
It's Tyler.
Tyler is the kidnapper.

320
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:38,519
This was taken
from a traffic cam on I-95.

321
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:41,694
He's the one controlling people,
and he's taken Peter hostage.

322
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,279
How could this have happened?

323
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:47,136
The son of one of your top scientists
can control people's minds?

324
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,201
Surely that's not a coincidence.

325
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,269
That doesn't seem possible.
But...

326
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,420
Dr. Carson works in aerospace.
But on one of his projects,

327
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:58,961
he's been collaborating
with the pharmaceutical division.

328
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,279
What project?

329
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,974
This is our flight simulation deck.

330
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,073
What you're watching is a live test

331
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,511
of our prototype
hands-free guidance system.

332
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,305
Hands-free navigation.

333
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,354
So who's controlling the jet?

334
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,896
Electrodes in the pilot's helmet
are picking up on his thought patterns,

335
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,895
which send commands
to an onboard computer.

336
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,509
The pilot has been given
a pharmaceutical enhancement...

337
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:27,032
A drug to amplify his brainwaves.

338
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:30,207
Which makes it easier for the electrodes
in the helmet to read them.

339
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:32,161
Dr. Carson, did you, perchance,

340
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,211
expose your son to this so-called

341
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:36,131
pharmaceutical enhancement?

342
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,841
Massive Dynamic has strict
testing protocols.

343
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:41,587
Family members are absolutely
ruled out as test subjects.

344
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,089
Oh, my God.

345
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,500
I took some samples home
for further research.

346
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,302
Tyler might have found them.

347
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:52,640
I got a question.

348
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,730
How far away can you control people?

349
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:57,255
You mean, how far
do you have to run?

350
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:58,782
Nice try.

351
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,494
- When did you figure out you were...
- I'm not telling you anything.

352
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:10,992
Genius, the second you took me,
they knew that you were behind it all.

353
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,619
Whatever. You had no idea
that I was the one in charge.

354
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:17,081
You managed to kidnap yourself...
congratulations.

355
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,948
You're a criminal mastermind.

356
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:20,144
Screw you.

357
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,729
You really haven't thought this out?
You don't even have a plan.

358
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,717
Shut up.
You sound just like my father.

359
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,929
Come on. That's what this is about?
Some sort of vendetta against your dad?

360
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,974
Do you really think that
you're the first kid whose father

361
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,631
didn't think he was
good enough or smart enough?

362
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,956
Take a number.

363
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:44,649
But it doesn't make sense because
even if Tyler did take the drugs,

364
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,962
they're designed to work
on computer systems,

365
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,614
- not on other human beings.
- The brain is a computer.

366
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:53,284
It's an organic computer.
It can be hijacked like any other.

367
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,460
So how old is this boy?

368
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:59,624
Fifteen? Still going
through puberty? Yes?

369
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:02,293
His system

370
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,338
flooded with hormones
affecting his neural transmitters.

371
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,174
Opening up the pathways
for the uptake of

372
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,134
psychoactive chemicals, yes?

373
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,819
- I suppose it's possible.
- Yes. It's possible, all right.

374
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,262
And was he, by chance,

375
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:17,642
taking any prescription medication?

376
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,610
Psychostimulants, perhaps?

377
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,483
Tyler was taking medication
for attention deficit disorder.

378
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:27,791
Puberty,

379
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,291
A.D.D. medication,

380
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:32,874
and an untested brainwave enhancer.

381
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,576
It's a mind control cocktail.

382
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:39,330
Because of this man's inability
to be a proper parent,

383
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:41,875
his son has kidnapped mine!

384
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,796
You know, I used to hate
my father too.

385
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,372
- I know what it's like.
- I need a driver, all right?

386
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:50,943
Not a big brother.

387
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,283
Don't stop.

388
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,351
This has been a ton of fun, but let's
get real here. It cannot go on forever.

389
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,220
I say it's not
even close to finished.

390
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,042
Pull over.

391
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,621
Let me take care of this.

392
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,044
If you don't,

393
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,416
I will.

394
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:34,885
Evening, Officer.

395
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,053
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

396
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:39,178
Sure.

397
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,488
Put your hands on the car.

398
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,775
- I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?
- I said up against the car.

399
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:59,114
You got any kind of weapon on you,
you should tell me now.

400
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:24,223
Tyler, please.

401
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:26,562
Do not force me to shoot this man.

402
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,930
He'll tell them where we are.
They'll try to stop us.

403
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,862
Come on, Tyler.
There's gotta be another way.

404
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,208
Something like that?

405
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,900
We lost them at
the New Jersey turn pike.

406
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:01,873
Heading south, towards Swedesboro.

407
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,221
We have a chopper
shadowing the vehicle.

408
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:06,811
We need all assets rerouted
to that vicinity.

409
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,452
Let me know if you spot him.
Thanks.

410
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,357
You tell the state troopers
if they spot them,

411
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,855
to keep their distance.
Stay just within visual range.

412
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,699
And make sure they know
that Peter is not the target.

413
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:21,858
You're needed in Ms. Sharp's office.

414
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:24,935
- What's wrong?
- The director's just classified

415
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,164
Tyler Carson
as a national security threat.

416
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,143
Fringe Division has been ordered to
stand down. Any intercept will be

417
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:32,612
- handled by special forces.
- But we're the only reason

418
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:35,670
they have any clue what's really
going on. How can they take us off now?

419
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:38,551
New information has come to light
about Tyler's plans.

420
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,226
Turns out he purchased two
one-way tickets to Costa Rica,

421
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,407
which he bought before
abducting Peter.

422
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:46,058
Headquarters believes the boy working
with a foreign handler.

423
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,466
With respect, all the evidence
points towards an angry kid.

424
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:50,796
Best-case scenario,

425
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:53,376
we have a highly intelligent
malcontent on a killing spree.

426
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:56,916
Besides, the director thinks it's worse.
Tyler may have been recruited to deliver

427
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:59,978
a multi-million dollar defense project
to our country's enemies.

428
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:02,917
"Overwhelming force will be
brought to bear if necessary"?

429
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:06,042
You know what this means.
Peter could be collateral damage.

430
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,371
But regardless,

431
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,499
We need to contain the situation
on our own before it's too late.

432
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,893
Have you made any headway?

433
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:32,939
I can't lose him again.

434
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,982
I know you're worried. We all are.

435
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,949
But we can get Peter back.
We just need you

436
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:45,159
to find a way to disable Tyler.

437
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:49,626
Peter always helps me.

438
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:52,728
I don't know what to do.

439
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:54,903
How do I do this without Peter?

440
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:57,853
He always helps me.

441
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,181
He helps me too.

442
00:30:01,078 --> 00:30:02,578
But you can do this.

443
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,048
I know you're scared.

444
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,067
But you're the only one
that can help him.

445
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,061
Maybe...

446
00:30:29,554 --> 00:30:31,842
I could use an emf...

447
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:33,705
scrambler...

448
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:37,007
to disrupt his
beta wave transmissions.

449
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,839
Sounds like a good place to start.

450
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,134
I think I found something.

451
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,343
They just brought
Tyler's computer in.

452
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,722
He's been doing
some pretty strange searches.

453
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,350
This is what he was looking for?

454
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,749
Obituaries and death notices?

455
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:58,681
All of women who died
14 years ago in car accidents.

456
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:03,362
Look, all these women died
in their mid-twenties.

457
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:08,451
So that would make them what,
about 40 now if they were alive?

458
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,911
What are you thinking?

459
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,914
I don't know yet. Can you
pull up his most recent search?

460
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,923
What do you know about Renee Davies?

461
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,747
Who is she?

462
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:28,886
She's my ex-wife.

463
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,307
Tyler's mother.

464
00:31:33,622 --> 00:31:36,872
- Where'd you find this?
- It was on Tyler's computer.

465
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,195
This was a good idea.

466
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,932
Yeah, I was 15 once too.

467
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:50,576
But I had to talk my way
into places like this.

468
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,546
You know, there are plenty of
easier ways to get money.

469
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:00,419
But it wouldn't have been as fun.

470
00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:01,774
Fun?

471
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:04,793
Faking your kidnapping...

472
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:07,118
Jacking your dad's company...

473
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,782
Killing cops
and innocent bystanders...

474
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,099
That wasn't part of the plan, okay?
They just...

475
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,517
got in the way.

476
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:26,941
You know, I get it.

477
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:32,048
I mean, you wanted to torture your dad.
But the thing just got away from you.

478
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,453
- Blew up in your face.
- It's not done yet.

479
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,440
What'd your daddy do to you anyway?

480
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,131
Didn't pay you enough attention?
Forgot your birthday?

481
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,217
- Didn't play ball with you enough?
- He lied to me my entire life.

482
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:52,388
- Let's not get dramatic.
- He told me my mother was dead.

483
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:58,129
But you have to understand,
she was a mess.

484
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:02,465
She was on drugs, off drugs. I never
knew what she was gonna do next.

485
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,117
When Tyler was a baby,
she would literally

486
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:08,742
disappear for weeks at a time.
And then finally she...

487
00:33:09,303 --> 00:33:10,876
She just never came back.

488
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,282
- Does Tyler know what happened?
- I didn't know!

489
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,664
I just always assumed that she would

490
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:19,189
end up dead
of an overdose somewhere.

491
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:25,623
And then when Tyler was old enough
to start asking about her,

492
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,212
I told him that

493
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:29,154
she died in a car wreck.

494
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,763
I thought it was for the best.

495
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,970
So he wouldn't know that
his mother abandoned him.

496
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:45,105
About a month ago
I found my birth certificate.

497
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:47,661
I learned her name.

498
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,604
And then I tried to find her.

499
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,783
Guess what I found.

500
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,136
That she was never
really dead at all.

501
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,861
She lives in Maryland.

502
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:02,758
- She's some sort of rehab counselor.
- So what, you think if you find her

503
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:05,163
the two of you are just gonna live
happily ever after?

504
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:07,745
- We're gonna be a family again...
- Those cops you killed,

505
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,258
they have families too.
They got wives, they g...

506
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:33,030
That would have been in your leg
if I didn't need you to drive.

507
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:36,939
Let's go.

508
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,461
We know where Tyler's going.

509
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:51,389
Please tell me you've got something
better to stop him with than

510
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:54,260
- what you're wearing.
- This has nothing to do with the case.

511
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:57,513
I don't trust them here. I think
they're trying to read my thoughts.

512
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,003
Massive dynamic gives me
the creeps too.

513
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:02,935
According to Dr. Carson's data,

514
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:05,674
the pilots that were
treated with this drug

515
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,749
were highly responsive
to magnetic fields. So...

516
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:12,381
we are modifying an
electromagnetic pulse

517
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:15,823
- to target his brainwaves.
- What does that mean?

518
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,741
- We're gonna crash his brain.
- This device

519
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:22,586
will wipe his brain of all thought.
For a short period.

520
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,125
He won't be able to think.
He will become severely disoriented.

521
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,693
He may even vomit.

522
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:30,963
Which, hopefully, will give you
the window you need to take him down.

523
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:34,928
- Let's pack it up. We're leaving.
- Good.

524
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,067
Renee Davies?

525
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:51,669
Can I help you?

526
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,575
It's me, Tyler.

527
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,616
Your son.

528
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:09,465
I found you!

529
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,500
Who's this?

530
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,936
You mind if we go inside?

531
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,037
Of course.

532
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:33,386
Listen, I don't blame you
for leaving, all right?

533
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,736
- I blame him.
- I don't understand...

534
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:38,354
Dad.
He didn't want me to be with you.

535
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:44,396
- It wasn't like that.
- But it's okay now.

536
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:47,832
- I'm here. We can go.
- Go?

537
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:49,187
Go where?

538
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,961
Anywhere.
Another country.

539
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,054
What's going on?

540
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,446
We have some guests.

541
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:02,847
Who the hell's this?

542
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,474
It's about time for us to go,
Tyler... what do you say?

543
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,295
I think I see who's
the problem here.

544
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,464
Tyler, what are you doing?

545
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:37,720
You cover the back,
I'll take the front.

546
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:51,938
I need to disable Tyler now. No time
to wait for Dr. Bishop. I'm going in.

547
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,832
Tyler, it's over!

548
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:10,289
We're outta here.

549
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:11,791
And you're driving.

550
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:18,623
- Sir!
- He took Peter. Go after them.

551
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,541
Sir, we need to stop the bleeding.

552
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,856
<i>Dr. Bishop and I
are approaching the house.</i>

553
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:26,065
The bullet went clean through,
and I said go!

554
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,190
Yes, sir.

555
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
Tyler just took off with Peter.
Let's go.

556
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:49,537
Is that my car?

557
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,372
It's them.

558
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,367
If we can disrupt Tyler's brainwaves,
how close do we need to be?

559
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:01,966
No further than 20 feet. And the effect
will only last a few seconds.

560
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,372
Okay, do it. Do it now.

561
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,360
Son... Are you with me?

562
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:34,749
There you are.

563
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:38,850
That was quick thinking.

564
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:43,883
You always prove to be more
resourceful than I give you credit for.

565
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:46,636
Is that supposed to be
some sort of compliment?

566
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,827
How's Tyler?

567
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:54,994
He was knocked unconscious
in the crash.

568
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,806
Probably a concussion.

569
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:00,107
We gave him a sedative
to make sure he stays under.

570
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:08,449
See what happens when you
get out from behind the desk?

571
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,378
I've been shot before.

572
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:13,553
First time by one
of the good guys, though.

573
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,748
Lucky for me you're a lousy shot.

574
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,501
The kid wanted to shoot you
in the head. Lucky for you

575
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:21,128
I was able
to pull it off-center a bit.

576
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,841
You're gonna hold this over my head
for a long time, aren't you?

577
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,496
Somehow, you'll make it up to me.

578
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:34,979
Thanks, Olivia.

579
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,078
I'll tell walter.

580
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,756
Was I right?
Did Tyler lose the power

581
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:44,906
- once the drug wore off?
- You were right.

582
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:48,111
Which is a good thing, I guess.
That means he won't do any time.

583
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:51,244
Kid goes on a killing spree,
and all they're gonna do is

584
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,753
make him talk it out
with a bunch of shrinks.

585
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,425
- How many do you want?
- I'm not hungry.

586
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:03,174
- I don't need any crepes.
- Don't be ridiculous.

587
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:06,320
You were abducted.
Of course you need crepes.

588
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,886
I'm okay.

589
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,754
Whenever your mother made them,

590
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,478
you called them "creeps."

591
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,988
Drove her batty.

592
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,681
She was a strong woman,

593
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,121
your mother.

594
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:54,684
<i>"William, I don't know if you've been
receiving these messages,</i>

595
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,581
<i>but I continue to hope.</i>

596
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:02,481
<i>I wanted to update you on the status
of the penrose-carson experiments.</i>

597
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:07,401
<i>One of the Tylers did, in fact,
display a rather dramatic ability</i>

598
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,919
<i>for mind control.</i>

599
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,324
<i>But before we became aware
of his ability,</i>

600
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,295
<i>there were some
unintended consequences.</i>

601
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:21,582
<i>Among them, he was able to locate
records of his surrogate mother,</i>

602
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,550
<i>and, unfortunately, made a misguided
attempt to reunite with her.</i>

603
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:34,702
<i>In light of this, I am suspending
the experiments indefinitely.</i>

604
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,007
<i>You were right...
mind control is possible,</i>

605
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:43,813
<i>given the right conditions.</i>

606
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,204
<i>So despite
the unfortunate circumstances,</i>

607
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,779
<i>we can consider the project
a success.</i>

608
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,773
<i>As always, I hope
this finds you in good health.</i>

609
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:58,701
<i>Warmest regards, Nina."</i>
