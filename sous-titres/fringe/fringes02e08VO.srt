2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:03,678
There is one than one of everything.

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:06,672
- Who the hell is this guy?
- We're recorded him

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,925
at over three dozen scenes,
all of which relate to the Pattern.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,637
- Why? What is he doing?
- Watching. Observing.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,016
- We refer to him as the Observer.
- We were dead.

7
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:19,226
Until someone grabbed me.

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,146
We were saved, both of us,
by a man that I had never met.

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,272
You talk to him?

10
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:26,792
He wouldn't be any use to you.
He just observes.

11
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,904
I have said too much.
I'm not supposed to get involved.

12
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,180
Nice specs.

13
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:15,138
I've never seen anything
like them before.

14
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,959
They're from somewhere far away.

15
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:21,455
I don't have any money.

16
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,375
That's okay. I'm gonna give you
one of these anyway.

17
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:30,845
There.

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,633
That's great.

19
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,303
Thank you.

20
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,610
- Come with me, please.
- Excuse me?

21
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,354
What are you doing?

22
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,635
Get off me!
What are you doing?

23
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,436
Help me.
Help me.

24
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,765
- Let go. Help me.
- Let her go.

25
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,558
Somebody help me, please!

26
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:24,143
Somebody.

Morning.

35
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,294
Good morning, funny face.

36
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,521
You ready for our day?

37
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:38,008
This is the map Mom left for us.

38
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:40,303
There's four rollercoasters.

39
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:44,017
We agreed. No rollercoasters.
You can go on any other ride you like,

40
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,114
but no rollercoasters because
I am scared of the rollercoasters.

41
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,472
You think that's funny?

42
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,047
- You think that that is funny?
- Okay, no rollercoasters.

43
00:03:58,669 --> 00:03:59,669
Where?

44
00:04:08,694 --> 00:04:10,844
No, I'll tell Walter and Peter.

45
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,009
So. We're gonna have
to take a rain check.

46
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:24,597
That's okay, Aunt Liv.
I know you have an important job.

47
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,982
I'm gonna call the Jacobsens
and see if they can babysit.

48
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,259
And then I'll...

49
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,694
Make pancakes?

50
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,199
And I'll make you pancakes.

51
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,901
Are you sure it was him?

52
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,291
We don't have the security footage
yet, but an eyewitness said

53
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,633
that he was wearing
a gray suit and a hat,

54
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,558
quote, "One of those old ones
from the '60s."

55
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,760
We don't have
any information on the girl?

56
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,467
The police showed her picture around
the museum but no one knew who she was.

57
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,465
Is Walter awake?

58
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,163
He's in...

59
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:08,591
the kitchen.

60
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,769
- Talking to him's not gonna be easy.
- Why?

61
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,717
We have company.

62
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:25,157
I need you to tell me what you know
about the man we call "the Observer."

63
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,176
You once referred to him
as your friend.

64
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,537
And it seems that he may
have kidnapped a woman.

65
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,755
They call it
"the Strawberry Supreme."

66
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,543
His favorite ice cream store
is shut down.

67
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,906
He made me wait in line with him
for four hours yesterday

68
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,742
just so he could have
one last milkshake.

69
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,631
They have a secret ingredient.
It's...

70
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,346
It's mundane but it's...
Oh, it's sublime.

71
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,119
And I am trying to stimulate

72
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,959
my olfactory and...

73
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:51,891
gustatory senses
to try to recreate it.

74
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,811
Walter?
Can you come with me?

75
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,706
We've recorded him at over
three dozen fringe events.

76
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,705
Do you remember him?

77
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,112
Of course.

78
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,203
But there's nothing more
than I've told you before.

79
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,712
Peter and I were in a car crash.

80
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,755
In a frozen lake, when I was a boy.

81
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,058
We were drowning, and...

82
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,066
he dove in and saved us.

83
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,132
But you say he's kidnapped a woman?

84
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:24,758
We think he may have.

85
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,802
Why?
What are you thinking, Walter?

86
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,455
Hey, guys?

87
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,052
The footage from the abduction
has been downloaded.

88
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:35,962
Also, the police found a book
on a bench by the museum

89
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,995
that had some kind of
weird writing in it.

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,410
And they think it was his?

91
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,393
Well, they don't know,
but Agent Broyles is sending it over.

92
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,925
- Have we I.D.'ed the victim?
- No, not yet.

93
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:48,453
Wait a minute, Astrid.

94
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,295
Can you zoom in?

95
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,837
Now freeze it.

96
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:58,917
Peter, that isn't him.

97
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,948
That's a different guy.

98
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,298
There's more than one observer.

99
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,266
Stop. Ho... hold on.
What just happened right there?

100
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,728
Was he hit?

101
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,610
Who are these people?

102
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,729
"Please don't hurt me."

103
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,565
"Why are you doing this?"

104
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,567
"Please let me go."

105
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,298
"I promise I won't tell anyone."

106
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,364
"You don't have to do this to me."

107
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,415
"Please."

108
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:27,612
It will be safer...

109
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,341
if you stay quiet.

110
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,569
Her name's Christine Hollis.

111
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:46,569
27 years old in the masters program
for Fine Arts at B.U.

112
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,308
As far as we can tell,
she's no one special.

113
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,016
Her parents are deceased.
No siblings, no arrest record.

114
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,974
$2,700 in her bank account.

115
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,950
Nothing unusual about her at all.

116
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,453
- Well, do we have a home address?
- We're working on it now.

117
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,958
Assuming she's still alive.

118
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,156
We have no reason yet
to think otherwise.

119
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:05,481
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

120
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,504
I mean, we don't know what to think.

121
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:09,812
I... I'm lost.

122
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:13,663
24 years ago, one of them
saved Walter and Peter.

123
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:15,973
Walter doesn't know why,
or he can't remember.

124
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,919
But beyond that,
everything we know about these guys,

125
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:21,777
the little that there is
suggests that they just watch.

126
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,900
They don't get involved.
But now...

127
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,383
Figure out why he took this girl.

128
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,324
What makes her the exception.

129
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,493
Do that, and I think
you'll find him.

130
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,442
Hey, I think we may
have a lead on the Observer.

131
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,595
Walter. Look at this.
In his book.

132
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,460
I think that might be blood.

133
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:48,925
You might be right, son.

134
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,215
The scalpel, please.

135
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:54,176
Did he ever tell you
why he saved us?

136
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,055
The Observer.

137
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:04,851
We're close, Walter.

138
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,928
Whatever's going on, whatever
William Bell was warning Olivia about,

139
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,990
these people have the answers,
I know it. I can feel it.

140
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:14,207
This does not make any sense.

141
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:15,372
What?

142
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,215
His handwriting.

143
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,622
<i>So far, I have counted</i>
<i>1,246 distinct characters</i>

144
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,994
<i>and not a single one</i>
<i>of them repeats.</i>

145
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:24,989
All right.

146
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,792
Not all of us majored
in linguistics.

147
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:30,170
It means that every written language
is based on repetition.

148
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:33,632
So without repeated symbols,
language is not possible.

149
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,605
Well, maybe it's a code.

150
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,122
<i>Maybe.</i>

151
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,575
<i>But if so, it is the most</i>
<i>complicated code</i>

152
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,765
<i>I have ever seen.</i>

153
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,039
<i>The computer can't make</i>
<i>any sense of this either.</i>

154
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,786
Hey, what you got?

155
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:48,480
Nothing concrete on the symbols yet.
But we found a blood sample in the book.

156
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,255
- The kidnapper's blood?
- <i>Not sure. Walter's analyzing it now.</i>

157
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,347
Well,...

158
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,162
we can't be certain
till we run the labs,

159
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,148
but I've noticed the blood
has an orange tint,

160
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,453
perhaps a sign of hemophilia.

161
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,439
Well, if it is his blood

162
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,345
and if he's a hemophiliac, then maybe
he was treated in a hospital,

163
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,978
so there could be a record.

164
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,046
I'll call Broyles. Have him put together
a list of all hemophiliacs in the area.

165
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,773
Guys, I think I found something.

166
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,391
It looks like someone else has been
investigating these symbols too.

167
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,012
What?

168
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:21,954
Who is it?

169
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,359
Yeah, these things have been
blowing my mind for a while now.

170
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:32,201
Do you see the little
half-circle with wings?

171
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,291
That appears on a cuneiform tablet

172
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,111
at the Iraqi National Museum.

173
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,782
It's one of mankind's
earliest attempts at writing.

174
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,908
And, uh, do you see this little
triangular curlycue thingie?

175
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,036
That's etched on
the Iron Pillar of Delhi.

176
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,453
900, B.C.
It's pretty weird, right?

177
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:48,964
So Nina Sharp says you're FBI too.

178
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,376
Uh... you don't look FBI.

179
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,132
So you have no idea
what any of them mean.

180
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,666
- What the symbols mean?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,494
No, I have no idea.

182
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:02,345
But I found something else.

183
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,269
We all remember Paul Revere's ride,

184
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,328
"one if by land, two if by sea,"
but before that,

185
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:13,440
he was famous for his engraving
of the Boston Massacre.

186
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,827
1770.

187
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,991
Oh, come on.

188
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,813
Well, that could be anybody.

189
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,373
Marie Antoinette.

190
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,720
1793.

191
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,218
Sarajevo, 1914.

192
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,993
Minutes before Archduke
Franz Ferdinand was shot,

193
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,224
kicking off World War I.

194
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,369
So they have been around forever.

195
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,533
Or else, they're not limited

196
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:54,179
by our human perception of time.

197
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,564
Are you with me?

198
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,173
We think of time as linear, right?

199
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:04,703
Life is a journey.
You're born, and then you die.

200
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,713
And to get from one end
to the other,

201
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:11,466
there's only one way through.

202
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,360
Unless...

203
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,456
you look at it like this...

204
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,315
and then...

205
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:25,082
you can see at any point.

206
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,299
It's all happening at once.

207
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,918
So they're traveling through time.

208
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,595
It's more like
they're observing time.

209
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,817
I think...

210
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,652
these guys...

211
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,600
show up at important moments.

212
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:47,778
Um, historical,
technological, scientific.

213
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:49,536
But it's rare.

214
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:52,414
Maybe two dozen different

215
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,619
definite occurrences
in the past 5,000 years

216
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:58,332
of human history.

217
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:01,817
But recently,
I've charted 26 sightings

218
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,468
in the past three months alone.

219
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,720
It kind of makes you wonder.

220
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,055
Why now?

221
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,735
And what's about to happen.

222
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:14,173
More hot sauce, gentlemen?

223
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:19,045
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

224
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:36,166
We have a situation with August.

225
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,496
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

226
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,766
But she's supposed to be on
Tropos Air, Flight 821.

227
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,898
Why did he abduct her?

228
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:01,962
We don't know.

229
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,865
And the flight has
already left the terminal.

230
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,572
Then he's created an irregularity.

231
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,513
We'll need to repair it.

232
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,469
Contact Donald.

233
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,000
I just don't understand it.

234
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,487
Why would anyone want
to kidnap Christine?

235
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,651
Well, that's what we're trying
to figure out.

236
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:07,911
- So you two aren't roommates.
- No. We're friends.

237
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:10,458
Taking a bunch of sculpture
classes together.

238
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,846
I'm subletting her room
while she's away.

239
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,707
Was supposed to be away.

240
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,405
- Where was she supposed to be?
- Italy.

241
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:19,728
She was supposed to fly today.

242
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,815
She was gonna spend the semester
studying ceramics in Rome.

243
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,318
Well, do you have a copy
of her itinerary?

244
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,648
Her flight to Rome, or... maybe
where she was gonna be staying?

245
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,244
She emailed me one.
I can print out a copy for you.

246
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,100
Is this Christine?

247
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:38,042
It's a terrible story, actually.

248
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,832
Her family was visiting
relatives in San Francisco.

249
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:43,046
A few hours after
that photo was taken,

250
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,581
there was a big earthquake.

251
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:45,789
The one in '89?

252
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,673
They were driving on that bridge
when it happened,

253
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,717
when it collapsed.

254
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,769
Her parents were both killed.

255
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,388
That's the last photo
she has of them.

256
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,309
I'll, um, get you
her travel information.

257
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,069
Take a look at this.

258
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,143
Behind the father.

259
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:22,326
Come on.

260
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,208
Come on!

261
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,569
I thought you might be hungry.

262
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,735
You've hurt yourself.

263
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,807
Why are you doing this?

264
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,509
What do you want from me?

265
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:47,006
It would be easier to show you.

266
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,375
<i>Popularity polls continue
to show huge support</i>

267
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,347
<i>for the president
as the economy rallies</i>

268
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,928
<i>and terrorism declines.</i>

269
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:03,532
<i>The poll found that 63% of Americans
are happy with the president...</i>

270
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,165
It will be just a minute now.

271
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,137
<i>And believe he will continue
to find ways</i>

272
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>to improve the economY
and generate new jobs.</i>

273
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:15,997
Phone.

274
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,027
<i>Phone.
Please say a command.</i>

275
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,577
Call the Jacobsons.

276
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,024
<i>Calling the Jacobsons.</i>

277
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:23,953
Whatever these Observers do to keep
from aging, they should market it.

278
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,727
They'd make a fortune.

279
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,883
So what does it mean, that he...

280
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:30,585
has been keeping tabs
on this girl for 20 years?

281
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:32,327
<i>Hello?</i>

282
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,589
Oh, Ken, hi.
It's Olivia Dunham.

283
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,098
I'm just calling to check in
and say hi to my niece.

284
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,853
<i>Jane just took her out
for ice cream.</i>

285
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:42,802
<i>You want me to call her
and have her...</i>

286
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,485
Just let her know that I called.

287
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,524
<i>Sure thing.</i>

288
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:53,616
- Rachel's out of town?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,040
For the weekend.

290
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:56,444
And?

291
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:58,112
And what?

292
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,615
You do that thing with
your mouth when you're upset.

293
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:03,730
Oh, it's...

294
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,765
Ella and I had this whole day

295
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,052
at the amusement park planned,
and then dinner after.

296
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:13,484
She was completely understanding
when I told her that I had to work.

297
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,230
When my mom took me
to my first movie when I was six,

298
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,336
I was so excited.

299
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,503
She bought me a box
of popcorn, and...

300
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,774
we took our seats.

301
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:33,595
You know, they used to have that
curtain before the movie started?

302
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,650
It was this beautiful red velvet.

303
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,233
We sat there eating popcorn.

304
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,534
And after a couple minutes,
I turned to her and said,

305
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,713
"Mommy, this is
the best movie ever."

306
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,231
I didn't understand
that it hadn't started.

307
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:52,175
It's one of my favorite memories
of my mother.

308
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,191
Don't worry, you'll make plenty
of memories with Ella.

309
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:59,621
<i>New information</i>
<i>on Tropos Air Flight 821,</i>

310
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:01,506

311
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:03,507
<i>two hours outside Rome, Italy.</i>

00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,058
<i>The plane contained 211 passengers

313
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:09,168
<i>all of whom are assumed to be dead.</i>

314
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,180
- <i>Flight 821 departed...</i>
- What?

315
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,915
<i>International airport at 10:45 AM,</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time.</i>

316
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,366
Okay, Christine's itinerary,
it's just in my glove box.

317
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,347
<i>... at the Leonardo</i>
<i>da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport</i>

318
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:20,579

<i>The plane was in the air...</i>

319
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:21,946
Flight 821.

320
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,574
Boston to Rome.

321
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:26,907
She was supposed
to be on that flight.

322
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,774

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,494

00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,347

<i>We will bring you live coverage</i>

<i>Right now, what you're...</i>

330
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,547
I saved you.

331
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:46,890
How did you...

332
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,085
You're not safe. Yet.

333
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:56,522
There is something I need to do.

334
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,012
I have to go out.

335
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,376
I would prefer not to gag you.

336
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,186
But it is for your own protection.

337
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:25,877
What if he did?

338
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:28,817
I mean, what if he somehow
knew the plane was gonna crash?

339
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:30,625
So you think this Brandon guy
was right?

340
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,711
That they can see the events
before they happen.

341
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,811
I'm sorry, what plane crash?

342
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:37,153
Christine Hollis was supposed
to be on a plane

343
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:38,988
that crashed just off
the coast of Italy.

344
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:41,133
- 200 people were killed.
- Oh, dear.

345
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,384
I mean, what if he wasn't
trying to kidnap her?

346
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,311
What if he was trying
to save her life?

347
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,563
What is so special about her?
Why save her?

348
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:49,508
Why did one of them save us?

349
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,191
I've got the results of the blood
sample from the book.

350
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:00,920
High concentration of Capsaicin.

351
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:03,766
Which means it's not blood at all,

352
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:05,731
it's chili pepper juice.

353
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:07,856
He must have spilled some
in the book.

354
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,688
Well, that's great news.
So we'll add "messy" to the APB.

355
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,091
No, it is good news.

356
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:17,417
Concentration at 970,000
on the Scoville scale,

357
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,041
that's one of the hottest
chili peppers there is.

358
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,972
I hypothesize a Naga Jolokia
from India,

359
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,150
otherwise known as
the King Cobra chili.

360
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,177
I once ate one.

361
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,578
The flatulence was horrible.

362
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,288
Very embarrassing.

363
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,802
Are these peppers sold in Boston?

364
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:40,511
Oh, I... I imagine so.

365
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,265
Though I don't suspect
one could grow them here.

366
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:45,511
Astrid?

367
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:48,509
Locate anyone who's importing
those peppers locally. Got it.

368
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:55,941
Well.

369
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:58,456
It appears you've been busy.

370
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,342
Your actions took us all
by surprise.

371
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:13,640
I take it you've come here
to explain yourself.

372
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,954
Then you are aware
of the plane crash.

373
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,122
Of course.

374
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,289
Christine Hollis.

375
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:23,031
Who is she?

376
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,750
I have observed this woman
for much of her life.

377
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,759
She is unique.

378
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,549
They are all unique.

379
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,263
That is not reason to interfere

380
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,891
with the course her life
was meant to take.

381
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:39,060
We have interfered before.

382
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,896
Only to correct a mistake
of our own making.

383
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:46,535
She has no future.

384
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,402
Then why do I see it?

385
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,184
Why do I see that she is important?

386
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,645
Your perception must be in error.

387
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,042
Perhaps.

388
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,405
Your oversight will be forgiven,

389
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,440
but Miss Hollis must be corrected.

390
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,055
We've already seen to it.

391
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:19,726
- You should eat something.
- Thanks.

392
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,933
If there's something significant
about this girl, I just don't see it.

393
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:25,918
After her parents died, she was
taken in by her mother's best friend,

394
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:30,047
who was a veterinarian in Worcester.
She got decent grades in college and

395
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:34,078
interned at art galleries in the summer.
I think she's just like anyone else.

396
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,992
Guys? I think I found something.

397
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,162
There's King Cobra chilis.

398
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,706
Three Boston restaurants imported them
last year, and one private citizen.

399
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:43,300
- Who?
- I don't know.

400
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,918
He paid with a money order.
But we have an address.

401
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,145
- It's an apartment in Cambridge.
- Can you give the address to Broyles

402
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,460
and get him to have a back-up team
standing by in case we need them?

403
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,635
Sure thing.

404
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,632
Taste this, please.

405
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,770
No. That's what I was afraid of.

406
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:08,562
What is that?

407
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,651
French vanilla ice cream
and cough syrup.

408
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:15,088
I suspect that this...
The secret ingredient

409
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:18,111
is wild cherries, and I didn't
have any fresh cherries.

410
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:22,025
Unless you'd make a trip
to the market.

411
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,422
If I do, I am no longer
your taste tester.

412
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:27,338
Deal.

413
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,042
You got my message.

414
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:52,625
I suspected that a likeness
of a nitrogen molecule

415
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,539
would attract your attention.

416
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,627
Please don't take my son.

417
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,128
Your friend and I had a deal.

418
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,468
We had an arrangement.

419
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:13,399
I know what I did was wrong, but...

420
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:15,821
That is not why I contacted you.

421
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,265
I need your help.

422
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,010
My help?

423
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,398
In that case, I should call him.

424
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:31,862
And Agent Dunham.

425
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:34,378
They'll want to know
I'm talking to you.

426
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,895
I suspect that they might be
occupied right now.

427
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:36,788
On your knees.

428
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:39,273
Down on the ground.

429
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:43,102
Take it easy.

430
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,429
Take it easy.

431
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,433
Take it easy.

432
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,780
What is it that requires my help?

433
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:15,495
I have interfered
in the natural course of events.

434
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:17,804
To correct that,

435
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:21,213
the others will try to kill
Christine Hollis

436
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,269
until they succeed.

437
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,772
If we run, they will find us.

438
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:30,202
If I stop the assassin,
they will send another.

439
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,208
I cannot see any course of action

440
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:36,161
that will prevent...

441
00:30:37,757 --> 00:30:38,757
her death.

442
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,256
What makes you think I can help?

443
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:45,111
Because you have solved
such a matter before.

444
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,929
You saw beyond the limitations
of your problems.

445
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,531
Not really.

446
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,325
I just missed my son.

447
00:30:57,017 --> 00:31:00,816
May I ask what is so important
about Miss Hollis?

448
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:06,815
I cannot explain the reason.

449
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,760
I merely see it.

450
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:14,292
I have never experienced such...

451
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:16,778
certainty.

452
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:19,511
But the others,

453
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,545
they say she is of no consequence.

454
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,798
In that case,

455
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:28,391
if you can not persuade
the others of your conviction,

456
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,096
then you must do something
to prove it.

457
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,885
You must make her important.

458
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,346
And of course whatever you do,

459
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:44,574
you must be prepared
to face the consequences.

460
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,324
The gunman leave a trail?

461
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:58,108
I called in his description to the PD
but I expect he's long gone by now.

462
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:01,971
Broyles is sending in a CSU team
to dust this place for fingerprints.

463
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:04,508
I doubt he's gonna show up
on any databases.

464
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,173
At least none from this century.

465
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,353
What do you mean?

466
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:11,387
What that guy Brandon said about
them being around for a long time?

467
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:12,619
1884.

468
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,058
Apparently, it was
a great year for blubber.

469
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,869
What?

470
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,705
What is it?

471
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:48,261
Do you...

472
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,260
trust me?

473
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,524
Then you must do...

474
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:06,947
exactly...

475
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
as I say.

476
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:18,025
Any ideas?

477
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,248
What are they looking for?

478
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,835
We're looking for them but
they're looking for something too.

479
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,253
That's why they keep on showing up.

480
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,256
So what are they looking for?

481
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:33,898
Where?

482
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,001
Someone just called in a description
of our second Observer.

483
00:33:37,126 --> 00:33:39,016
He was spotted at a motel in Lowell.

484
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,203
What are you doing?

485
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:43,474
Tell me where she is.

486
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,332
Just tell me where she is.

487
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,585
You know I'm just trying to do my job.
I have no quarrel with you.

488
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,590
Are you insane?

489
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,090
Good-bye.

490
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:31,483
Christine Hollis?

491
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,462
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham.

492
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,001
I'm with the FBI.

493
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,918
It's gonna be all right.

494
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,387
What about the man?

495
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:06,134
The one who took me?

496
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,636
Let's get you home.

497
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:21,671
Will she be safe now?

498
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,305
Who is she?

499
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,449
Why did you save her?

500
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,237
I saw her many years ago.

501
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:36,808
She was a child.

502
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,365
Her parents had just been killed.

503
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,763
She was crying.

504
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:46,939
But she...

505
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:50,117
She was brave.

506
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:59,525
She crossed my mind...

507
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:03,054
somehow.

508
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:05,824
She never left it.

509
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:13,033
I think...

510
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:17,112
it's what they call...

511
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,050
feelings.

512
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,630
I think...

513
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,615
I love her.

514
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:39,225
Will she be safe now?

515
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:46,035
You made her

516
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:48,841
important.

517
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,757
She is responsible
for the death of one of us.

518
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:19,926
So who was he?

519
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,526
How am I supposed
to make sense of any of this?

520
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,320
Him, the plane,

521
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:27,722
the guy who came after us.

522
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:30,193
Did he say anything to you?

523
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,381
Anything? Did he...

524
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,454
tell you why he saved you?

525
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:42,093
He asked me to give you something.

526
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:45,023
The bald man.

527
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:53,003
In the event that he couldn't.

528
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,164
My dad...

529
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,110
won this for me playing skee-ball.

530
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:17,205
I was holding on to it in the backseat
when the bridge collapsed.

531
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,701
I think you'll be safe now.

532
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:36,583
When did you see the Observer?
And why didn't you tell me?

533
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:39,734
What do you mean?

534
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,150
- I just did tell you.
- No, that's not good enough.

535
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,809
We are so close. I can't
let these guys get away again.

536
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:50,116
They have the answers.
I know they do.

537
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:51,591
Don't worry, son.

538
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,489
You'll get your answer.

539
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,834
Why don't we go for
a long drive together?

540
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:07,255
Perhaps to pick up
a Tutti Frutti milkshake.

541
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,010
The man you shot
was named Donald Long.

542
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,945
Ballistics tied his gun to six unsolved
homicides up and down the East Coast.

543
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,932
The earliest one
dates back ten years.

544
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:19,757
- An assassin.
- Maybe.

545
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:22,907
- Do we know who hired him this time?
- We don't know.

546
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,625
Nothing in his car or on his person
gave any indication.

547
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,750
What about the Observer's gun?

548
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:31,105
Our techs had never seen anything like
it. They can't seem to make it fire.

549
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,074
The best we can figure,
Peter shot off the last round.

550
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,013
There's one more thing.

551
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:40,462
The tip-off that the Observer
was spotted at that motel,

552
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,166
it was called in from
one of the motel phones.

553
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,896
What if he was trying
to protect Christine?

554
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:52,134
And if he realized
he couldn't do it on his own?

555
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,330
That's what I thought.

556
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:02,636
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to take the rest of the day off.

557
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:05,981
Sure.

558
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:08,005
Big plans?

559
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,153
Don't worry, Aunt Liv.

560
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:15,257
I'll hold your hand.

561
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,409
You'd better.

562
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:22,033
I'm not gonna...

563
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:47,292
Look how happy she is.

564
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,000
It's a shame things
are about to get so hard for her.
