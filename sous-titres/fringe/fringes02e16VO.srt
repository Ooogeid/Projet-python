1
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:04,110
<i>Previously on </i>Fringe...

2
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:05,921
You nearly died when you were a boy.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,175
I became consumed with saving you.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,635
I don't remember any of that.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,928
There is more
than one of everything.

6
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:18,610
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.

7
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,130
What did you people do to us?

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,845
Of the children that William Bell and I
experimented on,

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,012
you were the first to identify things
from the other side.

10
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:28,961
Was it me who described it
as a glimmer?

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,658
I've never met anyone who can
do the things that you do.

12
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,083
I'll go get my coat.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,789
Please don't tell him.

14
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,465
Our success thus far

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,390
should serve as an example
of our ability to achieve

16
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:01,031
that which most can't even imagine.

17
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,360
What you must understand is that,
as scientists,

18
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,982
we must embrace every possibility.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,400
No limitations.

20
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:09,812
No boundaries.

21
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:11,740
There is no reason for them.

22
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,264
Gentlemen...

23
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,847
I would like you to
take a look at this.

24
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,674
It's a mobile telephone.

25
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:22,448
It can be made much smaller,
I assure you.

26
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:23,624
Does this work?

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,584
Not here, not yet.

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,629
This phone is digital, not analog.

29
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:31,757
It'll take us 30 years
to get up to speed.

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,161
I didn't invent it. I wish I had.

31
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:36,957
We were under the impression
Dr. Bell would be here this evening.

32
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:38,819
I'm afraid that's not possible.

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,668
Dr. Bell is in Europe.

34
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,038
But I am here,

35
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:44,290
so I can answer any questions
you may have.

36
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,115
Dr. Bishop,
is this Russian technology?

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,190
It is not.

38
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,030
It is quite American. But...

39
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,406
It is technology
from another universe.

40
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,002
An alternate universe
just like ours...

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,870
But more advanced in some area.

42
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,236
Are you suggesting you somehow
visited this alternate universe

43
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,244
and acquired this
advanced technology?

44
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,254
It is theoratically impossible
to go there.

45
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,353
Then how did you come
to possess this?

46
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,641
I copied it.

47
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,055
For the last several years,

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,685
William and I have been
conducting various experiments

49
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,621
regarding this other universe.

50
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,699
So based on our findings,

51
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,887
we developed a window of sorts,

52
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:32,526
a way of looking into
this neighboring world.

53
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,613
And that is why we are
asking for funding.

54
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,936
This is my colleague,
Dr. Carla Warren.

55
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,158
Hello, sirs.

56
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,951
This window works

57
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,859
by capturing errant photons

58
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,705
from the universe beside ours.

59
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,475
The window essentially stretches

60
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,819
the membrane between our worlds

61
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,400
and allows us...

62
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:56,675
to see their image from our side.

63
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,178
You're gonna make some sort
of alternate Manhattan appear?

64
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:01,802
It's already there, General Hames.

65
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:02,977
Dr. Warren.

66
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:04,225
At all times,

67
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,608
right in front of our eyes.

68
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,326
We just can't see it.

69
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:17,767
I'm sure you know
that the original purpose

70
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:20,116
for the so-called observation deck

71
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,159
of The Empire State Building

72
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,815
was to be a docking station...

73
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,718
for zeppers of course.

74
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,561
Gentlemen,

75
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,094
you are looking through a window...

76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,340
into another world.

77
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,424
Walter, what are you doing here?

78
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,789
You left me no choice.

79
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,203
You wouldn't answer your telephone,

80
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,302
return my messages.

81
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,489
I tried to communicate.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,783
I need time, okay?

83
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,994
I don't even know...

84
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,206
how to begin to work this out.

85
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,843
I think I do.

86
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,735
Please, Olivia,

87
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:58,203
I need to explain.

88
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,249
And if you wouldn't mind,

89
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,886
I could use a sip of something,
myself.

90
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,568
Have you told Agent Broyles?

91
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,076
But to be honest,
that doesn't mean that I won't.

92
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,642
I always knew that one day I'd have
to pay the price for my deception.

93
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:33,080
Well, we're not really sure
what the cost is yet, are we?

94
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,128
No, I suppose not.

95
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,980
I invented this

96
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:51,633
after William and I learned
that we had doubles on the other side.

97
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:54,979
Or maybe it was before.
I can't remember.

98
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,165
It's a window to the other universe.

99
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,322
I was a different man then.

100
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,196
I was going to change the world.

101
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:05,857
But you see,

102
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,405
after Peter became sick,

103
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:11,050
none of that seemed
to matter anymore.

104
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,264
The illness was genetic.

105
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:17,215
Savage.

106
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:18,806
Wasting.

107
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:20,748
I tried everything.

108
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,992
There was simply no hope.

109
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:24,962
At least...

110
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,455
not on this side.

111
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,380
But over there...

112
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:33,117
They're more
technologically advanced.

113
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:36,951
If the alternate Peter
was also sick over there,

114
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,563
then wouldn't his father be equally
motivated to find a cure?

115
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,286
He was.

116
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,915
God help me...

117
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:53,105
He was.

118
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,205
Any progress?

119
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,643
He's synthesizing
a new compound now.

120
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,521
He's using cobalt and magnesium.

121
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,573
Any idea yet how he's selecting
the filtering compounds?

122
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,927
Random, I think.

123
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,702
Chance, fate, luck of the draw.

124
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,124
I've given him a name, Carla.

125
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,168
Walternate.

126
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,762
This is it.
This should be the reaction.

127
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,258
No cure.

128
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,037
Perhaps with a higher
iodine purification.

129
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,343
- Is he...
- No, he's fine.

130
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,585
He's all right right now.

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,923
But...

132
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:36,723
What?

133
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,938
I think you should come
home now, Walter.

134
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,312
I think it's time you came home.

135
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,659
He looks worse.

136
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:00,920
Keeps asking for you.

137
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,802
It's not like before.

138
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,175
What is it like?

139
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:08,505
It's different.

140
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,924
He keeps saying
he wants to talk to you.

141
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,494
He says he's worried
he won't be able to.

142
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,843
I just can't bear it
when you're not here.

143
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,565
You know what I'm doing.

144
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,716
You know where I am

145
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,873
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

146
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,663
I won't give up, Elizabeth.

147
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,576
I can do this.

148
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:57,126
I need you not to doubt me.

149
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,841
You're supposed to get some rest,
my son.

150
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:12,556
Dad?

151
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,565
I've almost got it.

152
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,856
Let me show you.

153
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:22,882
Now...

154
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:25,212
Slowly...

155
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:27,141
Watch...

156
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,746
one finger at a time.

157
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,638
You show me.

158
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:43,548
Very good.

159
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,886
I want you to have it,

160
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,458
my lucky silver dollar,

161
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,234
if I die.

162
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,406
It's okay.

163
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:58,672
I'm not scared.

164
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,355
Nothing's going to happen to you.

165
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,332
I promise.

166
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,695
You're going to be just fine.

167
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,529
Now get some rest.

168
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,125
Will you wake me for dinner?

169
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,599
I don't wanna miss it.

170
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,509
You're not gonna miss anything.

171
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,881
You know how much William
wanted to be here.

172
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,332
But with the meetings in Berlin...

173
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,626
I don't need to tell you
how important they are.

174
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,210
For both of you.

175
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:43,110
He wanted me to make sure
that you know how terrible he feels.

176
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:47,890
I understand.

177
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,359
I'm glad you came.

178
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,638
We didn't give him a good life.

179
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,677
We didn't.

180
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,904
He practically never
got out of the house.

181
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:09,768
He was always too sick.

182
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,577
He didn't go to a proper school.

183
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,334
He didn't have any proper friends.

184
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,741
He had no family but us.

185
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,307
We kept him so well,

186
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,783
we never let anyone
else get to know him.

187
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,670
We did the best we could.

188
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,686
We dealt with what we were given.

189
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,008
He knew he was loved.

190
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:46,873
Didn't he?

191
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,372
Walter, what's wrong?

192
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:27,731
You're cold. Have you been outside?

193
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:33,576
Come with me.

194
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:48,905
Walter, what is this?

195
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,622
How's this possible?

196
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,725
How are you doing this?

197
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,542
What I've been working on,
Elizabeth,

198
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:22,182
it's a window to another universe.

199
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,286
Like ours, but different.

200
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:38,701
Please.

201
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,582
Please turn it back on again.

202
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:43,206
Please turn it on.
I want to see him again!

203
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,134
I am telling you this

204
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,920
because I want you to know

205
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:48,817
that somewhere Peter will grow up,

206
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,847
somewhere he will lead
a proper life,

207
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:53,762
somewhere he will be happy,
but just not here.

208
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,786
And we must take comfort in this.

209
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,968
And we must begin to move on.

210
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,364
The compounds
you're using for the cure...

211
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,657
not random at all.

212
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,888
You are very smart.

213
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:35,903
You did it!

214
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,386
By God, you did it!

215
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,620
You had it, the cure.

216
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,923
All you have to do is
stabilize the compound,

217
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,666
and you can save him.

218
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,890
You can save him.

219
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:42,623
Their theories are fascinating.

220
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,021
They are not theories.

221
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,434
They are entertainment.

222
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,825
I have made...

223
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,626
a mistake.

224
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:56,444
So I've heard.

225
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,805
What were you doing in the lab?

226
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:02,198
Dr. Bishop was on
the verge of developing

227
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,845
a cure for the boy.

228
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,436
It was an important moment

229
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,145
he discovered me.

230
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,307
There was no other way
to witness the moment.

231
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,880
You have changed the future.

232
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,758
You have created a new set
of probabilities.

233
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:20,825
But...

234
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:24,711
you must agree
the moment was significant.

235
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,255
The boy...

236
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,809
is significant.

237
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,490
You need to take action
to restore balance.

238
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
How?

239
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,755
You will...

240
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,630
have an opportunity...

241
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,198
to fix this.

242
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:00,883
Dr. Warren.

243
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,469
Have you been here all night?

244
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:05,346
I've been working.

245
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:07,990
- Working on what?
- This.

246
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,350
What is this?

247
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,616
Walternate found a cure.
He found a cure for Peter.

248
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,579
And... and it works, Carla.

249
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,691
It's not too late.
I can save him.

250
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,649
Peter is dead.

251
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,365
I know.
Of course I know that!

252
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,284
I'm not talking about my Peter.

253
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm talking about the other Peter,

254
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,830
The one on the other side.

255
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,832
He missed it. The other Walter.

256
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:36,364
He... he missed it and, you know...
It was right there in front of him,

257
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,079
And... and he didn't see it.

258
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,222
- He was distracted by the man.
- What man?

259
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:42,807
The man in the lab.
He was distracted.

260
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,745
And... and when he returned,

261
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,096
the positive result had failed,
and so he moved on.

262
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:50,521
Maybe he'll realize what he missed,
and he'll go back.

263
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:53,436
Carla, he is just... like... me.

264
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,772
I wouldn't look back,
and neither will he.

265
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,213
He didn't see the compound...

266
00:21:58,338 --> 00:21:59,817
But I did.

267
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,206
And I've reproduced it.
It just needed...

268
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,224
Minor modification.

269
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,742
And without this, Peter will die.

270
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,284
He'll die all over again.

271
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:14,123
Which is why I have
to go over there.

272
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,918
What?

273
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,338
The casimir effect should produce

274
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,216
a thinner,
more porous region of space-time.

275
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:26,212
I only need to affect
the area for long enough

276
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:29,349
to cross over to the other
side with a vial of the cure.

277
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,153
And... and then, of course,

278
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,101
recreate the effect
to cross back again.

279
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,105
Walter, you're trying to create
a wormhole into another universe?

280
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,814
I think I just said that.

281
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,936
Where's my map?

282
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:46,305
When I looked into his
room on the other side,

283
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,992
I saw that his mother
had already packed

284
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,266
his suitcase for our lake house,

285
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:54,493
just like we do
every year at this time.

286
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,108
That's where we need
to find a location to set up.

287
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,546
Walter, I'm sorry, but you can't.

288
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,614
Yes, I think I can.

289
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,137
No, Walter, I mean you can't.

290
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,430
Shattering the wall
between universes would

291
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,473
rupture the fundamental
constants of nature.

292
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:14,499
It's a theory.
We don't know that to be true.

293
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:17,017
It's a good theory. It is why we have
been lying to the military,

294
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,624
telling them it's impossible.

295
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:21,976
Walter,
there has to be a line somewhere.

296
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,771
There has to be
a line we can't cross.

297
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:32,717
I always considered you as a scientist,
Dr. Warren...

298
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:38,011
Despite your personal needs
for religious claptrap.

299
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,200
I see I was wrong.

300
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:43,855
"I am become death,

301
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,965
destroyer of worlds."

302
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,860
- Don't you quote Oppenheimer to me.
- Knowledge cannot be pursued

303
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:50,511
without morality.

304
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,310
I may go to church every sunday,

305
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:54,909
but I also have three degrees
in theoretical physics,

306
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,227
and I am telling you
you cannot do this.

307
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,804
We both know the amount
of energy required

308
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,600
to create a portal will
forever ruin both universes.

309
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:05,943
For the sake of one life,
you will destroy the world.

310
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:10,611
Some things are not
ours to tamper with.

311
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,134
Some things are god's.

312
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,422
My son is dying, Dr. Warren.

313
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:20,266
I will not allow
that to happen again.

314
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,130
There's only room for one god
in this lab, and it's not yours.

315
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,635
The lake.

316
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,849
It's perfect.

317
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:34,138
The water will absorb
the excess energy.

318
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:38,017
And I won't be needing your assistance
any further today, Dr. Warren.

319
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,228
That will be all.

320
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,612
Walter's always been like that.

321
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,743
He often goes off
on flights of fancy.

322
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:53,747
But even if he was serious,

323
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,349
The design itself is decades
beyond anything we could imagine.

324
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:57,980
No. You don't understand.

325
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,018
He already has the design.

326
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:02,125
He's building it.

327
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,875
Yes. Dr. Bell's room, please.

328
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,658
Here... Here we do.

329
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,902
See you've changed your mind, Carla.

330
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,790
Good.

331
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,870
I'm sorry, Walter.

332
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,096
You disappoint me, Dr. Warren.

333
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,940
Go home, Nina.
There's work to be done here.

334
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,290
Walter, don't do this.

335
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:03,304
I'll be there and back
before you know it.

336
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,725
That's not the point.

337
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,909
We know that there's
more to it than that.

338
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,318
Don't mean to say
that creating a doorway

339
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:11,178
between universes is trivial.

340
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:12,838
I'm simply suggesting...

341
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,050
- If William were here...
- William were here?

342
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,690
He'd be applauding.

343
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:20,516
- That's not true.
- No? Then why isn't he here?

344
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,418
I... the funding, his schedule.

345
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,298
He's in Europe chasing funding?

346
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,395
Too busy to come and stop me
from destroying the universe?

347
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:30,171
How many times have
you rang him today?

348
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,344
Once? 20?

349
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,795
How many times has
he returned your call?

350
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:37,071
You know how many times that William

351
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,315
has encouraged me to
take this very risk?

352
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:42,987
To expedite our espionage program?

353
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:48,059
"Why simply take a peek into
the other universe, Walter,

354
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,709
when you can go there?"

355
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,302
So till now,

356
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,962
he couldn't make me find a way
to try to get there

357
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,548
until I had to find a way.

358
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,232
No, I don't believe that.

359
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:58,519
No, you wouldn't,

360
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,720
because you don't understand him.

361
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,688
Like everyone else, you're blinded

362
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,177
by the charming mannerly,

363
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,350
the air of intelligence,

364
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:08,868
the whole damn show.

365
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:11,097
All William Bell ever cared about

366
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,825
was finding a way to
increase the power and the wealth

367
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,815
and the legend of William Bell.

368
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:22,348
Walter,
regardless of what William wants,

369
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,758
or who he is,

370
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,240
I know why you're doing this.

371
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:27,526
I understand.

372
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,084
You know how much Peter meant to me,

373
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:35,375
and how difficult it will be for me

374
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,600
to admit that he's gone.

375
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:40,859
But... this.

376
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:45,234
This isn't the answer.

377
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,009
I won't let him die again.

378
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,369
No! Walter! I won't let you do it!

379
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,349
Help me!

380
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,540
You're supposed to get some rest.

381
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,834
Look.

382
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,790
I've almost got it.

383
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,804
Okay, let's take a look.

384
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,507
Here, let's see, okay.

385
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,352
It's like this.

386
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,230
Okay, slowly.

387
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,580
One finger at a time.

388
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,149
Slowly.

389
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,814
Two...

390
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,026
Three.

391
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:50,692
Good job.

392
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,795
All right, love.
Now sleep, okay?

393
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,344
Good night, sweetheart.

394
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:01,358
Mom?

395
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,307
I want you to have it.

396
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:06,828
What, darling?

397
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:08,867
My lucky silver dollar.

398
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,551
I want you to have it

399
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,540
if I die.

400
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:22,379
Sweetheart, well...

401
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:23,754
It's okay.

402
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,884
I'm not scared.

403
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,459
Listen.

404
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:31,972
Nothing is going to happen to you.

405
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,602
I promise.

406
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,839
You're gonna be fine.

407
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,673
You just need to get
some rest now, okay?

408
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,187
All right.

409
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,128
Okay, my love.

410
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,102
Dad?

411
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,105
Hello, son.

412
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,898
Dad?

413
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:33,819
Are you all right?

414
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,083
Baby, who you talking to?

415
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:49,427
What are you doing here? I thought
you were working late at Cambridge.

416
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,280
I...

417
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:54,008
Walter, what are you wearing?
Where did you get that coat?

418
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:58,434
I think I found a cure.

419
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,581
What?

420
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,585
I think I found it,

421
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:04,231
a cure for him.

422
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:06,317
Are you certain?

423
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:08,033
Yes, I believe so.

424
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,560
I'll need to take him back
to Cambridge to the lab.

425
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,304
- We'll need to leave now.
- Yes, of course.

426
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:18,120
Right, Peter, darling, get up.
I'm going to get you dressed.

427
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,882
Darling, let's get you out of this.

428
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,583
Okay. Good boy.

429
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,921
There's a good chap.

430
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,344
Darling, we have to go
to daddy's work.

431
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:38,057
May I have a word, please?

432
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,907
Yeah, of course.
Put the gloves on.

433
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,689
What is it?

434
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,276
I think you should stay here.

435
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,444
What?

436
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,654
The cure, there's still testing
to be done, and

437
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:56,659
it could take all night
to find the correct dosage.

438
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,202
Well, I can pack a bag.

439
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:03,116
You haven't slept in weeks.

440
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,959
If it works, there could be

441
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,695
many days and weeks of recuperation.

442
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,173
Peter will need you.
He'll need you to be strong.

443
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:14,254
- I'm fine.
- Please, Liz.

444
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:17,565
I need you not to doubt me.

445
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,200
God, he's burning up.

446
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,668
We should leave.

447
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,583
You take this for luck.

448
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:50,671
- I love you very much.
- I love you too, Mom.

449
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:59,163
I'm going to be waiting
for you right here.

450
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:01,709
Okay, go on.

451
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,430
Gloves.

452
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:13,775
Bring him back to me.

453
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:17,763
I promise.

454
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,383
Are you warm enough?

455
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:36,851
I'm cold.

456
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:38,089
Me too.

457
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,900
Just a little farther.

458
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,374
Where are we going?

459
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:47,935
Why aren't we taking the car?

460
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,549
We can't get where
we're going in a car.

461
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,170
You're not my father,

462
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,446
are you?

463
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:05,471
Of course I am.

464
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,625
Who else would I be?

465
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:10,708
And I'm going
to make you all better.

466
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,289
Hold on tight, son.

467
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:39,862
We did it.

468
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,303
Is he okay?

469
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:56,755
Who are you?

470
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:59,796
You're the man I saw...

471
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:01,612
in the lab...

472
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,180
on the other side.

473
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:10,913
Your friend and the one
who was injured,

474
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:13,846
they left to seek medical attention.

475
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:20,213
He won't live much longer.

476
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,133
You must fix him.

477
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,650
Your lab is six miles from here.

478
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,264
Can you drive?

479
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,279
Think so.

480
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,029
Why did you save us?

481
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:50,064
The boy is important.

482
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,670
He has to live.

483
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:33,014
I just got off with the hospital.

484
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,739
Dr. Bell called in
a team of specialists.

485
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,291
He has some thoughts on Nina's arm.

486
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:42,838
Thank you for coming in to help
with Peter, after all that happened.

487
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,406
Of course, Walter.

488
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,216
He looks better.

489
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,337
He's getting his color back.

490
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,681
Seems to be working.

491
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,891
You're going to return him.

492
00:39:57,932 --> 00:39:59,482
Once he's stabilized.

493
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:01,114
Good.

494
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,360
- I'd like to go now.
- Of course.

495
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,485
Thank you.

496
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:28,508
Love, you didn't
come home last night.

497
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,946
I was worried about you.
I thought...

498
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:45,729
How?

499
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,661
He was dying, Elizabeth.

500
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:54,088
This is the boy I showed you,

501
00:40:54,863 --> 00:40:56,163
the other Peter.

502
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,916
It was the only way
I could save him.

503
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:36,646
My baby.

504
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:38,849
My baby.

505
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,661
Elizabeth, don't.

506
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,070
He's not ours.

507
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,881
I have to take him back.

508
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:00,962
And I realized

509
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,469
at that moment

510
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:06,059
that despite what I'd promised,

511
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,848
what I fully intended to do...

512
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,110
that I could never take Peter back.

513
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,413
The way she looked at him,

514
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:23,744
I saw in her

515
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,880
what I feared most in myself
when I saw him...

516
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,402
That I couldn't lose him again.

517
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
It was the first hole, Olivia.

518
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,990
The first breach.

519
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:44,562
The first crack in
a pattern of cracks,

520
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,487
spaces between the worlds.

521
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:51,985
And it's my fault.

522
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:06,472
You can't imagine what it's like

523
00:43:06,597 --> 00:43:07,897
to lose a child.
