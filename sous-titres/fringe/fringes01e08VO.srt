1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Previously on fringe

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,630
Olivia dunham  FBI.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,700
They're calling these events a pattern

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,460
As if someone out there is experimenting

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,630
Only the whole world is their lab.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Anybody you need  you can have.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,230
His name's walter bishop.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,530
My father. He worked out of harvard.

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,830
He was part of a classified u.s. Army experimental program

10
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,730
In an area called fringe science.

11
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,835
You're telling me

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,739
My father was dr. Frankenstein.

13
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,409
So much happened here

14
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,002
And so much isbout to.


16
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:56,131
Are those notes you're writing  ben?

17
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:59,502
I thought we talked about this.

18
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,561
You know  about taking a break from the music

19
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:06,501
So you'd have time for other things.

20
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,333
Maybe something new.

21
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:16,062
Dad  don't get mad at me

22
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:20,702
But the windshield wipers  can you slow them down?

23
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,201
Slow them down?

24
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:23,933
The tempo.

25
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:26,002
It's messing me up.

26
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:29,103
Sorry  bean  i can't.

27
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:30,732
I need to be able to see.

28
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,430
Stop,I need help.

29
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:43,633
What is it?

30
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,233
Don't know. Let's see.

31
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:55,702
You okay?

32
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:56,760
Oh  i'm fine.

33
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,501
I can't say the same for my car.

34
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,202
It kind of shuddered and then stopped.

35
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,661
And my phone's dead.

36
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,661
Oh  hold on.

37
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,733
Be right back.

38
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:07,762
Thank you.

39
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:10,263
It's not a night you wanna get stuck out here.

40
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,732
Yeah  i need a tow.

41
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,530
I'm on route 12

42
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,963
About two miles north of fair oak.

43
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:24,102
Yeah  massachusetts plate

44
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:26,232
3-3-2-e-w-d.

45
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:27,960
All right  thanks.

46
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,302
Ah  they're busy. It's gonna be a while.

47
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,732
Then I definitely am not gonna make it

48
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:33,463
To this business meeting  which would normally be a blessing

49
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,732
But this one's really important.

50
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,601
Listen i-i know hardly a thing about cars.

51
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,200
But why don't you let me take a look?

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,600
No  no  you've done enough. No.That's alright.

53
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,631
Transmission's dry.

54
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,332
Some kind of electrical short.

55
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,402
Hey  easy.

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,902
Didn't mean to scare you.

57
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,330
It's okay. I didn't hear you.

58
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,501
Yeah  listen  sorry it took so long.

59
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:26,002
Man  you okay?

60
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,002
Where's her car?

61
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,230
Ben.

62
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,661
Ben?

63
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,103
Ben!

64
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:04,803
The boy's name is ben stockton.

65
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:06,801
According to his father  they were driving home

66
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,100
From a school function last night

67
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,062
When he saw a woman having car trouble.

68
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,763
The father claims that while he was looking

69
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,501
At the woman's car  something happened.

70
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:14,960
He said it was like time jumped.

71
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,932
And his son  the woman  and her car were suddenly gone.

72
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,333
So he just blacked out.

73
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:20,801
In the statement he gave police

74
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:22,761
He insisted he never lost consciousness.

75
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,602
So any other witnesses to back up the dad's story?

76
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,333
No  but this is not the first time this has happened.

77
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:30,603
These are from the files of three other missing person cases

78
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:31,902
Dating back ten years.

79
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,861
In each one  witnesses describe seeing the same woman.

80
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:37,530
We've tried running facial recognition software.

81
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,062
Nothing.

82
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,861
So what happened to the other victims?

83
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,563
The first was found wandering the shoulder of i-91

84
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:43,662
Near northampton.

85
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,762
The second in the supermarket

86
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,201
Curled up in the freezer bin.

87
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:47,200
Meaning what? They were let go?

88
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,460
Apparently.

89
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,101
But not before whatever'd been done to them

90
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:51,201
Drove them insane.

91
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,702
Two weeks after she was found

92
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,962
One of the victims actually tried to lobotomize herself

93
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,403
Using a butter knife.

94
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:58,862
And all of them completely incapable of recalling

95
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,331
What happened during the abduction.

96
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:01,462
Even under hypnosis.

97
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,162
So they're all academics.

98
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,230
A probability theorist

99
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,333
Structural engineer...

100
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,332
If we're looking at a serial abduction

101
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,861
Then a ten-year-old kid really doesn't fit the bill.

102
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,003
No  but other than that

103
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,303
The details surrounding his disappearance

104
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,730
Are identical to the others.

105
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:17,700
Interacting with the woman in the sketch

106
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:19,633
Then experiencing an interval of lost time.

107
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:20,960
Peculiar flashing lights.

108
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,431
Green  green  green  red.

109
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:24,962
Like christmas lights.

110
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,800
How did you know that  dr. Bishop?

111
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,662
I don't know.

112
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,601
But that's what happened  isn't it?

113
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes.

114
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,660
Think you might be able

115
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,103
To jog your mind  walter?

116
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,231
Could be kind of helpful.

117
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,063
Christmas lights.

118
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,700
That's all i can recall. Sorry.


120
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,601
I know what it sounds like.

121
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,703
Like i'm crazy. I'm not.

122
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,302
I talked to her.

123
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,430
I touched her car.

124
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,330
Police grilled my brother for hours.

125
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,830
They treated him like a suspect.

126
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,862
I know what i saw. She was real.

127
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:57,960
Why doesn't anyone believe him?

128
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,001
You're wasting time.

129
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,262
We need to find ben.

130
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:02,130
Yeah  i believe you.

131
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:03,963
In fact  we think that the same woman

132
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,962
May be involved in a number of other abductions.

133
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,403
This has happened before.

134
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:09,133
Why would anyone want to take my son?

135
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,403
I don't know.

136
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,363
Honestly  he doesn't really fit the profile

137
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,862
Of the other victims.

138
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,361
For one  they were all adults.

139
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,660
And another  they were all academics.

140
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,431
Experts in various fields.

141
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,231
What?

142
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,462
Ben is kind of an expert himself.

143
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,460
What do you mean?

144
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:34,665
Nine months ago  my wife was walking ben to school.

145
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,209
Some idiot late for a dentist appointment ran a red light.

146
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:41,069
And they were hit in the crosswalk.

147
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,861
Abby was killed.

148
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:45,000
The doctors told me they didn't know

149
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,030
If ben was gonna make it either.

150
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,663
He was in a coma for six days.

151
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,901
And when he woke up--

152
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,802
It's easier if i just show you.

153
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:12,630
This is the day i took him home from the hospital.

154
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:15,233
He hadn't spoken said even a word

155
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,561
Since i told him his mother died.

156
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,201
And we got home

157
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,061
And he just sat down at the piano

158
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,063
And started to play.

159
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,503
He's very talented.

160
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,461
Before this

161
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,501
He had never taken a single lesson.

162
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:32,631
His doctors told me there had been other cases.

163
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,032
People with severe brain traumas

164
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:36,731
Waking up with the ability to do things

165
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,132
They'd never done before.

166
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:43,060
Two weeks later he was composing his own music.

167
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,662
One piece in particular.

168
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:50,932
Stopped being interested in everything else.

169
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,760
You said the other people that had been taken

170
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,930
Were accomplished at something.

171
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,031
Do you think

172
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,201
That that's why they took ben?

173
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,060
I don't know.

174
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,603
Thank you so much for your time.

175
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,061
Uh agent dunham...

176
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:14,531
After abby died

177
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,261
My brother...

178
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,833
He barely held it together.

179
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:24,402
Without ben i don't think he'll make it.

180
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:26,733
I'll do everything i can.

181
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,733
Thank you.

182
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:45,431
How are you feeling ben?

183
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,861
I wanna go home.

184
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,432
I just wanna see my dad.

185
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:58,200
Well i have something better for you.

186
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,632
There's someone else here

187
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,503
Who would very much like to see you.

188
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:02,702
I don't care!

189
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,960
I wanna see my dad!

190
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:08,433
Well your mother will be very disappointed to hear that.

191
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,932
My mom's dead.

192
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,630
Are you sure about that?


194
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,003
Hey,Walter

195
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,861
Don't you think it's a little early in the season

196
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:31,960
For the yuletide cheer?

197
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,632
I'm reciting christmas carols

198
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,633
In an attempt to jar loose

199
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,532
Some details from my subconscious

200
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:41,763
To remember where i heard mention

201
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:43,500
Of the green and red lights.

202
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,502
But sadly it hasn't yet worked.

203
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,131
So you thought it would be more useful

204
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:50,132
To work on your christmas tree decorations?

205
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:53,501
Though i-i cannot recall where i heard of the lights

206
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:55,732
It did give me an idea a theory

207
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,631
As to how the boy was taken.

208
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:01,032
I was hired to design a technology

209
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,232
An intricate pattern of flashing lights

210
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,500
Intended to create a suggestible state of hypnosis.

211
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,503
Theoretically the test subjects

212
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,002
Will do what ever commanded.

213
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:15,433
Bark like a dog,dance a jig,wash the car.

214
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:17,862
U.S.Government had you working on mind control?

215
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,830
Not the government.

216
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,760
It was an advertising agency.

217
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:27,863
They hoped to broadcast the flashing lights during commercials

218
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,561
So that the viewers would have no choice

219
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,430
But to buy their products.

220
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:36,030
Unfortunately it merely caused nausea.

221
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,602
Which was unfortunate because apparently

222
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,631
People don't like to shop

223
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,432
When they feel like they're going to throw up.

224
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,561
Miss!

225
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:45,702
Where is the remote?

226
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,832
Oh hey walter walter.

227
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:50,101
Walter dial it down a notch all right?

228
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,131
Now i posit that the flashing lights

229
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:59,802
Witnessed by the father induced a hypnagogic trance

230
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:02,660
During which stage the child was abducted.

231
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,663
I thought you said the experiments were failures.

232
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,632
Oh yes.

233
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:08,433
But i focused solely on the timing and intensity

234
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,131
Of the flashes not the colors.

235
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:11,600
The green and red.

236
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,903
Now i suggest that those wavelengths

237
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,232
Are the key to success.

238
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,233
Come.

239
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,603
Let me demonstrate. Come.

240
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,433
What do you want me to do?

241
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,263
Just stare at the lights.

242
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,861
Sorry walter.

243
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,860
Better luck next time.

244
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,600
Anyone ready for lunch?

245
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,002
What's up chachi?

246
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,161
Did you do this to me?

247
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,300
You did.

248
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:20,603
Dunham.

249
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,831
It's me.

250
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,460
Based on the description by the father

251
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,760
I i.d.'d your kidnapper.

252
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,162
Name's joanne ostler.

253
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:29,160
She was a molecular biologist studying at m.i.t.

254
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:30,830
She would have been thirty this march.

255
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:32,030
What do you mean,would have been?

256
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:34,360
Uh according to dmv department of records

257
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,260
Joanne ostler died ten years ago.

258
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,861
Are you sure it's the same woman?

259
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,561
Looks identical to the woman from your sketch.

260
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,160
And she doesn't have a twin because i checked.

261
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,700
So what happened to her?

262
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:47,260
Apparently her car went off the bridge in november of '98

263
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,861
Eight months before any of the abductions.

264
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,431
How is that even possible?

265
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,932
Here's the thing.

266
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,332
The car was recovered but her body was never found.

267
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:57,060
So then it's possible that she survived.

268
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:01,661
Either that or broyles has you chasing a ghost.

269
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,201
What the hell's he doing?

270
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,161
He thinks it'll help him remember where he's heard

271
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,161
About the red and green lights.

272
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,602
Okay. We've got good news.

273
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,801
We think we understand how it was that ben was abducted.

274
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,132
Those red and green flashing lights

275
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:18,962
They put the father into a hypnagogic state.

276
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,462
And we think we may have i.d.'d the woman responsible.

277
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:22,701
I have it!

278
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,902
Christmas. Christmas.

279
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,302
Leading to christmas carols

280
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,131
One of which is jingle bells

281
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:32,630
Which leads naturally to dashing through the snow

282
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,761
Which  of course  inevitably leads one to dash.

283
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:36,900
To dash?

284
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,132
Dashiell kim

285
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,433
The man who mentioned the lights to me.

286
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,461
I'm sure of it.

287
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,002
Where is he  walter?

288
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,701
Can we talk to him?

289
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,760
I guess that would depend on whether he has succeeded

290
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,162
In killing himself or not.

291
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,103
What are you talking about  walter?

292
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,300
Who is this guy?

293
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:56,463
A fellow inmate of mine at st. Claire's asylum.

294
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,231
I think

295
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,363
We may have i.d.'d another abductee.

296
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,301
Dashiell kim. Headed up astrophysics at umass.

297
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,803
Went missing in may 2006.

298
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:08,632
Turned up a week later at his home outside clarksburg

299
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,762
Where he had a psychotic break.

300
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,331
Bludgeoned his wife to death with a tire iron.

301
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,602
He was committed to st. Claire's hospital.

302
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,803
He was there at the same time

303
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:19,801
As dr. Bishop?

304
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:20,863
Walter bishop claims he remembers kim

305
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,562
Telling him a story about a woman

306
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,303
Who put him to sleep with a christmas tree

307
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:25,430
And then took him away.

308
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:26,960
Green and red lights.

309
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,232
And he fits the profile.

310
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:30,162
Expert in a scientific field.

311
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,962
But i need you to get an interview request

312
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:35,603
Pushed through legal so we can arrange a visitation.

313
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:38,063
Any specific things that kim might remember

314
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,062
About the abduction

315
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,660
Like  where he was taken  maybe.

316
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,932
That might take some time.

317
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,503
How come?

318
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,032
Says here dashiell kim is a 1027.

319
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:46,132
Yeah  what's that?

320
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,531
1027: criminally insane

321
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,133
With knowledge of state secrets.

322
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,230
Apparently  kim had a sideline

323
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:56,302
Consulting the defense contracts for jpl.

324
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:57,461
You can't get in to talk to him

325
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:58,833
Without official clearance.

326
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,131
And how long will that take?

327
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:03,531
If we go through channels six weeks minimum.

328
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,963
I've got a contact at justice.

329
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,162
I'll tell him it's urgent.

330
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:16,802
I don't know how a guy that could do this to his own wife

331
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:20,730
Is gonna help you find a missing kid.

332
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:56,033
You've never looked at it in that order  have you?

333
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:02,862
No.

334
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:03,930
Hi  bean.

335
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:07,862
Mom?

336
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,563
He did this to his own wife?

337
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,633
32 years of marriage.

338
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,862
By all accounts they seemed happy.

339
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:28,961
Until dashiell showed up after he was abducted

340
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,261
And beat her to death.

341
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,501
Did i hear mention of my old friend dashiell?

342
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,630
Of course.

343
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:40,462
I'd recognize his handiwork anywhere.

344
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,833
You mean he killed others?

345
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:48,831
Well  he tried--a patient at the institution Jasper

346
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:51,400
But actually  i was referring to the equation.

347
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:53,260
Dashiell was obsessed with it.

348
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,201
Obsessed in what way?

349
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,133
He couldn't complete it.

350
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,460
I tried to help him solve it once

351
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:02,001
And he came at me with a plastic spork.

352
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,561
What are you thinking?

353
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,561
You know  ben's father said that ben became obsessed

354
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,730
With this one piece of music.

355
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,363
And he couldn't complete it either.

356
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,860
I've been listening to it. It's very beautiful.

357
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,202
He's light years

358
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,631
Ahead of where even you were at that age.

359
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,933
Walter  take a look at this.

360
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:26,130
See this function?

361
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,001
It appears here  here  here--

362
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,401
It just keeps on repeating over and over.

363
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,831
Yes  yes  it's a recurring expression.

364
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:32,960
Or it's a rhythm.

365
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:37,930
Well  yes  i suppose.

366
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,133
Are you suggesting--

367
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,202
Can you convert that into standard musical notation?

368
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:43,332
Oh-oh-oh  i can try.

369
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,631
What's going on?

370
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,130
Music is a mathematical language.

371
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:47,403
Chords have numerical values

372
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:48,361
And their notes

373
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,560
1/4s  1/8s  1/16s

374
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,632
They're all just fraction variables.

375
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:51,831
Okay  i took the oboe for six months

376
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:52,900
And then quit.

377
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,562
Almost there  peter.

378
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,061
That's nine bars.

379
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:02,860
Okay  listen to this.

380
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:19,233
Sound familiar?

381
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,463
That's ben's song.

382
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:23,761
Yes.

383
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,461
Ben's piece is the musical equivalent

384
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,230
Of dashiell's mathematical formula.

385
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:30,860
So how is that possible?

386
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:32,262
They'd never even met each other.

387
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:35,400
It's not so surprising actually.

388
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:39,003
Curious minds often converge on the same idea.

389
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,600
Newton and leibniz independently

390
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,632
Without knowing each other

391
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,402
Invented calculus.

392
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,761
The relevant question is what is it?

393
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,333
What is what?

394
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:53,000
What is it that both ben and dashiell are trying to solve?

395
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,062
How is this possible?

396
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,030
Are we in heaven?

397
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:58,033
No  honey  we're not in heaven.

398
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,833
But i don't understand.

399
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:04,501
I saw you get hurt.

400
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,460
I don't understand  either.

401
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,830
But i do know that i'm here.

402
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:10,502
And i've missed you so much  ben.

403
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:13,961
For me to stay you have to do what this woman says.

404
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,863
You have to finish the song  bean.

405
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,762
You need to finish it.

406
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:22,330
It's important  ben.

407
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,530
Okay.

408
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,103
I love you  mom.

409
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:35,000
I love you too  bean.


411
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,831
Dr. Sumner. Hello.

412
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:45,932
Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

413
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,701
I understand you're interested in talking

414
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,633
To one of my patients.

415
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:52,560
Although i-i can't imagine what help dashiell kim

416
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,102
Could be to the fbi.

417
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,532
We're investigating a missing persons case--

418
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,630
A kidnapping.

419
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:59,300
And we believe that before coming here

420
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:01,831
Mr. Kim may have been the victim of an abduction himself.

421
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,560
Possibly by the same person that we're looking for.

422
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:08,060
I suppose you came by this information

423
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,662
Through a former patient of mine.

424
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,930
dr. Walter bishop?

425
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:13,661
You're the agent who took him three months ago,

426
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,401
aren't you?

427
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,062
Yes.

428
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,530
And you should know dr. Bishop is doing quite well.

429
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:22,062
He's been assisting us since he checked out.

430
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:27,261
He has no business being out among the rest of us.

431
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,233
Well, I appreciate your concern

432
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,402
But i'm not here to talk about dr. Bishop.

433
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,963
I respect your discretion.

434
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,560
Provided you respect mine.

435
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,831
The mental health of my patients

436
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,630
Is my primary concern.

437
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:45,833
And subjecting them to open-ended interrogations

438
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:49,103
By fbi agents is hardly prudent therapy.

439
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:53,160
I appreciate your position.

440
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,430
And i'd like to help.

441
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:59,461
But i can't subject dashiell to new faces right now.

442
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,061
Dr. Sumner I'm here because a child's life

443
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,130
May be in danger.

444
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:10,603
There may be a way we can work this out.

445
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,932
I'm listening.

446
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,363
You've assured me

447
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:18,431
That walter bishop is doing fine.

448
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,931
If that's the case

449
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:24,633
I'll allow walter bishop

450
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,030
To talk to mr. Kim

451
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,301
And ask your questions.

452
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:31,863
It might do dashiell good to see a familiar face.

453
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:40,563
Olivia, there is nothing to discuss.

454
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,802
But it's the only way

455
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,632
We can make contact with dashiell kim.

456
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,803
Absolutely not.

457
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,060
Peter--

458
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:48,130
You want to send my already mentally unstable father

459
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:49,963
Back to the institution that made him that way.

460
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,260
We don't have a choice.

461
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,331
We need to speak to dashiell

462
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,330
And without sumner's permission, we need a subpoena

463
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:56,633
Which is going to take time.

464
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,101
Even if he speaks to dashiell

465
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,703
What makes you think he's gonna remember a word

466
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:01,160
That he says?

467
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:02,432
The man can't even remember what he had for lunch.

468
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:04,231
I have noticed

469
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:07,462
That you have a habit of referring to me

470
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:08,503
As if i'm not in the room.

471
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,832
Does anyone care what i think?

472
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,400
Yes, walter.

473
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:15,933
What do you want to do?

474
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:20,163
I'd rather not go.

475
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,200
Walter--

476
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,162
Olivia, he said "no."

477
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,902
That is incorrect.

478
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:28,001
I said, "i'd rather not go."

479
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,430
But i will.

480
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:35,732
Every moment that passes

481
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,360
Is another moment that little boy's life

482
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,931
Is in danger.

483
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:46,430
Isn't that correct, agent dunham?

484
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:50,732
Then we should go.

485
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,430
Well, are you ready?

486
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,103
When you get out, we'll be right here.

487
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,833
Good luck, walter.

488
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:55,762
Come with me.

489
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,161
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help you.

490
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,000
Dr. Bishop, how you been?

491
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,731
You know I'm not really back.

492
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:04,730
Yeah, well, it's nice to see you anyway.

493
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:07,031
You have ten minutes, walter.

494
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,801
Dashiell.

495
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:27,063
It's me, walter.

496
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:31,200
Walter bishop.

497
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,400
Walter?

498
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:44,502
You look different.

499
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:48,460
It's the beard.

500
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,403
And you look different too somehow.

501
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:53,730
That smile.

502
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:58,002
Have they altered your medication?

503
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,530
Wouldn't surprise me.

504
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:03,360
These medieval quacks are more proficient

505
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:06,733
At phrenology than psychopharmacology.

506
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:11,762
I miss your jokes, walter.

507
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:15,561
And I miss your stories.

508
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:19,760
The one about the woman who took you away

509
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:23,600
With the green and red lights.

510
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:24,603
Dashiell, look at me.

511
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:27,233
This is important.

512
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:31,131
The woman, where exactly did she take you?

513
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:34,530
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:38,233
I don't know what you're referring to.

515
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:41,361
You must be mistaking me for someone else.

516
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,902
Now, if you'll excuse me

517
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,031
I want to sit here and finish

518
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,460
My butterscotch pudding in peace.

519
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:17,862
You were always trying

520
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:20,503
To solve it, huh?

521
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,162
Yes.

522
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:34,260
I don't do math anymore, walter.

523
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,800
Mathematical formulations are not conducive

524
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,032
To my mental stability.

525
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:42,500
That's fine, but if you recognize the equation

526
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:45,001
Do you not remember the woman

527
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,661
With the red and green lights  where she--

528
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,201
I don't do math anymore!

529
00:27:58,736 --> 00:27:59,903
You used to tell me the story all the time.

530
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,763
-No! -You used to drive me crazy.

531
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,402
I don't do math anymore. I don't care about math.

532
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:05,830
Dr. Bishop.

533
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,900
No, I need to know where she took you, damn it.

534
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,531
That's enough! It's time to go.

535
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,063
-Where is she? -I've got him.

536
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:19,302
Please, dashiell, it's only--

537
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,403
What do you mean you sedated him?

538
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:24,361
Walter is legally in my custody.

539
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:26,400
You have no right to keep him here.

540
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,200
Not only do I have every right to hold him

541
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,032
I have a responsibility to hold him.

542
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:31,563
He accosted mr. Kim.

543
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,062
If i release him and something else happens--

544
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,803
I can assure you that's not going to happen.

545
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,531
He's under our supervision.

546
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:39,301
Perhaps that's what compounded the problem.

547
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,402
Meaning what?

548
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:45,831
I had some time to talk to dr. Bishop

549
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:49,001
After he calmed down about his work assisting you

550
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,830
And it is clear that exposing him

551
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:53,000
To the pressures of criminal investigations

552
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:54,803
While indulging

553
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:58,503
His fantastical pseudo-scientific notions

554
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:02,633
Has exacerbated the worst features of his mental illness.

555
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:04,201
-Really? -Really.

556
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:05,231
'Cause after some of the things I've seen

557
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,603
In the last three months

558
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,933
Walter strikes me as being one of the sanest people i know.

559
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,432
Is that so?

560
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:11,602
I'm gonna make this really simple

561
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:12,633
Dr. Sumner.

562
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,701
Walter bishop is assisting us

563
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:14,803
In a criminal investigation

564
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:16,233
Which you are currently obstructing.

565
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,532
So either you release him into our custody

566
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:19,833
Or i will get a court order.

567
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:22,503
You go get your court order  then.





572
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,533
Welcome back  walter.

573
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:17,902
Where are we on that tip from rochester?

574
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:19,100
Local agents are heading to the convenience store

575
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,402
Where they saw the boy.

576
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,102
They're hoping video surveillance can confirm

577
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:23,932
It really was ben stockton.

578
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,301
Okay  well  have we set up checkpoints?

579
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:27,062
No  they're working on it. So far  nothing.

580
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,001
I have the general counsel's office on the phone.

581
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,133
It's about dr. Bishop.

582
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,160
This is agent dunham.

583
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:38,602
No  i wanted you to work around the protocol.

584
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:42,032
Please  i need your help. I need to get bishop out.

585
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:46,803
Okay  7:00 a.m.

586
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,603
Thank you. What was that?

587
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:49,963
Okay  we have to wait till morning

588
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:51,500
For the court order to have walter released.

589
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:52,502
But then he's out.

590
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,130
I promise. And i'm sorry.

591
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:55,261
And obviously  you were right.

592
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,663
No  this was walter's choice.

593
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,531
Okay.

594
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:01,303
So if you want to go down to reception

595
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:02,860
Someone can arrange a ride

596
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:04,862
And then at least one of us can get some sleep.

597
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,261
The woman who abducted ben

598
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,603
Joanne ostler--

599
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:10,203
Up until now  everybody thought she was dead  right?

600
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah.

601
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,463
Well  she's been walking around

602
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:13,563
For the last ten years.

603
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:14,901
She must have been using somebody's name.

604
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:17,001
We didn't get any hits on an alias search.

605
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,230
What'd you base the search on?

606
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:19,863
On the anagrams.

607
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:22,202
Like combinations of different family names.

608
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,561
It's what most people use

609
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,060
If they want to change their identity.

610
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:26,261
Thanks  i know that  i've done this once or twice myself.

611
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:27,900
Why doesn't that surprise me?

612
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:31,701
The best lie  the one that's easiest to remember

613
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:34,201
With consistency  is the one that's based on the truth.

614
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,300
Whenever i would do this

615
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,433
I would base it on my own last name.

616
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,931
Bishop. So peter king.

617
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,131
Peter knight.

618
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:40,161
Well  that's a great idea

619
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,903
If your last name is as simple as bishop.

620
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:44,502
What do you do when it's ostler?

621
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:47,601
Is there a computer around here i could use?

622
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:55,560
This is a serial abductor  so she's smart.

623
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,931
She's probably switched cars since then.

624
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:59,661
I want a record of every stolen car

625
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,930
From the last 36 hours.

626
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:26,731
Hey  where does this print?

627
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,062
Thanks.

628
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,333
Every gas station from middletown to rochester.

629
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:32,003
And pull all the credit card receipts.

630
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,130
"ostler"--middle english for "innkeeper."

631
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:37,332
Hold on.

632
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,700
Middle english.

633
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,561
The point is  "innkeeper" got me to hotels

634
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,900
So i cross-indexed last names

635
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:43,201
That match hotels with her first name.

636
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:45,133
Joanne ritz.

637
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:47,803
No photo  just a p.o. Box in clarksburg.

638
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,402
P.o. Box.

639
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,563
Criminals don't really like

640
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:51,703
People like you knowing where they live.

641
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:54,600
Can you expand the grid search

642
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,531
For ben stockton to clarksburg?

643
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:16,602
What is it  ben? What's wrong?

644
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,202
I--

645
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,202
I just-- i don't see it.

646
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,500
It's okay  bean.

647
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,161
You're doing great  honey.

648
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:50,161
I can't.

649
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,361
I don't know how it ends.

650
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:01,263
Mom.

651
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:03,630
No.

652
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,063
Please  i don't want to go away.

653
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,733
Well  that's up to ben  isn't it?

654
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:10,402
Mom.

655
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:12,961
Stop!

656
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,802
What are you doing to her?!

657
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,333
If you lose her again

658
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:18,400
You'll only have yourself to blame.

659
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:20,060
Mom!

660
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm sorry i upset you last night.

661
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,430
Go away.

662
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,933
There's a little boy out there.

663
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:13,100
He's in trouble.

664
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,530
We're his only hope.

665
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:18,532
I don't want to talk about math  walter.

666
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:19,802
Okay  okay.

667
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:22,202
I don't need to talk about the equation.

668
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,063
I need to know about the woman.

669
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,162
Where she took you.

670
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,561
You're wrong.

671
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,101
There was no woman.

672
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,131
Dashiell.

673
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,363
If you don't  the boy...

674
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,861
He'll end up like us.

675
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,501
Walter please.

676
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:46,133
I can't!

677
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:49,163
Yes  you can.

678
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,902
It was so beautiful.

679
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,663
She promised me things.

680
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:04,330
What i wanted most of all.

681
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,432
But when i couldn't solve the equation

682
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,333
She took it away.

683
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:18,963
Everything she promised.

684
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:21,932
It was all a lie.

685
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,602
None of it was real.

686
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:28,062
She hurt me.

687
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:30,861
She put me in a dungeon.

688
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,233
She filled my mind

689
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,531
With images of the people i loved...

690
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:45,603
And then tortured them  ripping them apart

691
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:47,332
All the while

692
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,762
Trying to suck the answers she wanted

693
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,430
Out of my head.

694
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:55,160
But i couldn't--

695
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:58,901
I couldn't give her what she wanted.

696
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:01,903
Where were you  dashiell?

697
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:03,232
I told you  a dungeon.

698
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,033
No  no  no.

699
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:09,163
Not some fantasy  you nitwit.

700
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:13,132
Where were you really?

701
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:15,802
Dungeon! A dungeon in a red castle!

702
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:17,702
You listen. You answer me.

703
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:22,731
Don't you understand?

704
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,062
No  listen.

705
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:26,931
This is the only way we find him.

706
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:32,233
None of it happened.

707
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:35,800
It was just a dream.

708
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:39,130
Just a bad dream.

709
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:50,461
You're making a terrible mistake.

710
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,103
Despite whatever strings you've managed to pull

711
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:55,133
Your father is not mentally fit

712
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:56,962
To be released from this hospital.

713
00:37:56,965 --> 00:37:58,501
Thanks for the advice.

714
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:00,230
My personal assessment is that he's safer with me

715
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,630
Than he is with you.

716
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:04,161
He may not be the picture of sanity

717
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,631
But yesterday when i saw him come through that door

718
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:06,930
I saw him change.

719
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,200
He was afraid.

720
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,932
So what are you saying?

721
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,933
Are you saying that i somehow

722
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:14,762
Managed to intentionally harm him?

723
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:19,731
Office of homeland security.

724
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,961
How'd you pull this off?

725
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:23,201
Meaning?

726
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,600
Meaning that since you were here last

727
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,732
I learned a little bit about you.

728
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:28,233
Enrolling at m.i.t.

729
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:30,000
Based on fraudulent credentials

730
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,903
Starting businesses and failing

731
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,330
And then running away from the consequences.

732
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:35,161
Do you have a point?

733
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,960
You are not a fit guardian for walter

734
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,602
And i'm going to petition the state

735
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,002
To have him removed from your custody.

736
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:43,401
Excuse me?

737
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,602
Whether you're willing to recognize it or not

738
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:47,063
Walter is a danger--

739
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,362
Both to himself and to others.

740
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:50,801
Then i guess the apple

741
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,633
Doesn't fall far from the tree.

742
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:55,000
'Cause you may think you know what he's capable of

743
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,163
But you have no idea what i'm capable of.

744
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,330
Are you threatening me?

745
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:05,003
I'd like to see my father  now.

746
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,533
Walter?

747
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,660
Are you okay?

748
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:29,532
I'd like to go now.

749
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,631
Of course  we're gonna go right now.

750
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,803
I've--i've failed.

751
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,562
It was all for nothing.

752
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:43,963
Dashiell went on and on

753
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,503
Like an incoherent loon

754
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:51,233
About being taken to dungeons

755
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:53,230
And red castles.

756
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:57,861
Son.

757
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:02,233
Is that what it's like to talk to me?

758
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:04,902
Walter.

759
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,103
Let's go home.


761
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,031
Excuse me  ma'am.

762
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:17,002
I'm special agent francis with the f.b.i.

763
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,403
I was wondering if you'd seen this boy.

764
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:20,332
His name's ben stockton. He's ten years old.

765
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,830
No  i'm sorry. What happened to him?

766
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:25,161
This is dunham.

767
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,800
Hey  it's me.

768
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:28,501
I want you to know he's out.

769
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:30,331
Oh  good!

770
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:31,803
How's he doing?

771
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,161
Yeah  he's okay

772
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,801
But i hope you got a lead there

773
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:36,131
Because this was a total bust.

774
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,401
I'm sorry.

775
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,202
So he wasn't able to connect with dashiell?

776
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:40,601
No  he's taking it pretty hard.

777
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,402
He's beatin' himself up pretty good.

778
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,031
Did he get anything?

779
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:45,502
He just said the guy was babbling on

780
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:48,600
Talking about red castles and dungeons.

781
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:49,930
He did what he could.

782
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,302
I--i'm just glad he's okay.

783
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:52,561
Yeah  me too.

784
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,101
Okay  if any red castles appear

785
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:55,631
I'll let you know.

786
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:56,860
Sure.

787
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:24,832
It's not a drawbridge  but it's close.

788
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:26,131
This place looks like

789
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:27,662
It hasn't been used for a while.

790
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:30,332
It's francis.

791
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,833
Need you to pull up

792
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:33,460
A property search on an address for me.

793
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,402
Charlie. Yeah.

794
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:39,202
I think i found something.

795
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:13,803
Watch yourself.

796
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:09,801
Oh  thank god.

797
00:43:15,438 --> 00:43:16,962
You're going to be okay.

798
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:47,302
Stop!

799
00:43:48,605 --> 00:43:50,463
Put your hands in the air!

800
00:43:59,238 --> 00:44:00,762
You okay?

801
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:02,000
She was just there.

802
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:17,463
Nice to be home  right?

803
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,960
This place is filthy.

804
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:25,331
Did you have a party while i was gone?

805
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,433
No  dad  i didn't have a party.

806
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:30,260
I don't want you

807
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,961
To take this the wrong way

808
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,031
But i need space.

809
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:39,233
Sorry to spring this on you so suddenly

810
00:44:39,237 --> 00:44:43,461
But these quarters are very cramped.

811
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:46,361
I think i am ready for my own room.

812
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,432
That's--that's not a problem.

813
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:51,060
I can talk to olivia tomorrow

814
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,330
About getting you some on-campus housing.

815
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:55,500
That would be very beneficial.

816
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,001
You know  what you did

817
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,403
By going back into that place

818
00:45:00,408 --> 00:45:02,502
Was very  very brave  walter.

819
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:10,702
Thank you  son.

820
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:28,920
Got it.

821
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:39,560
Now let's see if it really does what you said it would.

822
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:56,963
Where's the equation?

823
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:06,401
Seems crazy

824
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:07,960
That some numbers

825
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:09,830
Can make a machine like this work.

826
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,801
Look around your house

827
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:13,260
Your office  your kitchen--

828
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:15,931
Numbers make everything work.

829
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:20,460
Here we go.

830
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:58,671
It worked.

831
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:02,003
That's incredible.

832
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:16,901
It worked.

833
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:20,703
Ben  are you hungry?

834
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,861
'Cause there's a vending machine in the hall

835
00:47:22,865 --> 00:47:24,202
And i've got a roll of quarters.

836
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:26,063
No  i'm okay. Thanks.

837
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:27,631
Sure? Mm-hmm.

838
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,561
Ben?

839
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:31,060
Dad?

840
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:31,353
Ben?

841
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:32,303
Dad!

842
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:40,500
Release forms.

843
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:42,532
As soon as he signs  they're free to go.

844
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,601
Yeah  oh--we should maybe just  uh

845
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:48,101
Let them have a minute.

846
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:50,062
I really need to call peter and walter.

847
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:52,230
After what walter went through

848
00:47:52,238 --> 00:47:54,432
He'll be happy to know that ben's all right."

849
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,330
Good work.
