1
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,485
Through this holy anointing,

2
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,933
may the lord and his love and mercy,

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,517
help you with the grace
of the holy spirit.

4
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:29,820
May the lord who frees you
from sin save you

5
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,449
and in his goodness raise you up.

6
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:41,737
Are you ready?

7
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:08,863
Time of death,

8
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,528
5:21 a.m.

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,531
We have a team assembled
and waiting.

10
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,612
Ms. Donovan, I'm afraid we need
to begin the procedures right away.

11
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,711
I love you.

12
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,846
We gotta hurry up.
Core temp's dropped.

13
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,510
- Where's the list?
- Here.

14
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,770
- Watch your back, sir.
- Get her to harvest.

15
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,335
We'll be able to coordinate
that with the transplant team.

16
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,085
Great. Do we have a time frame?

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,125
Not yet.

18
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:54,595
Lean it over.

19
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,901
I'm gonna begin with the kidneys.

20
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:04,016
The heart and lung block
are gonna come last.

21
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,774
- Clamping off the renal artery now.
- Yes, doctor.

22
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,769
All right, I've got the first one.

23
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,302
Oh my God, she's alive!

24
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,098
- Get a trauma team in here.

30
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,290
<i>Bon épisode...</i>

31
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:52,247
The girl's name is Lisa Donovan.
She's a high school junior.

32
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,686
She collapsed during gym class last week
and slipped into a coma.

33
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,718
Doctors diagnosed
a cerebral aneurysm.

34
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,552
After she was determined brain-dead,

35
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,951
her mother made the decision
to take her off life support.

36
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,039
And then she woke up from the dead,
screaming random numbers.

37
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:07,357
This is Lieutenant Commander Turlough,
United States Navy.

38
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,954
He's here because it turns out
those numbers weren't random.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,142
They're an alphanumeric code.

40
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,917
The lead surgeon did two tours
on an aircraft carrier.

41
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,336
He recognized one section
as lineal identification

42
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,739
for sailors in the US Navy.

43
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,338
That's when I got the call.

44
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:23,139
The first half of the sequence
is ID information

45
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,621
for a petty officer
named Andrew Rusk.

46
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,562
Second half of the sequence
are launch codes for ICBM missiles

47
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:31,118
aboard a nuclear submarine
he was stationed on,

48
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:32,545
the USS Gloucester.

49
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,398
How did classified launch codes get
into the hands of a 17-year-old girl?

50
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:38,588
Exactly.
That's what I want to ask Rusk.

51
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:41,362
If he's revealing these codes,
he's committing high treason.

52
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,557
When I tried contacting him, his wife
told me she reported him missing.

53
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,967
- That was three days ago.
- Just to ask the obvious,

54
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:50,343
you've considered the possibility of
a connection between Rusk and the girl?

55
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:51,730
None that we're aware of.

56
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,007
As far as we can tell,
there's never been any contact

57
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:56,235
between Lisa Donovan
and Andrew Rusk.

58
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,562
Well, I suppose
that's where we come in.

59
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,121
So how is she?

60
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,177
Scared, as you can imagine.

61
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,234
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,871
I've never seen him before.

63
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,580
The numbers that you repeated,

64
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,128
do you know what they are,
or do you remember hearing them before?

65
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,717
I don't even remember saying them.

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,596
Well, at least they got
you some nice balloons.

68
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,209
I guess they couldn't find ones
that said "welcome back from the dead."

69
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,103
I imagine those would be more
of a special-order kind of thing.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,523
Lisa, I just have
a couple more questions.

71
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,359
The man's name is Andrew Rusk.

72
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:39,815
Does that ring any bells?

73
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:48,203
- What's happening?
- She's speaking Russian.

74
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,955
But she doesn't speak Russian.

75
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,417
Lisa?

76
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,864
Are you okay?

77
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:55,790
Mom.

78
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:02,033
- What's happening to me?
- I don't know. But you're fine now.

79
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:04,068
No more questions, please.

80
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,501
She should rest.

81
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,916
Of course.

82
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:14,021
Rusk is fluent in Russian.

83
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,435
He would have learned it
during his training.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,328
Any idea what little star is?

85
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,735
<i>Maya Zvezdochka</i> means
little star in Russian.

86
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,927
I dated a Russian girl for a while.

87
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,195
Most of what I picked up
was curse words, but...

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,397
Where's Walter?

89
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,396
I'm trying to listen.

90
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:49,556
Listening to what? These people
are in comas. They can't talk to you.

91
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,822
Don't judge him.

92
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:53,662
He's my son.

93
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,522
And despite his narrow-mindedness,
I'm quite proud.

94
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,114
Do you honestly think
you're communicating with her?

95
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,359
Why shouldn't I be?

96
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:04,780
No one truly understands
the nature of human consciousness.

97
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,534
I've read documented cases
of coma patients waking up and claiming

98
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,158
that they had moved, spirit-like,

99
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,309
to remote locations
and witnessed events

100
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,594
they couldn't possibly
have knowledge of.

101
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,203
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

102
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,679
if that's what's happened to
the young lady we just saw.

103
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:23,831
So...

104
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,766
You're saying that you think,
while Lisa Donovan died for a moment,

105
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,662
her spirit,

106
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:33,654
somehow left her body
and floated over Andrew Rusk

107
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,770
while he was in the process of telling
somebody else those secret launch codes.

108
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:41,442
"Floated over"
is a tad specific, but...

109
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,694
something like that, yes.

110
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,530
- It's a theory.
- It certainly is.

111
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,096
Hi.

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,907
Agent Dunham, I apologize
if I was rude earlier.

113
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,064
How is she?

114
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,928
They don't have any answers,
and now she's running a fever.

115
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:13,508
They want to run more tests.

116
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:19,591
We got into a fight
the morning she collapsed.

117
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,045
I wouldn't let her take the car.

118
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,528
All she has is a learner's permit.

119
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:31,700
And then I got the call from school.

120
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:35,102
But by the time I got to the hospital,
she was in a coma.

121
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,233
You know, I never
thought that I would...

122
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,721
get a chance to tell her
how much I loved her again.

123
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,856
God gave her back to me.

124
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,526
Your daughter's been through a lot.

125
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:06,651
And...

126
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,550
so have you.

127
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:15,911
I want permission to have
Dr. Bishop examine her.

128
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,292
What for?

129
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,845
I think he can help her.

130
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,663
I think it might help find
Andrew Rusk.

131
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,118
There's nothing more
that she can tell you.

132
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,331
He was here.

133
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:54,768
That man.

134
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,381
He was here.

135
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,496
Andrew Rusk, the man in the picture.

136
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,332
He was here.

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,630
I saw him.

138
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,430
We searched the hospital for Rusk,
got nothing.

139
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,819
And Maureen Donovan won't
let us near her daughter.

140
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:15,100
She said that our disruptive presence
is what caused Lisa to hallucinate

141
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,882
seeing Rusk's image in the mirror.

142
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,951
How she explain her kid
speaking Russian?

143
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:21,226
Knowing ICBM launch codes?

144
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,065
I was asked to come in.

145
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,099
I'm Teresa Rusk.

146
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:32,738
Do you know this girl?

147
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,730
I don't think so.

148
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:36,647
Why, who is she?

149
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Her name's Lisa Donovan.
She's from Brighton.

150
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:42,623
You think she had something to do with
my husband's disappearance?

151
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,041
We're not sure.

152
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,166
But she...

153
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,921
has some information
that only your husband should know.

154
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,130
Information?

155
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,098
Classified military codes.

156
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:01,141
Do the words <i>Maya Zvezda</i>
mean anything to you?

157
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,335
Where did you hear that?

158
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,854
From Lisa Donovan.
Do you know what it means?

159
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:07,888
"My star."

160
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
It's a...

161
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,026
pet name Andy calls me.

162
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,489
I don't understand.
Who is this girl?

163
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,357
How could she know that?

164
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,492
How?

165
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,497
Lisa Donovan's aneurysm occurred
in her left frontal lobe.

166
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,066
Specifically her Broca's area.

167
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,638
That's the part of the brain
that processes language.

168
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:31,755
Precisely. But it also has
the capacity for something

169
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,423
far more intriguing.

170
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,094
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.</i>

171
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,219
<i>This...</i>

172
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,237
<i>is test subject number six.</i>

173
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,848
What happened to
subjects one through five?

174
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:44,768
I believe the university
settled with them out of court.

175
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,977
They probably never had
to work again.

176
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:48,272
Not that they could.

177
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,358
I was asked to design an experiment

178
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,528
to test whether cranial manipulation

179
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,030
could increase a person's
psychic capability.

180
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,409
I applied electrical stimuli
to various parts of the brain

181
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,619
and measured each psychic response.

182
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,038
The point is that my tests proved

183
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,856
that manipulation of Broca's area
had the most dramatic effect

184
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:12,170
on a person's ability
to create psychic bonds.

185
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,923
So you think Lisa Donovan's
aneurysm made her psychic.

186
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,964
- It's certainly a possibility.
- Let's say that you're correct.

187
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,013
Why would she be channeling Rusk?
What's so special about him?

188
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,682
That's a good question.

189
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,540
Walter, can you prove
any of what you're saying?

190
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,061
About her being psychic?

191
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,858
Perhaps, if I could examine the girl,
but you say her mother has refused that.

192
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,070
After watching Walter's scariest
home videos, who can blame her?

193
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,933
- How are you feeling?
- I've been really tired, but,

194
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,303
good, I guess.

195
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,562
What are you doing here,
Agent Dunham?

196
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,567
We think might have found
an explanation for what happened

197
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,650
- to Lisa in the hospital.
- Really?

198
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,146
We believe that Andrew Rusk...

199
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,740
may be trying
to communicate through you,

200
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:23,323
psychically.

201
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:26,161
We're not sure how or why, but,

202
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,878
it seems that there's a connection

203
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:32,000
that's been developed
between him and your daughter.

204
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,558
Give agent Dunham and me
a minute alone, please.

205
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,006
Lisa, I want

206
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,124
to introduce you to somebody.

207
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,225
Are you a religious woman,
Agent Dunham?

208
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,186
- No. I'm not.
- Then I imagine

209
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,704
you sit in judgment
of those of us who rely on our faith

210
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,650
to guide our decisions about what's

211
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,702
best for our loved ones.

212
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,126
I know what faith can mean
to a person.

213
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,452
I also believe
that what's happening to Lisa is real,

214
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,593
and if Rusk is a
national security risk...

215
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,260
Whatever happened, Agent Dunham,

216
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:13,911
it's over now.

217
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,245
And I believe what's best for Lisa

218
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,332
is that she put
all of this behind her.

219
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,090
Here's my card.

220
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,296
If anything else comes up.

221
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:42,900
The Tibetan book of the dead?

222
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,198
Walter's been reading up
on psychic connections.

223
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,319
In the Tibetan teachings,
the near-death experiencer

224
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:52,852
can often converse
with those who have already died.

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,901
What do you think?

226
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,795
Well...

227
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,340
I think it makes a hell
of a coaster.

228
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,759
What do I think about
what happened to Lisa?

229
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,305
I don't think she's alive
because God changed his mind.

230
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:14,352
I'm just waiting to see
if lightning strikes you.

231
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,593
Who am I to say? Maybe
there is actually something to it.

232
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,977
People are free to believe
whatever they want, right?

233
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,761
Lisa's mother certainly does.

234
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,899
However, until I see
it with my own eyes,

235
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:28,783
I'm gonna put my money
on healthy skepticism.

236
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,051
You're obviously a believer.

237
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,929
My mother believed in God, but,
all the praying in the world

238
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,676
didn't stop my stepfather
from terrorizing her.

239
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,330
And her faith just seemed
to put her in harm's way.

240
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,555
I'm worried.

241
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:53,563
Lisa's motheris going
to do the same thing.

242
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:01,995
<i>It's Lisa Donovan.</i>

243
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:04,486
Are you okay?

244
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,196
<i>It hasn't stopped.</i>

245
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,416
</i>I'm seeing him again, Andrew Rusk.<i>

246
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,957
Where's your mother?

247
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,932
<i>She's at home, but I'm not.</i>

248
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:16,057
<i>I had to come here.
I keep seeing this place.</i>

249
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,749
Okay, where are you?

250
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:24,985
Where are you?

251
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,354
You all right?

252
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,023
He was here.

253
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,692
Who was here?

254
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:46,903
I can see him.

255
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,280
Andrew Rusk.

256
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,782
There's someone else.
Another man.

257
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,620
He has a gun.

258
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,496
- Lisa?
- He shot him.

259
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,593
He killed him.
He killed Andrew Rusk.

260
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,961
Lisa, do you know the other man?

261
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,947
Did you see his face?

262
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,343
But you're sure that they...
that they were here.

263
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:15,515
Found a .9 millimeter shell casing.

264
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,568
Here you go.

265
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:24,608
Not the most stylish, I know,
but it will keep you warm.

266
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,320
So I just talked to your mother,
and she is on her way here.

267
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,773
Is she mad?

268
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,365
She's just glad that you're okay.

269
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,679
What is it?

270
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,630
Why don't we just
stay here for a second?

271
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,834
Come get in the car.
You can get warm.

272
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,830
It's Andrew Rusk.

273
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:52,151
Your girl was right.

274
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,183
Olivia, I need some help!

275
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,538
What happened?

276
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:03,213
I don't know.
She just started to seize.

277
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,655
I just talked
to the medical examiner.

278
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,964
He confirmed that Rusk was killed
by a bullet wound to the head.

279
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,636
Ruled out suicide.

280
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,120
So everything Lisa told us pans out.

281
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,481
Except one thing.
According to the rigor of the body,

282
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,376
Rusk has been dead for three days.

283
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,993
Well, then, how would he have been
communicating with Lisa Donovan?

284
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,833
Was the medical
examiner more specific?

285
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,468
About the time of death, I mean.

286
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,470
Between 5:00 and 7:00 a.m.

287
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,517
- Why?
- Interesting.

288
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,225
How is she?

289
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,768
Your daughter suffered
a fairly substantial seizure.

290
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,924
Oh, my God.

291
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,563
But she's responsive now,
and her condition is stable.

292
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,046
She's lucky.

293
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:49,442
I don't think there's gonna
be any permanent damage.

294
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,277
Is this because of her aneurysm?

295
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,405
No, there's no connection
between the two.

296
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,505
I don't understand.

297
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,418
You said she was fine,
but she keeps getting sicker.

298
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,229
What's causing this?

299
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:03,133
We'll run some tests,
but, with seizures,

300
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,333
the cause is often unknowable.

301
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,824
You mean...

302
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,828
this could happen again?

303
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,715
We just don't know.

304
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,154
But you should be able
to see Lisa soon.

305
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,135
Excuse me.

306
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,768
What time did your daughter's
resurrection take place?

307
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,186
Her resurrection?

308
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,855
Just after 5:00 in the morning.

309
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,406
Exactly as I suspected.

310
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,763
- What are you thinking?
- I propose...

311
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,034
that Rusk's murder and Lisa's
rebirth happened simultaneously.

312
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,138
In fact, it was his
suddenly dispatched energy

313
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:45,113
which jumpstarted the girl's body

314
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:47,333
- and brought her back to life.
- That's absurd.

315
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,353
Perhaps it is.

316
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,498
Please allow me a moment
to entertain my fantasies.

317
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,184
They often lead to a truth.

318
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,162
It's possible that Rusk's energy

319
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,446
brought some
of his memories with it.

320
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:15,779
And it is these memories trapped
within her, fighting to get out.

321
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,161
Are you suggesting that Lisa is...

322
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:19,767
possessed?

323
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,889
I wasn't.

324
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,460
But now that you mention it,

325
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,252
I wouldn't be surprised

326
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,750
if numerous possessions were

327
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,922
in fact misdiagnosed cases

328
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,129
of a phenomenon we are
just now discovering.

329
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,507
- I think that's what's happened here.
- You hardly would

330
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,510
because the church doesn't approve
of exorcism anymore.

331
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,553
No, because they are
merely superstition...

332
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,352
because there are examples
of casting out spirits

333
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,383
right through the Bible, father.

334
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:46,768
Can you help her?

335
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,938
- Maureen, what are you doing?
- I have been praying,

336
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,106
hoping that...

337
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,722
Lisa will get better.

338
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,735
But she's not.

339
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,788
If what you're saying is true,

340
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,365
and this man's memories
are making Lisa sick,

341
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:01,897
can you...

342
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,219
can you get these memories out?

343
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,455
Can you help my daughter?

344
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,089
I will need to have your daughter
transferred to my lab.

345
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,313
Are you sure an exorcism
is gonna work, Walter?

346
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,190
No, not at all.

347
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,797
Unfortunately, I think I'm wrong.
I can't explain the seizures.

348
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,537
I believe that Rusk's energy
would reanimate the girl

349
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:36,691
and carry his memories, but...

350
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,657
It doesn't suggest why she's sick.

351
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,620
I was just so angry the
way that man challenged me.

352
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,426
Walter, her mother is about to
check her out of the hospital.

353
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,583
I have no idea what I'm
going to do with her.

354
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,956
We got to go in there and tell her.

355
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,295
Olivia. What are you thinking?

356
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:07,765
If Rusk is sick, could
that make Lisa sick too?

357
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:09,363
What, like...

358
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,021
his illnesses would be transferred
along with his spirit?

359
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:14,909
You want to know what I think,

360
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:17,066
- or what Walter would think?
- Either.

361
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:19,348
Well, you read Rusk's file.

362
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,722
Is there anything in there
to suggest that he was sick?

363
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:25,199
But that was the navy's
official medical records.

364
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,739
Well, you know me.

365
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:30,541
If you tell me the US Government
is covering something up,

366
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,450
I'll tell you it must be Tuesday.

367
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,920
Commander Turlough,

368
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:39,025
thank you for coming
back to talk to me.

369
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,123
Not a problem.

370
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,110
I was already here
when agent broyles told me

371
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,594
you found Andy Rusk's body.

372
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,971
Listen, why didn't you
tell me he was sick?

373
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,140
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,270
Who told you that?

375
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:56,701
You did.

376
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,559
Just then.

377
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,611
What was wrong with him?

378
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,072
Was it something that happened
onboard the Gloucester?

379
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:10,440
A young girl's life is on the line.

380
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,958
They were shadowing
a Russian naval exercise

381
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,017
in North Korean
waters six months ago

382
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,591
when a coolant line broke,
causing a reactor leak.

383
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,751
Rusk was locked in the engineering
section for 16 hours

384
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:29,305
before they were able
to vent the contamination.

385
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,646
Radiation.

386
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,267
How could he possibly have survived?

387
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,216
He was airlifted to pearl harbor,

388
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,941
where he was given a highly
experimental radiation inhibitor.

389
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,706
He's been on medical
leave since the accident.

390
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm gonna need his medical records.

391
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,281
The real ones.

392
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,748
We can't keep stalling, Dr. Bishop.

393
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,122
You can't think of anything to do?

394
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:03,810
Maybe I could tell them that
my stomach is troubling me.

395
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,922
That is not what I mean.

396
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,730
Walter, I have Rusk's
medical file here.

397
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,419
Does any of that mean
anything to you?

398
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,075
"Radiation poisoning."

399
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,660
That's why she had the seizure.

400
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:23,159
The radiation and the synthetic
treatments they gave him.

401
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,530
I'd wager that's what kept
his energy from dispersing.

402
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:30,283
And you think that's how
he was able to inhabit Lisa.

403
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,661
Which means we need more drugs.

404
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,020
To...

405
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,779
calm Lisa's conscious mind.

406
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,259
To relax her brain.

407
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,143
Which should enable Mr.
Rusk's mental energy...

408
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:45,381
his memories... to slowly

409
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,176
- and painlessly leave her mind.
- What kind of drugs?

410
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,594
Benzodiazepine.

411
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,138
It's a hypnotic sedative.

412
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,683
May cause a slight tingling sensation.
It's actually quite pleasant.

413
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,426
Besides, your daughter is 17.

414
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm sure she's sampled
far worse by now.

415
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,329
Agent Farnsworth,
prepare an IV drip,

416
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,489
100 Mikes to begin per liter.

417
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:11,316
This is just gonna make
you a little sleepy.

418
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,224
So are you, like, a doctor?

419
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:17,138
But I promise you this won't hurt.

420
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,458
It's okay.

421
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,058
It's kind of nice to have
someone not afraid of me.

422
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:22,251
What do you mean?

423
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,480
Well, my friends at church.

424
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,717
When I walked past them, I could feel
them talking about me behind my back.

425
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,387
Kids at school are even worse.

426
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:36,641
Ever since what's happened, they think
I'm, like, a freak or something.

427
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,017
Well, I don't think you
have to worry about us here.

428
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,978
We're kind of partial
to freaks in this lab.

429
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:49,188
- How's it going?
- It's smashing.

430
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,448
Gene agrees with me,
don't you, Gene?

431
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,701
So is agent Dunham,
like, your girlfriend?

432
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,914
No.
She's like a friend who's a girl.

433
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,777
And who carries a gun.

434
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,490
Walter, Astrid told me that
you think you may be able

435
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:08,506
to extract Rusk's thoughts
from Lisa's brain.

436
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,092
- I believe so. Yes.
- Okay, well, if that's the case,

437
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,849
do you think that she would
have access to his memories?

438
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:16,264
Maybe describe his last moments.

439
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:19,183
Oh, you... you want
to find out who killed him.

440
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:22,878
Well.

441
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,862
Well, let's see, shall we?

442
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:31,240
Strap Lisa down, please.

443
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,341
- Are straps really necessary?
- It's just a precaution.

444
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,733
Just tell me if they're
too tight, all right?

445
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:39,412
How are you feeling, Lisa?

446
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,225
My toes are beginning
to tingle and...

447
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:43,708
Oh, that's good.

448
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,440
That means it's working.

449
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,628
Dr. Bishop, we're at 6 hertz.

450
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,426
Increase the drip 2 mikes, please.
Done.

451
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,847
I don't think I like how this feels.

452
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,439
- Lisa, it's okay.
- No.

453
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:04,520
- No, I think I want this to stop.
- Maybe we should slow this down.

454
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,461
You know what, Lisa, this is
actually normal. It's okay. Just relax.

455
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,879
I'm gonna be right here.
You're safe. Lisa, just...

456
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,663
just close your eyes.

457
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:15,226
Close your eyes.

458
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,533
This is going to help you.
Now breathe.

459
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,035
Breathe deeply.

460
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,944
Just let it go, Lisa.

461
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:22,125
Let it go.

462
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,898
It's Agent Dunham.
Can you hear me?

463
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,845
Hi.

464
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,432
I want you to think
about Andrew Rusk.

465
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,294
Look, look, look.
This is surprising.

466
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,358
Surprising good or surprising bad?

467
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,493
Lisa! She's seizing!

468
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,613
No, she's not.

469
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,491
You've gotta stop this right now.

470
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,701
I'm afraid we have to
let it run its course.

471
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:03,108
Where am I?

472
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,539
Lisa. It's mom.
I'm right here.

473
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,391
Who... is...

474
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:10,378
- Lisa?
- Why is she talking this way?

475
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,162
Because I believe

476
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:15,091
this is not your daughter
speaking any more.

477
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,548
What's wrong with my daughter?

478
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,683
Appears that my hypothesis...

479
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:28,645
Lisa's mind was harboring
Mr. Rusk's memories was wrong.

480
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,398
It would seem more likely

481
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,359
that Mr. Rusk's entire consciousness
was transferred to Lisa.

482
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:34,944
His consciousness.

483
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:36,362
Perhaps his soul.

484
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,183
Well, then where is Lisa?

485
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:41,909
Merely suppressed.

486
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,053
Asleep in her own mind.

487
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,830
I want this stopped.

488
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,958
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- What do you mean you can't?

489
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,876
We can't stop the experiment.

490
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,455
The drugs have taken effect.

491
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,646
We must let the experiment
complete the system.

492
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,968
Listen, let's go out and
get some air, Miss Donovan.

493
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,864
- I can't leave her.
- Miss Donovan,

494
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:00,922
you have asked me to help.

495
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,805
Please let me do my work.

496
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,188
- I can't lose her again.
- I understand.

497
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,410
She's going to be fine.

498
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:25,634
Can I talk to him?

499
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,848
To Rusk?

500
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,052
I hope so.

501
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:32,152
Maybe the only way to coax him out.

502
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,132
My name is Olivia.
Do you know your name?

503
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,595
I believe that somebody hurt you
and I want to find out who that was.

504
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,138
Let me go!

505
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,431
Andrew. Andrew.

506
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,457
Who killed you? Who did this to you?

507
00:28:58,282 --> 00:28:59,820
I called my wife.

508
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,989
Told her I was getting a beer.

509
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,248
There was someone in my car.

510
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,128
In the back seat.

511
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,289
Told me

512
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:12,281
"pull over here."

513
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:14,911
"Get out."

514
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:17,998
"Walk."

515
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,758
"I said walk!"

516
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,211
"Get on your knees!"

517
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,844
I'm not going out like that.

518
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,321
Let me go!

519
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,936
Andrew. Andrew!

520
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,145
Who killed you?

521
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,516
Give me a name.

522
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,253
Don't know his name.

523
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,114
Just...

524
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:44,964
His blood.

525
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,393
His left arm.

526
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:56,085
Peter, turn off the drip.

527
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:58,872
Okay, I'm gonna call
the local hospitals

528
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,922
and see if anybody's gone
in with an injured left arm.

529
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,131
She's coming out of it!

530
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:24,825
Hi.

531
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:27,497
Did it work?

532
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:29,712
Is he gone?

533
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,466
It's her.

534
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,990
Let's get you out of this.

535
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:36,769
We got a hit.

536
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:38,512
Jake Selleg, age 36,

537
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,365
walked into a Roxbury
ER three nights ago.

538
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,174
Lacerations on his left arm.

539
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,801
You know, Liv, Jake Selleg

540
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,508
was navy too, okay?

541
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:49,908
Now, he trained with seal team six.

542
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,510
That's counter terrorism.

543
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,601
That can't be a coincidence.
Is he local?

544
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,099
He works at a boxing gym
in Dorchester.

545
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:57,999
Okay. Can you send me the address?

546
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:00,129
- Sending it now.
- I'll meet you there.

547
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,188
On my way.

548
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,616
That's it. Nice. Nice cross.

549
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,868
'Scuse me. FBI.

550
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:16,134
I'm Agent Dunham.
This is Agent Francis.

551
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,072
We're looking for a Jake Selleg.

552
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,084
Lisa, there's no need
for you to be looking at that.

553
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,402
This is him.

554
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:10,963
Rusk.

555
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,494
Astrid's on her way back
right now with your mom.

556
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,528
Hopefully, you'll be able
to put all this behind you

557
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:21,467
in life and get back to normal soon.

558
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:24,733
Can I have something
to drink, please?

559
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,374
Of course.

560
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,477
Guessing you want something
other than fresh cow's milk.

561
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,957
I'll be right back.

562
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,681
You drink all the cream sodas again?

563
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:57,236
What's wrong?

564
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,447
Lisa's brain scan.

565
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,333
I think she's still sleeping.

566
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,214
Maybe you should take
a look out in the lab.

567
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:07,860
Well, her brain waves...

568
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,489
it appears that her signal
is still being masked

569
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,495
by Rusk's dominant pattern.

570
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:16,287
Rusk is still in control.

571
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,833
Where is she?

572
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,383
Where's my daughter?

573
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,183
This is a slug we pulled
from Andrew Rusk's head.

574
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:42,902
Our ballistic unit's
matching it as we speak

575
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,503
from the .9 millimeter
we found in your apartment.

576
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:47,341
I guess the navy did a poor job

577
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,593
training you to clean
up after your work.

578
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,239
Who ordered you to kill Andrew Rusk?

579
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,371
Was he threatening to go public
over the meltdown on the gloucester?

580
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:03,521
Did the navy
have you kill Andrew Rusk?

581
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:08,258
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

582
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,114
I spent seven years in the navy
and I never killed a man.

583
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,928
But Andrew Rusk deserved it.

584
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,556
What do you mean he "deserved it"?

585
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,741
For what that bastard
did to his wife.

586
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:32,092
Rusk's wife.

587
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:35,065
What does this have to do with her?

588
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,342
I hang out at a bar she tends at.

589
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,117
She told me about Andy.

590
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:41,484
How he beats on her.

591
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,329
One day she came in
with a broken arm.

592
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,321
She couldn't deal with it any more.

593
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:52,256
No one should have
to live like that.

594
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:54,842
Teresa Rusk hired you
to kill her husband?

595
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:01,912
In the scrapyard,
he kept asking me "Why me?"

596
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:08,265
I pulled the trigger,

597
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,292
but I made sure that I told him

598
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,818
that it was Teresa
who was sending him to hell.

599
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,261
You said that to Rusk?

600
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,574
Before you killed him, you
told him his wife hired you?

601
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:23,077
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,855
Why didn't Rusk tell us that?

603
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,580
He told us everything else.
Why not that?

604
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:46,056
Rusk is still controlling Lisa
<i>and she's gone.</i>

605
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:48,854
I think I know where he's going.

606
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,316
<i>Rusk's wife had him killed.
I think he's going for revenge.</i>

607
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,743
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

608
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,869
Maya Svyozdichka.

609
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:08,259
What did you say to me?

610
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,002
How did you know to call me that?

611
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,315
You're... you're that girl.

612
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,510
You get out of here.
I have a gun.

613
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,678
Upstairs.

614
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
In a safe.

615
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:25,684
This gun...

616
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,812
That I got you from the service.

617
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:31,934
How do you...

618
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:34,817
I don't understand.

619
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,990
Well, neither do I.

620
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,228
But I've been given a second chance.

621
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:43,123
And I'm sure as hell
not going to waste it.

622
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:45,913
Now get down on your knees.

623
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,791
Don't do this.

624
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,165
Please!

625
00:36:58,452 --> 00:36:59,852
You had me killed.

626
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,468
Put down like a dog.

627
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:03,720
I want to hear you say it.

628
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,557
I didn't have you killed.
I don't know what you're talking about!

629
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,476
That's the thing about being
with someone for 20 years,

630
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,228
you know when they lie,

631
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,847
how they lie.

632
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,432
Admit what you did.

633
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,317
Don't.

634
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:23,821
- <i>It's me. Where are you?</i>
- We're five minutes out.

635
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:25,705
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm just pulling up.</i>

636
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,345
Please don't do this.

637
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:35,999
Please!

638
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,111
Admit that you had me killed.

639
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:40,377
Don't you want to die
with a clean conscience?

640
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,135
Please! Don't!

641
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Stop!

642
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,758
Don't do this.

643
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:52,311
I'll give you one chance
to back out of here

644
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:55,939
- or we're all going out together.
- You know I can't do that.

645
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,400
Then you're making a mistake.

646
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:05,949
You don't have to do this.

647
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,951
I already told you to leave once.

648
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,786
I am not gonna tell you again.

649
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:18,503
You know, I understand.

650
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:20,964
What you said back at the lab.

651
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,932
When I was in school,
Lisa, I was different too.

652
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,209
I was always sick.

653
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:31,308
- I didn't have any real friends.
- What the hell are you talking about?

654
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,078
I'm telling you

655
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:35,854
- that I understand, Lisa.
- You got to stop calling me Lisa.

656
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,602
I know what it feels like
to feel different all the time.

657
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:40,814
- I'm gonna count to one.
- Lisa, listen to me.

658
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:43,779
You've been given a second chance here,
but you have to fight for it.

659
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,492
One!

660
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,156
What happened?

661
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:10,134
Well, I'll tell you all about it,
but not right now, okay?

662
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,557
Right now you need to rest.

663
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,172
So they're gonna take you
to the hospital,

664
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:19,189
and get you checked out, and make sure
that everything's okay. And then

665
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:22,025
they'll bring you back to the lab.
And we'll meet you there.

666
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,534
How'd you know it would work,
that you could reach her?

667
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,587
Walter's book of Tibetan philosophy.

668
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:35,194
"Innermost subtle
consciousness is ever present.

669
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,518
It never leaves the body
even in death."

670
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:40,293
You got a lot of
mileage out of a coaster.

671
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:43,505
In other words,
I threw up a hail mary.

672
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:47,982
Perfectly normal.

673
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,595
Singular consciousness.

674
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,037
Lisa's.

675
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,724
Which means he's gone.

676
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:55,576
I believe so.

677
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,295
I would propose that
Mr. Rusk stuck around to

678
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,693
deal with unfinished business.
And once he did, then,

679
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:09,406
Lisa was free
to finally purge herself of him.

680
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:11,742
How can we be sure?

681
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:18,669
<i>Nisi credideritis,</i>

682
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,752
<i>non intelligentis.</i>

683
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:23,545
I don't understand.

684
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:27,487
It's a Latin translation
of Isaiah 7:9.

685
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:30,195
"Unless you believe,

686
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:34,431
you will not understand."

687
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,709
Even as a scientist, sometimes

688
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:42,274
I have to rely on faith.

689
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,027
God keep you
and yours safe, Dr. Bishop.

690
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,024
And you, ma'am.

691
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,236
Come along, Lisa. Time to go home.

692
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:00,768
You all set, sweetheart?

693
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:19,921
Take care.

694
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:31,780
- Thank you again, Agent Dunham.
- It's Olivia. And you're welcome.

695
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:33,709
Thank you.

696
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:35,096
Bye.

697
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,400
I'll be 18 in a year.
Don't wait to long to make your move.

698
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:51,041
Well, the navy officially
denied our request

699
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,510
to launch an investigation
into the USS Gloucester.

700
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,641
Well, there's a shocking surprise.

701
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,377
Thinking about his shipmates,
I shouldn't worry.

702
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:01,926
I suggest that Mr. Rusk's
postmortem adventures

703
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:04,521
will prove to be the
exception rather than the rule.

704
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:06,212
And if not,

705
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:09,736
then we'll go
into the exorcism business.

706
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:13,655
Is it just me or did you detect
a note of excitement in his voice?

707
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,180
'Cause I for one cannot wait
to get that guy out of here.

708
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,064
I'm not getting a pulse on this guy.

709
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,826
<i>Maya Svyozdichka.</i>

710
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,677
What'd he say?

711
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:02,593
I think he's speaking Russian.
