1
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,660
Hey do you need a menu?

2
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,500
You okay?

3
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,360
Do you want some food?

4
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
There's a wicked good vegetable soup.

5
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,760
Hey   give me a soup. onion?

6
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
No   vegetable. no one likes the onion.

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
And call marty   would you?

8
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,730
Marty? how come?

9
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,500
There's some woman here who might be in trouble.

10
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,900
She might need some help.

11
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
Here you go.

12
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,660
Thank you.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,730
I used to love those crackers.

14
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,800
When I was kid

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,200
My mom would always get pissed at me

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,500
Because whenever we went out to eat

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,230
I'd always eat like three packs

18
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,000
Before the food came   and then I'd be stuffed.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,230
What happened there?

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,730
Not that it's any of my business.

21
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,360
I'll leave you alone if you like.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,830
I'm trying to remember.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,830
I was at thurber's.

24
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,400
Hey   marty.

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,200
I'll just have a soda.

26
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,930
How you doing tonight?

27
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,360
You live around here?

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,430
I do. I live in the area.

29
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,800
Haven't seen you around.

30
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,960
I know I was born in boston.

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,660
Oh   yeah? you were born there?

32
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,700
So   uh   where do you live now?

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,330
Where's home?

34
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,730
I don't remember.

35
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,200
They...

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,300
They did things.

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,130
Who did things?

38
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,630
I--

39
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,530
I don't--i don't know.

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,500
They--

41
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,460
They gave me a red medicine.

42
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,130
Yeah?

43
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,460
So   uh   what was the red medicine?

44
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,800
They didn't tell me.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Okay   that's all right.

46
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,130
And   um   a blue one.

47
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,460
There was blue.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,630
They--

49
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,030
They confused me.

50
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,300
They...hurt me   and--

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,930
Ma'am   I think you should come with me.

52
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,230
-No. -I can help you.

53
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,160
No! no   no   no   you're not in any trouble.

54
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,330
No   stop--stop it!

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,330
You need to talk to somebody.

56
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,730
Stop it!

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,800
This is officer pitts. I've got a 5150.

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,200
Can you make sure that hannah's available tonight   please.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,230
Aah! ben.

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,730
Ben!

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,460
I need an ambulance at the diner right away!

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Right now!

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,000
What the hell is this?!

64
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,930
What?

65
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,530
Oh   that doesn't bother you?

66
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,060
Are you kidding?

67
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,860
That man falls asleep

68
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,230
Counting pi to the 101st digit.

69
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,400
That's soothing.

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,830
Walter!

71
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,730
Was I humming?

72
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,360
I thought it was in my head.

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,200
It wasn't.

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,660
Forgive me   olivia.

75
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,800
Nothing sings like a kilovolt.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,260
Unique pitch.

77
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,260
Nothing else in nature quite like it.

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm sure you're right.

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,930
What's up? what's on your mind?

80
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,060
Short fuse today   I guess.

81
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,230
Indeed   the tension in your voice

82
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,200
Indicates that you're carrying a heavy psychic burden.

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,830
Tortured by the depths of some--

84
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,560
Hey   walter   I think she liked it better

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,360
When you were humming.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,260
The incident occurred approximately six hours ago.

87
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,300
All we've been able to determine so far

88
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Is that they were exposed to high levels of radiation.

89
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,130
Emily kramer.

90
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,330
Last night was the first time

91
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,130
Anyone had seen her in two weeks

92
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,160
Since she was reported missing by her parents.

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,230
Police officer inside

94
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,500
Responded to a psych disturbance

95
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,230
Which would explain why we found her in handcuffs.

96
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,760
You think she was a runway?

97
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Her parents say no.

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,530
They say she was perfectly happy.

99
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,730
In fact   she'd just been accepted

100
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,600
To a masters program she was excited about.

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,830
Curiously   the level of radiation

102
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,130
Coming from emily's body

103
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,660
Is almost three times as great as the rest.

104
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,060
Are you saying that she was the source?

105
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,700
Don't know.

106
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
Dr. bishop   any thoughts?

107
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,700
Yes.

108
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,360
Where can I get one of those white suits?

109
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,030
Ah! oh   yeah.

110
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,700
There's no head.

111
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,860
She was sick.

112
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,930
Most like bellini's lymphocemia.

113
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,600
Striped bruising on her neck and upper arms.

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,300
You know what he's talking about?

115
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,900
Bellini's lymphocemia. it's an auto-immune disease.

116
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,130
Irreversible.

117
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,830
The body destroys its own muscles and organs.

118
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,430
Meaning it's fatal. yeah.

119
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,760
Though I've never seen bellini's cause a victim

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,060
To lose her head.

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,500
And what's more curious

122
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,260
The rash appears to be healing.

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,730
Bruises receding.

124
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,500
This woman seems to have been in remission.

125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,530
Cured even.

126
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,560
How do you cure a disease that's incurable?

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I haven't the slightest idea

128
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,630
Though I myself

129
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,260
Once cured this one in a dream.

130
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,930
Opium. fantastic stuff.

131
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,340
Of couse I forgot it as soon as it worked out

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,030
Ugh! thanks for the warning.

133
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,700
121 degrees.

134
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,330
That's counter-indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor.

135
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,730
Most likely water molecules excited all at once.

136
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,600
He means the guy's brain was boiled.

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,460
Like a maine lobster.

138
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,660
I need this body and the headless one

139
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,700
Taken back to my lab.

140
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,530
Walter   her disease. if there's no cure--

141
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,000
Well   that's the question.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
And one which we should pose to whoever was treating her.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,960
Which makes three questions.

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
The other one being   what exactly happened here?

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,030
That's only two questions.

146
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,330
Oh   is it? oh   the third question!

147
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,930
Um   could I get some of this onion soup?

148
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,960
It looks delicious.

149
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,060
Agent dunham?

150
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
Nadim patel. pleasure to meet you.

151
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,560
Thank you   thank you very much

152
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,660
For taking the trouble to talk to me.

153
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,430
Of course.

154
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,900
I've been told you have news about emily kramer.

155
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Unfortunately   I do.

156
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
Emily was found dead last night.

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,600
What? how?

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,030
I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you.

159
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,830
Forgive me. I'm just...

160
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,200
Emotional investment in patients.

161
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,300
It's an occupational hazard.

162
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Her poor parents must be devastated

163
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,830
After everything they've already been through.

164
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,400
Yes   and I hate troubling you about this

165
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,560
But we understand that emily was suffering

166
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
From a fatal disease that had recently gone into remission.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,460
That's right.

168
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,130
Do you have any idea how that's possible?

169
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,700
Medically   no.

170
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,130
Were you treating her

171
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,400
With any sort of radiation therapy?

172
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,460
Radiation? no. why?

173
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,530
The--the circumstances surrounding emily's death

174
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,000
Were unusual.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,400
And it's possible that her condition

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,800
May have been a factor.

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,460
I'll get you her records if that'll help.

178
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,230
Yeah.

179
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,300
She was finally starting to live again.

180
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,530
Do I really need to be here?

181
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,030
Couldn't you just use a clamp?

182
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,300
Of course I could.

183
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
But I enjoy the company.

184
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,830
Quality time   as they say.

185
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah   'cause this is just like

186
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,060
Throwing around the old pigskin.

187
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,130
What's that smell?

188
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,400
Hyacinth   my third favorite flower.

189
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Associated in mythology with rebirth

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,530
Which in this case is cruelly ironic.

191
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,960
It's coming from her?

192
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,460
Indeed   which indicates

193
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,330
Either a mutation of the genetic level

194
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,630
Or she was eating flowers.

195
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,130
Perhaps her perfume.

196
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,260
How's it coming?

197
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,700
Oh   olivia   join us.

198
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,000
We've learned some things already

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
We don't think she ran away.

200
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Ligature marks.

201
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,130
So she was being held against her will.

202
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,360
Either that or she had

203
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
A proclivity for sexual bondage.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,300
Scientific observation   not a judgment.

205
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,730
Some of my fondest memori----

206
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,860
Oh   walter stop.

207
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,700
Wherever that's going is just wrong.

208
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,460
There's also this.

209
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,730
Subcutaneous injection marks.

210
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,630
She was being given medicine intravenously.

211
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,530
So whoever was holding her captive

212
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,200
Was giving her drugs.

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,030
Yes   but not the enjoyable kind.

214
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,230
In fact   quite unlike

215
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,200
Anything I've ever seen before.

216
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,400
You okay?

217
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,830
Should I be?

218
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,300
So how'd she end up in the diner?

219
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,130
Did she escape? perhaps not.

220
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,160
There are two distinct methods

221
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,600
In scientific experimentation.

222
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Lab trials or field trials.

223
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,430
You're suggesting they may have let her go on purpose?

224
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,900
Whoever did this wanted to make sure

225
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,600
What they did to her was working.

226
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,360
So there was something inside her

227
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,930
That killed those people at the diner.

228
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,130
And her--  noggin?

229
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,460
I'm not sure yet.

230
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,660
It's a theory.

231
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,560
Obviously I'll be more certain

232
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,930
Once we identify the substance.  sorry.

233
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,090
Or when whoever did this...

234
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,260
hey   charlie.

235
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,700
Tries to repeat their results.

236
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,130
You mean if they take another woman.

237
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,300
Judging by agent dunham's body language

238
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,800
I'd say she's receiving that very news.

239
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,360
Okay.

240
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,300
Missing persons called in another case four hours ago.

241
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,560
Her name is claire williams.

242
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
She was diagnosed

243
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,030
With bellini's lymphocemia three years ago.

244
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,860
Someone's targeting people with the disease?

245
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,460
That or it's one hell of a coincidence.

246
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,130
Hey   liv.

247
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,860
I get it.

248
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,230
You get what?

249
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,200
Young woman   what was done to her.

250
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,300
You know   this coming your way today of all days.

251
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,260
It's okay.

252
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,630
I'm okay.

253
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,130
Listen   I know you don't like to celebrate

254
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,160
But happy birthday.

255
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,330
Ken williams?

256
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,060
Olivia dunham   charlie francis

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,800
fbi.

258
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,760
Claire. did you find her?

259
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,660
I'm afraid we don't have new information.

260
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,460
But we do need to ask you a few questions.

261
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,830
Her name is emily kramer.

262
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,260
She's suffered from the same disease as your wife.

263
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,530
You seen her before?

264
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,030
Another case?

265
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,960
What--what happened to her?

266
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,100
Do you know her   mr. williams?

267
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,930
No   i-i don't think so.

268
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,000
We don't know anyone else with bellini's

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,100
I mean   what we went through fighting claire's disease.

270
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,260
And the constant pain.

271
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,200
When the lesions started appearing

272
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,530
She stopped going out.

273
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,730
That damn disease almost took everything from us

274
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,860
Even our marriage.

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,030
And then... it was like a miracle.

276
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,100
A miracle?

277
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,260
She started getting better.

278
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,630
The pain went away.

279
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,730
She went into remission?

280
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,460
About six weeks ago.

281
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,030
She was herself again.

282
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,200
And now...

283
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,100
Please find my wife.

284
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,330
Please find her for me.

285
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,660
What's happening?

286
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,960
Please don't hurt me.

287
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,230
The diner was a test. this one counts.

288
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,430
Is she a candidate?

289
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,000
Even better.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,660
Let's get started.

291
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,530
To understand what happened at the diner

292
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,530
We'll use mr. papaya.

293
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,830
Clear!

294
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,900
This is upsetting

295
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,660
Because he's the friendliest of fruits.

296
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,800
And we have goo-ification.

297
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,960
Is that the scientific term?

298
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,630
Wait.

299
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,700
The show's not over yet.

300
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,430
Is that what you think happened to the people in the diner?

301
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,930
That beam emits high energy microwaves

302
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,430
Which cause mr. papaya's molecules

303
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,960
To vibrate rapidly

304
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,730
Causing friction and producing heat.

305
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,900
It's like how a microwave oven cooks food.

306
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,430
Only in emily kramer's case   she was the oven.

307
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,230
But then what killed emily?

308
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,260
This demonstration is far more effective with living tissue.

309
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,800
I have some expendable gerbils in the back. no.

310
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Oh   it's no trouble. I'm sure you'd like it.

311
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,430
Walter   just drop it.

312
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,360
Wait   am I missing something?

313
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,730
How is it that emily is   um   cooking people?

314
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,700
In her blood I found traces of radioactive isotopes.

315
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,030
Strontium 90.

316
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,400
I believe that these microscopic capsules

317
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,260
Are designed to release

318
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,330
Just the right amount of radiation at specific times

319
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,160
To cure her disease.

320
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,960
So you think these capsules saved her life.

321
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,600
Think of it like time-released chemotherapy.

322
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Oh yes   but in emily's case

323
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,700
The cure also made her a perfect candidate

324
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,900
For weaponization.

325
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,630
Whatever was injected into her bloodstream

326
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,300
Caused these capsules to burst all at once

327
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,700
Sending out a microwave blas

328
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,830
And perhaps given her own head

329
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,800
Was the source of energy--kaboom.

330
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,630
So emily's rheumatologist   dr. patel

331
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,530
Would he have access to these sorts of isotopes?

332
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,760
It's doubtful.

333
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,060
They only use them in a couple of therapies

334
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,630
And they're really strictly regulated.

335
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,130
Why?

336
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,330
You think patel had something to do with this?

337
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,700
I don't know.

338
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,460
But 83% of kidnap victims

339
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,530
Are abducted by someone they know.

340
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,900
I'm gonna go and talk to emily kramer's parents.

341
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,560
I'll come with you.

342
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,730
Oh   peter!

343
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,300
If you're going out

344
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,430
Could you bring me back some cotton candy?

345
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,260
Cotton candy. yep.

346
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,530
Blue   not pink.

347
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,130
I've had a craving.

348
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,430
Must be the hyacinths.

349
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,130
Lovely blue flowers.

350
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,560
You're probably way ahead of me on this already

351
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,460
But I'm noticing certain uncomfortable similarities

352
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,660
Between this and some of the other incidents

353
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,730
We've been covering lately.

354
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,200
More humans are being used as guinea pigs.

355
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,630
My points is   if this is part of the pattern

356
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,360
What if these people aren't just experiments?

357
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,300
What if somebody is preparing for something?

358
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,860
Maybe we should come back later.

359
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,360
Before or after they do to claire williams

360
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,730
What they did to emily kramer?

361
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,660
Olivia   this is a wake.

362
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,200
These people are mourning their child.

363
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,260
No.

364
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,630
Don't you need a warrant for this?

365
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey   olivia   stop!

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay   crashing a wake is bad enough

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,230
But rifling through a dead girl's things?

368
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,660
It's the only hope of finding a solid lead

369
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,560
So please help me.

370
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,200
What is it that we're looking for?

371
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,830
Anything   any connection she may have had--

372
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,660
What are you doing in here?

373
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,930
Who are you?

374
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,600
What are you doing in my daughter's room?

375
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Mrs. kramer   we're terribly sorry about your loss.

376
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,130
We're with the fbi.

377
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,900
Fbi? today? you come here today?

378
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,030
Mrs. kramer   please listen to me.

379
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,700
Another girl's life is at stake.

380
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,130
What do you mean? what other girl?

381
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,530
Her name is claire williams. claire?

382
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,260
What's happened to claire?

383
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,100
You know her?

384
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,500
A therapist told her to write through

385
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,530
The pain and the alienation that she felt.

386
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,700
It was all she had until the treatments.

387
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
The treatments? for her bellini's.

388
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,830
Emily and claire both had the disease.

389
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,430
That's how they met. here.

390
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,930
They became such good friends.

391
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,260
Why'd you lie to me   mr. williams?

392
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,300
We met emily at the hospital

393
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,930
Waiting for blood tests.

394
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,100
She and claire started talking

395
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Sharing horror stories about their disease.

396
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,100
They became friends.

397
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,200
One night over dinner   the conversation turned

398
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,730
To how the medical establishment

399
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,100
Had abandoned us.

400
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
See, there's only 3,000 people in this country

401
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,760
who suffer from Bellini's.

402
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,660
Not enough for the drug companies to make a profit.

403
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,100
So they're not looking into developing a cure.

404
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,630
And we started talking to some other people we met

405
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,760
who also had the disease.

406
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,260
A Microbiologist, an Investment Banker,

407
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,760
the mother of a professional Athlete.

408
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,860
Started thinking about what we could do

409
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,700
If we pooled our resources.

410
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,600
So Claire and Emily were treating themselves.

411
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,960
We didn't have a choice.

412
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,400
We were desperate.

413
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,000
We tried radical therapies normal doctors wouldn't touch.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,730
Three months ago we found a cure.

415
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,700
Time-released radioactive capsules.

416
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,730
Yeah.

417
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,060
I don't understand, why lie?

418
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,100
Because the people we love are depending on it.

419
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,860
I couldn't take the chance you'd stop that.

420
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,060
Claire wouldn't want that.

421
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,660
It's what gave us our lives back.

422
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,230
Mr. Williams, we will need

423
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,300
the names of the other patients involved.

424
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,960
I could give you some, but I don't know all of them.

425
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,100
You'll have to ask Dr. Nadim Patel.

426
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,260
Emily's doctor.

427
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
He knew this was going on?

428
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,230
He cared enough to help us.

429
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,060
The medication. Do you have a sample?

430
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,260
Is that my... Bellini's medication?

431
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,000
Just...tell me what you're doing.

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Please just tell me what you're doing to me.

433
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,660
We know all about your disease, Claire.

434
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,160
We know that this...

435
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,860
makes you better.

436
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,130
But this...

437
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,560
This will make you special.

438
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm so tired.

439
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,200
What is this?

440
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,130
When I told you there were unusual circumstances

441
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,300
surrounding Emily's death.

442
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,700
These were the circumstances.

443
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,030
I don't understand.

444
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,230
We know how it worked, Dr. Patel.

445
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,330
Ken Williams told us everything.

446
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,900
What we don't know is who else was involved.

447
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,630
I'm not responsible for this, not this.

448
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,930
-All I do is give them updates.  -Who's they?

449
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,460
-Who's they?  -Intrepus.

450
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,560
-The drug company?  -You should just walk away.

451
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,600
You have no idea who you're dealing with

452
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,660
what they're capable of.

453
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,930
I need a name, Dr. Patel.

454
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,100
Dr. Patel?

455
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,330
Dr. Patel.

456
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,330
-Drop it!  -I swear, it was only supposed to be updates.

457
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,030
Dr. Patel, put the gun on the ground now.

458
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm a doctor, a healer. Do you want a name?

459
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,660
David Esterbrook.

460
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
No!

461
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,000
I found him.

462
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,630
David Esterbrook.

463
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,800
He heads up Intrepus

464
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,930
Pharmaceutical research division.

465
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,300
By all accounts, he's solely responsible

466
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,760
for a guns blazing congressional lobbying campaign

467
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,430
That allowed Intrepus to dig into

468
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,160
some of their more controversial R&D.

469
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,730
Define controversial.

470
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,260
Prenatal gene therapy.

471
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,730
Human-animal hybridization studies.

472
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,560
Viral warfare.

473
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,130
All the fun stuff.

474
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,230
He's in Manhattan today.

475
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,960
He's speaking on a humanitarian aide forum.

476
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,230
Listen, Liv.

477
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,700
Even if the doctor was right

478
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,160
Even if Esterbrook had something to do with

479
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,330
what happened to those women.

480
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

481
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm gonna say he's not gonna confess.

482
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie.

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,260
I need to know it's him.

484
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,630
Mr. Esterbrook?

485
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,460
Sorry to interrupt. Amanda Bennet, Baxil.

486
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,860
Listen, with the risk of sounding sycophantic

487
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,300
I've followed your work since Yale.

488
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,400
Three degrees

489
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,260
Including a PH.D in Medicinal Neurobiology.

490
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,400
I couldn't even get through biochem

491
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,230
without cheating off my roommate.

492
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,330
I'm sorry.

493
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,300
This must sound insanely naive to you.

494
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,300
No, hardly.

495
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
Science and technology has reached a point

496
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,300
where our means are finally catching up

497
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
with our imaginations.

498
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,300
And the only thing preventing us

499
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,930
from doing truly visionary work

500
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,230
are these moral-based restrictions

501
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,130
that lawmakers put up

502
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,760
in the name of public policy.

503
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,330
That and money.

504
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,160
We always need more money.

505
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,600
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Amanda.

506
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,330
It isn't about the money.

507
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,630
It is about the resolve.

508
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,030
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

509
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,900
I don't work for Baxil

510
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,060
But I know a colleague of yours.

511
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,400
Dr. Nadim Patel.

512
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,260
How is Nadim these days?

513
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,530
These days?  Dead.

514
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,730
I'm sorry to hear that.

515
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,230
Not as sorry as I was to watch it happen.

516
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,330
Identify theft is a federal crime, Amanda.

517
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,460
So is kidnapping and murder. And it's agent Dunham.

518
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,760
Tell me what did you hope

519
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,260
to get out of this conversation?

520
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,200
I already got it.

521
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,230
How old are you?

522
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,100
28? 29?

523
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,460
You're an attractive young woman.

524
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
I'm sure you want to start a family one day.

525
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,030
It would be a shame if anything got in your way.

526
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,660
Broyles.

527
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,000
When?

528
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,400
Dunham.

529
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,830
Hey.

530
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,160
I understand you paid a little visit

531
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
to David Esterbrook.

532
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,860
News travels fast.

533
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,300
I was just about to type up the report

534
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,460
In public in a hotel bar.

535
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,130
I didn't realize my interview techniques

536
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,530
Were under such close scrutiny.

537
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,000
Everything we do is under close scrutiny.

538
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,130
This task force that you're now part of

539
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,130
At best it's... controversial.

540
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,630
We need to be perfect.

541
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,960
Trying to intimidate such a high profile suspect

542
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,230
In a murder investigation is reckless at best.

543
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,530
Claire williams is a prisoner right now

544
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,260
Having god know what injected into her body.

545
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,400
And david esterbrook knows where she is.

546
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,730
He's guilty

547
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,160
And he just assumes he'll get away with it.

548
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,930
So excuse me   but right now

549
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,860
I couldn't give a damn about politics.

550
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,960
Which is exactly your problem and now mine.

551
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,500
You think you're the only one

552
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,160
Who wants to find claire williams?

553
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,000
You violated the cardinal law of our profession.

554
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
You let your feelings drive your decision making.

555
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,830
And as a result you've endangered

556
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,060
Not only claire williams' life

557
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,500
But everything we're trying to do here.

558
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,230
If I can't trust you to control your own passion dunham

559
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,500
Then I can't trust you.

560
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,960
Is that clear?

561
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,260
You'll have my report

562
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,600
On the esterbrook interview within the hour.

563
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,960
I'll be waiting.

564
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,060
Is there anything else you'd like me to run past you?

565
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,300
Not anything.

566
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,330
Everything.

567
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,930
How's it going?

568
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,530
She's almost ready.

569
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,000
And the capsules in her blood stream.

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,230
They can be triggered remotely?

571
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,660
Everything's as requested.

572
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,230
She'll be stable and ready for transport by morning.

573
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,560
I'll call the client and schedule delivery.

574
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
Well done

575
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,560
What's happening to me?

576
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,760
How's it going?

577
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,460
It's great.

578
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,660
Esterbrook's our only lead

579
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,760
To where they're holding claire williams

580
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,830
And I can't get to him.

581
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,860
I mean the guy's cleaner than snow.

582
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,260
Not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket.

583
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,630
I think we actually might be making some progress.

584
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,130
Couple minutes ago walter thought he might have

585
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,660
Isolated the compound that's in emily kramer's blood

586
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,860
But then he got distracted

587
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,100
By the unicorn running through the lab.

588
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,460
Funny.

589
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,860
Anything else?

590
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,100
Got any more jokes?

591
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,860
All right something's been bugging you all day.

592
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Something other than claire williams.

593
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,060
And that's okay. you know what?

594
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,900
We're all allowed to have our bad days.

595
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,600
What's not fine is blaming it on me.

596
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
I want to find her just as much as you do.

597
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,530
You're right. I'm sorry.

598
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,200
I...

599
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,530
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Fine.

601
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,860
I had a stepfather.

602
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,700
And when he drank he'd accuse my mom

603
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,100
Of seeing other men and then he'd hit her.

604
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,130
And she just lived with it.

605
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,630
She never called the police not once.

606
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,600
Then one day he beat her really bad

607
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,830
And broke her nose.

608
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,030
I was nine.

609
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,500
Stormed out of the house

610
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,200
Got in his car drove off.

611
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
My mom's crying and I can't help her.

612
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,160
And then I hear his car.

613
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,030
He's turned back around.

614
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,430
He kept a gun in the drawer near his bed.

615
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,630
When he opened the door I pulled the trigger.

616
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,830
Then I pulled it again.

617
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
And I can still see his face

618
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Almost daring me to finish.

619
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,760
But I couldn't.

620
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,760
So...they took him to the hospital

621
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,530
And said that he couldn't be saved

622
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,030
But he didn't die.

623
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,430
He recovered.

624
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,560
Then one night he just slipped away.

625
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,960
We never saw him again.

626
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
And I still blame myself because I should've done it.

627
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
I should've killed him.

628
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,800
And I know that rationally

629
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,030
He is not responsible for all the bad things in the world

630
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,760
But he is responsible for some of them.

631
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,400
And every year he sends me a card on my birthday

632
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,660
Just to let me know...

633
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,760
That he's still out there.

634
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,430
It's your birthday today.

635
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,830
No man is untouchable olivia.

636
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,100
If you really want esterbrook

637
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,900
All you have to do is talk to your friend nina sharp.

638
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,530
Massive dynamic has three separate Pharmaceutical divisions.

639
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,930
They're in direct competition with intrepus.

640
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,430
They're annual budget for corporate espionage

641
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,260
Could feed a mid-size nation.

642
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,560
I guarantee you she has something on david esterbrook.

643
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,500
-but even if you're right I can't go to her  -why not?

644
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,330
Because despite their annual budget

645
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,200
Corporate espionage is wildly illegal.

646
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,430
You really think that she'd admit that to me?

647
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,930
It's here somewhere. I know it is.

648
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,430
I just have to look harder.

649
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,360
I'm going out.

650
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,260
Okay.

651
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,030
peter!

652
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,060
To be honest I didn't even know you were here.

653
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,360
Thank you.

654
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Excuse me. ms.sharp.

655
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm peter

656
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
Peter bishop. walter bishop's son.

657
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,900
You're not the only one who's done their homework.

658
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,160
What can I do for you mr. bishop?

659
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,400
I was hoping I could take a moment of your time.

660
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,800
Does ms. dunham know you're here?

661
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,330
No   no   she doesn't know I'm here.

662
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,900
Well   peter

663
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,560
Suppose we take a walk.

664
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,800
You're suggesting that intrepus is conducting

665
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,000
Illegal drug trials with human beings.

666
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,260
That is a rather bold claim to make   mr. bishop.

667
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,700
How are you able to substantiate

668
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,160
Your information?

669
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,630
Would you put it past them?

670
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,000
Let's assume for a second that what I'm saying is true.

671
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,230
Hmm. where would they do it?

672
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,400
They wouldn't risk using

673
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
One of their own testing facilities.

674
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,260
It'd have to be some place off the grid.

675
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,730
You know   you still look just the same

676
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,760
As you did when you were a child.

677
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,630
Oh   I doubt you'll remember

678
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,530
But you and I spent a good deal of time together.

679
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,100
Some of it right here.

680
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Your father and I were quite close

681
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,130
When we were both much younger.

682
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,800
Now I have all kinds of information   peter

683
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,600
And some of it does me no good.

684
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,330
We'll take the aymara people   for instance   of central peru.

685
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,530
I know that the soil beneath their land

686
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,260
Houses a naturally occurring metal alloy

687
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,600
That is potentially hyperconductive.

688
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,700
I also know that you have managed

689
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,230
To successfully conduct business with these

690
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,730
And other tribal concerns in parts of the world

691
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,060
Traditionally resistant to development.

692
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm sorry   ms. sharp.

693
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,060
I think i'm about to miss your question.

694
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,810
My question is.

695
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,360
Are you willing to make a bargain.

696
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,530
I give you exact application you want  and then exchange

697
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,550
I'll get to come to you someday

698
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,690
And you return favor.

699
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,470
No questions asked.

700
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,340
Do we have a deal?

701
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,570
Do you smell that?

702
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,000
Yes   and next time   how about a little warning?

703
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,870
Oh   not that.

704
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,170
Methyleugenol.

705
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,070
The chemical responsible

706
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,100
For giving hyacinths their aroma.

707
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
What about it?

708
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,600
I have been trying to determine

709
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,870
What caused the radioactive capsules

710
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,600
In emily kramer's bloodstream to burst at once.

711
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,730
This is it   asterisk.

712
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,400
Astrid. her name is astrid.

713
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,230
I've got it   peter. methyleugenol is the key!

714
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,470
That's what they injected her with.

715
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,170
That's why these women were chosen.

716
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,570
By itself   harmless   but given their treatments--

717
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,500
Causing all the capsules to burst at once.

718
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,070
They made her radioactive.

719
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,530
They turned her into a weapon.

720
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,330
It will be a decidedly blue compound

721
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,600
And now that i--

722
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,200
No...yes...yes!

723
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,570
That's it. a bonding agent.

724
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,970
That will work.

725
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,470
That will interfere with the process.

726
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,300
How long?

727
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,470
How long will it take to make the cure?

728
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,630
Oh   not long at all now that I know.

729
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,030
Where's olivia?

730
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,000
When did this happen?

731
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,970
When did this become the world we live in?

732
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,170
Patel   esterbrook.

733
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,770
These are the people we trust to take care of us.

734
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,400
5620 stapleton avenue.

735
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,500
The facility where claire williams is being held.

736
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,730
How could you possibly--

737
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,400
Radioactive isotopes have a heat signature

738
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,300
That's visible to spy satellites.

739
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,600
I had a friend track it down

740
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,930
Through the national reconnaissance office.

741
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,530
You have a friend at the nro.

742
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,230
I have a friend who's cracked their control systems.

743
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,600
Peter   if I pull the trigger on this

744
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
And the information's bad--

745
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,370
It's good.

746
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,500
It's good.

747
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,070
Charlie   I've got a solid lead.

748
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,600
A strike team. full tactical.

749
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
How we doing? almost there.

750
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,830
No   we're sure. this is the one.

751
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,970
We've got a visible heat signature from the isotopes.

752
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,300
Visible heat signature?

753
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,430
Radioactive isotopes don't give off--

754
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,600
Walter   walter   stay focused.

755
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,130
How we doing?

756
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,030
Oh   uh   um   olivia

757
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,800
This is the antidote.

758
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,670
Okay   charlie   we're coming now.

759
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,900
Listen to me.

760
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,930
You must inject this directly into her bloodstream.

761
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,630
In the jugular preferably. okay.

762
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,100
Facility's located

763
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,530
On the southern edge of framingham.

764
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,470
Surveillance teams reported

765
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,170
Armed security on the premises.

766
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,430
We're expecting resistance

767
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,970
So this will be a tactical entry.

768
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,630
Our main objective

769
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,570
Is securing the victim   claire williams.

770
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,410
Judging from the layout

771
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,070
It's likely she's being held at the basement level.

772
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,330
We'll enter through the northwest of the building.

773
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,000
Alpha team will enter through the front

774
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,470
Clear out the west of the building.

775
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,030
Bravo team will clear the lower levels.

776
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,500
Are we clear?

777
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,870
Then let's make this happen.

778
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,670
Fbi   you're under arrest.

779
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,000
Get down now!

780
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,530
Hands behind your head.

781
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,030
Room is clear.

782
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,100
I need one   I need one   I need one!

783
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,900
Look out!

784
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,770
Man down!

785
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,400
We have a man down. we need immediately medevac.

786
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,070
Call it in.

787
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,570
Stay with him.

788
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,400
Level's secure. we've got a few in custody.

789
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,430
Any sign of claire? no.

790
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,300
I'm going down. watch yourself.

791
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,000
Step away from that   please.

792
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Where is she? where's claire williams?

793
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,400
Agent dunham   you can't go in that room.

794
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,970
The radiation   it'll kill us all.

795
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,370
Claire! claire!

796
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,830
Claire   my name's olivia dunham.

797
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,330
I'm with the fbi.

798
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,970
I know you're scared   but I need you to listen to me.

799
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,130
I need you to come to the door.

800
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,570
I can't come in there.

801
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,200
My hea..it hurts.

802
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,570
That's medicine.

803
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,800
I need you to come to the door and take it.

804
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,030
I can't come in there. aah!

805
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,430
Claire!

806
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,130
Claire   look at me! that's good.

807
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,830
Now come to the door. keep coming.

808
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,270
I need you to take the syringe.

809
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,830
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

810
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,730
Good. good   claire.

811
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,130
Claire!

812
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,600
Look at me   claire!

813
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,070
Claire   I'm right here with you.

814
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,270
Claire!

815
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,930
Claire   you need to jab yourself

816
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,030
In your jugular on the side of your neck.

817
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,970
Oh   my god. my head!

818
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,830
Claire! claire!

819
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,030
Claire   do it! you can do this.

820
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,470
Claire   just do it. I know you can do it.

821
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,170
Stab it in.  aah!

822
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,330
Agent dunham.

823
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,030
Apparently I didn't make my point clearly enough.

824
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,430
I thought you'd be interested to know

825
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,000
That claire williams is safe.

826
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,930
Can't say I'm familiar with that name.

827
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,500
That's odd.

828
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Because an employee of yours   elizabeth sarnoff

829
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,930
Just admitted that you supplied her

830
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,370
With the facility and the equipment

831
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,200
To make emily kramer and ms. williams

832
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,530
Into human weapons.

833
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,100
A disgruntled former employee

834
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Will say just about anything

835
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,630
To vilify the boss that fired her.

836
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,900
Then you won't mind coming with me

837
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,700
To answer some questions.

838
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,830
Do you honestly see this going anywhere   agent dunham?

839
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,330
I have a law firm on retainer

840
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,500
That charges more by the hour

841
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,630
Than you make in an entire year.

842
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,800
Then I suggest you get them to meet you at the fbi.

843
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,070
I guess I will include police harassment

844
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,770
In the litany of charges that I will file against you.

845
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm still gonna walk you out that door in handcuffs

846
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,700
For resisting questioning.

847
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,870
So the press that I tipped off

848
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,730
Can splash your picture all over the news.

849
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,400
You may not answer to me

850
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Or the federal government

851
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,170
But you do answer to a board of directors.

852
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,930
And I wonder what their response will be

853
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,030
When they have their company dragged

854
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,700
Into the middle of a murder investigation.

855
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,300
I guess by now you've heard.

856
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,430
That you frog marched a senior officer

857
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,100
Of a multibillion dollar conglomerate out of his office?

858
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,170
Yeah   I heard.

859
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,930
Quite a few cameras there.

860
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,400
The press.

861
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,600
They always get their pound of flesh.

862
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,030
I understand that you think I acted too emotionally.

863
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,400
And putting aside the fact

864
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,470
That men always say that about women they work with

865
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,730
I'll get straight to the point.

866
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,370
I am emotional. I do bring it into my work.

867
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,200
It's what motivates me.

868
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,830
It helps me to get into the headspace

869
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,330
Of our victims

870
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,730
See what they've seen.

871
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,870
Even if I don't want to. even if it horrifies me.

872
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,170
And I think it makes me a better agent.

873
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,600
If you have a problem with that   sorry.

874
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,600
You can fire me.

875
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,330
But I hope you don't.

876
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,730
You're not getting off that easy   agent dunham.

877
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,900
I'll see you in the moring.

878
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,400
Today as the spike in the price of oil

879
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,530
Again sent tremors through the financial markets

880
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,900
But for pure shock value

881
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,200
Nothing beats today's very public detainment

882
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,470
On intrepus' david esterbrook by the fbi.

883
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,030
Intrepus stock is being absolutely pummeled

884
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,630
In overnight trading

885
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,930
And analysts predict it will open

886
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,130
At $23 a share.

887
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,570
That's a ten-year low.

888
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,970
Which   of course   is very good news

889
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,700
For intrepus' competitors

890
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,000
Most notably massive dynamic.

891
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,200
Shares of md are up almost 12%

892
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,600
As investors flee

893
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,270
To the most reliable brand in the sector.

894
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,900
Hey. olivia!

895
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,830
Did you lock yourself out again?

896
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,200
Actually   walter   this is our hotel.

897
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,530
I need to talk to you.

898
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,100
Sure.

899
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
I'll see you upstairs   okay?

900
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,800
It's nice to see you.

901
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,600
Good night   walter.

902
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,630
And remember tonight   please

903
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,870
The red toothbrush is mine.

904
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,130
White for walter.

905
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,030
That's me. right?

906
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,500
Yes.

907
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,470
Everything okay?

908
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,030
I know where you got your information.

909
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,830
About claire williams.

910
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,430
What was her price?

911
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,270
What did nina sharp want in return?

912
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,530
Nothing untoward   if that's what you're worried about.

913
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,200
Peter.

914
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,170
You don't have to worry about me.

915
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:13,270
I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself.

916
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,970
You've been looking out for me

917
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,070
So I'm just returning the favor.

918
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,130
Thank you.

919
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,530
There was no letter today   was there?

920
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,900
No.

921
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,370
Happy birthday.

922
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,330
You better get back upstairs

923
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,300
Before walter falls asleep in your bed.

924
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,300
Yeah.

925
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,300
He has actually done that before.

926
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,570
While I was sleeping.

927
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,930
Really not something you want to wake up to.

928
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,570
Good night.
