<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,905
The shape-shifters, on your side,
are looking for someone.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,207
William Bell told me
that Newton will try to open

4
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:10,593
a doorway from our universe
to the other side.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,595
You once build a door

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,347
that let you walk between world.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,390
Tell me how you did it.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,559
I can save him.

9
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,728
- Peter is dead.
- I'm talking about the other Peter.

10
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:22,813
The one on the other side.

11
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,412
- You are not my father.
- Of course, I am.

12
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,488
I've done enough damage,
I have to tell him who he really is.

13
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,727
You feel that?

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:48,930
What?

15
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,126
- The shaking.
- A whole lot of shakin' goin' on.

16
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,458
- No, I'm serious.
- And you're stoned. Give me that.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,229
I thought you said this place
was abandoned.

18
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:05,111
I'm gonna check it out.

19
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,173
- We should just go.
- No, just hang tight.

20
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,465
I'll be fine.

21
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,697
This totally sucks.
What took you so long?

22
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,374
You scared the hell out of me.

23
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,296
I want to leave here, Dave.

29
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,985
Come on, Walter, not again.

30
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,965
I'm just rearranging.

31
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,739
It's not quite right yet.

32
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,907
It's fine.

33
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:05,244
And it was fine yesterday
and fine the day before that.

34
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:08,998
A well-ordered house
is the sign of a well-ordered mind.

35
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,501
But staying up all night to find the
perfect place for your laundry hamper is

36
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,434
a sign of something else,
in my books.

37
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,474
Come on, leave that for later.
I got you a surprise.

38
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,783
I thought maybe we could bake
a pie together.

39
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,335
Your favorite... say, pecan?
I got all the good stuff.

40
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,592
You want to whip the batter?

41
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,728
The batter can wait.
There's something we have to talk about.

42
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:36,400
Fair enough. It's your room.
Decorate it however you like.

43
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,765
It's not that.

44
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,332
There's something
you deserve to know.

45
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,406
Every living thing...

46
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:49,538
dies.

47
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:56,165
As a scientist, that's one
of the hardest things to accept,

48
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,646
that we try to understand
the mechanisms of life,

49
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,928
but inevitably,
we can't defeat death,

50
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,336
No matter how much we may want to.

51
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,074
It's Olivia.

52
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,558
What's up?

53
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:20,110
- Sure. We'll meet you outside.
- Something happened?

54
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,863
I guess so.
She's on her way to pick us up.

55
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:26,803
I'll get my field kit.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,259
It's all right, Peter. It can wait.

57
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,296
Name's Jill Redmond.
Her purse was found outside the car.

58
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,418
Patrolman found her with a broken neck.
That's the cause of death.

59
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,515
But the medical examiner found this.

60
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,934
Three puncture wounds
in her soft palate.

61
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,562
Raised a red flag in the FBI database
and came up the chain to me.

62
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:56,855
Shape-shifters.

63
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:00,764
The last time we heard of Newton
and his men was in New York.

64
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,945
They must have needed her identity
for something.

65
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,680
What else do we know about her?

66
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,666
We're running
a background check on her now.

67
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,994
We should send a photograph
to the local and state law enforcement,

68
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,288
make sure they know that she just got
a lot more dangerous than she looks.

69
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:15,831
Look...

70
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,802
It's a lemon zinger, I believe.

71
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,684
It's not as good as the stuff I grow,
but it's not bad either.

72
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,881
At least she died in a happy place.

73
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:27,306
I'm not so sure.

74
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:30,691
The girl's wearing lipstick,
but there isn't any on the joint.

75
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,393
You think that maybe
she was with somebody?

76
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,799
Maybe...

77
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,897
Maybe someone
who was lucky enough to get away.

78
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:11,011
Three puncture wounds
to the soft palate.

79
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,757
All clear.
The rest of the place is deserted.

80
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:17,577
Except for this.

81
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:24,765
Wait.

82
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:27,788
Walter, have you seen
anything like this before?

83
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,421
I think I may have.
It's awfully familiar.

84
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,427
It reminds me of a beanbag chair
I once owned...

85
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,876
1974.

86
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,840
So when a shape-shifter
takes a body,

87
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,425
it's because they want access,

88
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,637
Like, the one
that turned into the nurse,

89
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,522
came after me at the hospital,

90
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:55,140
or Charlie.

91
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,601
So what would the shape-shifters
want with these kids?

92
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,521
That's a good idea?

93
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,441
I think it's harmless enough.

94
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:21,054
Mercury.

95
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,296
If that's mercury, do you think
that this is a shape-shifter?

96
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,258
I do believe it is.

97
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,689
Isn't that wonderful?

98
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,111
Good morning.

99
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,734
We're here to pick up a camera,

100
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:54,809
an Argus,

101
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,202
A2b 35mm.

102
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,709
The secretary told me
there would be three of you.

103
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,377
There was a problem.

104
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,252
The third didn't make it.

105
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,696
Marvelous.

106
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,852
That feels like an embryo,

107
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:17,514
in the sense that
it's not fully developed.

108
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:19,119
Developed?

109
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:22,477
Well, my theory is that
this is the state in which

110
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,923
they enter our universe.

111
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,016
And as I've said,
being partly mechanical,

112
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:28,734
they can cross over
in a way that humans can't, but...

113
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,529
this one...

114
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,447
seems to have failed
to mature properly.

115
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,576
Peter, would you take a look?

116
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,129
Shape-shifter embryo.

117
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:43,165
Adorable.

118
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,017
So the two teenagers...

119
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,545
Maybe there were two more of these
that hatched and killed them.

120
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,487
It's a sound proposition,

121
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:54,509
But presumably the embryonic
shape-shifters would have needed

122
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,414
features, human identities.

123
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,598
They certainly wouldn't
blend in otherwise.

124
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,095
So then those two teenagers were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

125
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,037
It's got dozens of different
amino acids, which would

126
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:11,616
allow it to survive in the foreign
conditions of our universe.

127
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,425
Okay, that was Broyles.

128
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,949
Astrid, I want to see if we can download
this file from the FBI's secure server.

129
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,342
<i>The African elephant
is the largest...</i>

130
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,656
This was recorded last night.

131
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,417
Now just before 9:00 PM,
several dozen homes,

132
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,814
all within a half-mile radius
of the warehouse,

133
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,589
reported an odd kind of interference
with their broadcast signal.

134
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,525
Right around when the ME estimated
the time of death for those kids.

135
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,449
Is it possible that
the shape-shifter embryo

136
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:40,528
could have caused
this kind of interference?

137
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,361
I believe the interfering signal

138
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,979
may have originated
in the alternate universe.

139
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:50,648
We may be getting a glimpse
into the other side.

140
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,260
Can we turn it up?

141
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,540
And slow it down.

142
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,119
What is that?

143
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,350
It almost sounds like a language.

144
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,291
You hear the way that some
of those sounds seem to repeat?

145
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,001
Shape-shifters are soldiers.

146
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:13,076
Soldiers always come with orders.
Maybe that's a message.

147
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,440
I can see what the code breakers
at the bureau can make of it.

148
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,585
I got a better idea.

149
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,930
It's not a language.

150
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,328
It's math.

151
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:24,619
Math?

152
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:26,965
Trig and metric equations.

153
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,392
In this case, a radio wave,
the kind given off by a solar flare,

154
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,416
which is interesting.

155
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,510
Interesting how?

156
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,852
Our astronomical division
picked up a surge in solar activity

157
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,614
right around that time.

158
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,826
Here's a radio wave
from last night's solar flare.

159
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,062
Here's your wave.

160
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,374
- Yours couldn't have come from the sun.
- Where else could it have come from?

161
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,502
I don't know.
I mean, they're not in sync.

162
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,590
Suppose it came
from a parallel universe.

163
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,030
That would de...

164
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,779
because in a parallel universe,

165
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:07,225
- time would be slightly out of sync.
- And the waves would be too.

166
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:12,881
What?

167
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,443
Imagine...

168
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,003
that these are the two universes...

169
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,078
Slightly out of sync.

170
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,529
But on rare occasion,

171
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,084
They perfectly line up.

172
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,962
According to the computer,

173
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,926
That's gonna happen
between our universe

174
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,970
and wherever this
radio wave came from.

175
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,983
When?

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,636
Based on this,
tomorrow at precisely 3:31 PM.

177
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,522
- Who will be McCalister?
- That'd be me.

178
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,595
He's Wu.

179
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,623
Everything else you need is in here.

180
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:09,621
Once you're done, we'll reconvene

181
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,499
at the exchange points
tomorrow at exactly 20 past 3:00.

182
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,002
So that's it?
We're still going through with this?

183
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,256
- Why? You have a problem with this?
- We're a man down.

184
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,195
Neither of us have time
to handle the Verona assignment,

185
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,927
and you don't have
a shifting device.

186
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:27,186
- Maybe we should abort.
- And I suppose

187
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,558
you'll be the one to give
the news to the secretary.

188
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,269
We won't have another chance
like this for seven months.

189
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,443
So I'll figure out how
to handle Mr. Verona.

190
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,607
You make sure you hold your end.

191
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:38,984
All right?

192
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:41,778
You're the boss.

193
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,364
Then let's get to work.

194
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,174
Excuse me...

195
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,496
Would you happen to know
where Franklin Street is?

196
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:05,469
Sure.

197
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,986
You're three blocks
south of Franklin,

198
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:11,268
So go down this street,
you'll see a convenience store.

199
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,914
Then make a left
and go two blocks west.

200
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,105
I'll write it down for you.

201
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,648
- Where's Walter?
- He's out counting cars.

202
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:33,441
Thinks it might help jog his memory.

203
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:37,250
- He says human memory is best triggered
- When accomplishing mundane tasks.

204
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,873
Walter's convinced that Newton
wants to build a door to the other side.

205
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:42,839
If he can remember
what he told Newton,

206
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,842
we might be able to find what's
supposed to happen at 3:31 tomorrow.

207
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,577
And these cars that
he's tracking down?

208
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,555
He promised to stay off the freeway.

209
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:14,590
How goes it?

210
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:18,320
Broyles sent over
a list of state and local events

211
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,925
taking place tomorrow...

212
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,387
Star Trek Convention
at the Worcester Centrum.

213
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,720
That's not good.
I told Walter I'd take him.

214
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:32,931
Maybe we'll pretend
we didn't see that.

215
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,034
Sure.

216
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:44,359
I finally figured out why
Walter's been acting so strange.

217
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,530
He's been carrying
this picture with him,

218
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,508
A family photo
from when I was a kid.

219
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,372
He wants to talk to me
about how my mother died.

220
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,035
About a month after I got to Europe,
I got a call from St. Claire's...

221
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,798
from Walter.

222
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,384
He told me
that she died in a car crash.

223
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,877
It wasn't a car crash.

224
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:15,839
My mother committed suicide.

225
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,595
It was the only time I spoke to him

226
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,572
in the 17 years
that he was locked up in st. Claire's.

227
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,778
He must have known the truth.

228
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,988
I think, in his way,
he was trying to protect me.

229
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,278
And...

230
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:46,417
for whatever reason,
he wants to talk about it now.

231
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:57,098
You know
that Walter loves you very much.

232
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,428
Our synthetic friends.

233
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,972
I believe I know how to figure out
what they're up to.

234
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,318
- You remember what you told Newton?
- No.

235
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:13,948
But as they say in Finland, there's more
than one way to roast a reindeer.

236
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,440
But I'll need some supplies.

237
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,337
I need six car batteries,
a voltage transformer,

238
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,123
and several yards
of ten-gauge electrical wire.

239
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,314
And a corpse.

240
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,165
Any corpse will do.

241
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,637
But it shouldn't be dead
for more than two days.

242
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:37,806
- Hello.
- Hello. Can I help you?

243
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,666
Yes, I'm here to see your manager,
Mr. McCalister.

244
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:42,894
He's expecting me.

245
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,890
So, boss, you felt the need
to check up on me?

246
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,633
- Figure out what to do about Verona?
- I have some thoughts.

247
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,653
Mr. McCalister?

248
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,205
Approval
for an overdraft withdrawal?

249
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,326
Thank you.
I'll be there in just a minute.

250
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:47,781
You can handle the rest.

251
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:49,878
Make sure the device
remains undisturbed.

252
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,925
Tied into the house power,
and the volt meter is ready to go.

253
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,636
Walter, you're sure
that I'm doing this right?

254
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,180
It's perfect, Olivia. Just make sure
they're tightened down.

255
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,768
Walter, you really think
that his is gonna work?

256
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:06,802
No reason it shouldn't.

257
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,898
Something stopped this creature
from developing,

258
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,233
and because it's part mechanical,

259
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,996
if we pump it with enough electricity,
we should be able to restart it,

260
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,989
like jump-starting a car.

261
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,074
So what's the corpse for?

262
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,952
Is this embryo supposed
to reanimate it?

263
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,801
Don't be ridiculous.

264
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,213
But, if we intend
to question this creature,

265
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:31,135
then it will need an identity to...

266
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,047
to shape-shift into.

267
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,715
That's not ridiculous at all.

268
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,550
I think we're ready.

269
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,667
- 80 amps.
- 80 amps.

270
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,729
Not enough power,
but it seems to be working.

271
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:53,316
Try 110.

272
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,205
110.

273
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,036
140.

274
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,979
140.

275
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,045
We must have blown a fuse.

276
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,802
Look.
Astrid, quickly, some candles.

277
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:05,325
Something's wrong.

278
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,221
When I cut into it,
I must have damaged it.

279
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:11,644
Peter, the corpse.

280
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,988
All right, good on my side.

281
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,582
Help me.

282
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,171
Contact... Newton.

283
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,274
Thomas Jerome Newton?

284
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,592
Where is he?

285
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,703
Verona.

286
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,006
Daniel...

287
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,307
Verona.

288
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,642
Who is Daniel Verona?

289
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,799
Blood type AB negative.

290
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,065
Cellular polarity...

291
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,882
- We're losing him.
- Okay, tomorrow afternoon,

292
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,612
What is happening at 3:31?

293
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:12,228
I'm...

294
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,392
sorry.

295
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,947
Daniel Verona?

296
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:48,407
FBI.

297
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,228
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

298
00:22:54,864 --> 00:22:57,416
There's a man.
He's middle-aged, caucasian.

299
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,331
It looks like
he's having a heart attack.

300
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:00,760
<i>What is your location?</i>

301
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,886
I'm on the corner
of Longwood and Huntington.

302
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:04,429
<i>What is your name, sir?</i>

303
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,006
Oh, my god!

304
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,531
This guy needs help!

305
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,249
Does anyone know CPR?

306
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,875
Someone call an ambulance, quick!

307
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,762
He's not a shape-shifter.

308
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:47,383
We'll run his blood anyway,

309
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,047
test it for mercury.

310
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,298
Maybe we got to him
before they could.

311
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,428
Why him?

312
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:55,613
I mean, why Daniel Verona?
What could they want with him?

313
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,396
Medical examiner,
works out of Boston General...

314
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,108
It's anybody's guess.

315
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:10,760
You too.

316
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,979
Good night.

317
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,514
Verona was a bust.

318
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,362
You've been awake
for two straight days.

319
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:28,070
- You need to get some rest.
- Shape-shifters...

320
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:33,447
I should have been more careful
with my initial dissection.

321
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,029
If I hadn't caused so much damage,

322
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,053
it could have told us everything.

323
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,288
But you couldn't
possibly have known that.

324
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,665
It was definitely
stupid and inexcusable.

325
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:45,668
Calm down.

326
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,838
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:53,344
We're gonna figure it out,
just like we always do.

328
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,181
I want you to get some rest, dad.

329
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,942
I'm gonna hit the sack.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

330
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,278
"Dad."

331
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:09,830
You just called me dad.

332
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:16,431
I guess I did.

333
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,131
Newton...

334
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,491
I think I know
what he's planning to do.

335
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,358
She's here.

336
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,799
Agent Dunham,
I'm sorry to get you out of bed.

337
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,593
- It's okay.
- Now...

338
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,749
Geometry and harmonic vibrations.

339
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,098
That's how we did it, Belly and I.

340
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:42,971
Did what?

341
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,842
Sent Belly's Monte Carlo

342
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,177
from this universe
to the other side.

343
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:51,817
As I've said before, the two universes
vibrate at different frequencies.

344
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,129
So we set up three harmonic rods

345
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:57,189
arranged as an equilateral triangle

346
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,909
and then activated the rods.

347
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,251
When the car began to vibrate
at just the right frequency...

348
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:16,050
That's how we sent belly's car
to the other side.

349
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,095
It's exactly what Newton did
with the building.

350
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,821
- But Newton's attempt failed.
- Yes, indeed it did,

351
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:23,959
because the building
that Newton brought over

352
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,186
landed in a location
that was already occupied by another.

353
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,036
But I suspect that Mr. Newton
has found a way around that problem,

354
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,817
because he has something
that Belly and I never had.

355
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,073
- What's that?
- Agents in both universes.

356
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:41,075
So if we set up the harmonic rods

357
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,203
in exactly the same position
in each universe,

358
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:46,539
like so...

359
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,257
and we activate the rods...

360
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:54,923
Then whatever is in the center
of each triangle will

361
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,527
simply be exchanged.

362
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,556
Of course, that would likely require
that the universes be in sync.

363
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,233
3:31 this afternoon.

364
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:09,665
So...

365
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,314
So what could newton bring here?

366
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,714
Last time he brought a building,

367
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,193
so I suppose anything
he could fit inside of it.

368
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,778
- A machine.
- An army.

369
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:21,074
If the triangle is large enough,
that is possible.

370
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,869
We have roughly ten hours to figure out
where the center of Newton's triangle is.

371
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,956
But it could be anywhere.

372
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:51,626
Three points.

373
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:53,913
Newton would have
to place the harmonic rods

374
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:56,045
at three specific locations
across the city.

375
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,078
Okay, so that's why
Newton's going after Verona,

376
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,538
because Verona must have access
to one of the three points.

377
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:03,739
So that would suggest either
Boston General hospital or Verona's home.

378
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,993
Okay, so Verona lives
in Beacon Hill,

379
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:07,745
520 South Garden Street.

380
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,735
It's a couple blocks from the hospital.
For our purposes, that's our first point.

381
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,671
I think I might be able to help.

382
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,558
Boston PD just found a corpse
on Chestnut Hill Village.

383
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:20,944
Three punctures to his soft palate.
His name is Ben McCalister.

384
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,458
He's a branch manager
at Pinewood Savings bank.

385
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,779
- He was found just outside his office.
- Not easy to access a bank.

386
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:28,810
Okay, 185 Mason Ave.

387
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,788
Mason...
So that's our second point,

388
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:33,868
and now we have
the first leg of our triangle.

389
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,649
We've got more than that, son. We're
looking for an equilateral triangle,

390
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,281
therefore, the third point...

391
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,354
Can only be in one
of two places, right.

392
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,162
All right, so the third point
is either Arlington or

393
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:52,430
Cedar Grove.

394
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:53,863
Well, try both.

395
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:56,001
See what's
in the center of each triangle.

396
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,995
It's either Hyde park...

397
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:07,388
or right on the Charles river.
So he's got to be targeting Hyde park.

398
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,621
Is there a bridge on the Charles?

399
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,687
A condemned railway bridge.
Why?

400
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:20,942
The water would absorb

401
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,737
any excess energy
caused by Newton's procedure,

402
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,263
so he must be
making the exchange on the bridge.

403
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:27,533
She's right, Peter.

404
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,846
It's Dunham.
I think we have something.

405
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,059
We're all set.

406
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,639
- Any problems?
- All good.

407
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,696
Go deal with it, now.

408
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,411
<i>Are we sending anyone
to look for the harmonic rods?</i>

409
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,563
Agents are on their way to the morgue
and McCalister's bank in Chestnut Hill.

410
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:13,912
Boston PD have been deployed to
the Andrews avenue bridge.

411
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:16,005
- What's your status?
- We're a few minutes away.

412
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,501
Whatever Newton's trying to bring over,
Walter can stop it.

413
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,185
<i>Call me when you get there.</i>

414
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:25,077
- Walter, how is this thing gonna work?
- Vibrations are composed of shock waves

415
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:28,511
and like sound waves, they can be
nullified by their opposite.

416
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,096
- Like noise-canceling headphones.
- Precisely.

417
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,561
The seismograph will pick up
the vibrations from Newton's device.

418
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:38,229
The laptop will calculate its opposite
and transmit it to the pneumatic hammer.

419
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,131
To send out vibrations that would
cancel out Newton's device.

420
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,635
Of course, we have
to get the hammer as close

421
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,637
to the center of the bridge
as possible,

422
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:47,821
- which might be dangerous.
- Dangerous how?

423
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,789
The vibrational waves that

424
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:52,764
Newton will need to generate,
the intensity...

425
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:53,827
Devastating.

426
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,456
- What do you mean, "devastating"?
- I suspect it would tear a man apart.

427
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,064
Walter, I need you to stay here
and finish putting that thing together.

428
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,443
We need to get on that bridge.

429
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:28,988
I'm afraid that's not possible.

430
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,365
I'm with the FBI.

431
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,068
You're the boss.
Let me just check with the sergeant.

432
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,921
- How did you know?
- A cop wouldn't call on a cell phone.

433
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:19,152
It's 3:32.
Walter's not gonna make it in time.

434
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,059
I'm going up there. Cover me.

435
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,120
You need to get off this bridge.

436
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,668
I have to put this right.
I started this, I've got to...

437
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,833
It's gonna go faster
if we do it together.

438
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,001
- What?
- The two on the bridge,

439
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,273
get them out of there.

440
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,742
Peter and Walter are on the bridge.
It's started.

441
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:28,372
- Pneumatic is ready.
- Seismograph is ready.

442
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:32,421
Cleaning up the program!

443
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,663
Something's wrong!

444
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,348
I don't understand.
It should be working.

445
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,891
Something's wrong with
your frequency-recognition program.

446
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,644
But don't worry. I can fix it.

447
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,688
How we doing?

448
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,232
- I need you to get off this bridge now.
- Get off the bridge.

449
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,245
There's nothing else you can do.
I need you to get him off this bridge.

450
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:45,048
You okay?

451
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:30,289
Welcome back.

452
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,183
How long was I out?

453
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:52,982
About a day and a half.

454
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:55,157
Here.

455
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:08,869
The doctor said that you'd be fine,
but Walter was worried.

456
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:11,265
I'm fine.

457
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:17,961
Is he here?

458
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,720
He wouldn't leave.

459
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,383
He'll want to know that you're up.

460
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,806
I'd like to speak to him alone,
if that's okay.

461
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,399
Sure.

462
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,244
They told me you'd be all right,
but I was so worried, son.

463
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
And...

464
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:59,002
There was another man
on that bridge.

465
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,565
When Newton's device started to work,
I saw him there...

466
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,597
just walking down the bridge.

467
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,974
He had to have been
from the other side.

468
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:20,026
You said the effects of Newton's
vibrations would be devastating.

469
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:21,638
And...

470
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:26,622
They were. They destroyed
that FBI agent. They just...

471
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,339
disintegrated him
like he wasn't even there.

472
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:38,232
But they didn't kill
the man from the other side.

473
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:41,545
And they didn't kill me.

474
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,408
I'm not from here, am I?

475
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,230
You didn't just
open up a hole to the other side.

476
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,340
You went through...

477
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,529
And you brought me back.

478
00:40:09,694 --> 00:40:12,200
That's why I was able to survive
Newton's device.

479
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:15,606
It's why I can't
remember my childhood.

480
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:18,707
- You were dying, Peter...
- It's why my mother committed suicide.

481
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:21,232
Isn't it?

482
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,719
She knew...

483
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:24,939
didn't she?

484
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,642
And when I left,

485
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,680
the guilt was too much
for her to live with...

486
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,805
the lie.

487
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,850
Peter,
you need to understand something.

488
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,568
I understand, Walter.

489
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,106
I understand everything now.

490
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:49,988
- Son...
- I am not your son.

491
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:58,854
I'd like to be alone now.

492
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,686
It would be easier

493
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,333
if you don't try to talk just yet,
Mr. Secretary.

494
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,493
You see, despite the preparation,

495
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,088
crossing over is quite
an ordeal on your body,

496
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:50,763
and, the consequences
are unpredictable.

497
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,017
This should help.

498
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,542
You should...

499
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:03,704
You should be able
to sleep for a while.

500
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,565
And hopefully, when you wake up,
you'll be stabilized.

501
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,179
Walter, it's 6:00.

502
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,672
Peter's probably still sleeping.

503
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:32,601
I have to go to the hospital now.

504
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:34,885
Are you going to drive me,
or shall I call a cab?

505
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:58,200
Peter checked himself out
of the hospital three hours ago.

506
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,869
He isn't at the lab,

507
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,397
and he's not answering his phone.

508
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:10,312
He's gone.
