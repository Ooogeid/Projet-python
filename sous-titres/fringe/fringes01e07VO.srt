1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Olivia Dunham. FBI.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,930
They're calling these events the pattern.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,660
As if someone out there is experimenting

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,830
only the whole world is their lab.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,230
Anybody you need you can have.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,300
-His name's Walter Bishop. -My father.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,700
He worked out of Harvard.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,530
He was part of a classified US army experimental program

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,960
In an area called fringe science.

10
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,930
You're telling me my father was Dr. Frankenstein.

11
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:26,165
So much happened here, and so much is about to.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,869
Captain Loeb, what's your 20?

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,039
We're in tow. 200 meters out.

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,562
What's your ETA[Estimated Time of Arrival]?

15
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,832
We're in position. Standing by.

16
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:42,130
No activity captain.

17
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:44,762
Roger. Hold position. Charlie?

18
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,103
In position. Standing by.

19
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,333
Delta?

20
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,662
Standing by captain.

21
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,432
Roger.

22
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,230
Cutting engines.

23
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,820
At south bank now.

24
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:01,903
South bank quiet. Bravo, status.

25
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,901
All quiet sir.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:13,590
Wait. I think I hear something.

27
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,531
We have tango in sight.

28
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:25,491
All teams move out. Go go go.

29
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:27,733
Stop the truck. Stay where you are.

30
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,763
Out! Out! Get out!

31
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,392
Hands where I can see them!

32
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,261
Packed bears?

33
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:46,291
I assume you checked inside of them.

34
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,500
They knew we were coming.

35
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,661
Somewhere they made a switch.

36
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,562
Joseph Smith.

37
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,700
Began working for the shipping company

38
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,531
a week before the container was packed.

39
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:58,131
He had access to the container.

40
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,863
He's also got a science background.

41
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,530
Customs has him back and forth

42
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:04,293
from Budapest eight times in the past 12 months.

43
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:05,903
Other local agents on the operation?

44
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,390
Coscarelli and Scrimm.

45
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,630
Page 47.

46
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:16,203
Weight of the container after pickup was 1306 pounds.

47
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,103
The weight when it arrived in Germany

48
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,363
before shipping, 1299.

49
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,461
That's seven pounds.

50
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,130
What the hell weighs seven pounds?

51
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:25,233
Mitchel?

52
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,162
Let's get a medic in here!

53
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,600
What'd you give him?

54
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,433
One round of Eppy. Intermittent cardiac arrest.

55
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,362
I've never seen anything like this.

56
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,801
Pupils fixed one minute dilating the next.

57
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,300
-How's the rhythm now? -Asystole.

58
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,403
Charge the paddles. we'll start at 200.

59
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,432
Phillip!

60
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:46,700
Phillip what's happening?

61
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,401
-We don't know. -Is he gonna be okay?

62
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,402
Is it a heart attack?

63
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:50,763
The only thing for us to do

64
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,131
is wait.

65
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:56,632
Clear!

66
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,333
All right. Again, let's go to 300.

67
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,661
-V.fib. -Clear!

68
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,531
We gotta open him up pump the heart manually.

69
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,360
Prep him.

70
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:08,502
Scalpel.

71
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:14,160
Saw.

72
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,890
Retractor.

73
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,802
We got something.

74
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,832
His heart's beating.

75
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,202
What is that?

76
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,330
I don't know.

77
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,403
It happened in my office two hours ago.

78
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,703
It wasn't a heart attack.

79
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,970
At least not in the traditional sense.

80
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,533
They cordoned off the area.

81
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,700
But ID's been here already.

82
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,931
Said the thing isn't communicable.

83
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,301
The thing?

84
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,301
We'll get to that.

85
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,132
-You have any gum? -No Walter.

86
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,630
-Mints? -No. Later.

87
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,771
Agent Loeb returned

88
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,073
from an operation last week in Frankfurt.

89
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:35,871
-Do you know him at all? -No.

90
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,433
He collapsed.

91
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,733
Thought it was a seizure at first

92
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,071
except he appeared lucid in pain.

93
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:42,833
Didn't seem like a heart attack either.

94
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,703
None of us know what it was.

95
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,403
None of us know now either.

96
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:49,801
-How are his vital signs? -Weakening.

97
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,502
Dr. Bishop.

98
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:55,172
What you're about to see...

99
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,463
I don't know if you've seen anything like it before.

100
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,501
But I'm hoping you have.

101
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,331
I'm hoping you can help.

102
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,401
The man lying in that room is not just a colleague.

103
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,573
He's a friend.

104
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:07,902
I see.

105
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,931
Do you have any mints?

106
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,200
This is spectacular.

107
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,431
"Spectacular."

108
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:31,171
I'm sure he'd be thrilled to hear your diagnosis.

109
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:32,331
Do you know what that is?

110
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:33,601
Your work or your old experiments

111
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:34,772
-Does that look... -Look familiar?

112
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,603
No. Couldn't be more aberrational.

113
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,330
I'm simply admiring the design.

114
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:42,971
At least partially organic.

115
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:47,873
Looks like the hybrid result of genetic manipulation.

116
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,230
Symmetrical its central body mass.

117
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:53,531
If indeed it is an organism at all

118
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,131
It's designed it seems

119
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:59,572
to envelope the entire human heart.

120
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:01,230
Look, look.

121
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,131
A series of tendrils.

122
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,271
A root system.

123
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:06,530
Don't you see it?

124
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:10,131
How beautiful this is?

125
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,233
Not so much, no.

126
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:13,801
Can you help?

127
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,360
Do you think you can remove it?

128
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,633
Oh, I'd be willing to try. But not here.

129
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,572
My breath is atrocious.

130
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,700
I was deconstructing in my head

131
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,730
the approach to designing something like this.

132
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,231
And...and two things occurred to me

133
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,772
on the journey from the hospital.

134
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:36,302
One...we could be dealing with something as simple

135
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:39,501
as uh, giardia duodenalis.

136
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,903
As simple as that. Really?

137
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:42,071
It's a single-celled parasite

138
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,430
that lives in the intestines of animals.

139
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,430
Common waterborne illness.

140
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,573
Could we attach mister...

141
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,570
-Loeb. -Loeb

142
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,433
To the vitals machine please?

143
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:53,200
So you're saying that... that thing in his chest...

144
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,605
Is a parasite? Yes. Yes, perhaps.

145
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:59,239
But with an exceptional means of attachment.

146
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:03,779
Typically, parasites use whole body insertion.

147
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,602
This creature is unlike anything I've ever seen before.

148
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,463
So we won't be able to truly examine it

149
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,273
until it's removed.

150
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:12,771
Mitchel Loeb's recent case files as requested.

151
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:14,703
Oh, thanks Astrid.

152
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:16,631
And his wife just arrived.

153
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,460
She asked to speak with you.

154
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,363
I'm gonna talk to her in the office.

155
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:24,772
Okay, he's wired. What was the other thing?

156
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,070
Pardon?

157
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:27,462
You said that two things occurred to you.

158
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:28,833
What's the other one?

159
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,072
I would still really like some gum.

160
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,102
Or some mints?

161
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,570
Thank you  peter.

162
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,571
Mrs. loeb.

163
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:47,532
Olivia dunham.

164
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,633
I'm with homeland security.

165
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:49,633
Samantha.

166
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm hoping you can help me.

167
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,031
No one will tell me anything.

168
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:56,601
Why was he transferred here? can you at least tell me that?

169
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,870
I can tell you that there's a doctor here

170
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:01,502
Who is...

171
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:03,200
Uniquely qualified

172
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,430
To save your husband's life.

173
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,732
This was in his bag.

174
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:16,800
Among the things he brought home from frankfurt.

175
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:23,631
I don't know if it'll help at all.

176
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,403
It might.

177
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:29,102
We'll check it out. thank you.

178
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,831
Can I see mitchel? please.

179
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:41,802
As soon as possible. I promise you that.

180
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,203
Uh-oh. what's happening?

181
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,673
It's killing him.

182
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,870
It's squeezing his heart. it's killing him.

183
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,700
What are you doing?

184
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,202
I'm gonna give him some cyclobenzaprine.

185
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:20,873
If the parasite is constricting

186
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,933
This might loosen its grip.

187
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,530
It's a gamble but I like the theory.

188
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:26,973
Look at this.

189
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,130
This is good.

190
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,500
Organism's tissue.

191
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,871
Where the hell are you going?

192
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,160
DNA analysis should tell us much.

193
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,433
Excellent work  son.

194
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:51,262
You may have found your true calling at last.

195
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:53,333
Working with me.

196
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:55,330
I certainly hope not.

197
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:09,202
Please tell me you guys have some good news.

198
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,803
I don't know if it's good news  but it is something.

199
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,873
This is fascinating.

200
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:15,973
What?

201
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:18,230
We can assume that this growth

202
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:21,073
This parasite is...is of human design  yes?

203
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,530
Okay. I was looking for repetition.

204
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:25,330
The signature of the creator.

205
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,401
A sign a...a footprint

206
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,930
That he or she had been there before us.

207
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,162
I don't understand.

208
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,502
Well  that puts you in the same group

209
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,731
As the rest of humanity.

210
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,232
What he's trying to say is we found this.

211
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,071
Ah. no see that?

212
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:43,433
This pattern repeats throughout the DNA sequence.

213
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:46,200
It appears again and again.

214
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,232
But it's too organized to be accidental.

215
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:50,502
Too perfect to be natural.

216
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:51,672
So you're saying

217
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,300
That someone put in this line of dna on purpose.

218
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,732
Why?

219
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,703
Mischief. arrogance. we don't know.

220
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:01,802
Your friend thinks it might be a code.

221
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,730
The other one.

222
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,263
I studied cryptology even before I joined the bureau.

223
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,233
I was obsessed as a kid.

224
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,330
Now I keep assuming it can't be this.

225
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,630
That it's too simple to be plain text.

226
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:20,831
But I think it may just be the caesar shift.

227
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,003
What's that?

228
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:23,673
It's a simple monoalphabetic cipher.

229
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:25,231
Is it now?

230
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,873
It's what julius caesar used apparently

231
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,433
To send letters to his friends.

232
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,631
You take one letter and replace it with another

233
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,630
But in alphabetical order.

234
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,033
There's a sequence of three letters

235
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,233
That appears repeatedly

236
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,033
In the parasite's dna.

237
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:41,402
It could be c-i-w or d-j-x

238
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,070
Or e-k-y.

239
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,401
Or z-f-t.

240
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,932
Yeah z-f-t fits. what is that?

241
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,502
I've been reviewing john scott's cases

242
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,031
Checking to see if any of them were mishandled

243
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:58,833
Or seeing if any of the cases were left unsolved.

244
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,163
And? and one of them that I remember

245
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,103
Was an operation tracking a group working out of budapest.

246
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,600
The name on the file

247
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,162
What was written was "Z-F-T"

248
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:13,833
That mean something to you? what?

249
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:18,161
A month ago a man...

250
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,130
British national named david robert jones

251
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,132
Was arrested in frankfurt germany by interpol

252
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:25,501
On possession of state secrets.

253
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,630
His background is in deep bio-technology.

254
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:30,473
Notably genetic weaponry.

255
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,131
He was a senior fellow at the bremming institute

256
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,073
For 12 years then went off the grid.

257
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,333
He'd show up now and then often in eastern europe.

258
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:39,600
So you think he's z.f.t.

259
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,030
I don't know. but loeb did.

260
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,903
It was one of the reasons he was in frankfurt

261
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,263
Investigating jones.

262
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,871
Meaning that thing...

263
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:48,331
May be retribution.

264
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:50,830
So z.f.t.  what is it? who are they?

265
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:55,232
Agent dunham  there is much you have not been made aware of

266
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,432
Regarding the pattern.

267
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,472
Well  I'm here.

268
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,260
I have time.

269
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:03,233
Are you available?

270
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,870
What we've learned so far is that

271
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,870
There are cells.

272
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,261
We don't know how many.

273
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,263
Privately funded with presence in 83 recorded countries.

274
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,632
Z.f.t. is among them.

275
00:13:20,638 --> 00:13:21,672
So they're terrorists.

276
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:22,802
Not in a conventional sense.

277
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,530
They traffic not in drugs or weapons

278
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,300
But in scientific progress.

279
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,673
Meaning what?

280
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,333
Meaning what happened on flight 627

281
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:32,572
Or what happened to agent loeb.

282
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:35,130
These may have been simply proof

283
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,702
That a scientific theory

284
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:40,030
An experiment  worked.

285
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,163
So that thing we found in loeb

286
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,931
Could be one of those experiments.

287
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:46,232
Do you think jones will tell us how to remove it?

288
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:49,302
He might  if we were allowed to see him.

289
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:51,803
German authorities have refused us access.

290
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:52,970
What?

291
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,873
They're not giving the u.s. access.

292
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,371
And he's being kept in frankfurt.

293
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,433
Yeah.

294
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,802
I may be able to get in.

295
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,601
You got super powers you aren't telling me about?

296
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,031
Maybe.

297
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:06,331
You're not really going to germany.

298
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,032
Yeah I'm really going.

299
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,371
Let me save you the trip  dunham.

300
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,530
You're not getting in.

301
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,930
We don't know each other well enough

302
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,930
For you to say something like that to me.

303
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,791
And I don't see any other option here.

304
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,302
Do you  sir?

305
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,832
Loeb's your friend.

306
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,131
And I promised his wife.

307
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,600
What's wrong?

308
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,930
This may be something of an understatement

309
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:40,900
But he is not doing well.

310
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,030
Dehydrated.

311
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,203
Walter  come here.

312
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,531
What is that?

313
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,531
That's the root.

314
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,873
Coming up from his arm?

315
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,700
Into the iv  yes.

316
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,732
This parasite is spreading faster than I thought.

317
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:16,300
How long do you think he's got?

318
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:19,871
A day maybe.

319
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:23,402
Hey.

320
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,160
Hi. so the good news is I think we have a lead.

321
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,903
The bad news is I have to go to germany to see him.

322
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,400
I don't think that's the bad news.

323
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:31,473
He's dying  Olivia.

324
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't think we're gonna make it.

325
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,070
We're gonna make it.

326
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:35,873
I'll call you when I land.


328
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,002
Look at you.

329
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,331
Well  don't let the suit throw you.

330
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,933
Wow  lucas  I never thought I'd see the day.

331
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,100
It's more comfortable than the military uniform.

332
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,571
Hi.

333
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,802
Hi...sorry.

334
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,533
I'm not sure I can help you.

335
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,473
You said you have contacts at the prison.

336
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:32,633
I'm in the bundestag. I have contacts everywhere.

337
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:34,702
But you jumped on a plane so fast

338
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,433
I didn't have time to check anything out.

339
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,302
Well  what did you find?

340
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:39,832
I know the warden.

341
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,102
He wouldn't agree to anything.

342
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:42,971
He didn't want me to show up.

343
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,403
So what do we do?

344
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,673
Show up.


346
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,902
Tenacious as always.

347
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:16,572
What can I do for you  lucas?

348
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:20,430
Olivia dunham  this is Johan Lennox.

349
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:21,503
Thank you for seeing us.

350
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,300
You want time with a prisoner?

351
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:24,902
David robert jones.

352
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,872
This will be a problem.

353
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm sure we can work something out.

354
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,072
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:46,102
Your friend wants to be persuasive.

356
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,870
Mr. lennox  you have your reasons

357
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,433
Why you won't allow access to your prisoners

358
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,402
But this is very important to me.

359
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:58,400
I would be willing to sign anything.

360
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:12,102
I like her.

361
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,933
You have good taste.

362
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,572
Even if I were to give the okay

363
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,802
Mr. jones talks to no one.

364
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:26,101
I have reason to believe he will talk to me.

365
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,933
If I write him a message  will you give it to him?

366
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:39,333
I don't expect miracles.

367
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:42,503
I don't know if I expect anything.

368
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:46,772
But I am grateful for whatever you can do in this case.

369
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,362
Sorry?

370
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:52,002
I was just saying I'm grateful for your work.

371
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,803
You're most welcome.

372
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:01,132
You know  I had a fruit cocktail once

373
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:02,832
In atlantic city.

374
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:06,171
Mind you  I'm not the fruit cocktail

375
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,973
Sort of guy.

376
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:13,803
Excuse me.

377
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,361
We need to discuss your father.

378
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,673
Is it the fruit cocktail thing again?

379
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,100
Yeah  he's been doing that recently.

380
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,500
He gets obsessed about certain foods.

381
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:28,500
It's weird.

382
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,670
We need him to focus.

383
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,672
To focus?

384
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,832
Mr. broyles

385
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,903
Two-thirds of the time

386
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,730
My father's not even lucid.

387
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,102
And in those rare

388
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,672
And unpredictable moments of clarity

389
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,600
He rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed

390
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,330
While he was incarcerated in a mental institution

391
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:42,801
For the better part of the last two decades.

392
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,533
To say that he's not focused

393
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:46,973
Is to say that he's a biped

394
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,360
Which is to say  you're absolutely right.

395
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,701
He's not focused.

396
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,203
And also  it's not going to change any time too soon.

397
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,702
I'm his son. I'm not a puppeteer.

398
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,131
I don't have a remote control.

399
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,073
There's no master switch I can flick

400
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,003
And turn him into the man I wish had raised me

401
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,601
Or even somebody I don't have to baby-sit every day.

402
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:11,071
I guess I've had that on my mind for awhile.

403
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,262
Apparently.

404
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,070
Broyles.

405
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,973
It's charlie francis.

406
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:21,400
I understand I'm not at clearance level

407
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:22,903
But I have something for you.

408
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,001
What is it?

409
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,970
Local connecontion to the z.f.t.

410
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,902
Speak to me.

411
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:31,172
We analyzed the document loeb brought back from frankfurt.

412
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,931
We figured out each line corresponds to an fbi case file

413
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:36,431
And an i.d. number for the agent or agents

414
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,773
Assigned to it.

415
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:41,203
Every one of them originating from this field office.

416
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,973
Another mole in this office?

417
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,602
And you think what?

418
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,101
John scott? he was working with z.f.t.?

419
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:47,730
Maybe. maybe not.

420
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,902
Whoever did this needed upper level security clearance.

421
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:52,771
Access to the fbi mainframe.

422
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:54,330
You said local connection.

423
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,032
Yeah  one of the lines is a phone number

424
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,802
Registered to a joseph smith and we have him tied...

425
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,901
Yeah  I know joseph smith.

426
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,870
Loeb was briefing me on him when he collapsed.

427
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:04,902
You got an address?

428
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,970
Hold on.

429
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,232
4331 broad street  saugus.

430
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:11,330
4331 broad street.

431
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,173
I'll call you back.

432
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:15,732
This is broyles.

433
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,801
I want a swat team surrounding joseph smith.

434
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:20,801
He's at 4331 broad street in saugus.

435
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:23,073
And I want this radio silent.

436
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,733
It's good to see you again.

437
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:35,103
Despite the strange circumstance.

438
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,300
You don't have to wait with me.

439
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:40,260
As you keep telling me.

440
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,900
I want to.

441
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,302
I really like it here.

442
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:48,533
Thank you.

443
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,533
I'm surprised.

444
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,003
He'll see you.

445
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,400
But not until tomorrow morning.

446
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,701
This is not jones' rule or mine.

447
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:06,003
This is the institution's.

448
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,262
Long before I got here

449
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:10,363
There have been strict regulations regarding visitors.

450
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:13,232
Tomorrow morning  you'll have 14 minutes.

451
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:16,230
Not a second more.

452
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,870
Mr. jones wanted you to have this.

453
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:31,232
Hello.

454
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:32,262
Peter  it's me.

455
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,261
I'm looking for broyles. is he there?

456
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,770
No  he's on some sort of raid.

457
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,533
Jones has agreed to meet with me tomorrow morning.

458
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:40,300
But only on the condition he talks to some guy first.

459
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,471
So we're looking for a guy local to boston.

460
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:43,672
He's in saugus.

461
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,172
He's in what?

462
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:47,200
His name's joseph smith.

463
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,930
At 4331 broad street.

464
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:51,202
How'd you know that?

465
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,133
That's who broyles is after right now.

466
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,330
What?

467
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:56,533
-How? -I-I don't know.

468
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,601
Peter  we need him alive.

469
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,172
Are you there?

470
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:06,331
No. I'm on my way.

471
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,703
You get in touch with broyles yet?

472
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,332
No  they're still radio silent.

473
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:11,570
I'm gonna call hq. I'll call you right back.

474
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:23,361
I know they're radio silent

475
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,900
But you've got to get someone down there right now.

476
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,900
Please  you need to get the message to them.

477
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,301
They need to keep joseph smith alive.

478
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,070
Damn it.

479
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,032
You must stand back  sir. I've got information.

480
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,031
To phillip broyles. you need to get back.

481
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,261
You are not authorized to get any closer to the house!

482
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:53,002
Are you close?

483
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,201
Yeah  I'm here

484
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,632
But I can't get any closer to the house.

485
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,770
They're already inside.

486
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,632
On the roof. on the roof.

487
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,902
Oh  no.

488
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,473
What? Peter.

489
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:04,132
Freeze! FBI!

490
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,772
Stop or we'll shoot!

491
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,732
Drop your weapon!

492
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,732
No  no  no  no!

493
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,070
Peter.

494
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,970
Peter.

495
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:19,272
Have the evidence response team

496
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,903
catalog and box every item down to the toilet paper.

497
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,632
Bishop  What are you doing here?

498
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,573
Well  I just got off the phone with olivia.

499
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,202
She's headed back to the airport.

500
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,930
Turns out Mr. Jones would only help us

501
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,602
If he could talk to Mr. Smith.

502
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:34,602
The same Mr. Smith that your people just killed.

503
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,062
You're kidding me.

504
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,703
That's the first serious thing I've said all day.

505
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:42,633
Hello.

506
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:43,873
Peter. hey  it's Astrid.


508
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,932
That there is fluid accumulating in agent Loeb's lungs.

509
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:49,672
Tell him we need help quickly.

510
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:50,873
He says we need help quickly.

511
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:54,772
Insert this into his iv. Let me talk to him.

512
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:56,970
Uh  hello  Peter. this is me  your father.

513
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:58,601
Walter Bishop.

514
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:00,330
Thank you  Walter. I know who you are.

515
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:01,673
Excellent.

516
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:03,670
Uh  we need to talk to that man Smith right away.

517
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:05,731
He may be our best chance

518
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:07,333
To save Agent Loeb's life.

519
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:08,632
I know that  but he's dead.

520
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,301
He was shot. we're out of luck.

521
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,161
Well  does he still have his head?

522
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,373
Is it still attached to his body?

523
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,933
Only you would ask that question seriously.

524
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:17,273
Yes  he still has a head.

525
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:18,533
Splendid.

526
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,572
Then perhaps in this case

527
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,700
Death is simply an inconvenience.

528
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:24,373
Bring him in and hurry.

529
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,631
Agent Loeb's tissue is already deteriorating

530
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:28,832
Which makes it exponentially messier.

531
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,160
What?

532
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,872
So close.

533
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,730
You never did lose well.

534
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:54,103
What happened  olivia?

535
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:55,731
There is something that has...

536
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:59,371
Shifted in you.

537
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:00,503
Something's happened.

538
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:04,571
Well  a lot has happened.

539
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,200
It's been a strange time.

540
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,503
I wasn't gonna say these words.

541
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:16,731
But here we are  so I'm gonna say them.

542
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,061
I've become... and I am not kidding...

543
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,973
A spectacular cook.

544
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:28,400
Spend the night.

545
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,603
I can't  Lucas.

546
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,831
Of course you can.

547
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:47,271
Of course you can.

548
00:26:58,777 --> 00:26:59,771
Dunham.

549
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:01,002
Does Jones know about Smith?

550
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,270
What

551
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:04,330
Does David Jones know that Joseph Smith is dead?

552
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,131
No. why?

553
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,872
'cause if you can still get in to see him tomorrow

554
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,430
He may not have to.

555
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:13,433
Oh good. uh bring him down here so quickly.

556
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,001
Get me ice. you already asked.

557
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,971
And the halo head brace. it's right over there.

558
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:18,001
We got it from here. thanks.

559
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:19,130
Uh  did I ask...

560
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:21,670
To put salt water in the trough. yes.

561
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,301
90 kilograms. not a drop more.

562
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,303
He's been shot in the head.

563
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,370
Is that a problem?

564
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,933
Yes  that's a problem.

565
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:34,330
Of course it's a problem!

566
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:36,972
A bullet in the head would normally indicate

567
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:38,301
Significant brain trauma.

568
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,930
Well  it would also indicate that he's dead.

569
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,603
But you didn't seem to have a problem with that.

570
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,770
This procedure is not like removing tonsils.

571
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,633
I've never had a conversation with a dead guy before.

572
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:47,333
Forgive me if I don't know the rules.

573
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:48,670
Is this going to work or not?

574
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,302
I'll need to alter the procedure.

575
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,670
And I'm not making any promises.

576
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:00,472
86 degrees  dr. bishop.

577
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,733
Good. almost there.

578
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:05,570
Let me know when it's exactly 84.5. blue.

579
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:08,831
The human braiis like a computer. green.

580
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,162
Just needs electricity to function

581
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:14,202
Which the body ceases to produce upon death.

582
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,271
Which is why we're keeping

583
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:21,502
His body cold to retard degeneration.

584
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:29,001
It's astonishing how this man's scalp resembles...

585
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:32,130
Peter's bare bottom when he was a baby.

586
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:33,501
How did you know that?

587
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,773
You told us that already. twice.

588
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:38,673
What did I say next?

589
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,331
That we're gonna kick-start his brain.

590
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,903
Ah  yes!

591
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,203
Excellent.

592
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:46,972
Conductive gel to prevent the electrical current

593
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,102
From setting him on fire.

594
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:49,431
Spread it evenly.

595
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:52,401
And don't forget his nipples.

596
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,202
Oh  peter!

597
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:02,831
In '75 the fbi asked me to use this procedure.

598
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:05,671
Someone had been murdered.

599
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,273
But I don't recall his name.

600
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:10,900
Hmm. James  I believe.

601
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:12,370
James. jamie.

602
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,503
Jimmy. They want me to identify his assessee.

603
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:16,731
Union leader I think.

604
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:18,233
Jimmy Hoffa?

605
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:20,133
Yes.

606
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,701
Well the... the trouble was

607
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:24,771
He had a shockingly low electro-sensitivity.

608
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:26,770
When I turned on the machine

609
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:29,503
It instantly fried his brain like an egg.

610
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,233
Everyone has a unique tolerance to electrical stimulation.

611
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:35,473
Mine for instance is remarkably high.

612
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:37,432
Yours peter unusually low.

613
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:39,832
As for our friend here  we don't know.

614
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:42,200
Too little current  and it won't work.

615
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:45,101
Too much  and we will overcook his brain.

616
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:46,102
So I will have...

617
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:48,103
You used to do this to me.

618
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:49,471
You attached wires to car batteries

619
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:50,530
And then you would shock me.

620
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,630
Yes  I was accumulating data.

621
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:55,772
No  you were experimenting on me.

622
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:58,001
Son  we're ready.

623
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:00,900
First we must test if this

624
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:04,603
will register any brain activity.

625
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:07,830
And this will indicate

626
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,303
If he's transmitting any thoughts to you.

627
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:11,631
Since he's dead  peter

628
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:14,901
You'll obviously have to be his ears and mouth.

629
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:17,633
Eventually  we'll connect this to your head.

630
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:19,062
Okay  dear  we're ready. turn it on.

631
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:22,870
Try 200 microvolts.

632
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:34,902
Oh  look  peter.

633
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:38,202
He's talking to you.

634
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,833
I suppose it's a good thing it wasn't attached to your head.

635
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,971
Not kidding. looked into it.

636
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:52,971
You have not. I have.

637
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,771
So... mm?

638
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,301
Who was he?

639
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:05,800
Whoever it was who broke your heart.

640
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:09,332
Or am I misreading you?

641
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:18,503
He was my partner from the bureau.

642
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,532
And you of all people should know

643
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:23,473
That I've always been a little inept at this.

644
00:31:23,476 --> 00:31:27,502
But he was straight forward  decisive

645
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:31,701
Charming  and it was wonderful.

646
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:35,130
Except it was all a lie  and he betrayed me.

647
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:37,573
Betrayed the job.

648
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:40,371
Then he died.

649
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,873
That's the end.

650
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:51,730
That's the end for him.

651
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,732
I've known this for years.

652
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:01,601
I screwed up

653
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,273
With you.

654
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:05,230
The timing wasn't right for either of us.

655
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,570
Yes  it was. I know it was.

656
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:11,273
But I was scared.

657
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,272
And that's the... that's the god's honest truth.

658
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,931
I think about you...

659
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:25,332
So often and...

660
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:29,433
I don't call because...

661
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:32,603
Because I'm ashamed of how I treated you.

662
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,672
No  it was just...

663
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,673
Lucas  i...

664
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:27,672
I...i have to...

665
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,702
I have... I have to get this.

666
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,830
I hate whoever that is.

667
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:35,301
Hello.

668
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:36,970
Hey. you're not gonna believe this

669
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,060
'cause I'm not really sure that I do.

670
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,233
But I think this might actually work.

671
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,933
Walter figured it out?

672
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:44,403
Well  there are limits. some issues and problems.

673
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,233
But walter seems to think we can get the dead guy

674
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:47,400
To answer some questions.

675
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:48,471
Then we're on.

676
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:50,232
I'll call you from the prison.

677
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,872
8:00 a.m. tomorrow  my time.

678
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,703
You okay?

679
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:57,903
I'm good. thank you.

680
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:06,971
I'm gonna go back to the hotel.

681
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,872
Grateful to you

682
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,970
To the incredible cooking

683
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:16,233
And your sweet words.

684
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,732
Do you hear anything?

685
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,160
I think we gotta ask him a question first.

686
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:37,503
I see.

687
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,333
Are we ready to see how this is working?

688
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:40,500
When I say go

689
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:44,031
You  astro  ask peter a question.

690
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,931
I will flip the switch which will stimulate

691
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:48,502
Our naked friend's brain.

692
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,800
And peter you will hear his response.

693
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:50,833
Any questions?

694
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:52,471
Uh  yeah. what should I ask him?

695
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:54,533
Anything you like. it's only a dry run.

696
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,573
And  son  I should apologize in advance.

697
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:58,932
I'm afraid this...

698
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:00,773
Well I shouldn't frighten you.

699
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,603
No. wouldn't want to do that.

700
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:06,433
3  2  1.

701
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:07,700
Go.

702
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,931
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

703
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:13,532
Anything?

704
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:16,331
Did I hear anything? no.

705
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:22,132
3  2  1. go.

706
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:24,133
What's your favorite color?

707
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:29,063
Nope. still nothing. just extreme discomfort.

708
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:31,002
Hello.

709
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,673
They're taking me to see jones now.

710
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:34,202
It's olivia. they're taking her in.

711
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:35,600
No. we're not ready yet.

712
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:36,932
No  no  no. tell her she has to stall.

713
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:37,933
Did you hear that?

714
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,200
I'll do what I can

715
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,933
But I've only got 14 minutes starting now.

716
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:43,733
14 minutes.

717
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:03,400
What a pleasure this is.

718
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,473
We have your mr. smith in custody.

719
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,300
You will not speak with him directly.

720
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,271
You will ask me one question that you want answered.

721
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,833
I will relay that question to an agent back in the states

722
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,601
Who will talk to mr. smith.

723
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,500
I will then relay mr. smith's response to you.

724
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:28,001
Then you will tell me how to save agent loeb.

725
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,633
That is how it works.

726
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:35,272
You're very serious  do you know that?

727
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,232
Your friend's life hangs in the balance

728
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,233
Is that it?

729
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:41,231
And you want me to save him.

730
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:45,233
I gathered as much from your note.

731
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,702
Tell me something.

732
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,303
Why not your freedom

733
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:52,601
Or extradition?

734
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,603
You must realize that you have leverage here.

735
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:58,433
Yet all you want is the answer to one question?

736
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:01,632
You make two assumptions  ms. dunham

737
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,832
Both incorrect.

738
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,531
The first is that there is nothing more valuable

739
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:09,002
Than my freedom.

740
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:12,031
The second is that I am responsible

741
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:15,672
For the infection of agent loeb.

742
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,632
Hello  gene.

743
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,500
Shh. not a word.

744
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:29,833
I think I know your problem.

745
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:31,531
You think too much.

746
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:33,600
It's a family curse.

747
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,370
Your own brain function is interfering

748
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:36,433
With the process.

749
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,270
You need to be a passive receiver.

750
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:39,672
This is a sedative.

751
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:42,173
It will numb your higher brain function.

752
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,631
I've mixed it with a euphoria inhibitor

753
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:47,503
Which will clear the high from your system

754
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:48,761
In a matter of minutes.

755
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,863
If I tell you to  stick this in his chest right here.

756
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:52,973
Beneath the breast bone.

757
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,133
what is that?

758
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,300
Adrenaline. why  walter?

759
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:57,832
Are you planning on stopping my heart?

760
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:59,432
Walter  what are you giving me?

761
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:01,131
Nothing for you to worry about.

762
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:04,732
Perfectly harmless.

763
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,803
What is going on in here?

764
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:15,830
Mitchel!

765
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:20,703
If you're not responsible

766
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:23,173
For infecting agent loeb  who is?

767
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,030
Perhaps the same people responsible

768
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,933
For bringing us together.

769
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:32,472
What if someone wanted information

770
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:35,431
From the both of us?

771
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,932
Do you see?

772
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:41,900
Perhaps they've orchestrated all of this.

773
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:44,572
What if you and i...

774
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:49,101
Both of us  at this very moment

775
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,070
Were being manipulated?

776
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:53,400
By whom?

777
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:54,930
And what would they want?

778
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:59,401
You've not been doing this very long  have you?

779
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:01,833
There are very few things in life

780
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:04,331
That surprise me anymore  ms. dunham.

781
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:07,430
And yet  I confess  I am confused.

782
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:13,730
If it is so urgent to save

783
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,300
The life of your friend

784
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:18,371
Why haven't we gotten on with it?

785
00:39:18,377 --> 00:39:19,500
Peter.

786
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:22,272
Peter  can you hear me?

787
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,802
This can't possibly be scientific.

788
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:26,933
Peter  look at me.

789
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,733
Daddy?

790
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:40,231
Hmm. I think we're ready.

791
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,130
Hello. go. quick.

792
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,270
Go ahead. ask your question.

793
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:57,803
Ask my friend joe...

794
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:59,761
Where does the gentleman live?

795
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,432
Mr. jones would like to know

796
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:08,303
Where does the gentleman live?

797
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:10,470
Three.

798
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,302
Mitchel! oh  god.

799
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:16,473
What is it? parasite in his bloodstream choking him of oxygen.

800
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:17,973
Asteroid  nitroglycerine in a vial on the desk.

801
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,003
Wait a minute. I don't understand. a parasite?

802
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,373
Could you give us some room  please?

803
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,530
I'll call you back.

804
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,132
Come on  sam  let them do their job.

805
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,230
Is there a problem?

806
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:40,072
My phone doesn't get the best reception

807
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:42,672
In prison isolation cells.

808
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:48,630
You do have mr. smith  do you not?

809
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:51,231
I'm curious.

810
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:53,132
Why do you think he would cooperate with you

811
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:55,302
After you had him arrested?

812
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:57,831
Oh  the people I work with

813
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,102
Are loyal to the end.

814
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,573
Can you say the same?

815
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,302
Hello.

816
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:12,571
Okay  we're trying again.

817
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,331
Three, two, one. go.

818
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:15,832
Where does the gentleman live?

819
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:20,371
Do you hear anything?

820
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,103
No. no.

821
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,973
I'm going to have to increase the voltage.

822
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,970
I'm sorry  son.

823
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:29,760
Three, two, one. go.

824
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:31,203
Where does the gentleman live?

825
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:38,203
Uh-uh. nothing.

826
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:39,932
No.

827
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:47,603
Astrid  I need the answer now.

828
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,903
Agent dunham  it's not working.

829
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:58,100
I need paper.

830
00:41:58,108 --> 00:41:59,271
Paper! give me some paper.

831
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:00,432
Quick  quick. I see something.

832
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,971
Wait. hold on.

833
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:02,972
Untie my hand.

834
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:05,930
Quickly!

835
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:16,102
What is that?

836
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:22,020
I have no idea!

837
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,762
I need the answer now.

838
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:32,661
We don't have it yet. I don't think it's working.

839
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,731
Walter  what is this?

840
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:35,433
How do I know?

841
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:37,102
You saw it  not me.

842
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,570
He seems rather irritated with you.

843
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:45,700
Astrid  please. I have no time.

844
00:42:45,706 --> 00:42:47,801
I know. you have to hold on. I'm sorry.

845
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:49,070
Walter  what is it? do you see it?

846
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:50,070
It's there.

847
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:53,200
There's just something missing.

848
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,603
Obviously  horizontal lines.

849
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:56,930
There's literature on this.

850
00:42:56,935 --> 00:42:59,372
Misrepresentation of horizontal space

851
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,902
In unilateral brain damage.

852
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,331
Astrid  please  hurry.

853
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:06,470
I-i don't understand.

854
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:07,631
It's just a conjecture.

855
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:08,900
But the bullet may have destroyed

856
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:10,303
That part of the brain

857
00:43:10,308 --> 00:43:13,303
That...that helps process horizontal lines.

858
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:16,400
We are going to have to fill in the blanks.

859
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,701
God  astrid  I have no time.

860
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,233
I need the answer now  astrid! please.

861
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:33,232
Little hill. little hill?

862
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,370
Little hill!

863
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:39,831
Three parts mebendazole.

864
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:41,703
Two parts thermophilic hydrolase.

865
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:45,133
A syringe directly into the parasite.

866
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:47,901
Astrid  write this down.

867
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:49,571
Three parts mebendazole.

868
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:51,453
Two parts thermophilic hydrolase.

869
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,942
A syringe directly into the parasite.

870
00:44:03,536 --> 00:44:06,301
Walter. look.

871
00:44:06,306 --> 00:44:09,470
The roots. they're dying.

872
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:13,633
Well does that mean that...

873
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:15,171
Is... is mitchel gonna live?

874
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:17,633
Is... is he gonna be okay?

875
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:21,590
Yes my dear. I believe he will.

876
00:44:21,598 --> 00:44:23,241
Thank you.doctor bishop.

877
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,533
Jones asked me a question

878
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:34,803
About loyalty.

879
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,873
And something about the way he said it

880
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,501
It felt like he knew something.

881
00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:43,602
Like what?

882
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:47,071
Something about my partner betraying the bureau.

883
00:44:47,077 --> 00:44:49,170
I don't know.

884
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:55,370
You know  I have other means

885
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,371
Of gathering information about mr. jones.

886
00:44:58,377 --> 00:45:02,032
If you'd like me to use them.

887
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:07,103
Say yes  olivia.

888
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:09,370
It'll give me an excuse to call you again.

889
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:21,073
Mitchel  I understand that you're feeling

890
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:24,072
Far from 100%.

891
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:25,371
But while you were unconscious

892
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:27,532
We made a discovery.

893
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:29,870
That an organization with connections to the pattern

894
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:33,230
May have someone working for us on the inside.

895
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:34,903
John scott.

896
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:36,702
That was our first thought.

897
00:45:36,706 --> 00:45:38,433
But he would have needed to have higher clearance

898
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:40,233
Than scott was afforded.

899
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,100
We thought that perhaps you were talking to him

900
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,403
Because you might have discovered who that person was.

901
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:52,660
Scott's the only one I know of.

902
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:58,271
You're making me paranoid.

903
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:03,570
All I want to do is make you better.

904
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:04,733
I'll see you in the morning.

905
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:06,932
All right.

906
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,402
Please seeing you!

907
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,831
Sir.

908
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:21,273
How is he?

909
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,333
He's good.

910
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,762
The doctor here removed that thing

911
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:26,003
From his chest.

912
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:27,903
Walter made sure he saved it for him.

913
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:29,900
I bet he did.

914
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,503
But what about answers?

915
00:46:32,508 --> 00:46:35,301
The question jones asked smith.

916
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:37,171
And the response he got  "little hill"?

917
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:38,830
We know that agent loeb was infected

918
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:39,900
But we don't know by whom.

919
00:46:39,907 --> 00:46:41,530
Jones says it wasn't him.

920
00:46:41,538 --> 00:46:43,600
We don't know anything.

921
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,661
You have a problem agent nham.

922
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:48,930
You're not easily satisfied.

923
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:50,733
You want everything and you want it now.

924
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:53,601
In your mind  somehow a small victory is no victory.

925
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,271
What you did was save a man's life

926
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:56,733
But that doesn't land for you.

927
00:46:56,737 --> 00:46:57,800
Sir...

928
00:46:57,808 --> 00:46:59,572
I would tell you to snap the hell out of it.

929
00:46:59,576 --> 00:47:01,333
To stop whining about what you can't know

930
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:03,073
Can't control  can't change.

931
00:47:03,078 --> 00:47:05,231
I would tell you to get some sleep while you can

932
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:07,230
Because tomorrow  we'll do this all over again

933
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:08,663
And guess what

934
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,100
You'll have a million new answers

935
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,533
And a million and one new questions.

936
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:17,702
I would tell you those things  but I won't

937
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:20,763
Because your dissatisfaction

938
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:24,133
Is what makes you so damn good.

939
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:26,370
Someone I'm proud to say I work with.

940
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,203
Thank you.

941
00:47:33,606 --> 00:47:35,532
Now go get some sleep while you can.

942
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,030
Hey  how you feeling?

943
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:46,663
I should be asking you that.

944
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:48,763
Good job. thank you.

945
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:50,003
You too.

946
00:47:50,008 --> 00:47:51,633
You hungry?

947
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:54,201
After everything I saw today

948
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,372
No not at all.

949
00:47:55,377 --> 00:47:57,500
But I am thirsty.

950
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,901
Really really thirsty.

951
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:01,602
Me too.

952
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,473
Look at that.

953
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:08,471
Yeah  look at that.

954
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:27,230
They're gone.

955
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:30,871
So did it work what we did?

956
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:36,173
Yes. it led them back to Mr. jones.

957
00:48:36,178 --> 00:48:38,503
Did he ask the question?

958
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,070
And did we get the answer?

959
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:48,103
Little hill.
