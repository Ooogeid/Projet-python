1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,530
<i>God, it's cold.</i>

2
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,860
Gettin' too damn
old for this.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,400
Make sure that blast cap's
on tight.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,700
It's not the blast cap
I'm worried about;

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,794
it's my damn fingers.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,198
Stop your complaining.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,130
We fall behind schedule,
we violate our permit.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,000
Just a minute.
Almost there.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,463
<i>Zone one clear.
Zone two clear.</i>

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,730
<i>Zone three 
Zone four clear.</i>

11
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,860
<i>Got a squatter in zone five.
Getting him out.</i>

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>After that,
we're clear here, too.</i>

13
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>Zone six clear.</i>

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,860
Okay, people.
Building's clean.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,603
Wrap it up and get out.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>We're go for demolition
in three minutes.</i>

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,156
T-minus three minutes.

18
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:50,622
<i>So what's up, man?</i>

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,560
<i>Stateside diner,
meatloaf sandwich?</i>

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,985
Thinking steak and eggs
at Cora's.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,382
Well, we could always head up
Route Nine to Parkview.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,363
Sure.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,710
What?

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,808
"What?"

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,729
The waitress.
The brunette. What's her name?

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,700
Oh, Marcie?
No, I wasn't even...

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,930
I was thinking about
the lean corned beef.

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,208
Yeah, right,
the lean corned beef named Marcie.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,627
<i>Hold up.</i>

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,124
What's the matter?

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,479
You okay?

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,170
Dennis.

33
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,102
What's the problem?

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,378
Nothing.

35
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,659
I don't know.

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,361
- You swept it, right?
- Sure.

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,724
I just...

38
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:35,296
I don't know.

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,252
All of a sudden,
I got a weird feeling.

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,669
Yeah? Me too.

41
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,691
Mine's called,
"I don't wanna die looking at Dennis."

42
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:41,588
Come on, man.

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,281
Hey, radio Mike,
will ya?

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
Tell him I wanna do
another sweep.

45
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,944
<i>Come on, man,
where you going?</i>

46
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,215
<i>Dennis, they're holding
the countdown for us.</i>

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,868
- Damn it! Over here, let's go!
- Where we going?

48
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:59,008
I think we missed something.

49
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,536
The plans show
another room over here.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,433
Ahh,
this doesn't make sense.

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,300
<i>Phil, you got Dennis?
What's going on?</i>

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,630
<i>We don't have
a lot of time.</i>

53
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,409
Just two more minutes.
We'll be right out.

54
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,300
- Do you hear that?
- What?

55
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:15,623
Sounds hollow.

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Come on, man, this place
has been completely prepped.

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
There's nothing
underneath there.

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Just solid foundation.

59
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,607
Does that sound
solid to you?

60
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,500
It's probably
just frost damage.

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,914
The... the
concrete's cracked, man.

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,377
Ohh!

63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,533
Mike, I think you should
come down here.

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,362
This...
was definitely not in the blueprints.

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,885
God,
and what's that smell?

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,623
<i>What do you think
this was?</i>

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,110
<i>I don't know,
but it's old.</i>

68
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,740
<i>Well, good,
that narrows it down.</i>

69
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,658
<i>What the hell?</i>

70
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,372
Oh, my God!

S01E15:
Inner Child

74
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,530
Ella?

75
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,215
Mommy gets grumpy
if I wake her too early.

76
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:40,851
She always did.

77
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,560
Mm, come on.

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,578
Oy, oy, oy.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,674
Well,
do you want some...

80
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,341
Pancakes?

81
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,360
- Yes.
- Yeah? Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:54,923
<i>Francis.</i>

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,460
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,758
How are you, buddy?

85
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,560
I saw that
your mayor got himself

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,016
into a
little bit of trouble.

87
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,916
That couldn't have been
fun for you guys.

88
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,789
When?

89
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,703
Has anyone taken anything
from that fax

90
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,168
- in the last five minutes?
- <i>Yes, sir. It's here.</i>

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,289
I'll call you back.

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,410
Ugh, Liv, I'm sorry.

93
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,517
I told her to
let you sleep late.

94
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,621
Oh, she did until 6:17.

95
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:35,574
Yup,
that sounds late for her.

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,881
Which one?

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,783
Uh, the yellow one.

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,030
Aunt Liv?

99
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,890
Definitely the yellow.

100
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,427
Did you tell her?

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,436
- Go get dressed.
- <i>Okay.</i>

102
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,709
What?

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,403
We went
apartment hunting yesterday.

104
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,382
Really?

105
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,981
You're thinking of moving to Boston?

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,260
Yeah, well,
Ella loves it here,

107
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,815
and so do I, so...

108
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, you know
that you can stay here

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,875
for as long
as you want.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,430
I know,
but you don't need

111
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,463
a little creature waking
you up at 6:17 every morning.

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,854
If that little creature
is Ella, I am fine with it.

113
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,150
Hello.

114
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,083
It's me.

115
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,072
The Artist is back.

116
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,224
How do you know?
Did we receive another fax?

117
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,923
Yeah.

118
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,564
<i>Hartford office
got one too.</i>

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,856
<i>Well,
did we get a trace?</i>

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,872
Said from a
copy store in Allston.

121
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,022
<i>So I've got
Mason and Louis headed over</i>

122
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,415
<i>to question the employees,</i>

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,982
<i>see if someone can give us a
description of whoever sent it.</i>

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,674
Okay, I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.

125
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,041
Some new horrifying event

126
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:36,060
you're not allowed
to tell me about?

127
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,081
Yeah.

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,522
Okay,
now it's gonna be 14.

129
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,605
<i>Excuse me,
Agent Dunham?</i>

130
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,500
- Oh, hey.
- <i>Get the Bishops soon.</i>

131
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,906
<i>I need you to meet me
at Children's Hospital.</i>

132
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,512
Actually, I just had an
old case reopened, and I...

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,517
<i>It can wait.</i>

134
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,931
<i>After the
boy was found,</i>

135
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:57,079
<i>construction crews performed
a search of the tunnels.</i>

136
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,494
It was determined
they'd been

137
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:00,550
sealed shut
for at least 70 years.

138
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,979
The place
was a sarcophagus.

139
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:04,686
The only living things down
there were rats, insects...

140
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,507
<i>And him.</i>

141
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,261
And we have no idea
how he got down there?

142
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,960
He's so pale.

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,160
<i>He seems to be developing
some sort of pigmentation.</i>

144
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,650
<i>Well, he probably hasn't
seen sunlight in years.</i>

145
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,971
Does he have a name?

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,297
<i>He hasn't spoken a
word since he was found.</i>

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,370
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?

148
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,177
<i>Perhaps.</i>

149
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,949
But first I need a piece of
special equipment.

150
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,430
My turntable.

151
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,088
Is that some kind of
lab equipment?

152
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:37,670
No, a turntable.
Record player.

153
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,520
You enjoy music,
don't you, Mr. Broyles?

154
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,446
<i>Well, imagine the
agony of having</i>

155
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:48,660
<i>an extensive record collection,
and having no means to play it.</i>

156
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:50,260
The agony.

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,664
I'll have someone
get right on that.

158
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,750
It's Doctor Wenick.
Chief of Pediatrics.

159
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:04,135
Look, I understand your agency's
taken an interest

160
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,114
in this child, but he's
been through quite a trauma.

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,317
Is he sick?

162
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,492
Not as far as
we can tell, but...

163
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,033
he's having difficulty breathing.

164
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,335
<i>We need to
administer oxygen.</i>

165
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,636
No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't do that.

166
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,106
You said the tunnel was sealed,
is that correct?

167
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,910
<i>Well, then it's obvious
that the child</i>

168
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:22,160
was trapped in a low-oxygen
environment for so long

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,860
<i>that his body
adapted to it.</i>

170
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,360
<i>And that is why he's
having trouble breathing.</i>

171
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,482
I don't think so.

172
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:27,856
Unless you have an
IQ higher than mine,

173
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,618
I'm not interested in
what you think.

174
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,800
<i>Administering additional
oxygen at the stage</i>

175
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,130
<i>would simply
cause his lungs</i>

176
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,643
to fill with fluid and
drown him where he lies.

177
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,580
We need to
deprive him of oxygen.

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,294
Get him a nasal cannula

179
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:48,098
and a tank with
low oxygen content.

180
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,441
Perhaps 5% to start.

181
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,033
A griffin.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,781
'Scuse me?

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,313
Your tattoo.

184
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,401
<i>The body of a lion,</i>
and the head of an eagle.

185
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,508
That's a griffin, right?

186
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,455
Just picked it
outta the sample book.

187
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,112
Thought it looked cool.

188
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,433
Oh, well.

189
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,062
A nice choice.

190
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,527
Did it hurt much?

191
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,760
I always imagined getting a
tattoo would hurt real bad.

192
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,955
It's a good pain.

193
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to embarrass you or any--

194
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,030
You didn't.

195
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,841
Hey.

196
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,817
Do you need a hand?

197
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,854
Uh, thanks,
I got it.

198
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,954
Um, actually, you know,
a-a little help would be great.

199
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,533
<i>Cool motorcycle.
What make?</i>

200
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,057
'67 Harley Shovelhead.

201
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,206
She's a beauty.

202
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,630
Yeah, she is.

203
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,890
Any minute, now.

204
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,265
It worked.

205
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,082
You'll want to increase
the oxygen flow by 10%

206
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:12,200
every hour,
'til he acclimates.

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,330
<i>So you said
that he hasn't talked.</i>

208
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,836
How do we know
he can hear?

209
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,130
He responds to sound.

210
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,551
<i>And we examined
his tympanic membrane,</i>

211
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,769
<i>there's no physical damage.
In fact...</i>

212
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,208
Considering how he was found,
he seems fairly healthy.

213
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,020
His heart sounds fine,
his blood pressure's strong.

214
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,463
And how do we think
he survived down there?

215
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:32,245
- I mean, what did he eat?
- <i>Rats.</i>

216
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,711
I'd think.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,457
Moss, insects.

218
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,810
High in protein.

219
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,980
Tastier than you may think,
especially millipedes.

220
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:43,571
Although they all lack
certain minerals

221
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:46,038
which may account for
his follicular dilemma.

222
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,518
His baldness.

223
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,702
Have you performed
a urinalysis?

224
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,086
We haven't been able to.

225
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,787
<i>We've been feeding him,</i>
intravenously.

226
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,823
He hasn't relieved himself
since he arrived.

227
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,624
Can't say I blame him for
not wanting to try this.

228
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,094
This looks worse than the dreadful food
they served at St. Clare's.

229
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,368
You were on staff 
at St. Clare's Asylum?

230
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,370
No, no, no,
not a medical doctor.

231
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,871
I was a patient.

232
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,869
- Got such a sense of humor, huh?
- Hmm?

233
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,838
<i>Walter,
what do ya say we keep</i>

234
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:13,151
<i>those old St. Clare's
stories to ourself, yeah?</i>

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,775
Hello.

236
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,284
My name's Olivia.
What's yours?

237
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,298
It's my phone.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,014
It's Charlie.

239
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,027
Hi. I'm, uh,
still in the hospital.

240
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,897
You won't remember this,
Peter,

241
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:43,800
but you didn't
<i>talk much either, as a child.</i>

242
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,460
- Could you get me the address?
- <i>In fact, you were quite shy.</i>

243
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,862
What's it say?

244
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:34,113
Sam Gilmore.

245
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,018
He can write?

246
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,664
Is that your name?

247
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,710
<i>I'll see what we have on any</i>
Sam Gilmores in Massachusetts.

248
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,634
<i>The body was found just
after 6:00 pm.</i>

249
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,252
This part of the park's usually
empty this time of the year.

250
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,751
Couple of kids were using it
as a shortcut when they found her.

251
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,298
<i>Definitely the work
of the Artist.</i>

252
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,565
<i>He clearly made alterations
to the body post mortem,</i>

253
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:59,849
<i>and put her out here for
the whole world to see.</i>

254
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,427
Here's what
we have so far.

255
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,559
<i>She's a local girl.</i>

256
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,036
<i>A process server
from Weston.</i>

257
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,786
<i>Next of kin is being notified by
local agents as we speak.</i>

258
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,070
<i>Samantha Gilmore.</i>

259
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:13,241
Wait,
did you say Sam Gilmore?

260
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,873
Yeah.
Samantha Gilmore.

261
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,164
You know her?

262
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,447
<i>Our perp's name
is the Artist.</i>

263
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,050
<i>Now, some of you here
may recall</i>

264
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,454
that we had our first encounter
with him three years ago.

265
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,970
He killed four women
in lower Jamaica plain

266
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,688
over a period of two days.

267
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,716
<i>After the fourth murder,
he stopped.</i>

268
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,120
<i>Are you holding
for Dr. Winnik?</i>

269
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,497
Uh, yes.

270
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,321
<i>- One moment, please.
- Samantha Gilmore, age 24.

271
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,648
Now, the killing bears all
of the Artist's trademarks.

272
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:47,282
His MO is to kidnap, sedate,
and kill his victims.

273
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:50,938
Then after he kills them,
using surgical tools and chemicals,

274
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:54,388
he, in his mind,
enhances their appearance.

275
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,761
<i>In this case,
he bleached her skin,</i>

276
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,921
<i>removed multiple piercings,
and dyed her hair,</i>

277
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,268
<i>I'll let Dr. Winnik
know that you called.

278
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,460
- <i>like the others...</i>
- Thanks.

279
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,343
<i>It was preceded with a faxed
invitation to view new work</i>

280
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,348
<i>that was to be displayed</i>

281
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,468
- <i>somewhere in public.</i>
- Anything yet?

282
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,152
No.

283
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:10,308
That was the hospital.
They're giving the boy an MRI.

284
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,906
When he's done, I'm gonna go in
and talk to him again.

285
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,126
In the meantime,
I've sent his picture

286
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,972
to Samantha Gilmore's
friends and family,

287
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,024
but, so far,
no one recognizes him.

288
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,628
You didn't really expect
that they would, did you?

289
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,374
No.

290
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:30,361
So let me ask you
the obvious.

291
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:31,833
What's the connection?

292
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,530
Amala and Kamala,

293
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,776
<i>the wolf girls of India.</i>

294
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,210
And... and, ah...

295
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,180
Marie-Angelique Memmie Leblanc,
the wild girl of Champagne.

296
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,474
They're all feral children who...

297
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,524
who grew up completely
isolated from human contact,

298
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:57,394
surviving, like our boy,
uh, for many years alone.

299
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,889
Yeah, but I'm guessing none of them
could write upside-down.

300
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,883
You're saying that the
boy grew up down there.

301
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,937
Well, based on the
blood work, yes.

302
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:09,530
I'm fairly certain that the
lack of Vitamin D, for one,

303
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:12,534
but also the complete
absence of lactobacillus...

304
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:14,493
Microorganisms
that help us digest.

305
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,945
- They're everywhere.
- <i>Precisely.</i>

306
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,019
<i>If the boy had spent any
time above the ground,</i>

307
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,497
<i>then he certainly</i>
would have absorbed those.

308
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,958
<i>But that still doesn't explain</i>

309
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,257
how he got there
in the first place.

310
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,427
You said that-that place had
been sealed off for decades.

311
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:29,286
The boy couldn't be
more than ten.

312
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,564
Well, he certainly
looks that.

313
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:32,019
You believe
he might be older.

314
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,086
Well, given the
environmental conditions...

315
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,048
the lack of
oxygen and light...

316
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,861
and their impact on his
biological development,

317
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,224
he could be
significantly older.

318
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,696
<i>But none of that explains</i>
how he knew Samantha Gilmore.

319
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:44,998
No.

320
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,609
<i>That I can't explain.</i>

321
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,138
<i>But good news,
Mr. Broyles.</i>

322
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,996
I have located my turntable.

323
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,339
So I-I don't need you to
purchase me one after all.

324
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,736
It was under
the sink in the john.

325
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,682
So obviously,

326
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,606
<i>I was sitting
on the toilet, and I--</i>

327
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:05,858
Walter, I think that's
probably enough information.

328
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:06,754
Agent Dunham.

329
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,060
We just got
another one.

330
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,870
<i>The Artist is going
after another victim.</i>

331
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:15,537
Easy, easy.

332
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,759
That's a beautiful dog.

333
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:20,227
- Thank you.
- <i>Is he friendly?</i>

334
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:21,055
Of course.

335
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,025
His name's Mack.

336
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,869
Hey, Mack.
Hey, Mackie.

337
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,643
<i>Hi, Mack.

338
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,435
<i>Hey.</i>

339
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,271
They, uh...

340
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,786
They told me that you haven't
eaten anything solid yet.

341
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,281
So I, uh...

342
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,878
I thought that
you might like these

343
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,571
more than the mystery meat.

344
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,384
When I was a kid,
I used to live on these.

345
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:07,230
Except the yellow.

346
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,251
Something about the color.

347
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,545
Reminded me of medicine.

348
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,418
You wanna try one?

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,337
<i>That's it. Good.</i>

350
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,439
Thank you.

351
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,842
Ahem.

352
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,632
Yesterday, you wrote down
a name for me.

353
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,351
Remember?

354
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,211
I thought today,
you could give me your name.

355
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,275
<i>You have a
real way with him.</i>

356
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,287
Elliot Michaels.
Department of Social Services.

357
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,389
Uh, Olivia Dunham, FBI.

358
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,037
Um, do you mind if I borrow
<i>Miss Dunham for a few minutes?</i>

359
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,045
I-I promise I'll bring her
right back.

360
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,474
I'll be just outside.

361
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,660
Dr. Winnik brought me up
to speed

362
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,254
about your interest
in the boy's case.

363
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,208
The circumstances
by which he was found

364
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,391
attracted our interest.

365
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,509
It's bizarre, huh?

366
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,400
Have you been able to find out
anything more about him?

367
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,876
You know, first name,
where he's from...

368
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,746
Uh, no.
I'm afraid not yet.

369
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,626
Well, I'm not gonna get
in your way.

370
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,953
I just thought I'd stop by
and see him

371
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,430
before I get the
ball rolling.

372
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,508
How so?

373
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,515
How so? Uh, well,
you know... physically, it...

374
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,833
<i>It doesn't seem as if there's
anything really wrong with him,</i>

375
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,890
<i>so I've arranged</i>
to have him moved.

376
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:10,942
Moved?

377
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,339
To a facility that can provide
the treatment he needs.

378
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,852
- When?
- Tomorrow.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,953
You know, I hope.

380
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,921
Assuming all the paperwork
is in order.

381
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,775
- What's wrong?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

382
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:35,123
His BP and his heart rate
are spiking.

383
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,329
It's okay, it's okay.

384
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:37,482
<i>Hey.</i>

385
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,476
It's okay.

386
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,333
Shh.
It's gonna be okay.

387
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,594
Oh...

388
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:46,940
Good...

389
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,700
<i>Should I get the doctor?</i>

390
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,030
- I-I think we're okay.
- Alright.

391
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,039
You okay, there?

392
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,442
Maybe if you just, uh,
gave us a moment.

393
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:02,523
- Of course. Just take your time.
- Thank you.

394
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,412
I'm at the hospital.

395
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,143
I think we may have
found another one.

396
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,496
I should let you get
some rest.

397
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,060
Anything so far?

398
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:49,844
I just got here
five seconds ago.

399
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,985
So what's the plan?

400
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,870
Start knocking on doors?

401
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,979
Unless you can think
of a better idea.

402
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,692
All right.

403
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,204
You go east,
I take west.

404
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,164
Okay.

405
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,289
<i>Shh...</i>

406
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,987
<i>Shh, shh, shh...</i>

407
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,581
<i>Shh...</i>

408
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,930
Shh, shh, shh.

409
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,681
Good. You are very good.

410
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:37,096
<i>Mind some company?</i>

411
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,374
Of course not.

412
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,361
Did I miss you last night,
or did you not even come home?

413
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,304
Uh, no.
You didn't miss me.

414
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,072
Have you eaten anything?

415
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,032
Uh, M&Ms.

416
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,538
Liv...

417
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,628
Do you like it?

418
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,656
Your job?

419
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,266
Yeah.

420
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,439
Most days.

421
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,412
Today,
not so much.

422
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,503
I followed a lead
that didn't pan out.

423
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,231
What about you?
Why are you up?

424
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,123
Um...

425
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,700
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,811
Hello.

427
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,580
We found our second victim.

428
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:37,750
<i>It's Kate Harper.</i>

429
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,450
Where?

430
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,374
<i>She's right outside</i>
St. Catherine's.

431
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,696
Surrounded by candles.

432
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:47,694
<i>Good news is we might have
finally caught a break.</i>

433
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:51,278
E.R.T. said they found some
blood underneath her nails.

434
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>So they're running it.</i>

435
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,637
Okay. I'll be right in.

436
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,098
<i>Just one more thing, Liv.</i>

437
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:59,004
The address the boy gave us.

438
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,646
Little while after we left,

439
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,118
a neighbor found a dog
tied to a fence.

440
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,805
It was whimpering.

441
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,389
<i>It was the victim's dog.</i>

442
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,440
We were there.

443
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,271
There's no way
we could've known, Liv.

444
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:16,031
But he was trying to tell us,
he was right and we were there.

445
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,458
Walter.

446
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,245
Olivia's here.
She needs to talk to ya.

447
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,165
Walter!

448
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,877
<i>Could she come back later?
I'm about to step in the bath.</i>

449
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,648
No, she can't come
back later.

450
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,763
It's the
middle of the night.

451
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,431
She needs to talk to you
right now.

452
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,630
Honestly, Peter,
can't a man get a...

453
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,087
Agent Dunham.

454
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,221
Peter, why didn't you tell me
Agent Dunham was here?

455
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,678
I'm pretty sure I did.

456
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,190
Well, what can I do
for you?

457
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,569
<i>Walter, it turns out that
the boy was right.</i>

458
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:51,067
He gave me a clue, but I didn't
know what I was looking for.

459
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,130
So do you have
any thoughts at all?

460
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,916
Any idea that how I can reach him
or how he's doing any of this?

461
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:00,644
I... I believe I know
how he's doing it.

462
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:03,751
Since he's been living
underground for so long,

463
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,600
his hypersensitivity
to light and sound...

464
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,506
It's just possible
he may also

465
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,912
be sensitive to
people's emotions.

466
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,910
A raw nerve.

467
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,611
Able to intuit the feelings
and intentions of others.

468
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,551
Your killer, for one.

469
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,181
So are you saying
that he's psychic?

470
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:23,460
No, no.
More a shark.

471
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,130
A shark?

472
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,700
Specifically,
their electromagnetic field,

473
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,430
which allows them to detect
their prey's bioelectric field

474
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,700
from a distance
of many miles.

475
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,137
We humans
have it too, of course.

476
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,275
<i>Pheromones.</i>

477
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:39,760
Undetectable chemicals
that nonetheless

478
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,098
affect our behavior,
our sex drive, our--

479
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,223
Hey, speaking of sex drive.

480
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,810
Oh, Peter,
don't be such a prude.

481
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,510
I'm sure Agent Dunham knows
what a penis looks like.

482
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:51,675
Don't you, Agent Dunham?

483
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,571
<i>My father,</i>
ladies and gentlemen.

484
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:56,167
But how would he know
things that I don't?

485
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:59,722
Know about the killer or
victims that he's never even met?

486
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:03,146
<i>My dear,</i>
there is much that is unexplained.

487
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,216
Until it is.

488
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,410
In short, he has no idea.

489
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:10,988
Even if you're right,
and he can sense the killer,

490
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,797
he can't tell me that.

491
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,260
Not in a way that I could
do anything about it.

492
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,000
Well, if that's the problem,
then there's no problem.

493
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,330
What does that mean?

494
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,300
Well, the boy is
obviously thinking, yes?

495
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,400
Having thoughts.

496
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,230
We just haven't been able
to hear them.

497
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,213
And I'm sure you
can do that, can't you?

498
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,400
Hear his thoughts.

499
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,410
Perhaps I can.

500
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:44,548
<i>Did you make that?</i>

501
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,416
<i>Hey.</i>

502
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,433
Listen, I wanna take you away
from here for a while.

503
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,195
Is that okay?

504
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,822
- <i>Super-genius--</i>
- Vintage Bugs Bunny.

505
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:24,861
<i>Ee, what's up, doc?</i>

506
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,269
Didn't get any better
than this, right?

507
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,879
- <i>A genius certainly has his--</i>
- Aha! I found it!

508
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:35,269
Neurostimulator.
Is there anything you can't do?

509
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,815
Walter, is that what
you're gonna use

510
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:39,960
to read the boy's thoughts?

511
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,700
Not to read them,
my dear.

512
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,160
To listen to them.

513
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,265
I wish you would have
told us

514
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:45,400
that that's what
you were gonna use.

515
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,013
<i>Why?</i>

516
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:47,460
'Cause you coulda saved us
the hassle.

517
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:49,886
You're not putting that medieval
torture device on that poor kid.

518
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,409
Walter, the last time
you used that thing,

519
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,630
you drilled it into
the guy's head.

520
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:56,055
If you think
he'll find it disagreeable...

521
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,260
- I suppose it could be modified.
- Really?

522
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,030
You didn't think to mention
that to the last guy?

523
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,139
It shouldn't be
too much trouble.

524
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,700
We merely need to intercept
the neural responses

525
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,184
<i>from the speech centers
of the boy's brain,</i>

526
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:10,899
<i>which can be achieved by</i>
placing electrodes in the halo ring.

527
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,600
<i>After that,
it's simply</i>

528
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,060
<i>a matter of
synthesizing the impulses.</i>

529
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,030
Think of it as creating
artificial vocal cords.

530
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:20,360
Simple.
Like makin' an omelet.

531
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,761
Actually, son, a good omelet
is far more complex. Eh?

532
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,686
We'll have him
talking in no time.

533
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,345
Where's the child
that was in this room?

534
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,060
He was discharged.

535
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,860
By whom?

536
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,930
Just remember
that you don't

537
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,460
have to do anything
that you don't wanna do.

538
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,071
If for a second
you're scared,

539
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:51,817
or you don't like
what's happening,

540
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:53,630
you just
squeeze my hand like that.

541
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,756
Okay?

542
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,216
Is he ready?

543
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,900
As ready as he'll ever be.
I guess.

544
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,230
<i>I've seen
that look before.</i>

545
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,018
Usually right before
somebody throws up.

546
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:07,530
<i>Agent Farnsworth,
ready?</i>

547
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,947
Walter,
what're you doing?

548
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,966
Watch and learn, son.

549
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,165
<i># Love and happiness #</i>

550
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,075
<i># Wait a minute #</i>

551
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,368
<i># Something's going wrong #</i>

552
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:35,460
<i># Someone's on the phone #</i>

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,830
<i># 3:00 in the morning #</i>

554
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,905
<i># Yeah #</i>

555
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:42,200
<i># Talkin' 'bout #</i>

556
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,160
- Ooh!
- <i># She can make it right, yeah #</i>

557
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,332
<i># Well #</i>

558
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,100
<i># Happiness is when #</i>

559
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,454
<i># You really feel
good about somebody #</i>

560
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,287
<i># There's nothing wrong #</i>

561
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,960

562
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,272
<i># Yeah #</i>

563
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,830
<i># Yeah, oh, baby #</i>

564
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,565
Nicely done, Walter.

565
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
<i>- Thank you.
- # Love and happiness #

566
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,699
<i>You can turn the music off now,</i>
Agent Farnsworth.

567
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,715
What's wrong?

568
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,706
What's going on in here?

569
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,660
Did you really think you
could just steal a child

570
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,960
out of protective custody

571
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
and that somehow
no one would notice?

572
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,930
Look, first of all,
I didn't steal him.

573
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,260
The child's assisting us in an
active criminal investigation.

574
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,660
Assisting you how?

575
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:47,130
No offense,
Mr. Michaels,

576
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,269
but that's
classified information.

577
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,100
The Department of Social Services

578
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,534
doesn't have clearance
to know that.

579
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:00,100
- What?
- Mr. Michaels isn't Social Services.

580
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,688
<i>He's with the CIA's Directorate
of Science and Technology.</i>

581
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,230
I'd have told you
earlier myself, but...

582
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,066
You don't have
clearance to know that.

583
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,733
<i>This morning,
we were informed</i>

584
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:12,913
 the D.S.N.T. will be taking full
custody of the child.

585
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,140
So they can what?

586
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,703
Study him?

587
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,412
This child was apparently
able to survive for years,

588
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,460
underground,
<i>in an oxygen-deprived environment</i>

589
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,766
<i>with no food or water.</i>

590
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,260
Surely you could see
how someone who doesn't

591
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
have his best interests at heart
might want to exploit that.

592
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,360
Oh, so you wanna take him
to protect him, is that it?

593
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,600
Forgive me for
sounding harsh,

594
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,730
but I don't buy that
for a second.

595
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,731
Dunham.
It's all right.

596
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:42,500
To be honest, it really
doesn't make any difference

597
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,853
what you think.
The boy's coming with me.

598
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,221
I'm afraid this is
above both of us.

599
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,630
<i>Agent Francis just called.</i>

600
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,060
He said we got another invitation

601
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,800
<i>from the Artist.</i>

602
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,919
Mr. Michaels,

603
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,163
suppose you give us one day.

604
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:03,462
A day?

605
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,830
<i>He could help us catch a
murderer and save a life.</i>

606
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,800
The boy would be
under my protection.

607
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,411
I'll personally
guarantee his safety.

608
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,019
If I agree to this,

609
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,174
then you'll turn the boy
over to me without a fight?

610
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,785
Do we have an agreement?

611
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,446
We do.

612
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,860
My very educated mother

613
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,822
just served us
nine pies.

614
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,939
No.

615
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,630
That's the planets
of the solar system,

616
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,800
or at least was.

617
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,034
You wanna
take a look at this?

618
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,160
His name is Roadblock.

619
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,000
He's not really one of
your top-tier G.I. Joes,

620
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,430
but it is the best we had.

621
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,360
- <i>Wait!</i>
- Huh.

622
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
It's funny,
I always remember

623
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,881
the scar being on
the other side.

624
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,860
You want him?

625
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,660
Cannot build phallic puzzles
in the lab.

626
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,430
What is he doing?

627
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,500
Mnemonics.

628
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,733
You know, like a rhyme
or phrase to help memory.

629
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,964
Like, uh, "HOME" stands
for the Great Lakes.

630
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,130
<i>That's Huron...</i>

631
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm familiar with it.
Why is he doing it?

632
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,530
Well, he is trying
to remember

633
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,130
which wires go into which
connections on the machine.

634
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,000
<i>Yeah, thanks, Charlie.</i>

635
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,308
<i>I will.</i>
Keep me posted.

636
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:32,351
More bad news?

637
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:33,975
<i>We got the
forensics report.</i>

638
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,863
We were hoping that

639
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,304
the blood we found under the
second victim's fingernails

640
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,430
was a match for the killer.

641
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,430
But no?

642
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,373
Not unless
<i>Gene is the killer.</i>

643
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,100
It wasn't human,
it was bovine.

644
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,588
You said cow blood?

645
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:46,686
Yeah,
and some plastic polymers.

646
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,030
How would someone
get cow's blood

647
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,430
on their fingers in Boston?

648
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:54,360
Astrid, could you contact
the Bureau of Animal Health?

649
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,500
We should start pulling

650
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
livestock licenses
around Boston.

651
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,250
Petting farms,
<i>research facilities, anything.</i>

652
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,300
- Yeah. Gotcha.
- She's a bad mamma jamma! Ha!

653
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,260
Alpha, beta,
<i>beta and gamma...</i>

654
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,125
<i>She's a bad mamma jamma.</i>

655
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,200
Signal amplification,
bifurcation,

656
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>modulation, juxtaposition.</i>

657
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,200
You hanging in there, kiddo?

658
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:16,577
<i>Vocal linguistic
impulses into magnets--</i>

659
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:17,437
Yeah, me too.

660
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:18,830
Peter, get me the red wires.

661
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,030
Peter.

662
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:22,660
Here's a thought.

663
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:26,300
A couple years ago,
I was working down in Tennessee

664
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,200
as a floor sweeper
at a meat packing plant.

665
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Sounds awesome.

666
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,903
You have no idea.

667
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,430
My point is:
We had these

668
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,730
big rolls of
industrial-grade plastic

669
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,730
that we used to wrap
their cuts of meat in

670
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,460
before we would send them
to the grocery stores.

671
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,060
Cow's blood in plastic.

672
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah.

673
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,858
Okay.
I believe we're ready.

674
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,660
- Peter?
- Yeah.

675
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,725
Yes.
<i>Listen to that.</i>

676
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,560
Listen to what, Walter?
That's just random noise.

677
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,760
No, that's
just the computer

678
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,800
calibrating the signal
to noise ratio.

679
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,100
Adjust the attenuation
setting to 70 decibels.

680
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,400
Okay, that sounds
a little more like a voice.

681
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,100
<i>Yes, now,</i>
the sound pressure level.

682
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,730
Eh, dial the
audio meter to 1,500 hertz.

683
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Slower, damn it,
go slower.

684
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,330
Okay, if you wanna do this yourself,
feel free.

685
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,560
No, there.

686
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,509
Astrid, quickly,
get me a tape recorder.

687
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:12,241
Walter, turn the
machine off right now.

688
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:13,330
<i>Turn it off now.</i>

689
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,800
He's freezing.
Help me get this off of him.

690
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,500
Hey, Astrid,
can you grab us a blanket?

691
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,460
- All right, free in the front.
- Here.

692
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,360
All right, we're gonna
get you warmed up.

693
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,474
Doesn't make any sense.

694
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,260
If anything, brain activity
should generate heat.

695
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,630
<i>We're trying to track down</i>

696
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,630
<i>a suspect in a
murder investigation.</i>

697
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,730
What, you mean the
guy on the news...

698
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,900
who killed those girls?

699
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,860
We're not sure.
Maybe.

700
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,715
But any past or present
employees that stick out to you?

701
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,160
Like antisocial behavior

702
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,500
or a history of violent
incidences here at work?

703
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,300
No. They're good men.
Hard workers.

704
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:49,660
I'm gonna need a copy of your
employee records, regardless.

705
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,732
Okay.

706
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:53,560
And also a sample of
your shipping plastic.

707
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,021
Plastic? Why?

708
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:58,600
It could be an element
in our investigation.

709
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,366
- Will that be a problem?
- No, but...

710
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,760
Mr. Wu?

711
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,391
A man came in here
yesterday,

712
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:13,828
and I...
I sold him some plastic.

713
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,893
Allow me.

714
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,005
Oh, thank you.

715
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,829
Your mother
raised you well.

716
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,123
<i>Hey, Peter, it's me.
I'm just leaving.</i>

717
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,089
So, how's the boy?
Has Walter made any progress?

718
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,800
<i>Hard to say;
we heard something,</i>

719
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,889
but I don't know if it
was the kid trying to talk.

720
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:44,630
Look, I don't want you
to get upset about this

721
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,000
because he is fine,

722
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,960
but something kinda
weird did happen.

723
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,230
Weird how?

724
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,760
<i>Well, he started shivering
all of the sudden.</i>

725
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,000
Like, the temperature dropped
30 degrees, except it didn't.

726
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
<i>Is he sick?</i>

727
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,300
No, he seems fine.

728
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,960
We got him wrapped up in a blanket.
He's doing okay.

729
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,660
<i>How 'bout you?
You find anything?</i>

730
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,600
Yeah, looks like
the Artist bought some plastic

731
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
from a slaughterhouse
in Roxbury.

732
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,130
I got his sketch,
all thanks to you.

733
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:05,900
Hey, guys.
We got good news.

734
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,300
What's that?

735
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,960
Turns out the plastic did
come from a meat packing plant.

736
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,930
Olivia got a sketch of the guy.
What about you?

737
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,530
You gonna go back to the FBI,
or you coming here?

738
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,000
Ask her if it was refrigerated.

739
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,330
- Hold on a second.
- Peter!

740
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,760
Ask her if
the plant was refrigerated.

741
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
It's a meat-packing plant
full of raw meat.

742
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,030
So yeah, let's go out
on a limb here

743
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,360
and say that it's
probably refrigerated.

744
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
What does that
even matter?

745
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,200
Because that
explains everything.

746
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,249
<i>Walter, slow down.
You're not making any sense.</i>

747
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,430
<i>Of course I am.</i>

748
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,500
<i>The boy...
Our strange, little friend...</i>

749
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,960
<i>is an empathy.</i>

750
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,560
<i>Yes.
He senses other people's emotions.</i>

751
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,628
<i>You already said that,
Walter.</i>

752
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,560
Go on, Walter,
what are you saying?

753
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,230
That he's capable of
making connections...

754
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,760
Emotional connections.

755
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,430
Uh, to a construction worker
who found him, the killer,

756
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,500
but most importantly,
he is emotionally bonded to you,

757
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Agent Dunham.

758
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,000
<i>That's why he's telling
you about the crimes.</i>

759
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,130
<i>Because he knows</i>

760
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,800
that the information
is important to you.

761
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,460
He's trying to help you.

762
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,300
Are you trying
to help me?

763
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,160
That man who's been
hurting people

764
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,022
is going to hurt someone else
unless I stop him.

765
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,460
Do you know
who he is?

766
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,604
Can you tell me
anything about him?

767
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,074
Maybe he doesn't know.

768
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,812
Or he can't control
the ability all the time.

769
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,460
Perhaps a small electric shock
to kick-start things.

770
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,164
No.

771
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,635
It's something different.

772
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,820
It's like
he's mad at me.

773
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:24,460
Because he doesn't
wanna leave.

774
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,756
What?

775
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,200
Well, you told Michaels
that once the boy

776
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,830
helped you stop the Artist,
you'd turn him over to him.

777
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:33,055
He heard you.

778
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,693
Or, more accurately,
felt you.

779
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,946
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,800
I've been so caught up in
what I needed that I forgot how...

781
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,188
strange
this must seem to you.

782
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,330
And I know how
scared you must be,

783
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,069
but I need your help again.

784
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:00,931
And I can't even stop
them from taking you.

785
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,430
Even though I wish I could.

786
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,940
And if you really can feel
what I'm thinking...

787
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,548
You know how much
I mean that.

788
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:44,492
Thank you.

789
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,953
Nice car, sir.
Where ya headed?

790
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,732
Uh, home.

791
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
<i>I was out to dinner.</i>

792
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,664
<i>Open the trunk,
please.</i>

793
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:05,304
It's clear.

794
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,237
Okay. Thank you.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

795
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,768
What's going on,
officer?

796
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,500
What are you doing
in the neighborhood, sir?

797
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,723
I... just, uh,
coming home from work.

798
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,292
Haven't had
anything to drink.

799
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,065
Would you mind
if I ask what you...

800
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:30,500
What you're looking for?

801
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,933
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're not allowed to say.

802
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,730
<i>Sir, we need to check
the back of your vehicle.</i>

803
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,400
<i>Charlie!</i>
Check the back of the van!

804
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,262
Liv, it's him.

805
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:28,000
We found the victim.
She's alive.

806
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,115
- You alright?
- Yeah.

807
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,600
Oh, God!

808
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,069
This is Francis.

809
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,873
I need E.M.S. at the cemetery
behind the 1600 block of York.

810
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,281
- Broyles.
- It's Olivia.

811
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,500
I need you to help me
with something.

812
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,046
Here. Here.

813
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,801
And then we just do
the blood work, okay?

814
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,440
Excuse me,
Dr. Winnik?

815
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:47,203
Yes.

816
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,493
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

817
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:51,433
Sure.

818
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:56,004
Hi.

819
00:44:57,793 --> 00:44:58,633
Hi.

820
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,433
I think you'll find
he's doing much better.

821
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:05,057
Hi.
Oh, thank you.

822
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,368
You remember
Dr. Winnik.

823
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,036
She's gonna take you now.

824
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,503
But not to a facility.
She's going to take you to a home.

825
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,004
With a very nice family
that are gonna take care of you.

826
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:26,915
And keep you safe.

827
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,630
We should go now.

828
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,736
Bye.

829
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
<i>What do you mean
he's gone?</i>

830
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:25,452
I'm sorry, Mr. Michaels.

831
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,560
Gone where?

832
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:29,907
Well, that's what
we can't figure out.

833
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,861
He disappeared from right under
the noses of protective detail.

834
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,714
How is that possible?

835
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,485
He's just a kid.

836
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,260
Yes.

837
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,460
A kid who,
as you said yourself,

838
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,100
lived his entire life
underground,

839
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,130
which still begs the question

840
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,536
how he got there
in the first place.

841
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm beginning
to suspect there's

842
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,895
a lot about him
we don't understand.

843
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,700
And apparently,
we never will.

844
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,860
<i>- You said it!
- No!</i>

845
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,260
<i>- I didn't! I didn't say it!
- Yes, yes, yes, you cheater!</i>

846
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,260
Waah!

847
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,875
Hi, Liv.

848
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,944
Mommy is so bad at Simon Says
<i>she won't even do what I say.</i>

849
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,243
<i>Four years old and</i>
she's drunk with power.

850
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:24,280
I have created a monster!

851
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,430
Do you wanna
play with us?

852
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,298
Oh, don't do that.
Let Aunt Liv rest.

853
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,530
Sure.

854
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,544
- I'm Simon.
- Okay.

855
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,157
Simon says,
"Put your hands in the air."

856
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:38,260
- Okay.
- Touch your nose.

857
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,313
You lost!

858
00:47:42,156 --> 00:47:44,480
<i>- Okay. Again, again.
- Simon says--</i>
