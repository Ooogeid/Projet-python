00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,290
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:05,602
A series of events has occurred. These
events appear to be scientific in nature.

3
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,318
It's been referred
to as the pattern.

4
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:11,238
We need to know what happened,
how it happened, and who's behind it.

5
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:12,928
Anybody you need, you can have.

6
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,345
His name's Walter Bishop.
He worked out of Harvard

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,183
in an area called fringe science.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,434
Step back!

9
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,956
You're telling me
my father was Dr. Frankenstein.

10
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:24,315
I have a job,
to defend our national security.

11
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:26,651
And I assure you, we are not secure.

12
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,619
When the threat is unimaginable,
that is when we are at the door.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,365
Hey, honey, I'm glad I caught you.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,268
<i>Where are you?
Did you make it?</i>

15
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:58,653
Airport lounge.

16
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,840
About to board in 15 minutes.

17
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>Nat, I know with mom being sick
and me traveling so much</i>

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,430
I feel bad.

19
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:08,542
I told you it wasn't gonna be
like this anymore.

20
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:11,028
<i>We'll just do something
next weekend when you get back.</i>

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,781
- <i>You're not upset?</i>
- No, I understand.

22
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,313
<i>Don't worry. If you have to work,
you have to work.</i>

23
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:17,819
Are you on your way home?

24
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,662
<i>There was some traffic,
I'll be home in about five minutes.</i>

25
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,573
Listen,

26
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:26,585
they just called my flight.

27
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,963
Have a safe trip.
Call me when you land.

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,268
I will.

29
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,086
Happy anniversary.

30
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:34,313
<i>I love you.</i>

31
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,649
I love you too.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,465
Randy, you're gonna get it.

33
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,378
Randy, you totally got me.

34
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,313
I had no idea.

35
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,698
Stop it. You're scaring me.

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

41
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,066
This doesn't make any sense.

42
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,411
There's no forced entry,

43
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:02,900
no signs of a struggle.

44
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,947
Walter do you have any thoughts?

45
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,491
Reminds me of Christmas.

46
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,829
Like a fire log that burns so hot
it remains intact,

47
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,655
holding the shape
of its former self.

48
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:19,170
You used to love that
when you were a child.

49
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,465
You'd poke the log with
your little finger when it had cooled,

50
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,636
and you'd draw genitalia
on the reindeer decorations.

51
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:27,886
Happy memories.

52
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,432
I think was do you have any thoughts
as to what happened to dusty here?

53
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,993
The seat cushions
have no scorch marks,

54
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:42,417
which rules out any form of fire
or spontaneous combustion.

55
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,528
So could he have been
dosed by something?

56
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,431
Yes, it's possible.

57
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,979
But before we can determine cause,

58
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:54,144
We need to find some way
to transport Mr. Dancik's remains

59
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,040
back to my lab. So...

60
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,627
Peter, I'll need a dust devil.

61
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,128
A vacuum cleaner?

62
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,174
Yes, you're right.
Well, we'll need several.

63
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,834
What do we know?

64
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,620
Randy Dancik.

65
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,759
His wife found him.

66
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,318
She thought he was
on a plane to Hong Kong.

67
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:21,857
But he stayed home to surprise her
for their anniversary.

68
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:25,278
Did this man happen to be a doctor
or work in a hospital?

69
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,988
No, he was an investment banker.

70
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,157
Has he visited a hospital
in the last 24 hours?

71
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:32,464
I can find out.

72
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,578
Why?

73
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,957
It's not the first time
I've seen this phenomenon.

74
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,133
Four years ago in DC, several victims
were turned to dust like Mr. Dancik.

75
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,502
By the time the killings ended,
there were five deaths.

76
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:58,936
Each of the victims
worked at or had recently

77
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,141
visited Tyson General down in DC.

78
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,692
After the third death, I was contacted
by an eastern european man.

79
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,209
He knew case-specific details.

80
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,526
Details that only the killer
would have known.

81
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,432
He offered to turn himself in,

82
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,838
but only if we could
decipher his formula.

83
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,249
What formula?

84
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,521
It's a molecular model.

85
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,555
Some kind of complex
organic compound.

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,449
I recognize a couple of these elements,
but the others I'm not so sure.

87
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,126
- What is it?
- Don't know.

88
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:36,682
He implied that solving it
Was the key to stopping the murders.

89
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:40,123
CDC and NIH chemists worked around
the clock, but couldn't break it.

90
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,250
There were two more victims,
and after that, he stopped

91
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,398
- and the trail went cold.
- Until last night.

92
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:47,627
I'm gonna get this
to Walter right away.

93
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:55,958
Thank you.

94
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:59,088
PD confirmed with Dancik's wife

95
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:01,499
that he visited his mother
in a hospital yesterday morning.

96
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,287
- Which hospital?
- Latchmere General.

97
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,820
The Latchemere Health Alliance
is actually made up

98
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:09,130
of three separate hospital campuses
and a network...

99
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,026
This is the location
we're interested in.

100
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,069
We need to review
all your employee records.

101
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:15,781
We're looking for an employee here
of eastern european descent

102
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,844
who may have also worked in a DC-area
hospital about four years ago.

103
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,579
We're looking for a match.

104
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,258
This is a warrant giving us
access to your network servers.

105
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,377
My agents will need
to take over this office.

106
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,039
Scuse me, Miss.

107
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,386
That is a man's remains
you're playing with.

108
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:39,659
Indeed.

109
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:42,374
Reduced to its most
elemental components.

110
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:43,716
Carbon and calcium.

111
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,577
One geiger counter.
Batteries replaced.

112
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:47,939
Thank you, my dear.

113
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,482
You think some sort of radiation
passed through him?

114
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,477
We all carry low amounts
of radiation.

115
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,155
The water we drink, the food we eat.
Seven rads or so.

116
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,628
But that equation describes something
organic and highly radioactive.

117
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:02,827
If it has anything to do
with the man's death,

118
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,582
then this man will be
in the mid to low hundreds.

119
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,872
This doesn't make any sense.

120
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,812
Even reduced to this state,

121
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:21,643
Mr. Dancik should have
some trace amounts of radiation.

122
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,536
Maybe it dissipated when he did.

123
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,564
It's unlikely.

124
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,157
He's right here. Hang on.

125
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,566
Thank you.

126
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,193
Has Walter made
any headway on the body?

127
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,327
Just that it doesn't
contain any radiation.

128
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:38,114
Otherwise it's just a pile of dust.

129
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,203
What about the formula?

130
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,675
<i>He hasn't cracked it yet, but he thinks
it may describe some kind of organism.</i>

131
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,620
<i>And...</i>

132
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,554
as of a couple hours ago,
he started referring to it as a "she."

133
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,403
Hold on a second. Here he is.

134
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:54,755
<i>The formula is</i>

135
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,949
a different matter entirely.

136
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,719
She's a complex chemical puzzle.

137
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,014
<i>What, I don't know.</i>

138
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,306
But can you solve it?

139
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,152
First I would need to break her

140
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:10,520
into her organic
and inorganic parts. And then...

141
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,424
Titanium tetrachloride.

142
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:25,661
You sly temptress.

143
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Me again.

144
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,921
Needless to say, he's into it.
I'll keep you posted.

145
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,257
<i>Thanks.</i>

146
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,132
What do we have?

147
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,664
We're indexing the employment records
for both hospitals

148
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:50,630
against any eastern european names.

149
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:51,855
Nothing yet.

150
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,206
You know, I can stay.

151
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:07,327
You should go home.

152
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:09,926
I'll wait.

153
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:21,320
Why'd the killer call you?

154
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:23,625
Was it just to taunt you?

155
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:26,374
Quite the opposite.

156
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:29,594
He was distraught.

157
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,066
Said he couldn't control it.

158
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,360
I got the overwhelming impression that
however he was killing these people,

159
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:38,813
he wanted it to end.

160
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,376
Until today, I thought maybe it had.

161
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,665
Something's going on.

162
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:47,433
Did you see anything?

163
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,150
- I want this floor sealed.
- Yes, sir.

164
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,557
We have a name.

165
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:54,601
Tomas Koslov.

166
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,796
He worked at the hospital in DC
and quit the week the murders stopped.

167
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,862
- How long till he started working here?
- About a month later.

168
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,649
He's a night nurse in the coma unit.

169
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:04,570
He never showed up
for his shift tonight.

170
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,782
Tomas Koslov?

171
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,069
Clear.

172
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:14,714
Clear.

173
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,951
He knew we were coming.

174
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:23,817
He must have seen us
at the hospital.

175
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,915
What do you think it is?

176
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,856
Soldering iron burns,
electronic components.

177
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,449
He was building something.

178
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:47,321
I understand.
Thank you for running it.

179
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,627
Tomas Koslov was an alias.

180
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:51,996
Nothing on that name
in any of our databases.

181
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,463
He forged his medical records
and previous employment.

182
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:56,747
We still know he's russian.

183
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,565
- Cyrillic letters?
- Tomas, whoever he is,

184
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,711
certainly didn't get that
from anywhere around here.

185
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:05,900
Prints?

186
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:09,576
- Good one.
- Run it through AFIS.

187
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,681
<i>I don't know how many more will die.</i>

188
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,250
<i>Isn't that up to you?</i>

189
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,684
<i>You have the power
over what happens next.</i>

190
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,157
<i>No, I don't.</i>

191
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,445
<i>You don't understand.</i>

192
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,840
<i>This won't stop until
you can solve that formula.</i>

193
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,503
<i>Now I know you are tapping my line,
so, agent, can you solve it?</i>

194
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,490
<i>You have ten seconds
before I hang up.</i>

195
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,247
<i>It's been analyzed.</i>

196
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,483
<i>The FBI, everyone, top men
and women in their field.</i>

197
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,181
<i>They simply need more time.</i>

198
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,432
<i>Maybe we should meet
someplace, you and I,</i>

199
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,628
<i>you can explain what it is
we're not understand...</i>

200
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,347
Come in.

201
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,124
Senator Van Horn's on line three.

202
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,908
What's so important we had
to meet face-to-face, senator?

203
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,447
Phillip, when you filed those
fingerprints on your suspect,

204
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:04,747
it went wide.

205
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,700
The Bureau, Homeland, CIA.

206
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,819
Flag went up in Langley.

207
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,853
They're gonna take this case from you
and demand you cease and desist.

208
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:14,948
I support interdepartmental
transparency 100%.

209
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,330
But this was my case four years ago,
and it will remain my case.

210
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,265
Your suspect is at
the center of an ongoing

211
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,379
international investigation
led by the Russian government.

212
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,503
- By that definition alone, it falls...
- Why are they searching for him?

213
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,837
CIA and the Russians?

214
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,843
What value does he have to them?
Who is he?

215
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,911
According to a statement made
by one of their deputy prime ministers,

216
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,059
he illegally removed some property
belonging to the Russian federation.

217
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,256
Property?

218
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,437
A weapon?
Is that what's killing these people?

219
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,680
I don't know. Within the last hour
this case has been

220
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,527
kicked three floors
above both our heads.

221
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,942
You're a sitting member of the
senate intelligence committee,

222
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,861
- a former FBI agent.
- I'm not CIA.

223
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,137
There was a time, Dennis,
that you would say that

224
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:56,450
as a matter of pride, not an excuse.

225
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:02,206
I understand what
this case means to you.

226
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,670
But I am sorry.
There is nothing I can do here.

227
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,810
Please give my regards to Patricia.

228
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:07,782
So this is all the surveillance
footage from the fourth floor.

229
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,637
Excuse me.

230
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,481
Where are you?

231
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:17,114
I'm at Latchmere hospital just going
over security footage from last night.

232
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,343
I've just been informed that the suspect
known to us as Tomas Koslov

233
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,629
is wanted by the CIA
and the Russian government.

234
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:24,830
The CIA is now handling the case.

235
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,333
And they just expect you
to hand it over?

236
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,877
But I intend to do no such thing.

237
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,014
<i>From this point forward,
don't put anything down on paper,</i>

238
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,423
<i>no documentation.</i>

239
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,894
Anything we need to say to each other,
we'll do it in person.

240
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,367
With all due respect, sir, I know
that this case is important to you,

241
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:43,937
but when we break the rules,
we've got you to protect us.

242
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:45,393
Who's gonna protect you?

243
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,401
<i>I'm afraid that if you don't comply
with a direct order...</i>

244
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,758
<i>I'm aware of the risks.</i>

245
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:51,783
Agent?

246
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,944
Hang on.
We might have something.

247
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:00,140
This is the adjacent hallway
to the crime scene.

248
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,353
This is 23 seconds
before the victim was discovered.

249
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,448
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. A man's shadow.

250
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,544
So can you get a better
angle on his face?

251
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,452
Yes, this is a different angle,
same hallway.

252
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,465
We should see him head-on here.

253
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,759
The light here
would register an image.

254
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:21,929
There is no face.

255
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,348
What is it?

256
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:28,019
I think you're gonna want
to see this.

257
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:40,031
No reflections or highlights.
No translucency.

258
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,781
This is clearly its own entity.

259
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,533
How is that possible?

260
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,329
It's possible that the technology
That our Russian friend stole

261
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,665
allows him to become this shadow.

262
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,180
Are you suggesting that this was
some sort of russian experiment?

263
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,753
Because they're from the other
side of the world, Peter,

264
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,463
it is so hard to believe

265
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,550
that they would have their own
stripe of the inconceivable?

266
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:03,095
Really I'm always amazed
at their advancements.

267
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,956
Even 40 years ago.

268
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:07,600
You wouldn't believe
what those pinkos were up to.

269
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,405
Russian fringe science.

270
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,229
There's a pleasant thought.

271
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,948
This just came in from DC
senator Van Horn's office.

272
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:03,828
It turns out that it wasn't technology
timur stole six years ago.

273
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,992
- He abducted his brother.
- The cosmonaut.

274
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,199
Officially,
the russian space agency states

275
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,332
he died in space.
He didn't.

276
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,341
Why would they say
he's dead if he's not?

277
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,843
What happened to him up there?

278
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:16,519
According to these documents,
they still don't understand.

279
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:18,396
Are you saying
the cosmonaut's the shadow?

280
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,561
I don't know.

281
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,837
But what is clear is
Timur took his brother

282
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:24,468
from the secret quarantine facility
where he was being studied.

283
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:25,511
Took?

284
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,597
He returned from his mission
in a coma.

285
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:31,809
And Timur's been working
in a coma ward both here and in DC.

286
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,949
I think Timur's been moving
his brother around

287
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:35,902
from hospital to hospital
and guarding him.

288
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,532
So where's his brother now?

289
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,658
Presumably still
at Latchmere hospital.

290
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,711
No bodies have been removed from
the coma ward for the past two weeks.

291
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:45,124
- Okay, well, I'll get a team together.
- We're good.

292
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,365
We're ready to go there now.

293
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:54,141
So Walter and I were discussing how
radiation pertains to this formula...

294
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,785
Yes, which led to a theory
about the shadow.

295
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,465
Initially, I assumed...

296
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,169
there would be a radiation surplus

297
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,118
in the victim from the penthouse.

298
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,466
I was mistaken.

299
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,613
It's not the radiation
that's killing them.

300
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:08,125
Quite the opposite.

301
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,875
It's the radiation
that the entity is after.

302
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,319
This thing passes through victims to

303
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,813
- absorb radiation?
- And disintegrates them in the process.

304
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,943
All five of the victims were
undergoing radiation treatment.

305
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:25,182
Except for the penthouse guy.
He died of bad luck.

306
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:27,049
The day that he visited
Latchmere General,

307
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,075
he took a cross-country flight
in a window seat.

308
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,131
30,000 feet closer to the sun.
It's like getting a big fat head X-ray.

309
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,330
So this thing followed him
from the hospital?

310
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:36,958
I'm not gonna sleep for weeks.

311
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,538
I'll go check the patients.

312
00:23:59,062 --> 00:23:59,939
Coma ward.

313
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,566
Yeah, the lights and all
the security monitors are down.

314
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,221
We're going to backup power.

315
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,325
What are you doing here?
It's not your shift.

316
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:27,407
It's hard to explain.

317
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,470
I have to disconnect the patient.
I need it to confuse the monitors.

318
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,597
I can't let them see me take him.

319
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,682
Maxine,

320
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,929
I wish you hadn't seen me here.

321
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,306
Are all the patients accounted for?

322
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:46,736
Are they accounted for?

323
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,404
Yes! Every bed.

324
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:51,866
But, Maxine, she came in here
a few minutes ago.

325
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:23,689
He swapped her for his brother.

326
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:25,532
She's been sedated.

327
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,994
How long has he been
at it like this?

328
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:19,744
Three hours.

329
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,914
Don't touch!
Don't touch!

330
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,714
What a pleasant surprise.

331
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,090
Could you get us
some licorice, please, dear?

332
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,354
As unlikely as it seems,

333
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:39,098
is it possible that this
cosmonaut somehow is our killer?

334
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:41,387
It wasn't the cosmonaut.

335
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:43,853
But it could be something
inside him.

336
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,314
It's possible that,
while in outer space,

337
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,565
the cosmonaut...

338
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:51,226
took a spacewalk and brought
something back with him.

339
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:55,351
An organism
capable of projecting itself

340
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:58,034
without ever really
leaving its host.

341
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,287
- I'm not following.
- Like a ventriloquist throws his voice.

342
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:05,740
The organism can project
another version of itself,

343
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:07,820
what we perceive as the shadow,

344
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:10,945
without ever really leaving
the cosmonaut's body.

345
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:15,216
Now I have to get back to her.

346
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:19,621
We have a phone number
for Timur Vasiliev

347
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,424
based on his employment records.

348
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,271
We can leave a message for him and hope
that at some point he retrieves it.

349
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,366
Can we tell him
that we can solve the formula?

350
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:32,601
Can we?

351
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,094
I can dominate her.

352
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,023
But first I need
something from home.

353
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,248
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

354
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,779
<i>Message received 3:14 pm.</i>

355
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,470
<i>This is Jerry Larsen again</i>

356
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,108
<i>from human resources
at Hartswell Medical Center.</i>

357
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,725
<i>We've looked over your resume,</i>

358
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,480
<i>and, boy, it's really something else.
I think there's a position here for you.</i>

359
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,360
<i>Call me when you get to town.</i>

360
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,955
<i>We'll show you around Minneapolis.
Thanks again now.</i>

361
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:22,096
<i>You have one new message.</i>

362
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:25,222
<i>Message received 6:45 pm.</i>

363
00:28:26,114 --> 00:28:28,686
<i>This is special agent Broyles
from the FBI.</i>

364
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,270
<i>I'm the agent you spoke with
four years ago.</i>

365
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,793
<i>I have information
about the formula for you.</i>

366
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:37,800
<i>Call me at 617-555-0118.</i>

367
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,093
I've been thinking too linearly.
Deductive.

368
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:19,866
Restrictive.

369
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,280
I must expand my thinking.

370
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,533
If you're looking for your acid tabs,
Walter, don't bother. I threw 'em out.

371
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,290
Son, this is not a job
for the Purple Blotter.

372
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:37,047
The right tool for this job...

373
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:41,057
is Tinker Toys.

374
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,344
All he has to do is call in,
and we can trace it.

375
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,120
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

376
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:15,542
Why this one?

377
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,539
Why is this case
so important to you?

378
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:37,687
Four years ago,

379
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,609
when this case happened,

380
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,525
It was at a moment in time that
Fringe Division had fallen out of favor.

381
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,422
The government was siphoning money
away from us For things that had more...

382
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:50,701
public results.

383
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,944
But at a certain point, I stopped
caring about my profile or promotions.

384
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:00,519
I just wanted to make
the world a safer place.

385
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:07,597
Anyway...

386
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:11,826
I became obsessed with this case.

387
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,141
And for my wife...

388
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:18,991
it was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

389
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,492
It ended our marriage.

390
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,011
I took this job to make the world
a safer place for my family.

391
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,398
Instead, I lost them.

392
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:11,141
That's it. Physical
representation of the formula.

393
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,345
Something wrong?

394
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,407
Could you hold that end,
please, Peter?

395
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:58,315
That's him.

396
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,740
Call Dr. Bishop.

397
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:06,759
- This is agent Broyles.
- <i>I saw you in the hospital.</i>

398
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:10,270
- I thought you might have.
- In your message, you said you had

399
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,592
new information about the formula.

400
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,220
- That's right.
- Have you solved it this time?

401
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:18,082
We've got Timur on the line.
<i>I need Walter.</i>

402
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:20,349
He's right here. Hold on a sec.
It's Oliva.

403
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,013
Have you solved the formula?

404
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,775
<i>It is bad news, unfortunately.</i>

405
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,903
I know, like last time, you are
tapping the line. You need 60 seconds.

406
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:35,156
<i>I'm giving you ten before I hang up.</i>

407
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:37,075
Don't make the same mistake again.

408
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,618
<i>I believe the Russians</i>

409
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,455
have tried to remove the organism
from the cosmonaut...

410
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,957
<i>they couldn't.
It is not possible.</i>

411
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:46,036
The two have become one.

412
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:49,087
Bonded at a molecular level.

413
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,786
<i>They can't be separated.</i>

414
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:53,508
<i>You can't kill the organism
without killing them both.</i>

415
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,177
<i>I'm going to hang up now.</i>

416
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,688
We have the answer, Timur.

417
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,961
But I don't think
it's the one you want to hear.

418
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,643
<i>I'm afraid your brother</i>

419
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,421
and whatever's inside of him

420
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,647
have become one and the same.

421
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,733
<i>But the people I work with,</i>

422
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,249
<i>if anyone can help
your brother, they can.</i>

423
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,780
But we'll need to see your brother.

424
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:30,004
I don't want him harmed.

425
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,772
Just ten more seconds.

426
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,299
Tell me where you are, Timur.

427
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:36,618
I have managed to keep it at bay.

428
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,603
He's not going to hurt anyone else.

429
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,350
- For now.
- <i>We'll take care of him.</i>

430
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,852
I want this to end
as much as you do.

431
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,375
But you've got to tell me
where you are, Timur.

432
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:52,118
<i>You can trust us.</i>

433
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,149
I've got him.
His line's still open.

434
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:16,540
Start triangulating the position.

435
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:29,230
Van door's open.

436
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,022
He's moving his brother.

437
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:07,101
Hold on, let me help you with that.

438
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,350
Pupils dilated.

439
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,918
His breathing's normal for a coma.

440
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:16,986
What's with all these jumper cables?

441
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:21,574
Agent Broyles said that Timur was
certain he could contain it.

442
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:24,368
Perhaps so by administering
electric shocks,

443
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,662
- distressing the cosmonaut.
- But it didn't work.

444
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,497
It killed Timur.

445
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,178
Dr. Bishop, how will you contain it
before it kills again?

446
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:35,458
I imagine we would need a lead case

447
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:38,674
For starters,
big enough for his entire body.

448
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:41,397
What's wrong?

449
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,431
Before we attempt anything,

450
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,601
we have to wait until the shadow
returns to the cosmonaut.

451
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:51,928
There's no radiation.
Which means the organism is here,

452
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,450
but it's already projected
the shadow elsewhere.

453
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:57,082
You said that Timur could contain it
by distressing the host.

454
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,737
Do you think you could draw
the shadow back doing the same thing?

455
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,460
Is that possible?

456
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,701
I don't know how it behaves.

457
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,828
But it could work.
Since they're connected.

458
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,310
I don't know!
Theoretically, yes.

459
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,223
If you hurt the host,
you hurt the organism.

460
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,407
It's out there now.
Do you think you could try?

461
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,946
This equipment, it's in russian.

462
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,210
Stand back!

463
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,090
What's wrong?

464
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:04,677
What happened?

465
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:21,309
There was a man.

466
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:23,322
A shadow man.

467
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:26,337
He disappeared.

468
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,028
The kids aren't here.
They went over to Sadie's.

469
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,279
Actually, I came to talk to you.

470
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:11,586
I just wanted to tell you that...

471
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:24,840
I closed that case.

472
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:30,845
The one four years ago.

473
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:37,819
I'm happy for you.

474
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,130
I mean that.

475
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:44,952
Thank you.

476
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:52,993
Do you want to come in?
Have some dinner with us?

477
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:59,196
I'll let you get back
to your dinner.

478
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:02,444
Good night, Diane.

479
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:05,956
Good night, Phillip.

480
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,573
You got a real friend
in senator Van Horn.

481
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:56,158
Is that so?

482
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:58,928
When the CIA says,
"Cease and desist,"

483
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,228
we kind of mean it.

484
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,609
A person could get
into a lot of trouble.

485
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,525
I guess I should thank
senator Van Horn then.

486
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:07,795
Understatement.

487
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,838
So, this thing,

488
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:15,825
there isn't going to be any report.

489
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,147
Right?

490
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,082
What did you guys do with him,

491
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:37,275
- the cosmonaut?
- We had no choice.

492
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,035
Once he started breathing again...

493
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:08,337
À la semaine prochaine !
