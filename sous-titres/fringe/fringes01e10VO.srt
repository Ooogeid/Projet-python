00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on Fringe

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,963
They're calling
these events a pattern

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,587
As if someone out
there is experimenting.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,256
Only the whole world is their lab.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,370
You're saying I can talk to john.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,914
You could access his memories.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,620
David robert jones was arrested
on possession of state secrets

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,010
The people I work with
are loyal to the end.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,770
Can you say the same

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,280
- Hello, Liv
- You're not real

11
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,517
What's happening?

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,250
When you were in the tank, part
of his memories crossed over into yours.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,190
Security cameras are out,
disarming alarm.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,357
Alarm disarmed.

15
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,305
<i>Roger, we are in.</i>

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,050
- How are you doing?
- Loop is up, you're good to go.

17
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:19,347
- How are we doing?
- Good to go.

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,907
- OK.
- powering up.

charge.

23
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,309
Oscillation is good.

24
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:35,560
Ready to open the grid.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,910
Where are we?

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,097
96%

27
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:39,473

Give me the grid

31

Careful

United firm

33
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,429
- How long do we have?
- Confirming density...

34
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:10,296
and digners,

35
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,911
1 minute 41,

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,008
- 40.
- Let's go.

37
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,528
610, 610, 610

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,700
OK, we got it.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
Give me a charge gel

40
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,000
57 seconds. We gotta move

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,139
45 seconds

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,682
OK, tie it on.

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,904
Alright, let's move.

44
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:14,819
Grab everything let's go.

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,059
Let's go, I need help. Get it up

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,800
OK, take your dom.

47
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,783
They gotta move or
we're not gonna make it

48
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:51,140
Lugo, let's go

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,727
- Neg, can't just disengage.
- Forget disengage, we gotta go now.

50
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,700
You go, i'm working on it.
Go. I'll back the herage.

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,278
- 15 sec. What the hell is he doing?
- Man he's stuck,

52
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,378
He can't leave that in there.
It will be screwed if he does.

53
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,450
Yeah, I think he understands that.

54
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,614
Come on.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,622
What got it slack.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,049
10 sec,

57
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:21,455
9 sec,

00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,417
- 8,7,6,
- Alright, i'm ready

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,634
- Pull me through
- 5 seconds, 4, 3,

60
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,957
- We've got 2 seconds, come on, pull
- Come on, push. Come on.

61
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:33,420
Pull me through.

62
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,190
Grab everything, let's go.

63
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,114
No, don't leave me.

Let's go.

67
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:08,173

76
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,396
What do you mean you don't have one?
{\Everybody's got one. }Even I've got one.

77
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,577
{\pos(120,260)}- What's that, a spleen?
- Yeah, Walter, a spleen.

78
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,387
{\pos(110,250)}And this one suffers from asplenia,

79
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,707
{\pos(192,240)}A rare genetic condition
in which one is born spleenless.

80
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,869
{\pos(192,240)}Thank you, Walter.

81
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:51,547
{\pos(192,240)}You seriously
don't have a best friend?

82
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,385
{\pos(192,240)}Nope.

83
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,110
{\pos(192,240)}- Well, does a sister count?
- Of course a sister doesn't count.

84
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,690
{\pos(192,240)}Well, I guess that I've always
just enjoyed being on my own.

85
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,898
{\pos(192,240)}Even when I was at boarding school,
they used to call me "han".

86
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,326
As in "solo"? That's cute.
Least you had a nickname.

87
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,716
{\pos(110,260)}This is Phillip Broyles
with homeland security.

88
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,685
{\pos(110,260)}Please have him call
me as soon as possible.

89
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,568
{\pos(110,260)}Yes, and they'll connect you.

90
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,194
{\pos(110,260)}Clear the area, please.

91
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,535
This is fascinating.

92
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,288
Security guard was killed,
the surveillance cameras disabled.

93
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,964
- So, what do we have?
- Nothing.

94
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:24,077
{\pos(110,260)}This incident may be
related to a recent series

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,506
{\pos(110,260)}of bank robberies, this
would be the third.

96
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,599
All in philadelphia?

97
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,678
{\pos(280,260)}First was in cleveland, the
second in baltimore.

98
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,272
{\pos(120,220)}I was in baltimore.
I remember a woman

99
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,308
{\pos(110,240)}With particularly large breasts.

100
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:37,101
{\pos(280,260)}Each time the only thing
that's been taken has been

101
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,482
{\pos(280,260)}A single,
oversized safe deposit box.

102
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,442
All without so much
as a breach of the vault.

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,635
Are the boxes traceable?

104
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,177
{\pos(300,260)}I have a call in
to the bank manager now.

105
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:47,147
{\pos(300,260)}The who, what, and why,

106
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,403
That's you.

107
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,412
Just when you thought things
couldn't get any weirder.

108
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,041
{\pos(300,260)}Peter, I know this man.

109
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,447
{\pos(280,220)}What, the guy in the wall?

110
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:06,374
{\pos(280,220)}Really? Let me guess.
He's your best friend.

111
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:07,847
{\pos(110,260)}No, I mean it.

112
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,595
{\pos(110,240)}You know him from where?

113
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,971
{\pos(110,240)}To determine what happened here,
we'll have to...

114
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:13,781
{\pos(110,240)}cut him out of the wall.

115
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,142
At least pieces of him.

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,979
I'll need some of
this netting as well.

117
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:18,040
Raul.

118
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,563
Raul lugo.

119
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,877
You know this man?

120
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,780
He was in my first
unit in the marines.

121
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:24,450
Then you have my condolences.

122
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,177
You're being serious?

123
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:28,192
{\pos(110,240)}Yeah. He's from jersey.

124
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,286
{\pos(110,240)}Uh, he's married.
His wife's named susan.

125
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,692
{\pos(100,240)}He plays baseball.

126
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:35,788
{\pos(100,260)}He Lives in edison.
I've been to his house.

127
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,584
Bullet in the head or no,

128
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,402
Leaving a guy halfway
stuck in the wall

129
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:43,447
Wasn't the most professional move.
I thought it was a nice touch.

130
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,313
You can joke about it all you want.

131
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:46,607
Yeah, thanks.

132
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,343
We had another grid.
We should have tried to get him out.

133
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,918
{\pos(280,220)}- How are we doing?
- Crappy.

134
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,677
{\pos(280,220)}Self-sealing bolts,
magnetic tumblers,

135
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,447
{\pos(280,220)}Some kind of old-school
chromo-alloy.

136
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,877
{\pos(300,260)}Someone really didn't
want this opened.

137
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,628
{\pos(280,220)}- How long?
- Couple of hours, maybe three.

138
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,637
{\pos(260,220)}We have one more box to go.
If your bitching about Raul

139
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,881
{\pos(260,220)}Is your way of saying
you want out, then go.

140
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:06,726
{\pos(260,220)}Otherwise inject yourself
and shut your mouth.

141
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:25,585
Mr. Kohl.

142
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,422
Please come in.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,989
This is amazing!

144
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,114
{\a6}The scale of this hardware store
in unprecedented.

145
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,461
{\a6}Actually,
it's completely precedented.

146
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:39,805
{\a6}There are stores like
this everywhere, Walter.

147
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,598
{\a6}All around the world, in every city.

148
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:44,000
{\a6}If anyone knows that, it's you.

149
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,762
All right,
what's that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,452
- My last phrase?
- Yes, your last phrase.

151
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,743
"If anybody knows that, it's you."
What is that?

152
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,638
I was implying
that you traveled extensively.

153
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,162
No, you were implying that I haven't

154
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,120
Stayed still much
in the last 15 years.

155
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,748
{\a4}You were implying, and you've been
implying with increasing frequency,

156
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,796
{\a4}that you don't approve
of my admittedly nomadic existence.

157
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,658
{\a4}In short, Walter, you're saying
that you're disappointed

158
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,252
{\a4}i haven't made more uut of my life.

159
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,220
That's what you're implying.

160
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:11,842
Yes, I suppose so.

161
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,247
The reason this store seems
like such a miracle to you

162
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,482
Is because you've been
holed-up in a mental institution

163
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,848
For the better part
of the last two decades,

164
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,411
Which effectively does two things.

165
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:26,576
One, it precludes you from knowing
much of anything about me.

166
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:30,247
About who I am, who I've been,
what I know, and what I've done.

167
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,945
And two,
it renders any fatherly judgments

168
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,808
You may have of me moot.

169
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,451
Are we clear?

170
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,807
- Can I help you guys find something?
- Oh, Yes.

171
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,517
We're looking for an electric saw,

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,358
Preferably variable speed

173
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,589
With an easily
replaceable blade system.

174
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,677
- What are you cutting? Wood?
- Human tissue. Flesh and bone.

175
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,208
It's more sinuous
than you may expect.

176
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,634
It's really not that dire.

177
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,640
Oh, actually,
potentially it's far worse.

178
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,835
Um, I think that the
saw that you're looking for

179
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,761
Is around the corner,
next to the routers.

180
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:05,810
Thank you.

181
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:08,420
No need to call the police.

182
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,687
Mr. Jones, as you know,
we only have so much time.

183
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,747
So...

184
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,993
The sentencing is
scheduled for next week.

185
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,982
As I told you before,
i think the best

186
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,798
we can hope for is...

187
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,285
life.

188
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:30,131
- However, I will be filing an appeal...
- You're spoke to my people?

189
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,730
Do they have any news for me?

190
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,907
Yes, they said that the "job"

191
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,277
In philadelphia was successful.

192
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,759
Oh, good.

193
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,659
Please tell them the following.

194
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:47,689
They are to wire
Mr. Loeb another $100,000

195
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,642
And to inform him of
the location of the next item.

196
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll pass that along.

197
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,707
Thank you.

198
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,317
Here is the document.

199
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,181
If you could just
take a quick look at it?

200
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,166
This is a standard
document for appeal.

201
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,189
If you'll just sign on the...

202
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,492
What are you doing?

203
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,700
Items that I will need
upon your next visit.

204
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,477
My people will provide them for you.

205
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,656
Dramamine?

206
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,385
Sun tan lotion?

207
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,980
- What are these for?
- As my employee,

208
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:24,549
It really is none of
your concern now, is it?

209
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,983
What size are you?

210
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,075
Your suit size?

211
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,571
40 long. Why?

212
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,240
The address of my personal tailor.

213
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,077
He'll fix up something nice for you.

214
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,203
My way of saying thank
you for all you've done for me.

215
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:01,117
Yes?

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,980
Susan.

217
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:03,409
Yeah.

218
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:05,380
Olivia.

219
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:06,977
Olivia Dunham.

220
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:08,785
Hello.

221
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,001
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

222
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,894
I just can't believe it.

223
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,985
I just can't believe he's dead.

224
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,231
Raul moved out about two years ago.

225
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,619
We hadn't spoken in months.

226
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,872
You know, I am so sorry.

227
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,413
And please forgive me,
but did he mention these robberies?

228
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:33,150
No.

229
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,269
Can't say I'm surprised though.

230
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:37,848
What do you mean?

231
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,460
Ever since he came back from the war,
He was just...

232
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:42,621
Dark.

233
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,722
Depression, drinking.

234
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,890
And I tried to help the best
way I could, I swear to god, but...

235
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,010
I'm sure you did.

236
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:53,942
Do you know anyone
he was hanging out with?

237
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:57,230
Any of his recent friends?
Because I hadn't seen Raul in years.

238
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:58,498
You knew Raul?

239
00:12:58,581 --> 00:12:59,868
Yes, of course.

240
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,114
We served together in the marines.

241
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:03,911
Oh,

242
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:05,619
I didn't know.

243
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,577
We have met before.

244
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,787
Who? You and I?

245
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:09,588
Yes,

246
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,415
we had dinner here.

247
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:13,815
You were in my house?

248
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,577
It took me a little
while to remember

249
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,177
Because it was so long ago,

250
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,956
But,

251
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,959
Raul and I met at camp Pendleton.

252
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,707
And we had dinner here,

253
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,629
The night that he
became first lieutenant.

254
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:26,009
No,

255
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,956
you weren't here.

256
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,946
Susan, I'm sorry, but I was.

257
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,277
And you were a wonderful
host. You made pot roast...

258
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,477
And it burned, yes,
and we had to order in.

259
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,547
Yeah, and the delivery guy
dropped the bag right here.

260
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,362
And that piano was actually
in front of the window

261
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,449
And the sofa was here by the fire.

262
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,288
Yes, I remember, but
you were not here.

263
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,329
The day Raul made first lieutenant,

264
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,692
It was just me,

265
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:52,493
Raul,

266
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,375
and John.

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,439
Who?

268
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:57,169
Raul's friend from Pendleton, John.

269
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,629
John who?

270
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,298
John Scott.

271
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,722
Are you okay?

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,857
Almost there, son.

273
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,239
Get ready.

274
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,022
You can do it.

275
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,573
Nice catch.
Well done.

276
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,559
I'm carrying a tray, Walter.
It's not exactly rocket science.

277
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,329
What I said before...

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,498
- didn't come out as I intended.
- What, the crack about the breasts?

279
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,446
No,

280
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,335
about my disappointment in you.

281
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,808
It has more to do with your potential
than anything else.

282
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,539
You have no idea what
you're capable of, Peter.

283
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:45,552
That's sweet, Walter,

284
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,597
But ultimately unfair.
Especially coming from you.

285
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,497
- So, what have we got here so far?
- Nothing yet.

286
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,917
Walter seems to think
that if we can examine

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,347
This guy's flesh
at the cellular level,

288
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,577
We might be able
to figure out how it is

289
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,959
That they pass through solid matter.

290
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,043
What we perceive as solid matter

291
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:02,147
Is mostly empty space.

292
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,207
Just as me may perceive
that a life is full

293
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,099
That is actually a
series of empty encounters.

294
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,160
He's been like that all day.
It's been awesome.

295
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,546
To accomplish this,

296
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,445
Your bank robbers would need

297
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,929
Cutting edge knowledge
of quantum physics,

298
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,717
Not to mention technology
that would cost more

299
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,389
Than dozen banks could hold.

300
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,829
How did it go with Raul Lugo's wife?

301
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,117
Well, they were separated,

302
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,820
So she hadn't had much
contact with him for months.

303
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:31,724
But she said he suffered
from depression.

304
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,506
Are you okay?

305
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,750
Yeah, I'm good.

306
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,796
No, Peter's right.

307
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:42,636
Your pupils are dilated.

308
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,000
It's a symptom of high stress.

309
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,162
Unless you're using hallucinogens.

310
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,859
Are you tripping, agent Dunham?

311
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:49,983
Walter...

312
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,987
I didn't recognize Raul Lugo,

313
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:57,998
John Scott did.

314
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,329
You're confusing
John Scott's memories...

315
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:02,528
With my own.

316
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,213
So, you never met this guy?

317
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,183
No,

318
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,425
but I could have sworn I did.

319
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,338
That.

320
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,147
I don't understand that.
I need to look into that.

321
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,762
OK, but first we need to figure out
what happened here.

322
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,377
Who did this, what they want,

323
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,604
and what they're gonna do next.

324
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,360
Success.

325
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:38,756
Nice job.

326
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,712
Are you ever gonna let
us see what's in these boxes?

327
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,117
I don't think so.

328
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,171
And even if I did, you
wouldn't understand it.

329
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,830
Well, I thought we
were making progress.

330
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:07,717
We were, but we've hit a dead end

331
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,877
Trying to reconstruct
john Scott's memories.

332
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,939
If we push further,
we risk destroying

333
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:14,177
The fragments we're
trying to retrieve.

334
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:17,167
Well, not to place any undue pressure
on you and your team,

335
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,647
But we're in a race against
highly motivated individuals.

336
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,357
And right now,
John Scott is our only advantage.

337
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,052
Understood.

338
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,102
So, why did you need
me to go get all that rice?

339
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:43,894
No talking!

340
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,307
Seriously,
Walter, what's the rice for?

341
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,852
And while I'm at it,
what's with all the toys?

342
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,277
Oh, these were in my storage.

343
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,194
They're your toys, son,
from when you were a little boy.

344
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:54,177
- Those aren't mine.
- Then I suppose they must be mine.

345
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,229
It's the netting, Peter.

346
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,129
I believe the swatch left behind

347
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,447
Is from a larger piece.
It was draped over the vault wall.

348
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,917
That somehow is the key,

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,630
Although I'm not sure
yet exactly how they would...

350
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,979
Watch...

351
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,162
do you see here?

352
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,636
So far some rice
and a bunch of toys.

353
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,229
This gentleman is standing
on what appears to be solid.

354
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:20,218
However,

355
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,842
add vibration...

356
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,604
I'm quite envious of this.

357
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,447
Of what?

358
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,999
Well, somehow the robbers,
were able to weaken the vault wall.

359
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,677
High frequency vibrations
disrupting its atomic structure

360
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,929
Allowing another piece
of solid matter through it.

361
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,426
Well, obviously what
I'm showing you here

362
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,117
Is a theoretical example.

363
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,247
In actuality,
this feat would be immensely complicated

364
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,372
And apparently not
without consequences.

365
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,242
It seems the use of this technology

366
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:58,511
Can render one slightly...

367
00:18:59,088 --> 00:18:59,973
Radioactive.

368
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,160
How slightly?

369
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,489
Not as slightly as I thought.

370
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,029
Miss?

371
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:09,407
Would you mind putting
the hand on ice?

372
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,277
- It will help preserve the tissue.
- Just so I'm clear, Walter,

373
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,277
The robbers have managed
to not only violate

374
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,177
The natural laws of the universe,
but they're also becoming radioactive?

375
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,367
- Who's radioactive?
- Our robbers apparently.

376
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,531
Where have you been?

377
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:22,577
I've been working.
Where have you been?

378
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,661
I've been buying
rice for Walter's toys.

379
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,958
Did you get any leads
on the safety deposit boxes?

380
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,575
Yeah, they were all
purchased 23 years ago.

381
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:33,739
All paid for in cash,
bogus names on each account.

382
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,359
How radioactive?

383
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:36,716
Slightly.

384
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,553
Though not as slight
as Walter would like.

385
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,785
So, we have no idea who
those safety deposit boxes belong to?

386
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,447
No, and it's untraceable.

387
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,769
Can you call all the hospitals
in and around the philadelphia area?

388
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,507
Get them to call
us if anyone comes in

389
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,296
showing signs of
radiation poisoning.

390
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,815
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- Okay.

391
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,760
So, what's our next move?

392
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,695
Raul lugo was a good
kid before the military.

393
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,223
He had a clean record,
responsible employee.

394
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:03,068
I want to know how
he became a criminal.

395
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,917
Why they recruited him
and what they promised him.

396
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,523
All right,
so how are we gonna do that?

397
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,251
Lugo's wife gave me some names...
It just so happens

398
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,595
His best friend from high school
works at a bar in Cambridge.

399
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,883
Did I just hear "bar in Cambridge"?

400
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,597
Hey, Astrid, would you mind...

401
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,485
Watching Walter?
Yeah, I'm on that, too.

402
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,171
Now, miss,

403
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,717
I'm going to repeat
the demonstration with the rice.

404
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,949
Would you care to watch?

405
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:31,461
- Nope.
- Okay.

406
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,461
Just go along with this, okay?

407
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,128
Sure thing, boss.

408
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:39,966
- Hi.
- Hey.

409
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,656
- How's your night?
- I've had worse. What can I get you?

410
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,050
- Double shot of whiskey.
- A double. What's your preference?

411
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,578
- Your call.
- You?

412
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,577
Same as the lady.

413
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,541
I'm stephanie.
This is my brother, rick.

414
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,716
Hey, brother rick.

415
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,446
Hi.

416
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,794
You know, you look familiar.

417
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,911
Oh, me?

418
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:01,825
Cheers.

419
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:04,398
Um...

420
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,098
I'll take another.

421
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,598
Are you sure we haven't met before?

422
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,017
I don't think so.

423
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,598
- What's your name?
- Drew.

424
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:16,250
Drew, I got to tell you,
I never forget a face.

425
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,436
It's true, she doesn't.
It's kind of creepy actually.

426
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:20,597
I got it.

427
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,126
Raul and Susan's wedding.

428
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,325
- No way. You were there?
- You were the best man.

429
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,890
- Yeah.
- It's incredible, right?

430
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,634
She's been able to
do that since we were kids.

431
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,630
- Remember that?
- I do.

432
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,714
So do you still see them?

433
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:33,098
No, it's been years.

434
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:34,665
I was friends with susan in college,

435
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,836
But we lost contact, too.
It's horrible.

436
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,249
Where are they Living now?

437
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,743
You know, I don't know.
I heard they split.

438
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,834
- Oh, No.
- Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.

439
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:42,741
Why not?

440
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,059
I don't know. Raul got weird.

441
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:47,589
- Weird how?
- You know he was in the gulf war?

442
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,946
He sort of... I don't know.

443
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:51,817
It was post-traumatic
stress or something.

444
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,207
I feel bad.

445
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:56,064
I'm sure I would have lost my mind
If I'd gone to the gulf war as well.

446
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,025
Anyway, when he got back,
he didn't come around much.

447
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,689
He started hanging
out at the va a lot.

448
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,583
- Which one?
- I don't know.

449
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,589
It's a shame. He was a good guy.
Excuse me.

450
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:05,487
Sure.

451
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,122
Brother?

452
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:13,293
Yeah.

453
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,325
It, uh...

454
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:17,293
- It kind of works. Better that way.
- Does it now?

455
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:20,677
<i>- Broyles.
- It's Dunham.</i>

456
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,738
<i>Look, I was wondering
if you could find out</i>

457
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:25,717
<i>What va hospital raul
lugo might have gone to.</i>

458
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,719
There was nothing
in any of his records.

459
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,518
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm calling you.

460
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:30,772
<i>Can you help me?</i>

461
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,276
I'll do what I can.

462
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,860
<i>I'll have an answer
for you in an hour.</i>

463
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:35,753
Thanks.

464
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,732
Let's go.
He is gonna call us back in an hour

465
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:40,969
What's the rush?

466
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,429
Two is your limit?

467
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,957
Is that a dare?

468
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:47,899
Rook to e-7.

469
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:48,786
Check.

470
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:51,677
So, I took a look at his papers
while he was checking out

471
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,121
Whatever was in that box we grabbed.

472
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:53,860
So?

473
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:55,696
- It's a map of germany.
- Germany?

474
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,585
Yeah, frankfurt. Lines all over it.

475
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,977
Latitude and longitude.

476
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,977
Looks like he's planning
a damn invasion.

477
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,601
I got next.

478
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,847
All right, listen up.

479
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,969
We're headed out. Let's go.

480
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,927
Where to?

481
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,062
Providence.

482
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:17,982
Pick a card.

483
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,357
All right.

484
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,892
Now, I need you...

485
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:26,863
to memorize that card.

486
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,279
- Okay.
- You got it?

487
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:29,422
- Yeah, I got it.
- You sure?

488
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:30,705
- Yes.
- Absolutely positive?

489
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:31,610
Absolutely positive.

490
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,976
Because if you don't,
it doesn't work.

491
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,867
- Okay, I remember.
- Okay, good.

492
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,649
And just like everything else
we do around here,

493
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,221
It's about to get weirder.

494
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:43,777
It's pretty good, right?

495
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,529
- That was great.
- Okay, so top that.

496
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,290
- Okay.
- Seriously?

497
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:49,412
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- Women never have card tricks.

498
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,539
Tell me when to stop.

499
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:53,146
One, two, three, four, five,

500
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:54,665
- six, seven...
- Stop.

501
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:55,726
Which one?

502
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,475
Four of clubs.

503
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,947
- Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12...
- Stop.

504
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:12,162
Queen of diamonds.

505
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:15,183
You can count cards.

506
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:17,119
That's all I would
do when I was a kid.

507
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,579
I'm sure that if
I was a child today,

508
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:19,976
I would be diagnosed with something.

509
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,162
I just have this thing for numbers.
I see them once and remember them

510
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,131
the rest of my life.

511
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:24,874
Seriously?

512
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:27,234
Yeah, my best friend
from high school's

513
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:30,551
License plate: 7240168.

514
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,386
My locker combination
in middle school:

515
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:34,829
36-21-7.

516
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,029
The numbers of the
safety deposit boxes:

517
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:39,323
233, 377, and 610.

518
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:41,779
What?

519
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,342
- I could do more.
- No, no, no.

520
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,709
Say that again.
The numbers on the safety deposit boxes.

521
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,435
233, 377, and 610. Why?

522
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,113
I know those numbers.

523
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,505
Walter? Hey, Walter!

524
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,056
Wake up!

525
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:58,380
Walter. Walter, wake up.

526
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,664
This is important.

527
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:03,979
Do you two want to use the room?

528
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:04,800
Walter, this is important.

529
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:06,515
The numbers you recite every night,
what are they?

530
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,285
Numbers?

531
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,117
Every night you recite a sequence
of numbers to help you fall asleep.

532
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,657
- 233, 377, 610...
- 987, 1,597.

533
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,436
Precisely, those.
What is that pattern?

534
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,373
It's a fibonacci sequence.

535
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,692
You should know that, Peter.
If you had stayed at college...

536
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:24,229
Walter, not everybody knows
the fibonacci sequence.

537
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:25,331
Oh, sure they do.

538
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:27,923
It's a wildly famous
mathematical sequence.

539
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,121
Each number in the sequence

540
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:31,909
Is the sum of the two preceding.

541
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,004
Including 233, 377, and 610,

542
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:38,035
Which just happened to be the numbers of
the safety deposit boxes that were stolen.

543
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,159
It's fascinating,
but it's a coincidence.

544
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,662
It can't possibly be significant.

545
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,050
Unless...

546
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:52,947
Oh, my god.

547
00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:54,760
What?

548
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:00,027
The safety deposit boxes are mine.

549
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:11,208
Walter, are there any other safety deposit
boxes that haven't been broken into yet?

550
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,376
I don't know.

551
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,948
I don't know where
because I can't remember

552
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,100
why I put things into the boxes.

553
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:18,242
All right,
so let me get this straight.

554
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,583
You can remember traveling
around the country 23 years ago,

555
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,054
renting all these safety deposit boxes
under assumed names,

556
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:24,925
But you can't remember why?

557
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:28,962
The "why" is of secondary importance

558
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,364
to "what".

559
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,126
What was I protecting?

560
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,835
Whatever it was,
I didn't use my usual hiding places.

561
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:40,436
So, I suspect it was something
of profound significance.

562
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,699
Well, excellent.
That clears it right up.

563
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:47,060
I was under a great deal
of stress at the time.

564
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,481
It was before the
accident in the lab.

565
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:55,364
Before that poor lab assistant
lost her life.

566
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:58,666
I was...

567
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,471
distrustful of everybody.

568
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:03,930
Even better, your mother,

569
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:08,254
I was convinced I was being followed.
Someone was watching my every move.

570
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,336
Which medication is that, Walter?

571
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,578
Supplements.

572
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:17,718
Walter, did you tell anybody else?

573
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:23,849
I told you, I was paranoid.

574
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,893
Okay, get dressed. We're going out.

575
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,779
Breakfast?

576
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,495
According to your travel records,

577
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:34,167
In 1985, you gave a lecture
at syracuse university.

578
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,032
Now, these photos are of banks
in the syracuse area.

579
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,818
Does any of this trigger anything
in your mind?

580
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,744
Yes, but not about banks.

581
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,184
Think back 20 years

582
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:50,543
Imagine yourself then,
imagining yourself now,

583
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:53,045
20 years into the future.

584
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:57,466
In your wildest imagination,
could you ever think you'd be here?

585
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,374
Is he stoned?

586
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:04,162
Just show him the other batch

587
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,752
And be patient with him.

588
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:08,095
His mind works in a different way.

589
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,589
Agent Dunham.

590
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:15,793
What's up?

591
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:20,019
After he split up with his wife,
Raul lugo moved to D.C.

592
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,061
He was an in-patient at the va there

593
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,927
for six months,
from last may to mid-october.

594
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,444
No visitors?

595
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,825
Not according to the records.

596
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:27,990
I don't know what that does
to your theory

597
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,165
He was recruited there.

598
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,793
Unless it was by another patient.

599
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:34,670
You have something?

600
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,961
Something remarkable, actually.

601
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:39,386
When we tried to access
agent Scott's hippocampus,

602
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,719
His brain wave echo
suddenly became erratic.

603
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,678
Inconsistent in
ways we've never seen.

604
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:45,348
And the cause of the inconsistency?

605
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:48,101
We managed to resolve the last image

606
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,853
in agent Scott's optic nerve
before he died.

607
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:54,231
This image is linked to a second set
of brain wave echoes.

608
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,092
Agent Dunham's.

609
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,623
They must have
somehow shared consciousness.

610
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:02,644
If that's the case,

611
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:05,307
It would suggest that some of
John Scott's memories,

612
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,047
Perhaps the very ones we need...

613
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,700
are in agent Dunham's mind.

614
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,510
Hi, agent Dunham with dhs.

615
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,543
I'm looking for Dr. Bruce Miller?

616
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,226
Thank you.

617
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,469
Excuse me, Dr. Miller?

618
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,313
{\pos(280,260)}Agent Olivia Dunham.
I'm with dhs.

619
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,613
{\pos(280,260)}What can I do for you,
agent Dunham?

620
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,837
{\pos(280,260)}I wanted to talk to you about
a patient of yours,

621
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,941
Raul lugo.

622
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,500
Marine force recon.

623
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,766
History of ptsd.

624
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,279
As I'm sure you know,
I can't violate patient confidentiality.

625
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:44,255
Raul lugo is dead, Dr. Miller,

626
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:47,807
So his right to confidentiality
no longer apply.

627
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,129
I'm investigating his death,

628
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:51,647
And I need to know
about his friends,

629
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,288
Anyone he was doing therapy with
or people that he got close to...

630
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,936
If you're referring
to current or former patients,

631
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:57,220
those records are also protected.

632
00:29:57,303 --> 00:29:59,210
Unless they're involved
in ongoing criminal activity,

633
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:02,307
In which case it would be your duty
to release them to me.

634
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,480
What crimes?

635
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,614
I'm sorry, I'm not authorized
to tell you that.

636
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:08,113
Suffice to say, the team of criminals
I'm investigating

637
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,234
Are all highly trained,
well-skilled, and...

638
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:13,446
Agent Dunham, I have two dozen patients
to see before I can go home to dinner.

639
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:16,673
And I'm not about to violate
my ethical duty based on your say-so.

640
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:18,777
Now, if you'd like to come back
with a federal subpoena,

641
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,976
I would be gla to help you out.

642
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,986
But until then,
you'll have to excuse me.

643
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,486
He liked to play chess.

644
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,332
Raul.

645
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,019
He used to play chess all day long.

646
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,877
With anyone in particular?

647
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,415
There were four of them.

648
00:30:39,498 --> 00:30:40,660
The chess club.

649
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,399
And do you remember their names?

650
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:43,591
Get a pencil.

651
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,286
Let's go.

652
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,352
Let's go. Let's move. Let's go.

653
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:00,882
Door! Let's move!

654
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,465
Robert Norton, captain,
united states air force.

655
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:06,471
Honorably discharged april of 04.

656
00:31:06,554 --> 00:31:08,429
Pull up his cell phone records
and his financials.

657
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:10,515
See if there's anything else
that ties him to lugo.

658
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:11,607
I'm on it.

659
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,124
These are the va visitor logs.

660
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,611
These men were recruited.

661
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:18,181
I want you to comb the logs
and follow up on every entry.

662
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:19,783
I just talked to Evan McNeil's wife.

663
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:21,356
Says her husband's away on business.

664
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,872
She hasn't heard
from him in two days.

665
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:24,971
Well, call his work and see
if they know where he is.

666
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:26,312
All right, we got something.

667
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:28,197
One of our vets bought
three one-way tickets

668
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,133
To tf green airport in Providence.

669
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:31,263
When do they land?

670
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,806
47 minutes ago.

671
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:37,812
Hey, what's up?

672
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,397
We think the next bank hit
is gonna go down in Providence.

673
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:42,936
Can you talk to Walter
and see if it jogs his memory?

674
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,554
- Yeah, sure.
- Don't strokes only.

675
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,346
You brush with the grain.

676
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:47,400
Hey, Walter, are any of those banks

677
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,973
you rented the safety deposit boxes
in Providence.

678
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:51,094
Providence?

679
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,462
I don't believe so, no.

680
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,247
I'm sorry, Peter, I have tried
everything to remember.

681
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:59,417
I understand how important it is
and I am...

682
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:01,873
quite disappointed with myself.

683
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:03,697
Hold on a sec.

684
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,769
When she's finished chewing her cud,

685
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,872
remember to brush her teeth.

686
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,526
I am not brushing
a cow's teeth, Walter.

687
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,037
You know I have real
work to do, right?

688
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,703
Hey, Walter.

689
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:16,995
If you were gonna rent
a safety deposit box In Providence,

690
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:17,996
what bank would you use?

691
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,049
Providence? That would have to be

692
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:21,441
the fairmont savings bank,
off westminster street.

693
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,509
It's the only one
with safe deposit boxes

694
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:25,481
big enough for my purposes.

695
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:29,868
Oh. Well done, son.

696
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:34,223
The fairmont savings bank,
off westminster street.

697
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,433
You're sure?

698
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:37,102
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

699
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,051
Agents, Sam Martin.

700
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,119
Providence SAC.

701
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,304
Francis and Dunham.
So, what's our status?

702
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:44,503
All surrounding streets
are locked down.

703
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:48,008
Per your request, my men are checking
all shared walls and alley ways.

704
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,938
This is Mr.
Grimes, he manages the bank.

705
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:53,265
I don't understand. We've had
no alarms or signs of forced entry.

706
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,151
Well, this crew doesn't work like that,
Mr. Grimes.

707
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,999
We have cameras, motion detectors,

708
00:32:57,082 --> 00:33:00,427
sensors that detect fractional variances
in ambient temperature.

709
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,491
They might be disabling
that wirelessly.

710
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:05,927
Shooting you a feed back loop
of old data while they stop and shop.

711
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,110
Oh, my god.

712
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:09,651
987.

713
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,448
It's the next number
in the fibonacci sequence.

714
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,583
These four walls are internal
to the bank.

715
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,672
I don't care how they got in here,
they're still in my perimeter.

716
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,291
This layout's not easy.

717
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,581
And even if they did get
through one of these walls,

718
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:25,356
they've got multiple
other walls on every side.

719
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,868
They wouldn't have time
to breach them all.

720
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,196
What's underneath?

721
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,897
A basement or access tunnels?

722
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,471
This is the basement.

723
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:35,932
There's two feet of solid steel
and then the foundation.

724
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,047
Everything under that belongs
to the city. Gas mains, sewer, electric.

725
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,142
Sewer.

726
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,610
Providence PD,

727
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:45,356
I need the closest sewer line exit
to fairmont savings bank.

728
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,172
Let's go.

729
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,410
FBI!

730
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:54,520
Freeze!

731
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,468
Come on! Come on!

732
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,293
Come on, man!
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

733
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:08,532
Reach out a little further! Come on!

734
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:11,687
Come on, man, you've almost got it!

735
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:20,310
This is Francis, id number 31556.

736
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:24,661
I need a bolo on a black cargo van
heading south on westminster.

737
00:34:24,744 --> 00:34:27,895
License plate number 10562-sierra.

738
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,928
I also need ems, suspect down.

739
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:34,794
Damn it!

740
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:35,677
Shut up.

741
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,604
Scrub down and take your shots.
I want this box open now.

742
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:40,703
Not until you show me
what this is all about.

743
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,464
One guy dead, another put away.
For that? A camera or something?

744
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:01,937
What the hell is it?

745
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,093
A word of advice...

746
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,799
don't pry into things
you couldn't possibly understand.

747
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:11,809
We're on.

748
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:14,187
He's coming tonight.

749
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:16,673
Perfect.

750
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:18,980
Very good.

751
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:32,268
I see you didn't take me up on my offer
to go see my tailor.

752
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:34,110
No, I like this suit.

753
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,953
It's always been lucky for me.

754
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,601
I can appreciate that.

755
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,547
Thank you, Mr. Kohl.

756
00:35:43,302 --> 00:35:46,049
Come back in the morning
with the paperwork for my appeal.

757
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,594
6:30 sharp?

758
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,635
I'll be happy to sign it then.

759
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,318
Oh, and wear one
of your lucky suits.

760
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,947
- Will there be anything else?
- As a matter of fact, Yes.

761
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:01,787
I'll need my people to procure

762
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,271
one last item.

763
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:05,938
And what would that be?

764
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:08,735
Not a "what", Mr. Kohl.

765
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,042
In this case,

766
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,303
a "whom".

767
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,920
Target in sight.

768
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,404
We have your service record,
Mr. Eastwick.

769
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,777
Your 1040's.

770
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,707
We know everything about you.

771
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,411
Except what it was
that you wanted so badly

772
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,340
you'd walk through a solid wall.

773
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,003
Ryan shawn eastwick, staff sergeant,

774
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:53,553
First special forces group,
third battalion.

775
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:55,704
29869,

776
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,294
617.

777
00:36:57,493 --> 00:37:00,050
You're not a pow, Eastwick.
You're a criminal.

778
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,992
Look at his hands.

779
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:04,931
- They look a little jittery.
- She's wearing him down.

780
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,592
No, I don't think so.
That looks physiological.

781
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:11,425
Call her out, would you?

782
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,726
I got an idea.

783
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:16,400
I wasn't aware you had
a background in interrogation.

784
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,324
I've been in rooms like that,

785
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,105
on both sides of the table.

786
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,292
This will either work or it won't.

787
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,638
Either way, it's only two minutes
of your time.

788
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:30,245
<i>We already have enough proof to put you
down for armed robbery times three.</i>

789
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:32,543
<i>That's over 20 years
in a federal prison.</i>

790
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,166
Do you think the
prisoners there will care

791
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:38,088
that you were once a hero
fighting for your country?

792
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:57,562
We lose him, we lose time.

793
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,995
We lose everything.

794
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,640
You're a tough guy.

795
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,908
I'm a tough guy. I think we can
dispense with the formalities.

796
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:14,672
I'm not gonna stick a thumb
in that shot-up leg of yours

797
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:18,189
Because a, I think that's exactly
what you expect me to do and b,

798
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:20,714
I don't think you'd crack anyway.

799
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,276
No, all I want from you

800
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,447
is to show me your hands.

801
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:36,429
Right.

802
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,655
Let me see if any of this
rings a bell for you.

803
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:41,568
You've been shaking uncontrollably,

804
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,872
You vomited at least twice
in the last 10 hours,

805
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,630
And this morning you found
hair on your pillow

806
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:47,077
because it's starting to fall out.

807
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,367
What's wrong with me?

808
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,701
Radiation poisoning.

809
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:52,255
Right now, you're
in the "walking ghost" phase,

810
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:54,383
which I suggest you enjoy
'cause it's a hell of lot better

811
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,767
than the intestinal bleeding,
delirium-and-coma phase.

812
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,845
You're gonna hit
in a couple of days.

813
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:01,163
You violated the laws of physics,
Mr. Eastwick,

814
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,048
And mother nature's a bitch.

815
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:08,512
Are you a doctor?

816
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,417
First, I need to know what
you were hired to steal.

817
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,306
He didn't tell us.

818
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:13,977
Who's he? I need a name.

819
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,930
He never told us his name,
all right?

820
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,132
We were freelance, hired out.

821
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:20,962
He equipped us, trained us.

822
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,228
I can tell you names of the others,
but it doesn't matter anyway.

823
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,413
He's got everything he needs now.

824
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,285
Everything he needs to do what?

825
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,227
Are you gonna help me or not?

826
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,849
Actually, Ryan. No.

827
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,576
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
on the other side of that glass

828
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:38,295
and I'm gonna watch you bleed out,

829
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,862
unless you tell me everything
I need to know!

830
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,249
I swear,
I don't know what he's doing.

831
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,639
All I know is I overheard
a phone conversation once.

832
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,799
He's going to a field in Westford.

833
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:51,284
- A field. What field?
- I don't know!

834
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,005
Look, man, you got to help me,
all right?

835
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,349
I need some medicine, okay?

836
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,726
Some specialist.

837
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,508
Please. You got to help me.

838
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:00,003
Hey!

839
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:01,509
Hey!

840
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,877
There. Westford.

841
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,779
That's 30 square miles.

842
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:09,859
How are we gonna find
one field in all of that?

843
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:10,726
Wait!

844
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:12,144
What?

845
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:14,533
I know where they're going.

846
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:16,260
There's an abandoned air strip
out there.

847
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,987
It's called little hill field.

848
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,558
"Little hill".

849
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,443
That's the code
word that Joseph Smith

850
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:24,087
gave to david Robert Jones,
in a case a few weeks ago.

851
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,116
- The guy from the german prison?
- It can't be a coincidence, Charlie.

852
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,176
It's in Westford
just off route three.

853
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,811
You come in from the west.
I'll take the south.

854
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:33,937
All right. Listen up!

855
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,783
I need every available unit
for field assist!

856
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:39,269
Let's move, move, move!

857
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:43,712
It's in here somewhere,

858
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,435
what I hid in those banks.

859
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,796
It must be.
I kept very thorough records.

860
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:53,141
Unfortunately,
not very organized records.

861
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,047
That's quite impressive.

862
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,376
It's a nervous tick.

863
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,315
Which hand?

864
00:41:10,623 --> 00:41:11,760
That's fantastic.

865
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:14,460
Magic.

866
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:20,648
What?

867
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,689
You nearly died when you were a boy.

868
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:28,401
You started bruising,
then your kidneys failed.

869
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,382
Doctors didn't know what it was,

870
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:32,892
The closest diagnosis was hepea.

871
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:36,927
It's a rare form of bird flu
that hadn't been around for decades.

872
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:40,365
Your mother...

873
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,693
was beside herself.

874
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,340
She stopped eating,
she stopped sleeping,

875
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:48,373
And I was worse.

876
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:50,672
After all, I was the scientist.

877
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:53,810
And here my only son was dying
and I couldn't do anything about it.

878
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:55,306
Walter,
I don't remember any of that.

879
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,117
I'd became consumed with saving you,

880
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,594
Conquering the disease.

881
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:02,751
In my research,
I discovered a doctor.

882
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:04,938
Alfred gross,

883
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,789
swiss, brilliant physician.

884
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,069
He was the only man that had ever
successfully cured a case of hepea.

885
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:14,239
But there was a problem.
He had died in 1936.

886
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:17,323
And so, I designed a device

887
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:21,101
intended to reach back
into time to cross

888
00:42:21,393 --> 00:42:24,946
the time-space continuum
and retrieve Alfred Gross

889
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:29,087
to bring him back with me,
to fix you, my dying son.

890
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:31,993
The device, Peter,

891
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:37,463
I think that's what I hid
in those safe deposit boxes.

892
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,923
And it worked?

893
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:41,892
You were able to go back to 1936
and get this guy?

894
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:43,860
No.

895
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:47,669
Before I could test it,
you started to recover.

896
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:51,151
The doctor said it was a miracle.

897
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:55,655
But the science behind it,
in theory, it would work.

898
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:56,999
In theory,

899
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:00,138
It could retrieve
anyone from anywhere.

900
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,825
- Dunham.
- It's Charlie.

901
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,129
I'm headed east on route three,
about two miles out. What's your 20?

902
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:45,985
I'm 10 minutes out, coming in
from the south on plain.

903
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:59,928
49.1.112295 degrees north.

904
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,704
<i>8.916092 degrees east.</i>

905
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:08,296
Horizontal angle

906
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:10,551
33.33 grad.

907
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,100
<i>We're good to go.</i>

908
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:17,413
What time do you have?

909
00:44:17,496 --> 00:44:18,429
12:30.

910
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:27,166
- Mr. Jones.
- Mr. Kohl.

911
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:33,200
I have your appeal request
all prepared and ready to go.

912
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:38,568
All I need is your signature.

913
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,389
1082, this is bravo team.

914
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:44,116
Entering Westford,
pulling south on to bridge street.

915
00:45:41,274 --> 00:45:42,565
Target captured.

916
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,521
Hello?

917
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,331
Olivia Dunham is missing.

918
00:47:44,516 --> 00:47:45,351
What?

919
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:47,102
What do you mean missing?

920
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:49,047
It appears she's been abducted.

921
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:51,117
Need I even ask?

922
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,054
Are you there?

923
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,646
Yes, yes, I'm here.

924
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:57,332
Frankly, I resent the accusation.

925
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,178
I don't make accusations,

926
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:01,302
so let me be clear.

927
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,700
- If I find out...
- Phillip, that's enough.

928
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,599
You know how I feel
about agent Dunham.

929
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:09,969
Why would I want any harm
to come to her?

930
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:13,833
Now, what do we know about
who may have taken her

931
00:48:14,422 --> 00:48:15,435
and why?

932
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,357
So, what does one say
at a moment like this?

933
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,463
Nice trip?

934
00:48:21,964 --> 00:48:23,858
I suppose that works well enough.

935
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,276
I need to get into
the decompression chamber.

936
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:28,148
- Of course.
- Do you have her?

937
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:29,305
Agent Dunham.

938
00:48:29,604 --> 00:48:31,366
She didn't even put up a fight.

939
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,495
Well, then let's
not keep her waiting.
