1
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:11,269
<i>The body was found here by
Pierre Seven.</i>

2
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,234
<i>Police are canvassing
the area.</i>

3
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:16,419
<i>No witnesses have
come forward at this time.</i>

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,995
<i>And authorities
are baffled</i>

5
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,386
<i>by what appears to be
one of the most gruesome murders</i>

6
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:21,781
<i>in Boston's history.</i>

7
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:23,079
<i>The media
has been blocked</i>

8
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,417
<i>from the immediate
crime scene</i>

9
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:25,981
<i>and all we could cope
was that a body</i>

10
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,043
<i>was found mutilated</i>

11
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,855
<i>by what might have been
a hunting knife.</i>

12
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:31,079
<i>Police are with-holding
the name of the victim</i>

13
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:32,979
<i>until their family
can be contacted.</i>

14
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:35,075
<i>There are a number of nightclubs
around here</i>

15
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,543
<i>that's not the
safest neighbourhood,</i>

16
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,942
<i>but there haven't been
violent crimes</i>

17
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,351
<i>of this nature before.</i>

18
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,787
<i>Until someone with information
comes forward,</i>

19
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:44,575
<i>police have no clues
at this bizzare murder</i>

20
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:45,943
<i>that had occured
here tonight.</i>

21
00:00:57,893 --> 00:00:58,875
Hello, beautiful.

22
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,568
<i>Finally.
Where you've been?</i>

23
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,735
<i>Did you get
my message?</i>

24
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,674
I did.

25
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:03,921
<i>But you didn't
call me back.</i>

26
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,483
No, I thought
I'd call you later.

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,758
<i>I was
at a conference.</i>

28
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,234
Where were you last night,
Bob?

29
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:10,816
<i>Where would I be?
I was at home,</i>

30
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,144
<i>I was catching up
on my sleep.</i>

31
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,284
But I called.

32
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,589
You know I turn off
the phone to get some sleep.

33
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:17,046
Come on, now,

34
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,429
you're starting
to go down that road again.

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,451
Before you know it,
you'll be all upset.

36
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,329
<i>I think this has more to do
with the miles between us,</i>

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,409
<i>all that dreary weather
you're having</i>

38
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:25,133
in Portland.

39
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,178
You'll feel much better
when you get back tomorrow.

40
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:29,137
Hey, we'll, uh,
we'll do something nice.

41
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:31,114
<i>In fact,
we'll stay in.</i>

42
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:32,393
<i>I'll cook for us.</i>

43
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,321
I'd like that, Bob.

44
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,479
<i>Listen, love,</i>

45
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,788
<i>I'll call you
when I get home tonight.</i>

46
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:38,469
Right now I've gotta go
have dinner

47
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,840
with these insufferable suits
from Hong Kong.

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,908
<i>I hope it won't be
too awful.</i>

49
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,184
You never can tell.

50
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:47,570
Bye.

51
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,055
You know
what's funny...

52
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,062
Before I came in here,
I thought I was good-looking.

53
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,515
Seriously, though, I can tell
you're my type of girl.

54
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,853
How do you know?

55
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:47,606
I know these things.

56
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:58,301
Cheers, mate.

57
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,807
I can tell you're
my kind of girl.

58
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:54,337
S01E18:
Midnight

59
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,230
<i>Oh, Olivia,</i>

60
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,185
<i>you have to hear how
Neal and Helen met.</i>

61
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,788
This could be good
for my sister.

62
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,504
We're both single...
Uh, we're in our thirties,

63
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:10,522
hadn't met anyone.

64
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:11,706
We wanted
to have kids.

65
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:13,450
Then I heard about
this program called

66
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,845
Two Singles Together.

67
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,259
Two Singles Together
was the answer for us.

68
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,328
I'm sorry, Two--

69
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,947
- Two Singles Together.
- <i>Two Singles Together.</i>

70
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,706
<i>It's a
matchmaking service.</i>

71
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,267
Not just a matchmaking service,
Rachel.

72
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:28,513
A way of life.

73
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,757
Two Singles Together?

74
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,781
Uh,
I have my own schedule.

75
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:32,806
Works for me.

76
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:35,665
I have no interest
in controlling Neil's, either.

77
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:37,992
I like vacations
in the sun and--

78
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,168
I like the snow.

79
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,948
Doesn't that kind of
defeat the purpose

80
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,388
of being in
a relationship?

81
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,407
Well, I'm--

82
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,238
There are things we agree on,
of course.

83
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,955
Like, um...
Where to live.

84
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,203
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- The appropriate kindergarten.

85
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,026
Friends we both
enjoy.

86
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:57,456
Which, incidentally,
I want to make sure

87
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,123
Ella can attend
Graham's birthday party.

88
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,879
Oh, I already R.S.V.P.'d
on the class sign up.

89
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,324
And, uh, that was for Neil's
rock climbing party

90
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:04,935
for Graham.

91
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,139
My party for Graham
is the following Saturday.

92
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,420
We are doing
science center.

93
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:14,177
Excuse me
for one minute.

94
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,411
Oh, thanks Olivia.

95
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,377
<i>I think you have...</i>

96
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:31,814
What?

97
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,253
Greg's filing for divorce.

98
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:39,919
Oh, Rach.

99
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:42,296
Not now.
Not in front of them.

100
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,041
They'll make me join
Two Singles Together.

101
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,121
Um, okay.

102
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,256
<i>Where were we?</i>

103
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,513
I'm sorry, I've just
been called into work.

104
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:04,254
Oh, what kind of work
do you do, Olivia?

105
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,086
<i>Think his name
was Bob Dart.</i>

106
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,548
<i>He was
33 years old.</i>

107
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,006
His girlfriend.

108
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,820
Got back from a business trip
in Portland.

109
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:14,842
Couldn't reach him.

110
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,048
She found him here.

111
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,683
We confirmed the trip.
No forced entry.

112
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:19,949
No witnesses.

113
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,107
So this matched the victim
that Boston P.D.

114
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,628
found two nights ago
at the Pier?

115
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,741
The one that's
been all over the news?

116
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:27,676
Yeah, they don't know
what to make of it.

117
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,166
So now
they have another one.

118
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,040
Now it's ours
to mix up.

119
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:33,041
You know what this
reminds me of, Peter?

120
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,374
Nope,
but I'm gonna guess

121
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:36,377
it's something
unbelievably disgusting.

122
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,789
Shrimp cocktail.

123
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:42,688
You see,
the shrimp must be deveined

124
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,930
by putting a
shallow cut down the back...

125
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,516
To expose the vein.

126
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:49,100
Which, in fact,
is not a vein at all,

127
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,077
but the crustaceans
intestinal tract.

128
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,152
Great,
thanks for that.

129
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:54,838
Another foodstuff I can
cross off the menu for life.

130
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,039
Hey, you okay?

131
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:00,011
Why?

132
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:02,445
Well, you were awfully quiet
on the car ride over here

133
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,269
and you just don't seem
your normal, chipper self

134
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:05,757
at a bloody,
gruesome crime scene.

135
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,311
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm, um...

136
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,244
It's just home stuff.

137
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,247
Well, I know
from home stuff.

138
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,329
I live with a guy

139
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,738
<i>who's inspecting
a severed spine.</i>

140
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:18,751
<i>This is fascinating.</i>

141
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,946
These appear
to be bite marks.

142
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,642
See how
the flesh is ripped

143
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:28,389
and jagged markings.

144
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,501
Canine or even ursine,
but human.

145
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,118
You're suggesting that
<i>someone</i> chewed his spine out?

146
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,034
Yes.
But with a jaw strength.

147
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,751
<i>Well in excess of that
of a normal human being.</i>

148
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,441
Great, well, maybe we're
looking for Dracula.

149
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,565
Finally, son,
you're opening your mind

150
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:46,954
to new possibilities.

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,212
<i>But, no...</i>

152
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,586
There are no vampires,
sadly.

153
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,458
But it'll be something exciting,
I'm sure.

154
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:02,404
We have another monster
on the loose?

155
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:03,339
Uh, no, sir.

156
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:06,297
Walter says that the teeth marks
are definitely human.

157
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,441
I can just about remember
when a suspect being human

158
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,741
was a given,
not an option.

159
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,289
Bob Dunn's girlfriend

160
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,935
said that he had a car,
an Audi A-4.

161
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,240
It wasn't in the garage,

162
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:17,770
and we couldn't find it when
we did a two-block sweep.

163
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:18,864
Local P.D. is on it.

164
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:19,981
Yeah,
we could get lucky.

165
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,276
Maybe the killer took it.

166
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,544
And Dr. Bishop?

167
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,294
He's at the lab
with both bodies,

168
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,505
doing autopsies.

169
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:26,025
<i>Okay...</i>

170
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,156
Well, let me know
if you learn anything.

171
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:32,970
Is there something else?

172
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,515
This may sound impolitic,
sir, but...

173
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:38,707
I was wondering

174
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:41,281
if you were satisfied
with your divorce attorney.

175
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,549
I've heard you talking
on the phone to your kids,

176
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,761
but never
to your wife.

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,056
I was satisfied.

178
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,998
Except for the bill.

179
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,106
I was wondering
if I might be able

180
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,419
to get
the name and number.

181
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,105
It should be waiting
in your inbox.

182
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:13,752
Thank you.

183
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,903
I hope things work out
for your sister.

184
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,887
I pay attention too,
Agent Dunham.

185
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,191
The C-1
cervical vertebrae

186
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:30,545
is connected to the
C-2 cervical vertebrae.

187
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,605
C-2 cervical vertebrae
is connected to the

188
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,612
- C-3 cervical verterbrae.
- Look, Walter...

189
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:35,341
That's enough.

190
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:36,877
When you finally
meet a nice girl,

191
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,222
I would avoid
bringing her home

192
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,687
for as long as possible.

193
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:42,529
Walter, this is the lab work
you requested on the victims.

194
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,448
Excellent.

195
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:47,808
It may help us understand
why their spinal columns

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,209
have been completely drained
of spinal fluid.

197
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:51,359
<i>The killer
took the victims'</i>

198
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:52,661
- spinal fluid?
- Hmm.

199
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,867
Why would they
do that?

200
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,851
Where would the fun be
if we already knew

201
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:56,905
all there is to know?

202
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,010
This is interesting.

203
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,212
Traces of
treponema pallidum.

204
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,778
That's the
syphilis bacteria.

205
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,599
On the victim's
neck and back.

206
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,808
<i>Most likely from
the killer's saliva.</i>

207
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,431
So the killer has
syphilis.

208
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:13,675
- Seems so.
- <i>Great.</i>

209
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,270
<i>Should have worn gloves.</i>

210
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,341
And what's even more
fascinating...

211
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,315
This particular strain
of syphilis is extinct.

212
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,992
<i>Has been
for decades.</i>

213
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,158
Well, how could the killer
be exposed to an extinct

214
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:26,287
strain of syphilis?

215
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,566
See,
isn't this fun?

216
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,719
I appreciate the CDC's
prompt response on this matter.

217
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,083
Of course.
I ran an index search.

218
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,244
A sample of that particular
strain of syphilis

219
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,121
was shipped out
four weeks ago

220
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,595
to a
Lubov Pharmaceuticals.

221
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,838
They have a local address
on Brighton.

222
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:48,157
Well, thank you, but a phone call
would have sufficed.

223
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,871
Actually, I'm not sure
that it would have.

224
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,964
Because their address
is on a residential area,

225
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,345
I took the
liberty of running

226
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,437
the rest of
Lubov's research requests

227
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:58,924
over the
past few years.

228
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,027
This isn't the first contagion
they've ordered from us.

229
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,754
In fact, there have been
quite a few.

230
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:12,737
We need to show this
to Broyles.

231
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:15,939
Any reputable scientist
with the appropriate credentials

232
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,648
can procure samples
of bacteria and viruses

233
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,701
for their research.

234
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,091
In addition to the extinct
syphilis bacteria,

235
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,146
Lubov Pharmaceuticals
also procured

236
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,888
a sample of a substance
called RUD-390.

237
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:29,586
Which is...

238
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,883
A chemical compound

239
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,143
used in the construction
of bioweapons.

240
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,807
You're suggesting
whoever's behind these killings

241
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,634
may also be planning
a biological attack?

242
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,054
Or has before.

243
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,729
<i>RUD-390 was</i>

244
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:43,669
one of the components
of the rapid skin growth toxin

245
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:44,899
that killed
Agent Kent.

246
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:46,462
You're saying
this is Z.F.T.?

247
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:47,957
Z.F.T.?

248
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:49,704
What's that?

249
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,655
We believe Z.F.T.
is a terrorist organization...

250
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,148
Responsible for a number
of bio attacks

251
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,165
in the last year.

252
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,326
I see.

253
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,182
Why?
What is their agenda?

254
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,898
That's what
we wanna find out.

255
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,593
Assemble an assault squad.

256
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,558
- Move on Lubov.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,789
Federal agents.
You're under arrest.

258
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,728
<i>Dr. Nicholas Boone.</i>

259
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,732
Advanced degrees in hematology
and biochemistry.

260
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,229
Founder of
Lubov Pharmaceuticals,

261
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,708
<i>a multinational
biotech firm</i>

262
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:22,159
<i>whose corporate offices
turn out to be in a split level...</i>

263
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:23,290
In Brighton.

264
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,494
<i>Now we know that
there's a strain of syphilis</i>

265
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,947
<i>that you ordered
was found on his spine.</i>

266
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,639
Can't you see these?

267
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,087
They're human bite marks.

268
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:39,445
What is out there
doing this?

269
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,666
<i>What happened
to these people?</i>

270
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:49,174
How long have you been
a follower of Z.F.T.?

271
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,536
That's right, Dr. Boone.

272
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,423
We know about Z.F.T.

273
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,192
What do you know?

274
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,742
Enough to know that they're
using the world

275
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,828
as a testing ground
for experiments.

276
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:05,006
We want to know more
about David Robert Jones,

277
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,183
about who funds Z.F.T.
and why.

278
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,246
We want to know
what we're dealing with.

279
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,548
I don't have to spell it out
for you, Dr. Boone.

280
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,899
<i>You talk to us,
give us information.</i>

281
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:17,314
Help us with whatever's out
there killing people.

282
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,133
It'll go better for you.

283
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,551
What is doing this?

284
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,111
<i>What have you done?</i>

285
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,995
- Someone was dosed.
- With what?

286
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:33,966
Dosed with what?!

287
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,704
I know a lot
about the things you want.

288
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:40,421
<i>And more.</i>

289
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,339
<i>And I'll answer
your questions.</i>

290
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,050
But you have
to help me first.

291
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:47,853
Help with what?

292
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,268
They have my wife.

293
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,875
I want you
to get her back.

294
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,684
<i>Z.F.T. has your wife?</i>

295
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:01,732
<i>Agent Dunham...</i>

296
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,130
What counts
with punishment

297
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,982
is the ability to know
whom to hurt, and when.

298
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:08,064
You're telling me
Z.F.T.'s coercing you...

299
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:09,807
To conduct
these experiments

300
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:12,035
by threatening
to harm your wife.

301
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,512
Why would they be
punishing you?

302
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,739
Because when I realized
what my work was being used for,

303
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:19,456
I tried to get out.

304
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,568
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

305
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:24,419
But first,
you have to get my wife back.

306
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:31,116
Do you believe him?

307
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:33,290
I don't.

308
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,965
Boone's wife
is a nurse.

309
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,083
I checked with her hospital,

310
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,685
and she hasn't been to work
in three weeks.

311
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:38,624
Proves nothing.

312
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,425
I'm inclined to agree
with Agent Francis.

313
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,072
Everything we know
about these guys

314
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,457
Suggests that
they're Zealots.

315
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,844
Why don't we go
back in there;

316
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,380
ask them why the sudden
change of heart?

317
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,266
We can't ask him a thing
until we get his wife.

318
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,102
- Could be a trap.
- Could be the truth.

319
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,711
I'm sorry,
but since I've been working

320
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:56,070
in Fringe Division,
81 people have lost their lives.

321
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,940
And that's not including
the 147 on Flight 627.

322
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,323
In my entire career,

323
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,543
only nine people have died
on cases that I worked.

324
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,497
This is the closest
that we've ever come

325
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,026
to getting traction
and stopping these people.

326
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,287
Getting a handle
on Z.F.T.,

327
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:12,637
Jones...

328
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,229
Or more.

329
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,427
This guy could be
our chance.

330
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:20,627
What is it?

331
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:22,029
The address
Boone gave us,

332
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,428
where he says
they're holding his wife.

333
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,768
It's a restaurant...
in Chinatown.

334
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:29,107
Doesn't exactly scream
Z.F.T. hive of activity.

335
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,382
<i>They've been
tagged right at us.</i>

336
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:30,987
Meaning?

337
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,253
They're burning five times
more power a month

338
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,943
<i>than they should
making moo shoo pork.</i>

339
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,516
They could be using the power
for something else.

340
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,840
Maybe to facilitate
a laboratory?

341
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,127
This could be our chance
to get to Z.F.T.

342
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,109
Go, get 'em.

343
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,041
<i>I'll get it
teamed together.</i>

344
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,830
<i>Peter and
Walter Bishop.</i>

345
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,558
We're here to catalog
the chemical evidence.

346
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,127
Walter Bishop,
nice to meet you.

347
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,251
Hello. Um...
Hello, please.

348
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,645
Uh, Bishop,
Walter Bishop.

349
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,411
Walter, you don't have
to shake everybody's hand.

350
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,261
He gets a little nervous
around authority figures.

351
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,181
Oh, boy.

352
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,156
<i>Look at that.</i>

353
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:18,915
Benzyl alcohol.

354
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,604
<i>Colorless liquid used
as a bacteriostatic</i>

355
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:23,022
in solutions
for injection,

356
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,763
topically
as a local anaesthetic.

357
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,492
Personally,
I'd like to use it as a mouth wash.

358
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,217
What did this guy
create?

359
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,694
<i>From what I've seen so far,
I am</i>

360
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,766
forming a hypothesis.

361
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,267
Would you
care to hear it?

362
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:39,729
Well,
I don't know.

363
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,836
Would I ever be able
to sleep at night again?

364
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,300
Well,
that depends.

365
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,645
Depends on what?

366
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,216
On whether the light is
on or not.

367
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:51,834
<i>There's four exits.</i>

368
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:53,911
Risk and Walken,
you take the rear.

369
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,970
Taub and Brown,
you take the side.

370
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,169
Dunham and I are gonna be in
the front with the rest of you.

371
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,172
And remember,
this is a hostile situation

372
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,430
in a
contained environment.

373
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:04,773
So retrieving the hostage
unharmed is our top priority.

374
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,830
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dunham.

375
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,814
Greg wants
full custody of Ella.

376
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:09,783
What?

377
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,156
<i>Another process server</i>

378
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,159
just came by.

379
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,362
Greg is claiming that I am
an unfit parent.

380
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,120
<i>That "the minor's mental and
physical well-being would be</i>

381
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:20,314

382
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,412
"sole custody
of the petitioner."

383
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,720
He can't be serious.

384
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,254
<i>I won't
let that happen, Liv.</i>

385
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,143
I will
run if I have to.

386
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,031
I will take her and I will
disappear,

387
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,216
<i>I swear to God.</i>

388
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,780
Okay, Rachel, Rachel...
Just calm down.

389
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,189
You're not running anywhere,
and you're not gonna lose Ella.

390
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,384
He's just doing this
to hurt me.

391
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:40,335
Okay, Rachel,
listen to me.

392
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:42,359
Now, this is just
one of those things

393
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,611
that you're gonna
look back on

394
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:45,627
and you're gonna say,
"I beat that too."

395
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,714
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

396
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,358
I hear you.

397
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,017
Okay.
So, um, look,

398
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,250
let's talk
when I get home.

399
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,449
I-I've got a...

400
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,706
I gotta go
to a meeting.

401
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,489
Okay.

402
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,813
Ahem.

403
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:05,819
We got that meeting.

404
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,082
<i>Freeze!</i>

405
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:29,428
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

406
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,895
- F.B.I.!
- Get your ass on the floor!

407
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,070
- Clear?
- Clear.

408
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,774
Uhh! Uhh!

409
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:42,201
Huh?

410
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,205
Your wife isn't there.

411
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:55,752
I know that.

412
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,034
I need to talk
to Agent Dunham.

413
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:05,377
Dunham.

414
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:06,570
<i>I'm putting him on.</i>

415
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:11,937
Agent Dunham.

416
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,354
What the hell's
going on?

417
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,494
There's a room in the back.
Can you see it?

418
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,626
Yeah, we checked.
She's not there.

419
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,774
I know,
but what I need is.

420
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,811
Okay, I'm here.

421
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:23,445
In front of you,
you should see

422
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,208
a row of
refrigeration units.

423
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:26,737
<i>Third from the right.</i>

424
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:27,699
Yeah, I see it.

425
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:28,990
<i>Open it.</i>

426
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:31,308
You know,
I'm not gonna do a thing

427
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,850
until you tell me
why we're here.

428
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,842
We're getting to that.

429
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:35,234
No, you tell me now.

430
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,113
Inside that cooling unit

431
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:39,576
<i>you'll find a contagion,</i>

432
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:42,811
<i>five vials
marked XT-43.</i>

433
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,146
The person
who's out there killing

434
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:46,434
has been dosed
with this.

435
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:48,794
<i>I need it
to make an antidote.</i>

436
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:49,979
You lied to me?

437
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:50,631
No.

438
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,032
Agent Dunham...

439
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:55,991
They didn't kidnap
my wife.

440
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,420
They infected her.

441
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:01,509
<i>That was my punishment
for trying to leave Z.F.T.</i>

442
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,330
It's she
who's out there killing.

443
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,550
<i>Valerie Boone.</i>

444
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,149
<i>Valerie Boone,
you turn March into June.</i>

445
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,511
<i>- Alright.
- Okay, that's enough.</i>

446
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,589
<i>You...
You be on camera.

447
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,488
<i>- I always do this.
- No.</i>

448
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:26,795
<i>I have no interest
in being on camera.</i>

449
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:27,679
<i>- Come on, you.
- We'll both...</i>

450
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,833
<i>Are we both in?
Okay, that's me.</i>

451
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:31,226
<i>- Hi!
- Hello.</i>

452
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,614
<i>Us in the park!</i>

453
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,891
You are so beautiful.

454
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:39,135
You are really warm.

455
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,778
You're burning up.

456
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,425
What--
What's wrong?

457
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:55,773
You're my kind of guy.

458
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:01,986
I'm sorry.

459
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:28,890
<i>Dunham.</i>

460
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,056
Charlie's running
a background check on the body

461
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:32,273
he found
on the Mustang.

462
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:34,114
Peter said that
you had something I should see.

463
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,058
We found this at
Boone's house.

464
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,339
You wanna pay
specific attention to the date.

465
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,045
<i>Ahh...</i>

466
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:00,366
<i>Whoever wore a lab coat
and rubber gloves.</i>

467
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,094
<i>Valerie Boone.</i>

468
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,819
<i>Valerie Boone,
you turn March into June.</i>

469
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,018
<i>Okay, that's enough.
You-you be on camera.</i>

470
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,059
<i>- I have no--
- I always do this.</i>

471
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,291
<i>I have no interest
in being on camera.</i>

472
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:11,184
<i>- Come on, you--
- Okay, we'll both...</i>

473
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:11,924
<i>All right.</i>

474
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,410
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

475
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,483
<i>Us in the park!</i>

476
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:16,924
<i>Where is--
Okay.</i>

477
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,157
<i>Look out.
Okay.</i>

478
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:19,676
<i>- Okay.
- There, okay, that's it.</i>

479
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,563
<i>No, no, no!
That's not it.</i>

480
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,934
<i>There he goes.</i>

481
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:27,718
<i>Oh, my God, you look like
you ran in the trash can.</i>

482
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,943
That video was taken
three weeks ago,

483
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:38,249
Dr. Boone.

484
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:41,189
<i>Can you explain to me
why you are in a wheelchair today?</i>

485
00:25:43,654 --> 00:25:45,215
She needs to feed.

486
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:47,612
She can't control it.

487
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:54,773
I began to feed her
my own spinal fluid.

488
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,252
The more I gave,

489
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,980
the more she craved,
until...

490
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:03,876
I couldn't give
anymore.

491
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:10,948
The contagion burns through
her spinal fluid

492
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,834
faster than her body
can replace it.

493
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,825
When she kills,
it's simply to...

494
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,943
Refuel.

495
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:22,848
<i>I tried to synthesize
the antidote on my own,</i>

496
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:27,018
watching her suffer the effects
of being infected.

497
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,026
But I couldn't do it.

498
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,561
Not without a dose
of the bacteria to work from.

499
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,820
For the rest of my life,

500
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,726
this chair will remind me
of what I've done.

501
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:43,463
Why would Z.F.T. want you
to create something like this?

502
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,753
To create a
human nightmare.

503
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,079
The syphilis
was just a platform.

504
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,836
Carrier
for other attributes.

505
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,781
Attributes that
changed her.

506
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,205
For what purpose?

507
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:02,040
For the same reason
they asked me to...

508
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:04,850
create the
skin growth toxin...

509
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,904
To show off.

510
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:07,951
To who?

511
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:09,576
Other scientists.

512
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:12,094
You mean
nothing to them.

513
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:14,037
So how many vials
were created?

514
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:15,739
Just the ones
that I took?

515
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,674
I made six,
now accounted for,

516
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:20,061
but I can't guarantee they won't
pick up where I left off.

517
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,675
If they did figure out
how to make it,

518
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:24,342
could they weaponize
this bacteria?

519
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,267
You really don't know

520
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,279
who you're dealing with.

521
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:35,118
The answer for both of us
is to let me make a cure.

522
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:39,107
Now that you've recovered
the dose samples,

523
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:40,579
I can make it.

524
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:43,469
My offer still stands.

525
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:48,337
I'll tell you everything I know
when you find her.

526
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:51,068
If the cure works,
we both win.

527
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:54,508
Now I'll need access to a lab
with a blood analyzer.

528
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:57,619
<i>I'll also need a spectroscope
and a centrifuge.</i>

529
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,006
You might want to
write this down.

530
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,855
That won't be a problem.

531
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,734
<i>You really think
it's a good idea</i>

532
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,775
to let him have
free reign

533
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:09,440
in Walter's
believe-it-or-not emporium?

534
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,552
Oh,
and this is something

535
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:14,146
<i>my son Peter
is working on.</i>

536
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:16,543
I haven't got
the faintest idea what it is.

537
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,419
Your centrifuge is
20 years old.

538
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,437
Oh, 25.

539
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:22,976
It's an oldie,
but a goody.

540
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,085
I also have a cow.

541
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,519
And,
just for the record,

542
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:29,182
one mad scientist
is my limit.

543
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:31,032
I think that having him
help Walter

544
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:32,781
is our best chance
at saving lives.

545
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,686
- Dunham.
- <i>It's Charlie.</i>

546
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,644
We found
Bob Dunn's missing car.

547
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:44,130
<i>Where?</i>

548
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,016
Clear across town,
in Mission Hill.

549
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,816
It's completely stripped.

550
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:49,812
Quarter panels,
radio, everything.

551
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,892
- The GPS?
- No, it's gone.

552
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:54,380
<i>We got no way to track
where he picked up Boone's wife.</i>

553
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,409
Okay,
thanks, Charlie.

554
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,099
Uh,
good news, Peter.

555
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,466
Nicholas and I
are in agreement

556
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:00,619
about this penicillin.

557
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:03,478
Yes, we need to purify the mould,
then ferment it.

558
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,187
To the highest possible
concentration.

559
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:09,045
<i>Agent Farnsworth,
we're going to need a rat.</i>

560
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,311
Can you, uh, call me
if something else turns up?

561
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:12,659
Okay, bye.

562
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:15,104
Great news.
They made a breakthrough.

563
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,243
They're gonna fight
the super syphilis

564
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:17,231
with super penicillin.

565
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:18,564
Syphilis
was the platform.

566
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:20,415
If they can kill the syphilis,
they can stop the contagion.

567
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:22,640
<i>They did the same thing
once against super pneumonia.</i>

568
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:24,173
Right.

569
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,078
Well, Charlie just found
Dunn's car,

570
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:27,618
stripped
in Mission Hill.

571
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:29,286
Excellent.
He check the GPS?

572
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:29,922
Stolen.

573
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,702
Well, everything stolen
is not necessarily lost.

574
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,952
Meaning what?

575
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,420
Meaning if there's
a car found stripped

576
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,322
in the
Greater Boston area,

577
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,597
I can guarantee you my man
Mako has his big toe in it.

578
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:43,289
Oh, you have a friend
who runs a chop shop?

579
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:43,997
Yeah.

580
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,183
You make that sound
so illegal.

581
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:53,360
Dunham.

582
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,865
Let's just say the GPS is here,
allegedly.

583
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:00,171
But it's useless because
it's been wiped for resale.

584
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:01,868
Hypothetically.

585
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,073
We're trying to track a killer,
Mr. Mako.

586
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,079
Nah, it's just Mako.
You know, like "Cher."

587
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:11,145
Theoretically,
if the GPS is wiped,

588
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,923
then that would put you
in a rough spot,

589
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:15,391
because you'd be hampering
a federal investigation.

590
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,172
I'm trying
to work with you here.

591
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,135
We need the GPS to find out
where the victim was

592
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,036
the night
of his killing.

593
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:21,999
But you stole his car
from his home in Brookline.

594
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,384
I didn't steal his car
from Brookline.

595
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,107
Where'd you
steal it from?

596
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,705
If I tell you where
we boosted that car,

597
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,518
can we just say that this
conversation never happened?

598
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:34,109
Hypothetically?

599
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:35,743
Sure.

600
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:37,862
Route 18th,
Weymouth.

601
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,034
By the water.

602
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:47,816
Fascinating.

603
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:51,157
105 degrees.

604
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,121
Then the rat's
successfully infected.

605
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,626
This strain of syphilis
raises the body temperature

606
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:57,760
well above normal.

607
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:01,562
The cure
is nearly complete.

608
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,882
Once this penicillin
concentrates,

609
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,088
we can test it
on the rat.

610
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:11,829
Where did you study,
Nicholas?

611
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,183
At the Curie Institute
in Paris.

612
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,320
Kings College,
Aberdeen, Scotland.

613
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:19,660
It's quite a fall.

614
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,555
It's an honor to have
your intellect in my lab.

615
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:27,960
That's high praise.

616
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:32,306
Because I know very well
who you are.

617
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,867
Well...

618
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,967
That makes one of us.

619
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,848
<i>A little memory loss</i>

620
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,376
is often kind
to the soul.

621
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,040
That a figure of speech?

622
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,022
Or do you believe
there is such a thing?

623
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:49,650
The soul.

624
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,890
There are days
when I wish I did.

625
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,598
There are days when
I wish I didn't.

626
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,479
I-I often wake up at night,
frightened,

627
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,620
with the understanding
that there are things

628
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,626
man shouldn't know.

629
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,829
That the scientific trespasses
I've committed--

630
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,019
Will one day be judged.

631
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:20,462
Belly and I would often
debate this very thing.

632
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,356
William Bell.
You've heard of him?

633
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,106
Of course.

634
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,601
Founder of
Massive Dynamic.

635
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,118
Richest man
in the world.

636
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,634
We used to share a lab.

637
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,166
Quite a fall.

638
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:37,492
Hmm.

639
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:40,126
<i>If indeed
there is a soul,</i>

640
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:41,853
we must consider then

641
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,675
that there is
still time for redemption.

642
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:49,039
We're not being hauled off
to be judged yet, Nicholas.

643
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:57,694
This must be where
Mako boosted the car.

644
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,333
<i>All the shattered glass.</i>

645
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:02,279
So we're thinking what?

646
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,077
Boone's wife
kills this guy,

647
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:06,820
steals his car,
and then drives it out here?

648
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:08,180
Yeah.

649
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:10,110
But what was she
doing here?

650
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,576
And where did she go?

651
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,264
You know what I hate worst
than the cold?

652
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:19,530
What?

653
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:21,129
Not much.

654
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,156
Olivia...

655
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:29,329
Think I know
why she came out here.

656
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:53,197
The camera,
aspirin.

657
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:58,565
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

658
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,189
<i>Ahem.</i>

659
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,767
We are about to inject
the infected rat

660
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:04,750
with an antidote.

661
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,517
Should it prove effective,

662
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:09,591
it will no doubt
work on humans as well.

663
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,177
Nicholas.

664
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:19,921
<i>Now we wait.</i>

665
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,473
<i>Ah! Marvelous.</i>

666
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:26,219
<i>You can bring the bodies
right this way, gentlemen.</i>

667
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,319
We've been expecting you.

668
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,731
Right over here
is fine.

669
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,861
May I offer you
a peak freen?

670
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,171
A delicious vanilla wafer
with raspberry center

671
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:37,928
and lemon cream.

672
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:39,566
He doesn't want a cookie,
Walter.

673
00:34:40,758 --> 00:34:42,986
Uh...
Apparently, you're wrong.

674
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,169
<i>That's
two more bodies.</i>

675
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,687
One we found
in the forest in Weymouth.

676
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,279
<i>The other on the street
in Roxbury.</i>

677
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:52,322
Where is she getting
her victims?

678
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,271
You must have some idea
where she'd go.

679
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:56,624
The person out there
killing people

680
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,263
is not thinking
like my wife.

681
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,070
Well, she wouldn't
recognize me...

682
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,412
Let alone find comfort
in places she knows.

683
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,851
<i>This one's
been drinking.</i>

684
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:08,500
He smells
like a brewery.

685
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:17,859
Hey, Peter, will you
turn out the lights?

686
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:18,862
Seriously?

687
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,453
Oh!
All right, Peter.

688
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,311
I ordered it
on television.

689
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:30,705
It's an entry stamp.

690
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:37,950
He's got
the same one.

691
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:39,276
It's a place
called the Cavern.

692
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:41,429
Industrial area
is really happening

693
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:42,926
in the underground club scene
right now.

694
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,177
So she's going to the club
to find these victims.

695
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,347
Look, I need more time
to make the cure.

696
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,026
Please.

697
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:00,510
<i>If you take her alive,</i>

698
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,837
I know
I can save her.

699
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:04,994
I'll see what I can do.

700
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:34,242
Dunham, FBI.
Him too, he's with me.

701
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,316
Now you're
my kind of guy.

702
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,539
What is that?

703
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,365
It's a hand-held
thermal imaging radiometer.

704
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,029
It tells me
if you're hot.

705
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,191
So...

706
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:21,090
So you're definitely hot.

707
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:22,422
But...

708
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:26,087
I'm looking for someone
with syphilis.

709
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,223
Uh, okay.

710
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,321
I don't understand.
Something's wrong.

711
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:37,942
Something's missing.

712
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:41,538
The rat's body
has rejected the cure.

713
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,981
Perhaps a protein
incompatibility.

714
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:46,088
No, it's not that.

715
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,242
I know what's wrong.

716
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,169
The contagion required
cerebral spinal fluid...

717
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,428
as a catalyst.

718
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,488
And the cure must
require some as well.

719
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,193
Bond the cure
to the contagion.

720
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,721
Yes, and the only spinal fluid
we know for a fact

721
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:01,629
is compatible...
is my own.

722
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:03,578
Well, no, that's
out of the question.

723
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:04,283
It's too dangerous.

724
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,448
If you lose
more spinal fluid,

725
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:07,750
it could cause
a brain haemorrhage.

726
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,998
No,
I was very careful

727
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:11,116
to monitor
the amount of fluid I removed.

728
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:13,465
Another 25 milliliters
should be safe.

729
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,964
Walter...
We can't.

730
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,624
We have
no other choice!

731
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:20,879
Walter?

732
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,905
Prep the table,
Agent Farnsworth.

733
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,231
Thank you.

734
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:42,873
Anything?

735
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:44,783
No, not yet.

736
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:05,866
I got her.

737
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:07,434
<i>She's moving along
the back walk.</i>

738
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,190
<i>Peter,
I can't find her.</i>

739
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,087
She was right there,
but she's gone now.

740
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:30,767
Okay...

741
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:31,628
Um...

742
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:33,988
Alright, keep looking.
I'm gonna check in with Charlie.

743
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:38,479
Hey, Charlie?

744
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,085
<i>We had her,
but we lost her.</i>

745
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,135
<i>You got the exit?</i>

746
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,526
Nobody is leaving yet.

747
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,161
She's still
in there with you, Liv.

748
00:40:05,957 --> 00:40:08,996
<i>You prepare the spinal fluid,
Agent Farnsworth.</i>

749
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:12,778
Come on up.

750
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:15,461
Here we go.
Gently.

751
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,514
Okay, gently,
gently, gently.

752
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:24,459
- Alright.
- Yes, thanks.

753
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,465
Charlie...

754
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:56,328
<i>Yeah, Charlie,
I think she's headed to you.</i>

755
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,440
What's she wearing?

756
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,567
<i>Black dress...</i>

757
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,538
and freakishly blue eyes.

758
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:01,708
On it.

759
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:06,770
<i>Valerie Boone?</i>

760
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:08,150
Are you Valerie Boone?

761
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,169
<i>It's her.
Take her down.</i>

762
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:16,075
Alright,
we got her.

763
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,642
- Clear the area.
- <i>You just shot that woman!</i>

764
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,142
<i>I just got
off the phone</i>

765
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:33,919
with Olivia.

766
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:36,568
Good news, Dr. Boone.
They have her.

767
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:37,885
Oh, excellent!

768
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:39,918
Dr. Boone?

769
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,487
- Walter...
- <i>Hmm?</i>

770
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,941
Get me
a TPA injection.

771
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:49,498
You lied to me.

772
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:52,805
You let me take too much
spinal fluid.

773
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,599
How far
would you go

774
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,143
for someone you love?

775
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,192
Unh!

776
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:10,117
How's she doing?

777
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:13,176
<i>She's going to be out
for hours.</i>

778
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:17,044
Where's the siren
on this thing?

779
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:18,989
There.

780
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,407
Is that why
you wanted to drive?

781
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,452
Everybody should get to do this
at least once before they die.

782
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,104
That looks says
more than just,

783
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,715
"I wish I hadn't have
let him drive."

784
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,764
I was just thinking
about Nicholas Boone

785
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,923
and what
he did for his wife.

786
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:03,106
What he is doing.

787
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:05,110
Geez,
that kind of love.

788
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,977
Greg asked Rachel
for a divorce,

789
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:12,554
and now he's fighting her
for custody.

790
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:14,593
You know,
I never liked that guy.

791
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,220
You've never met Greg.

792
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,578
Yeah,
but I met your sister.

793
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:19,095
So I know
she deserves better.

794
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,919
And I thought you were
a card-carrying cynic.

795
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,673
I am, world class.

796
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:26,183
But there's an argument to be
made that beneath every cynic,

797
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,595
there is a
frustrated romantic.

798
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:29,128
Agh!

799
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:30,470
<i>Uhh!</i>

800
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:36,495
Ohh!

801
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:38,407
<i>Peter!</i>

802
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:42,953
Peter,
my tranq gun.

803
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:49,901
Uhh!

804
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:56,742
Thank you.

805
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:04,164
<i>I think
she liked you.</i>

806
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,228
Good. Bring her in,
strap her down.

807
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,174
Walter,
what happened?

808
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,751
He had a stroke.

809
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,594
- Pulse is strong.
- Yeah, so is she.

810
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:26,576
Agent Farnsworth,
30CCs of the antidote, please.

811
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:28,450
<i>Peter.</i>

812
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,261
Thank you.

813
00:44:55,665 --> 00:44:56,665
You're welcome.

814
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:02,911
Okay, now what?

815
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:03,974
Now, we wait.

816
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:09,923
Uhh!

817
00:45:10,005 --> 00:45:10,903
Walter...

818
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:13,520
No! Let her!

819
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:31,572
Is she...

820
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,852
Seems to be working.

821
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:01,634
Agent Farnsworth...

822
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:04,374
Prepare a solution,

823
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:06,090
<i>30 parts saline.</i>

824
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,347
<i>And some adrenaline</i>

825
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:11,671
<i>and perhaps
a cup of coffee.</i>

826
00:46:14,048 --> 00:46:14,739
Walter.

827
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:15,765
Hmm?

828
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,047
He's gone.

829
00:46:57,345 --> 00:47:00,742
Dr. Boone asked me
to give this to you personally,

830
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:01,682
Agent Dunham.

831
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,224
What is it, Walter?

832
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:27,202
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

833
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,455
<i>if you're watching this,</i>

834
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:31,481
<i>I suspect
I didn't make it.</i>

835
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,214
<i>But you and I
had a bargain,</i>

836
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,854
<i>and, uh,
you held up your end.</i>

837
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,134
<i>Now, I have made
many mistakes in my life,</i>

838
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:43,674
<i>But... in the end,
I should at least</i>

839
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:45,071
<i>be a man of my word.</i>

840
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,643
<i>And I promised you
answers.</i>

841
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,710
<i>With any luck,
you will use them</i>

842
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,209
<i>to rectify
some of my misdeeds.</i>

843
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,516
<i>Now, in the time
I worked with Z.F.T.,</i>

844
00:47:58,148 --> 00:48:00,714
<i>I never dealt with anyone
of significant rank</i>

845
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:02,373
<i>within
the movement.</i>

846
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:06,244
<i>But I was able
to gather some names.</i>

847
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:11,318
<i>Including some I suspect
you've already heard of.</i>

848
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:32,928
Dunham.

849
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:34,645
Hey.

850
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:36,475
Are you all right?

851
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:37,288
Yeah.

852
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:41,140
Uh,
Nicholas Boone talked.

853
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,245
He told us everything he knew
about Z.F.T.

854
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:45,224
Did he mention
David Robert Jones?

855
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:47,557
No, he said
he'd never heard of him.

856
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:50,647
But he did mention another name
that we've heard before.

857
00:48:52,577 --> 00:48:53,607
According to Boone,

858
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:55,881
the man
who's funding Z.F.T...

859
00:48:57,745 --> 00:48:59,206
is William Bell.
