<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

2
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:03,878
We have evidence that indicates
William Bell may be involved

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,755
with several biological attacks.

4
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:08,143
I will turn this world over
looking for him.

5
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:10,468
William Bell is not in this world.

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,136
I've been waiting for this.

7
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,472
- Who are you?
- I'm William Bell.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,690
Where am I?

9
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:20,205
You were missing from your car
for at least an hour

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,247
- before you came crashing back.
- He told me something.

11
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:24,774
- Who?
- I can't remember.

12
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,735
But It was very important.
There's something that I have to do.

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,608
Walter thinks, he was a shape-changing
soldier from another universe.

14
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,828
Charlie, what if I don't
want to remember?

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,962


16
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:04,472
Mind if we speed things up, Kurt?

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,489
I'd hate for these popsicles to melt.

18
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:08,505
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

19
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,540
Cargo is secure.

20
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,520
Who is this guy?

21
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,353
Could I get some directions?

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,480
What are you doing here?
You're trespassing, pal.

23
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,710
Why don't you get in your car
and turn around?

24
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:49,660
Sure.

25
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,824
Oh, my God! Son of a bitch!
We got to call...

26
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,079
- Anyone else in the warehouse?
- That's it.

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,082
The keys are in his pocket.

28
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,546
Let me know if he's in there.
You know where to reach...

34
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,101
100, Walter.

35
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,829
Almost, 50 more chops.

36
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,732
So, you said you wanted to see me.

37
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,273
I had an idea.

38
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:34,839
 I think I may be able
to help you retrieve your memories

39
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,713
From the accident, when you disappeared
from the automobile in New York.

40
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,961
- I remember that bit.
- Of course you do.

41
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,599
Walter, I thought that we agreed
that this was a stupid idea.

42
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,475
 No, you decided. I still maintain
that the principle is perfectly sound.

43
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,518
He wants you to eat worms.

44
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,953
 Not just worms, flatworms!

45
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,733
The thing is,

46
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,319
I recalled an experiment
that Belly and I did

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,304
where we trained a handful of flatworms
to respond to light.

48
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,826
We then crushed them up
and fed them to other worms.

49
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:05,500
It was Belly's idea.

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,414
Because who wouldn't
think to do that?

51
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,858
The point is

52
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,793
that these other worms,
without having been trained,

53
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,876
Began to respond to light.

54
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,094
It seems the first worms
transferred their memories

55
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,521
to the other worms
through ingestion.

56
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,846
Right, but that still has nothing to do
with stimulating Agent Dunham's memory.

57
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,725
How will we know unless we try?
That's why it's called an experiment.

58
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,930
- I know what an experiment is.
- If Archimedes

59
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,949
- never decided to take a bath...
- Guys?

60
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:36,910
Astrid, water.

61
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,058
I was going to mix it
with strawberries.

62
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,830
Bishop's deli.

63
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,187
This is what we know so far.

64
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,462
Facility manager arrived
to work this morning at 6:30,

65
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,551
saw the bodies and called it in
to the local PD.

66
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,970
So, the robbery took place
in the middle of the night.

67
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,422
That makes three cryogenic facilities
in a week,

68
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:09,193
same MO as Chicago and New York.

69
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:11,185
But Chicago was
a straight "B" and "E."

70
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,356
But in all three cases,
the target was the same.

71
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,415
Frozen heads.

72
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:17,306
Which does bring up
several obvious questions.

73
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,164
First of which, what the hell for?

74
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,836
Police recovered ten shell casings
from a nine millimeter.

75
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,634
Looks like a single perp rolled up

76
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,783
and dropped four men,
two of whom were armed.

77
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,951
Excuse me.

78
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,403
Can I see the body
that's bleeding silver now?

79
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,256
Fascinating.

80
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,176
Perfect, son.

81
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,473
It has the consistency of mercury.

82
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,018
These robberies
are obviously connected.

83
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,300
We should pull the files
on New York and Chicago.

84
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:56,603
I'll make some calls,

85
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:59,342
tell the local agents that we're taking
over the investigations.

86
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,467
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:16,333
- You okay?
- Yeah. So, what does Walter think?

88
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,751
Meet Mr. Silver-Blood.

89
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,878
Walter thinks it's actually mercury.

90
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:21,427
Mercury?

91
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,572
Agent Francis, hello.

92
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,793
You all right? You look pale.

93
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:38,647
I didn't get much sleep last night.

94
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,930
I may be able to help you with that.

95
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:45,059
A little cannabis before bedtime
does wonders?

96
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:56,206
I recognize this.

97
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,815
This is the device
the shape-shifter used.

98
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:23,108
You look like hell.

99
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:27,199
That was...

100
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,445
That was sloppy.

101
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,267
You killed four men last night,

102
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,995
including one of our own.

103
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,126
There's nothing to link him to us.

104
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,360
Maybe not,

105
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:39,994
but now the FBI...

106
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:42,056
They have him.

107
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,330
They understand...

108
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,820
what he is.

109
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,653
You've been in this body too long.

110
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:51,870
You're dying.

111
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:56,183
You need to get back home and get fitted
with a new conversion device.

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,511
I'd let you use mine...

113
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,541
but what would be the point?

114
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,095
It wouldn't do anything anyway.

115
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,776
You've asked for extraction.

116
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,757
They say not until the mission...

117
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,155
is done.

118
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,823
They're real sweethearts.

119
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,326
Damn.
That's the last one.

120
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:15,769
He's not here.

121
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,914
There's another facility
in North Carolina.

122
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,711
I have another idea.

123
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,174
Olivia Dunham...

124
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,758
is starting to remember her time
on the other side.

125
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:31,927
I'm thinking...

126
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:34,268
she may know where it's hidden.

127
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,139
His head?

128
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,977
What makes you think that?

129
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,800
If Bell knows that
we're looking for it,

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,914
it seemed like a likely reason

131
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,862
why he'd bring her
over to the other side.

132
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,492
Well, if you're right,

133
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:53,801
and you don't want that
body to be your last,

134
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:57,763
then I suggest you do whatever it takes
to make her remember.

135
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,506


136
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:11,992
Why?

137
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:13,295
Why...

138
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:17,763
Why are shape-shifting soldiers from
another universe stealing frozen heads?

139
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,129
The most likely explanation
that we can think of

140
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:23,615
is that they're looking
for a specific head,

141
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,439
but they don't know where it is.

142
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,357
- Then who?
- We don't know.

143
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,014
These facilities
pride themselves on secrecy.

144
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,816
So despite the thefts,

145
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,489
none of them have been willing
to give up their client lists.

146
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:38,076
What about the other device,
the one we found a few weeks ago?

147
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,278
Did it give any indication
who these people are?

148
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,441
Unfortunately,
the other device is broken.

149
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,835
We asked Massive Dynamic
what they could make of it,

150
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,518
but apparently they've been stumped.

151
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,633
Well, this one
doesn't appear to be damaged.

152
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:51,048
So maybe Peter
can figure something out.

153
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,626
I suppose he knows a guy?

154
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,530
He knew enough about engineering
to fake his way into MIT.

155
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,272
Let me know if you learn anything.

156
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,141
In the meantime,

157
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:02,320
I'm considering giving you
a protective detail.

158
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,858
A protective detail? Why?

159
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,503
The last time Peter showed me
one of these devices,

160
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,801
its owner had just tried
to kill you.

161
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,116
I'm not worried,

162
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,503
'cause that was six weeks ago.

163
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,800
So if a shape-shifting assassin
wanted me dead...

164
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,438
then I would be.

165
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:26,332
Let's see how this thing operates.

166
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:28,641
What are you saying,

167
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,672
this is not a person?

168
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:35,710
My dear, I'm not certain that you're not
simply a figment of my imagination.

169
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,845
No, this is certainly not human,

170
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,606
rather a highly advanced
technology...

171
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,728
A mechano/organic hybrid.

172
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:49,941
I suspect that they produce
or possibly ingest the mercury

173
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,215
and that it controls the tissue,

174
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,315
instructing it to take
and maintain shapes.

175
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:57,895
What?

176
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,049
We have to call Agent Dunham.

177
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:02,220
I need to talk to her right away.

178
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:14,433
You know what this reminds me of?

179
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:17,168
Did you ever see that movie
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

180
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,512
Which version...
Don Siegel or Philip Kaufman?

181
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:26,190
The remake.

182
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:29,726
I remember when I saw that movie, I was
so scared, I didn't sleep for a week.

183
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,184
I was convinced that if I fell asleep,
I was gonna be replaced by a pod person.

184
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,490
Is this your way of trying
to ask me if I'm scared?

185
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,336
Of course not.

186
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:42,490
I figure if you were scared,
you'd tell me, right?

187
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,006
Besides,

188
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:48,084
I figure between the two of us,
you're the one that carries the gun.

189
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:54,921
What the hell?

190
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:56,252
What is it?

191
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,742
I'm not sure.
I was just trying to turn it on, but...

192
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,470
Looks like this thing
is streaming data...

193
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,286
and lots of it.

194
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,544
I've got good news and bad news.

195
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,063
The bad news is
that the shape-shifter's blood

196
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,487
47% mercury.

197
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,272
Which means?

198
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:21,615
Well, I'm not sure,

199
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,877
but I went back and re-examined
the autopsy reports

200
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,425
for the first shape-shifter.

201
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,579
- And?
- And...

202
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,791
her blood sample
is perfectly normal...

203
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,153
Just traces of mercury,

204
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,256
which would suggest that,
despite what we thought back then...

205
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,141
She wasn't a shape-shifter at all.

206
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,269
- I'm afraid so.
- So the shape-shifter is still alive,

207
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,878
which means by now,

208
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:46,255
- it could be disguised as anyone.
- And you could still be in danger.

209
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,894
Would you like to hear
the good news now?

210
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,422
I think I may know how to find him.

211
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:05,598
You showed us this.

212
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,827
The girl you experimented on.

213
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,634
Yes, to see things others could not.

214
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,943
<i>Oh, yes, a soldier...</i>

215
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:16,878
<i>From somewhere else.</i>

216
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:18,992
- There.
- <i>He's glowing, man.</i>

217
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:21,500
If she was able to identify
the shape-shifter once,

218
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,350
she may be able to do it again.

219
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,847
<i>He's from a place that looks like this,
but it's not here.</i>

220
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,763
<i>He's from another universe, man.</i>

221
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,693
Looks like we may have some leads
on how to identify the shape-shifters.

222
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:42,758
<i>Walter has an idea, and I have
a thought about the device.</i>

223
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:45,108
<i>But in the meantime,</i>
can you check in with Broyles,

224
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,627
see if there's something new
from the crime scenes?

225
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,802
Sure thing.

226
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,877
Starting your own pharmacy?

227
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,422


228
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,858
You found another one.

229
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,347
Peter says this device
is streaming loads of data,

230
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,672
and he also believes it's possible

231
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:11,034
that these devices store a pattern
of their last victim.

232
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,260
Our scientists have the same theory.

233
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:16,498
In fact, they thought they might
be able to extract an image.

234
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,501
They also theorize that each device
is tuned to a specific user,

235
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:23,922
which suggests that since
the shape-changer that tried to kill you

236
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:27,551
no longer has his device,
he's trapped in his current body.

237
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,054
Our scientists have been working on
revealing that shape-shifter's identity,

238
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,723
but what with all the damage
to the other unit...

239
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,267
Well, this one is intact.

240
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,686
Then let's take a look, shall we?

241
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,041
So can you fix it?

242
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:44,693
Do you understand you're asking me
if I can repair a piece of technology

243
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,028
that is entirely unlike anything

244
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,574
that has ever existed here on Earth?

245
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:52,701
Now that I have one that works,

246
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,328
I can do it in three hours... tops.

247
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,696
Good, then get started right away.

248
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,131
I'm gonna head back to Boston.
Will you call me if he gets it working?

249
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:04,114
I can do better than that.
I can set up a rendering program

250
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,689
and patch you in...

251
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,128
in real time.

252
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,935
If you want, you can see it
all for yourself

253
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,138
from a computer, from your cell phone,
I can log you into our server.

254
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,431
The public one.

255
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,649
The public server, of course...

256
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:18,977
if it's okay with you.

257
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,444
- Nice house.
- Yes, it's lovely.

258
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,963
Rebecca always had fine taste.

259
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,498
Do you think she'll remember me?

260
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:31,828
I think she might.

261
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,961
I'm gonna guess there's not too many
men in her life who have strapped her

262
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:38,178
to a table and pumped her full of
a massive amount of psychedelics.

263
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:46,327
Walter, you didn't...

264
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:47,452
What, son?

265
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:48,799
Nothing.

266
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:51,918
Peter, wait.

267
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,777
Could you do the talking?

268
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,237
Please, son.

269
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:57,411
Sure.

270
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,415
I'm Peter Bishop.

271
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,602
- Is it you?
- Hello, Rebecca.

272
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:30,069
At first, I assumed it was all
just a figment of my imagination

273
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,425
and the LSD, of course.

274
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:36,680
But after a while,
it wasn't just during the experiments.

275
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:41,975
I would see their faces
in front of me.

276
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,897
They seemed to have, I don't know,

277
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,861
a certain glow about them.

278
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,643
The shape-shifters?

279
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,670
It took me a year or two to...

280
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,380
really understand it.

281
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,785
But I realized that...

282
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,205
I was recognizing people that...

283
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:05,097
didn't belong.

284
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:08,655
You know,
like that children's song...

285
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:12,215
"One of These Things
is Not Like the Others."

286
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,500
"One of These Things
is Not Like the Others.

287
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,429
One of These Things Just Doesn't
Belong." <i>Sesame Street.</i>

288
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,600
Yes, that's it.

289
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:22,183
Our experiment triggered an ability
to see beyond the limits of your vision.

290
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:28,421
You gave me a great gift, Walter.

291
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:30,654
You...

292
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,144
opened my mind for a time.

293
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,710
In fact, I even tried to look you up
about ten years ago,

294
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,309
tried to contact Harvard,

295
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:46,534
but no one knew where you were
or how to reach you.

296
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,561
- I was...
- Traveling.

297
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,346
My father was traveling.

298
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,568
You said "for a time." Does that mean
that the ability has faded?

299
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,010
Not entirely, no.

300
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,012
Comes and goes as it pleases.

301
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,899
I just have...

302
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:02,237
memories.

303
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:06,077
These people... The shape-shifters...
We have reason to believe

304
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,229
that some of them
are amongst us right now.

305
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:11,149
We were hoping that you might
be able to help us identify them.

306
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,277
I told you, it's mostly gone.

307
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,945
What if you could get it back?

308
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,803
Your ability?

309
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,617
You mean do the experiment again?

310
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,906
Which I must advise against.

311
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,850
Anytime one exposes one's brain
to that amount of hallucinogens...

312
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:28,199
Yeah, sure.

313
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,668
I'll help you.

314
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,084
Just a couple more.

315
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,965
Actually, that one goes
more on my temple.

316
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:56,924
You're an old pro at this, huh?

317
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,782
Drug-infused mystical awakenings,
guided by your father,

318
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,650
aren't exactly something
you can forget.

319
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,624
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham.

320
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,350
Thank you so much for doing this.

321
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:18,354
You said you wanted to start her
with salvia. We don't have any salvia.

322
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,782
You used to...

323
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,139
in that cabinet on the second shelf
over on the right.

324
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,409
Got it.

325
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:34,867
I don't suppose you recall
where I left my slippers.

326
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,529
Excuse me.

327
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,656
Could you do me a favor?

328
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,419
Do you think you could log onto
this site from your computer?

329
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,579
"Massive Dynamic."
This looks like their secure FTP.

330
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,648
Sure thing.

331
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,559
This is the first
of the psychedelics.

332
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:14,782
Ready to begin?

333
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:18,897
I think I've been ready
for the past ten years.

334
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,884
It's working.

335
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,609
The tech must be rebuilding
the image from the broken device.

336
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,835
It looks like
a department store mannequin.

337
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,873
Now let's just load it up
on my phone.

338
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:04,008
When Belly and I first did this,

339
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,512
we prepped her for 36 hours.

340
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,583
But I'm thinking...

341
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:13,331
for this type of spatial disorientation
we can reduce it to a few moments.

342
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,899
- Isn't that dangerous?
- More than injecting her with...

343
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:20,630
substantial amounts of untested,
homemade psychoactive drugs?

344
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,678
Get me three syringes
of phenothiazine.

345
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,638
It's on the top shelf,

346
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,845
under "A" for "Anti-Psychotics."

347
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,226
And two vials of Valium...

348
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,240
just to be safe.

349
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,616
- Ready?
- Yes, son.

350
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,417
I want you to tell me if this starts
to get uncomfortable, okay?

351
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,880
Thank you.
I met you once before.

352
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,874
You were just a baby, but...

353
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,779
I swore I saw...

354
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,753
Here we go!

355
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:07,719
I think we're ready.

356
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,321
Focus on my voice.

357
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:14,246
What?

358
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,179
Concentrate on the people
who don't belong.

359
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,871
You mean...
the ones that change their appearance?

360
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,551
There's no need to be afraid.

361
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,406
You can see them...
They can't see you.

362
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,695
Listen to my voice.

363
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,332
I'm going to take you
over the threshold.

364
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:40,710
We're walking through Johnston Gate
into Harvard Yard.

365
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,188
Can you see it?
It's autumn, and it's late.

366
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,341
The leaves crunch under our feet.

367
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,643
Past the statue of John Harvard.

368
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,143
Now we're passing University Hall,

369
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,393
Memorial Church is up ahead.

370
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,417
Ring.

371
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,945
After all these years...

372
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:25,616
it is so nice
to finally see you again.

373
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,596


374
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:38,888
You'll have to forgive me.

375
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,866
The method by which I brought you over
here was crude and I'm sorry for that,

376
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:45,733
but there were people who were
trying to prevent our meeting.

377
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:50,822
This is not at all the kind of reunion
I'd always envisioned.

378
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,006
The reunion that you had envisioned?

379
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:57,995
Dr. Bell, I have been trying
to meet with you for over a year.

380
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,297
Please, call me William...

381
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:04,896
or "Willam"...

382
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,416
if that feels warmer to you.

383
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,279
That's what you always called me
when you were a girl.

384
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,556
How do you like your tea?

385
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:19,559
I don't want any tea.
I want answers.

386
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:28,109
You're still a little disoriented
from the time slips, aren't you?

387
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:33,621
Happened to me
when I first came here.

388
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:35,946
You're out of sync with this side.

389
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,581
You're lucky. Most people
who cross dimensions

390
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,047
without your natural talent

391
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:43,749
are simply torn apart.

392
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:48,421
Well, "lucky" isn't the word
that I would choose.

393
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:13,788
I don't know how much
Walter's told you by now.

394
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,203
I don't know how much he remembers.

395
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,037
He told me what you two did to me
when I was just a girl...

396
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,083
How you conducted drug trials
on young children.

397
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,872
We weren't trying
to hurt you, Olivia.

398
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:34,197
We weren't trying to hurt anybody.

399
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:37,894
Guess what?

400
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:39,822
You did.

401
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:45,681
I've met some of the others.

402
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:50,488
To say that they are permanently damaged
would be an understatement.

403
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,329
In any search for knowledge,

404
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,904
there are always
unintended consequences...

405
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,892
Victims, you might say.

406
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:05,248
But not you.

407
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,022
I can see that...

408
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:09,498
just by looking at you.

409
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,791
In fact, you're just coming
into your ability.

410
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:19,303
I've seen history repeat
itself enough times to know

411
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,185
a war is coming,

412
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,396
just as we predicted,
Walter and I, years ago,

413
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:27,724
and we knew that we had
to prepare a guardian,

414
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,564
someone to watch the gate.

415
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,399
The gate?

416
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,493
Between this side and yours.

417
00:27:34,716 --> 00:27:37,873
I would like to say "ours,"
because that's where I came from,

418
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:39,991
but I'm afraid
I would sound disingenuous.

419
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:42,073
Go on.

420
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,135
For reasons that will
become clear in time,

421
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:48,338
I cannot go back yet,
maybe not ever.

422
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:51,096
But now we know how difficult
it is to cross over.

423
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:54,547
I can count on my hand the number
of people who've done it safely.

424
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,133
But on this side,

425
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,139
they've become more insidious.

426
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,848
They have designed hybrids...

427
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,307
Part organic tissue, part machine...

428
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,561
that can do things
that humans can't.

429
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:12,122
They can change shapes,
taking the form of human beings.

430
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:15,866
Over here, they call them
"the first wave."

431
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:20,865
So you're saying that these hybrids
are already on our side.

432
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,286
I know it's difficult to grasp.

433
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,331
I can grasp it just fine.

434
00:28:29,202 --> 00:28:31,713
I don't trust you, Dr. Bell...

435
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,241
or William or...

436
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:38,372
Willam...

437
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:40,154
or whatever cutesy name

438
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,957
you think might appeal
to my childhood instincts.

439
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,242
It won't.

440
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,680
Your company has been involved in,

441
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,980
if not directly responsible for,

442
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,109
some of the most horrific things
that I have ever seen,

443
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,661
to say nothing of the fact
that you just yanked me

444
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:59,153
into a parallel universe
to warn me about

445
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,776
an inter-dimensional war

446
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,483
that I believe you are
responsible for starting.

447
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:07,374
So what I want is not warmth or tea.

448
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,280
It's the truth.

449
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,431
The truth will come out.

450
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,976
It always does.

451
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,956
Livvy,...

452
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:20,103
you don't have to trust me.

453
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:23,339
You don't even have to like me,
but you can't deny

454
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,006
I have a unique perspective,

455
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:29,555
shaped by having lived
in two worlds.

456
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,561
I know the difference
a wrong choice can make...

457
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:34,482
or a right one.

458
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,835
For example, this building
is still standing

459
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,928
because different choices were made.

460
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,297
So, Livvy,...

461
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,279
if you can look past your anger,

462
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:48,599
you may find that I'm more
of an ally than you think.

463
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,160
A storm is coming,

464
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:56,562
perhaps the last
and worst storm of all.

465
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,078
And when it is over,

466
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,506
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

467
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,423
The shape-shifters on your side

468
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,474
are looking for someone,

469
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:08,514
someone to open the door
between universes,

470
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,473
and if they find him,

471
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,184
there will be no stopping them,

472
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,596
and that is why you
must find him first.

473
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:18,956
Me?

474
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:21,831
You are the one, Olivia.

475
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:26,647
Of all the children
that Walter and I prepared,

476
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,835
you were the strongest.

477
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:32,284
You were always the strongest.

478
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,012
Remember this symbol.

479
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:45,593
It's hidden on their leader.
That's how you'll know him.

480
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:49,912
Show this to Nina Sharp.
She can help you.

481
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,758
We're out of time.

482
00:31:05,457 --> 00:31:07,281
Olivia!
Can you hear me?

483
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,484
Astrid, nitroglycerine, 30 CCs.

484
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:12,150
Please turn the head to the side,
make sure she can breathe.

485
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,329
What's happening?

486
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,582
She's receiving a flood of memories.
It could be too much, too fast.

487
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:19,043
You should stand.

488
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,008
I think it'll be
less painful that way.

489
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:21,986
What will?

490
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:24,047
And remember this...

491
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:26,878
<i>Einai kalytero...</i>

492
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,929
<i>Anthropo apo ton patera toy.</i>

493
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:33,057
Tell that to Peter.
You're going to need him by your side.

494
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,643
Tell it to him.
He'll know what it means.

495
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,647
We have to shock her heart.

496
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,206
There's a vial of adrenaline, Peter.

497
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,291
And I'm afraid there's no avoiding
what has to happen next.

498
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,366
I pulled you out of a moving car.

499
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,412
Momentum can be deferred,

500
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:55,329
but it must always
be paid back in full.

501
00:31:58,162 --> 00:32:00,085
Into her heart, between the ribs.

502
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,378
Count three. One, two...

503
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,503
As I once said to Walter,

504
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,462
physics is a bitch.

505
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,018
- Three!
- Sorry, Olivia.

506
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:18,435
I need to speak to Nina Sharp.

507
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:21,146


508
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,369
- <i>Nina Sharp.</i>
- Nina, we need to talk.

509
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,571
I'm on my way there now.

510
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,698
I'm sorry. I'm just about
to leave for Hong Kong.

511
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,866
I have a message from William Bell.

512
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:35,452
Cancel the plane.

513
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,578
I wish I could have been
more of a help to you.

514
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:39,798
You did great.

515
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:42,214
- You sure you're all right to drive?
- She's fine.

516
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,984
The injections I gave her
would have counteracted

517
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,363
any hallucinogenics in her system.

518
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,567
I think I'd like
to drive home with her.

519
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:58,058
You just said that all the drugs
were out of her system.

520
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,731
How are you gonna get back home?

521
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:14,680
The bus.

522
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,450
Peter, I need some money.

523
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:33,844
He said okay.

524
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,243
Terrific.

525
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,241
It was a pleasure meeting you.

526
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:45,833
You too, Peter.

527
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,983
Say good-bye to Agent Dunham
for me, will you?

528
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,907
What?

529
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,408
Nothing. I...

530
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:58,892
I'm sorry.

531
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,126
It's probably just the drugs.

532
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:13,175
Where is everyone?

533
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,494
Peter and Dr. Bishop are out,

534
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,846
and Olivia went to New York
to see Nina Sharp.

535
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,848
- I can call her. She just left...
- No, that's okay.

536
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,405
I'll talk to her when she gets back.

537
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:31,684
What is this?

538
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,768
That's Massive Dynamic.

539
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:37,315
They're rebuilding the image
from the broken device.

540
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:41,971
Dr. Bell showed you this?

541
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:46,190
Have you ever seen
that before... that symbol?

542
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,774
Well, that's what he told me.

543
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,265
He said it would be hidden
somewhere on their leader's body.

544
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,913
Well, then I suspect
it would be on his head,

545
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:06,645
assuming that's what
the cryogenic hijackings are about.

546
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,626
And that's all Dr. Bell told you?

547
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:18,665
He said that the man
with that mark...

548
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:23,746
would try to open a door
between our two worlds...

549
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:27,659
that a storm was coming,

550
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,668
and that the only way to stop it

551
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:32,828
would be for me to find him
before the shape-shifters did.

552
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,285
A storm?

553
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:44,586
What?

554
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:48,785
It was a phrase he used.

555
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,487
When Dr. Bell realized
the existence of the other side,

556
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:57,905
the thing he dreaded most
was the inevitable collision...

557
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:01,033
if our two universes
ever came together.

558
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:02,746
Collision?

559
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,238
The Pauli exclusion principle

560
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,299
means that no two objects can occupy
the same space at the same time.

561
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:12,250
Dr. Bell was afraid
that if the doorway

562
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,519
between the two sides
was ever opened

563
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,164
that the unavoidable conclusion...

564
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:21,053
only one world would remain.

565
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:25,011
It's what he called
the last great storm.

566
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,895
<i>Laston-Hennings Cryonics.</i>

567
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:42,741


568
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,616


569
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,498


570
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:56,327
I'm sorry. I have to go.

571
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:03,447
Whatever Massive Dynamic can do
to help find this man,

572
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:06,455
we're at your service.

573
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,605
- How'd you know?
- Listen to me carefully.

574
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,582
My car's around the corner,

575
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,426
we got a SWAT team inbound.

576
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,837
As soon as I verify
you're out of this building,

577
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:22,849
they're gonna shred this place.
Let's move.

578
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,579
Oh, God, Charlie,
I almost told her everything.

579
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,426
- I got to call Broyles.
- What do you mean "almost"?

580
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,417
Well, I just realized where it is,
the head that they're looking for.

581
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,542
Bell told me.

582
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,460
It's at Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

583
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:49,808


584
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,168
It's me.

585
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,378
Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

586
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:41,026
What are you doing?

587
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,173
Won't you come in?

588
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:28,765
I don't think I should.

589
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,704
The bus leaves
every half hour, and...

590
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:38,253
I only have 14 minutes
to walk to the stop.

591
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,071
Some day, huh?

592
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:49,424
Not at all what I expected
when I woke up this morning.

593
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:50,904
That's the way of things.

594
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,214
The best days and
the worst days rarely are.

595
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:05,595
Rebecca, what I did to you...
It was wrong.

596
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,195
Not, no. You were young,

597
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,531
and I took advantage,

598
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:11,843
and...

599
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,857
I've wanted to do that for so long.

600
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:36,414
What you did...
You made me...

601
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:39,364
special.

602
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:45,797
The truth is...

603
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:50,614
I believe you were always special.

604
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:56,603
I must go...

605
00:40:58,147 --> 00:40:59,539
under 12 minutes.

606
00:41:09,853 --> 00:41:11,486
You had no choice.

607
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,383
If you didn't kill him,
he would have killed you.

608
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,683
It's not your fault.

609
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:25,567
Whatever...

610
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:28,001
that thing was, it wasn't Charlie.

611
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,903
They killed him for what?

612
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,449
To open a door to the other side?

613
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:44,131
And who are these people,
and what do they want?

614
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,674
What did we do to them?

615
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:56,229
Laston-Hennings Cryonics
was hit 15 minutes

616
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:58,306
before our protective detail arrived.

617
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,548
They took everything.
All the cryo-capsules are gone.

618
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,605
So they found
who they were looking for.

619
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,160
I assume so.

620
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:14,116
William Bell pulled me
to another universe...

621
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,804
to give me a warning.

622
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,699
That's how important this is.

623
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:25,625
And I failed.

624
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:29,155
We'll find them.

625
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,545
À la semaine prochaine !
