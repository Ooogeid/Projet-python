- Hurry, I don't want to miss kickoff.

Let's go, Raymond.
What's the holdup?

9
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:00,691
Just a second.

10
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,916
Raymond!

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

16
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:38,605
- There you go.
- Thank you.

17
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:41,133
- You take care, agent Dunham.
- I will.

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,183
- Let me get that.
- Peter, I'm fine.

19
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,686
I know you are.

20
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:55,798
What?

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,190
Well...

22
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:01,090
Just looking
for the hidden ninja sword.

23
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:04,014
That one wasn't covered
by insurance.

24
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:07,561
Thank you.

25
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,162
Did you check the drawers?

26
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,926
No. Anything I've forgotten,
they can keep.

27
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,959
I don't want to spend
another minute here.

28
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,193
I'm no good at sitting around.

29
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,989
You're also no good
at letting people help you.

30
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,456
I'll let you carry my suitcase.

31
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,464


32
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,800
Did you get me
everything on my list?

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,842
The FBI signed off
on everything you asked for,

34
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:05,812
including new housing
for you and your father.

35
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,352
But the C-130 transport plane
is proving a bit tough to requisition.

36
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,196
We're not gonna need it
for this one.

37
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Pennsylvania?

38
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,712
I was trolling the FBI databases,

39
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,858
looking for any cases
that were similar to Olivia's.

40
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:22,321
Sudden disappearances.

41
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,396
This town has had six missing people
in the last two months, four of which

42
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:28,022
eyewitnesses say just
disappeared into thin air.

43
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,298
Thought it was worth checking out.

44
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,625
- How is she?
- Olivia?

45
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,055
She'll be fine.

46
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,081
Do it.

47
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,024
And keep a close eye on Dunham.

48
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,419
All right, Walter,
the cameras are ready.

49
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,418
Here we go.

50
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,726
Agent Dunham, you're just in time.

51
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:56,374
- Just in time for what?
- We're re-creating your car accident.

52
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:57,931
Astrid, ready.

53
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,401
3... 2... 1.

54
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,840
- The photographs, quickly.
- I know, Walter.

55
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:12,871
Your accident. I'm testing a theory.

56
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,503
Thank you. Excuse me.

57
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:22,952
No matter what I try,

58
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,267
I can't make the frog disappear.

59
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,441
We've been at this for five hours.

60
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,761
Science is patience!

61
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,528
It's also slimy.

62
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:31,994
From all the evidence,

63
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:35,707
you were missing from your car
for at least an hour

64
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:38,072
before you came crashing
back through the windshield.

65
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,150
You simply disappeared.

66
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:45,888
He thinks you traveled
to another universe.

67
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,872
You see, agent Dunham,

68
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,704
we assume...

69
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,665
that our universe is the only
universe. But that's not true.

70
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,151
There is an infinite
number of universes.

71
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,503
And in each of them,
there is a version of us.

72
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,882
You, me, and agent Farnsworth...

73
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,510
But each one slightly different...

74
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,443
changed over time

75
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,980
based on the accumulation
of our choices.

76
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,926
So, in this reality...

77
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,967
We've had this conversation
before, haven't we?

78
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,362
I know that I went somewhere.

79
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:29,814
I think I met with someone.

80
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,339
But the rest is like
a dream that I...

81
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,456
I just can't quite remember.

82
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,242
Perhaps you will...

83
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,284
in time.

84
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,622
When they said you were dead...

85
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,851
When I saw you lying there...

86
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,689
I don't know what I would have done.

87
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,135
But you're here now, and...

88
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,034
apart from the obvious, you...

89
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,620
- You appear to be fine.
- I appear to be?

90
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,843
Traveling to an alternate reality
has its consequences.

91
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,047
No, you'll be fine.

92
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,122
You feel up to going for a drive?

93
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,708
Hello. I'm Walter Bishop.

94
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,414
Sheriff Golightly?

95
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:02,853
Special agent Olivia Dunham.

96
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,377
This is Peter and Walter Bishop.

97
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,217
Don't remember calling the FBI.

98
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:10,132
Well, your office has filed
six Missing-Persons reports.

99
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:12,492
Seven now.

100
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,486
Seven.

101
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:16,592
All under the same circumstances?

102
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:18,432
Same as the others. Just disappear.

103
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:20,809
Be damned if I know
what to make of it.

104
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,103
Well, we're all victims
of our own gene pool.

105
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,371
Someone must have peed in yours.

106
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,753
I'm sorry, you'll have
to excuse my father.

107
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:29,943
Yes. Excuse me.

108
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,689
These two men are both
special investigators with the FBI.

109
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,325
And when the good men and women

110
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,573
who have come here
from three separate counties

111
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:41,027
have finished collecting evidence,
then you can see it.

112
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,462
Let me see what you got.

113
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:51,632
May I?

114
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:56,374
Wonderful!

115
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,498
Have you run across
something like this before?

116
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:00,027
Absolutely not.

117
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,852
The air here is quite auspicious!

118
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,982
Makes the hair stand up
on the back of your neck.

119
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:10,684
The air?

120
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,944
This!

121
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,371
It's a fresh mystery,
pregnant with possibilities.

122
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,844
Who knows where it may lead?

123
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:25,776
I bet you he knows.

124
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,628
Here are the investigation files.

125
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:38,429
Everything we have so far
from the first disappearance,

126
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,388
which is not a hell of a lot.

127
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:43,292
Possible suspect interviews,
case leads,

128
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,520
- dead ends from the disappearances.
- Okay. Thank you.

129
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:51,775
The FBI has very
specific laws that govern

130
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,279
what their jurisdiction involves.
None of these disappearances occurred

131
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,846
on a military base.
None happened across state lines.

132
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,437
You've already given us evidence.

133
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:01,243
- There's information...
- I understand.

134
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,425
But I can get
a special procedural order to...

135
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,289
Why are you so interested
in this case?

136
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:15,924
Excuse me?

137
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,135
Why are you so interested
in this case?

138
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,861
I'm sorry, I...

139
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:25,206
The night of desirable objects?

140
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,003
I have one just like this.

141
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,182
You know yourself a little bit
about night fishing, do you?

142
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:33,917
I've used hair jigs and pork rind,

143
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,615
rubber jigs for largemouth.

144
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,680
You ever try using
spinnerbaits at night?

145
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,585
You can use pork rind
with those too.

146
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,825
- Can you really?
- I like the topwater...

147
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,898
- Hey, it's me.
<i>- Hey.</i>

148
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,047
I'm sending you a victim sheet

149
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,891
from a multiple Missing-Persons case
in Pennsylvania.

150
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:58,018
Can you run the names and...

151
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:00,895
And notify me
if any red flags come up?

152
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,093
<i>Sure. I just have to run an errand.</i>

153
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,307
Thanks, Charlie. Bye.

154
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,755
I'll be with you in just a minute.

155
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,530
I need the back room.

156
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:30,486
Now!

157
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:04,774


158
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,601
{\SHE STILL BELIEVES I'M HER
PARTNER}

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,711


160
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,908
This is wildly helpful.

161
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:25,461
According to the sheriff,
the second person who disappeared...

162
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,204
His mom makes a mean apple pie.

163
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,225
In case you were wondering,
Andre Hughes is partial to flannel.

164
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:34,483
He likes to wear flannel shirts,
except, of course, in the summer.

165
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm gonna go get a soda.

166
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:42,195
- You want something?
- No, thank you.

167
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,660
- How's it going, Walter?
- I plan to urinate in 23 minutes.

168
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,437
Good to know.

169
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,398
I'm telling you because I'm going
to need help unzipping my fly.

170
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,500
I can't feel my hand.

171
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:59,379
It seems the substance from
Pennsylvania is a paralytic.

172
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,237
Which means that whoever
took those people paralyzed them first,

173
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:06,044
- so they couldn't fight back.
- Interesting theory.

174
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,456
Very devious.

175
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,792
Do you think we can trace it,
where it's from?

176
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,572
The base solution contains
human DNA, male, I think.

177
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,145
Of course, it's a mutation.

178
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:21,616
Perhaps a whole new stage
of human evolution.

179
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,069
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

180
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,155
If we've stumbled upon a mutant?

181
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,409
Fantastic's not the first
word that pops into my mind.

182
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,977
We're all mutants.

183
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,205
What's more remarkable...

184
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,365
is how many of us
appear to be normal.

185
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,795
- Find anything?
- You remember Andre Hughes?

186
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,117
Yeah, Hughes.
He was the flannel guy, right?

187
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,452
He's a neighbor of the Shanes,
and he was at their house

188
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:50,327
when the sheriff went to follow up
on their son's disappearance.

189
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:52,147
He was also at the Thomasons'

190
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,516
just after Jennifer Thomason
disappeared.

191
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,979
Sheriff Golightly arrived
just as Hughes was leaving.

192
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:00,815
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking you drive.

193
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:33,621
Hell.

194
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:19,894
Hell.

195
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,392
Who are you?

196
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,902
Olivia Dunham,
and this is Peter Bishop.

197
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:31,031
We're wanting to ask you
a few questions.

198
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:43,197
I assume you've heard about the people
that have recently gone missing.

199
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:47,643
I know about it.

200
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:49,799
I'd love to help if I can.

201
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:51,265
Please...

202
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,310
After you.

203
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,515
Either of you have any
experience with water wells?

204
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,901
This time of year
I spend most of my time

205
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,426
maintaining and...

206
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:07,382
digging 'em out.

207
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,737
I wouldn't wish it on either of you.

208
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:17,104
It's like to drive me crazy.

209
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,987
This is my fifth well in two months.

210
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,405
Can't seem to find
that switch button.

211
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,281
I'm just gonna go in the other room
and wash this dirt off.

212
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,266
Make yourself comfortable.

213
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:34,135
Excuse me.

214
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,972
Is there someone else in this house?

215
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,998
There's someone else in this house.

216
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,200
Did you hear that?

217
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,379
Keep him busy.

218
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:10,191
Come out of there.

219
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,706
Peter!
Oh, my God.

220
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,000
Peter, my God, I'm so sorry!

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,616
I thought I heard something.

222
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,004
I thought I heard someone.

223
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:36,925


224
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,179
You fired a gun in my house,

225
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,141
and now you're
bringing me down here?

226
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,688
I don't understand.

227
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,887
You don't think I had anything to do
with these missing people, do you?

228
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,441
Well, at the moment, Mr. Hughes,
we're just trying to gather information.

229
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,571
So I understand
that you're a doctor.

230
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,380
Yes.

231
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:03,076
But you retired

232
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,145
<i>nearly 20 years ago.</i>

233
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,406
<i>That's right.</i>

234
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,486
Anything?

235
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,560
- Not yet.
- <i>What have you done since then?</i>

236
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:12,961
We scoured the house.

237
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,665
There's no evidence that links him
to the disappearances.

238
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,612
Just a bunch of old lab equipment.

239
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,710
We had it packed up,
sent over to Harvard.

240
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,344
Walter's taking a look at it now.

241
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,874
<i>According to our records,</i>

242
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,668
<i>in the wake of the disappearances,</i>

243
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,205
<i>you visited with some
of the victims' relatives.</i>

244
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:31,354
<i>With Martin Shane's mother and...</i>

245
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,559
Jennifer Thomason's husband.

246
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,639
Yes.

247
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,661
Were they former patients?

248
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,622
Just friends?

249
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,193
I hardly knew either of them.

250
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,936
But I thought I could help them.

251
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,988
I...

252
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,210
I thought I could comfort them.

253
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:04,402
I lost my wife and my son
17 years ago.

254
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,081
She died, giving birth to him.

255
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,362
He was mine.

256
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,276
For five minutes, I had a son.

257
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:29,103
I could never hurt these people.

258
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:36,465
<i>Mr. Hughes, we'd like to take
a sample of your blood.</i>

259
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,214
We'd like to compare it
to some evidence that we found

260
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,057
at the scene
of the last disappearance.

261
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,543
Do we, have
your permission to do that?

262
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,861
- Am I under arrest?
- Not presently.

263
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,193
Then, no.

264
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,834
You don't have my permission.

265
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:09,096
I'll get a warrant
to take his blood.

266
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,710
Have Olivia hold him for 24 hours.

267
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,982
It says in her report
Dunham's gun went off?

268
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,495
Misfire.

269
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:29,514
I'll send agent Jessup
to the Hughes' house.

270
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,622
Dizziness?

271
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,678
How's your short-term memory?

272
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,079
What's your name?

273
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,677
Good.
You seem to be doing well.

274
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,614
You can go ahead and get dressed.

275
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,436
Hello, agent Dunham.

276
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:02,772
I haven't had a chance
to visit since your...

277
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:05,842
accident, but agent Broyles
has been keeping me apprised.

278
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:07,944
I was concerned.

279
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:09,846
Well, thanks. I'm doing okay.

280
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,812
I'm glad to hear that...

281
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:16,111
Though sometimes the physical injury
is the easiest to get over.

282
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,988
I remember when I was
first diagnosed with cancer.

283
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,945
Beside the fear, my most
overwhelming sensation

284
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,589
was one of betrayal...

285
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,497
The realization that my own body

286
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:33,327
was fundamentally foreign
to me, that it was a threat.

287
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,727
You've been through
quite an ordeal, Olivia.

288
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,126
One of many lately.

289
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:42,854
To overlook it would be a mistake.

290
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,092
What's this?

291
00:23:48,347 --> 00:23:51,319
Sam Weiss, the man who helped
put me back together.

292
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,940
You know, the FBI has psychologists.

293
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:59,711
- If I thought that I needed...
- He's not a psychologist.

294
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,097
When you're ready,
I believe he can help you.

295
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,685
{\DON'T BLAME YOURSELF
IT WAS GOD'S WILL}

296
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,960
{\YOUR WIFE AND CHILD
ARE WITH HIM}

297
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,800
Thanks.

298
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,935
That was Olivia.

299
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:13,636
Agent Jessup told her Hughes may have
killed his wife and child 17 years ago.

300
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,180
Finally some good news.

301
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,390
I assume we can dig them up.

302
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,390
I haven't had any bodies to examine.

303
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,976
Seven missing persons,

304
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,273
no bodies.

305
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,628
All right.
I'll get an exhumation order.

306
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:42,662
Put his wife's coffin is down here.

307
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:02,286
If Hughes is hiding something,
we're gonna find out what it is.

308
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,906
Let's open it up.

309
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,294
Let's open the baby boy's.

310
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:41,140
- My God.
- There's no body.

311
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,812
Looks like something dug its way in.

312
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,746
Or dug its way out.

313
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:05,524
I think we have some questions
for Mr. Hughes.

314
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,338


315
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:01,272
That's curious.

316
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:02,848
What?

317
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:04,625
What's curious?

318
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:07,643
Mrs. Hughes has...

319
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,351
scarring to the joints,

320
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,748
butterfly lesions to the face.

321
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,755
Systemic lupus erythematosus,

322
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:18,114
a very advanced case.

323
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:19,992
Lupus?

324
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,365
Which means what?

325
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:25,438
Notably, she was incapable
of producing offspring.

326
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:28,166
Except she did.
She had a baby boy.

327
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:32,209
A baby boy?

328
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,287
That's impossible.

329
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,787
Lupus results
in an overactive immune system.

330
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:41,692
Her own body would have
destroyed the fetus long before...

331
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:45,014
Yes, and yet despite that, she was
somehow able to give birth to a son.

332
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:48,476
Who, from all appearances,
then burrowed his way out of his casket.

333
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,136
The grave of a boy...

334
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:56,630
who was not in his grave.

335
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:34,018
How did this happen?
Why wasn't anyone watching him?

336
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,981
We're looking into it right now.

337
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:38,062
We need to have Andre Hughes' body

338
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:40,716
taken back to Walter Bishop's
lab as soon as possible.

339
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:41,954
Already on its way.

340
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,214
<i>Jim, it's Alex.
Yeah, I know I'm late.</i>

341
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:45,941
<i>I'm leaving right now, alright?</i>

342
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,220
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

343
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:49,406
<i>I'll take care of it.
I'll call him right now.</i>

344
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,219
Peter, I've got it.

345
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,662
Mrs. Hughes' womb. You were right.

346
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:15,583
She did give birth.

347
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:17,426
I'm glad we got that settled.

348
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,650
The afterbirth is still inside her.

349
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,235
Look at the tissue composition.

350
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,116
According to this,
Hughes' baby wasn't entirely human.

351
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,053
It explains his research...

352
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:31,871
Reproductive biology
and gene replacement.

353
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,457
I hypothesize that he may have used

354
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,931
some scorpion DNA...

355
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,353
It's an incredibly
resilient creature...

356
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:41,010
And also possibly something
that lives underground,

357
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,464
a mole rat.

358
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:45,426
Scorpions do paralyze their prey with
toxin. It could explain the blue liquid.

359
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,678
- What did I miss?
- Hughes' baby...

360
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,615
he altered it inside the womb so that
it could survive its mother's lupus.

361
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,058
- That is sick.
- That is brilliant!

362
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,956
He's created a super-baby...

363
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:57,801
one capable of surviving

364
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,963
in the most inhospitable
environment.

365
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,206
- We've had a breakthrough.
- I heard. Hughes' son.

366
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,159
I think I might know where he is.

367
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:12,495
When we were at the Hughes' house,

368
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,132
I heard a noise,
like something breathing.

369
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:17,480
I thought
that I had imagined it, but...

370
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:18,857
I didn't.

371
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,351
So if Hughes' son is alive,

372
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:24,548
I think that he is
somewhere in that house...

373
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:25,988
Or near that house.

374
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:27,161
Or under it.

375
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,599


376
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,403
Hello?

377
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,905
Sheriff Golightly?

378
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:51,714
I think it's a canine tooth.

379
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,590
Confirmed. Dog.

380
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:47,489
Gonna grab a shovel.

381
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:44,435
<i>He must have realized it was his son,
because we found...</i>

382
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:45,869
<i>traps,</i>

383
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,408
<i>set in all of these holes
that he'd dug</i>

384
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:49,994
<i>all over his property.</i>

385
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,652
Could you imagine living
with a burden like that,

386
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,856
when all you wanted was a son?

387
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,509
Charlie,
what if I don't want to remember?

388
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:07,147
- You mean your accident?
- All of it.

389
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:08,797
Where I went,

390
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,351
who I met with, what he told me.

391
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,173
What if there's a part of my brain
that's trying to protect me?

392
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,862
I'm not sure you have much
of a choice here, Olivia.

393
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:23,492
If Walter was correct
about you going to that other universe,

394
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,683
then whatever secrets you learned

395
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,617
might be worth remembering.

396
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,872
Another universe.

397
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:37,180
I never thought
that I would ever hear you

398
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,966
utter those words
with a straight face.

399
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:44,103
You've come a long way,
Charlie Francis.

400
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:48,712
Well, you know, whatever it is...

401
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:51,431
We'll deal with it together.

402
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:54,816
I'll help you remember.

403
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,305
I know you will.

404
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:10,329
- Are you going fishing, son?
- Yes.

405
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,595
But not alone.

406
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,134
Oh, no?
Who with?

407
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,208
Well, once upon a time,
there was a young man...

408
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,587
probably around 10 or 11,

409
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,738
who got it in his head
he wanted to take his father fishing.

410
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:27,062
So he saved up all the money
from his paper route

411
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:30,226
and bought a very special lure.

412
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:37,254
It's called
the Night of Desirable Objects.

413
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,990
Sadly, his father was never really
all that available to him,

414
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,158
so...

415
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,225
What started out
as a would-be bonding experience

416
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,497
ended up with a young man
fishing alone in a boat.

417
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,789
And this young man...

418
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,170
gave this to you?

419
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:06,448
Yes, Walter.

420
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:08,759
Can I come,

421
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:11,390
with you and your friend?

422
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,542
You know what, Walter?

423
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,312
I think that would make the trip.

424
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,004
Good.

425
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:24,031
Good.

426
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:06,922
If you want to bowl,
we close in 15 minutes.

427
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:16,421
I'm looking for Sam Weiss.
Is he here?

428
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,803
Sam? No.

429
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,740
Do you know where I can find him?

430
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,915
Atlanta, Georgia. He met a girl...

431
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,790
moved away.

432
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,743
Thank you.

433
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:40,622
That's it?

434
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:42,922
Excuse me?

435
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:44,337
You're giving up?

436
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,911
I tell you he met a girl
and moved away and you give up?

437
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:53,815
You're Sam.

438
00:41:57,168 --> 00:41:58,985
Nina Sharp said you'd be coming by.

439
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:04,104
Have the headaches started yet?

440
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:09,329
They will.

441
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:13,882
What are you, a size 8?

442
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,353
{\TARGET VISITED OTHER SIDE
BUT REMEMBERS NO DETAILS}

443
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:31,922


444
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:47,146
{\UNACCEPTABLE
IF SHE CAN'T REMEMBER ON HER OWN}

445
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:55,613


446
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,754
À la semaine prochaine !
