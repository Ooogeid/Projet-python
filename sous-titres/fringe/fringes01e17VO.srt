00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:10,193
# I heard the Earth

2
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,893
# far, far away #

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,670
# So Nellie the elephant
packed her trunk #

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,903
# and said good-bye
to the circus #

5
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:20,557
# Off she went with a
trumpetey-trump #

6
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,874
# Trump, trump, trump #

7
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,783
# The head of the herd
was calling, #

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,849
# far, far away #

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,853
# They met one night
in silver light #

10
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:39,432
# They met one night
in the silver light #

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,952
Evening,
little ladies.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,434
# So Nellie the elephant
packed her trunk, #

13
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:50,860
# Off she went with a
trumpety-trump, #

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,440
# Trump, trump,
trump, trump #

15
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,997
# The head of the herd
was calling, #

16
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,735
# far, far away #

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,358
Baby,
we're gonna run.

18
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:33,781
<i>Damn it!</i>

19
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:35,794
Mommy didn't say that.

20
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,465
Oh...
It'll fly away, baby.

21
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,568
# The head of the herd
was calling, #

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,273
# far, far away #

23
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,479
# So Nellie the elephant
packed her trunk, #

24
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,695
# and said good-bye
to the circus, #

25
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,014
# Off she went

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,879
# Trump, trump, trump #

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,661
It's our lucky day,
baby.

28
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:31,864
Here it comes.

29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,303
<i>Oh!</i>

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,051
<i>We have a
low-pressure center here,</i>

31
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,347
<i>backed up with a cold front
coming across the east.</i>

32
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,258
<i>And then,
here in the west,</i>

33
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,804
<i>we've got a
high-pressure ridge</i>

34
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:22,245
<i>coming in with a warm front
that's descending</i>

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>across the western part
of the country...</i>

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,092
- <i>What that means is--</i>
- I always hated you could do that.

37
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:27,315
<i>I always hated that</i>

38
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,297
you could date two guys
at the same time.

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,765
Really, Liv?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,366
<i>What time
did you wake up?</i>

41
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,266
<i>Are you okay?</i>

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,621
Aunt Liv,
I'm getting vascinations.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,346
<i>"Vaccinations."</i>

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,904
Come on, baby,
go get dressed.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,587
They put something
dead inside you.

46
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:43,830
Dead!

47
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,734
Into your blood.
Gruesome.

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,406
<i>Ella Jae,
please go get dressed.</i>

49
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,065
Yes.

50
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:51,730
"Gruesome."

51
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,692
- Gruesome?
- That's a good word.

52
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,339
<i>And in other news,
a suicide</i>

53
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:58,373

Bad Dreams

62
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,360
<i>I want permission
to go to New York</i>

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,711
<i>to investigate a case.</i>

64
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,045
What is it?

65
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,968
A suicide
on the subway.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,226
I read about it in the paper,
this morning.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,353
How exactly is this
a case?

68
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,479
I believe that the woman
may have been murdered.

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,061
<i>There may have been
extraordinary circumstances.</i>

70
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,938
What kind of
extraordinary circumstances?

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,714
I'm listening.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,969
Uh...

73
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,930
That's all
I'm comfortable saying

74
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,101
at the moment, sir.

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,446
Dunham,
are you all right?

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,567
For the
last few weeks,

77
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,291
you've seemed...
distracted.

78
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,485
On edge.

79
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,577
I haven't been
sleeping very well.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,127
I wouldn't be asking
if this wasn't important.

81
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:21,919
Dunham, you're a crucial part
of this operation.

82
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,231
You're very valuable
to me.

83
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:24,642
Thank you.

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,979
24 hours.

85
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,426
Then I want you back on the job,
head clear.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,074
Thank you.

87
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,212
<i>Olivia,
it was a nightmare.</i>

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,811
It felt like
I was really there.

89
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:51,029
No, you were asleep
in your bed.

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,064
Wait a minute.

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,795
Have you experienced any nausea,
Agent Dunham?

92
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,660
Rashes, hair loss,
even...

93
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,960
- a strand or two on the pillow?
- No.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,507
Any pain urinating,
or blood?

95
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,535
I don't think
you're helping.

96
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,488
Is that a--

97
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,891
Yeah,
a geiger counter.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,050
Not a rad.

99
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,167
<i>I thought you might have
teleported to New York</i>

100
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,601
in your sleep
and killed her.

101
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,384
Wouldn't that
have been wondrous?

102
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:21,072
But even the
most controlled matter

103
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,960
to energy transmutation

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,608
leaves behind
some background radiation so...

105
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,028
Ergo, you are not
actually there.

106
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,738
Great, well,
I'm glad we got that cleared up.

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,904
- Astral...
- Astrid.

108
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:36,143
Projection.

109
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,388
A spirit walk,
as it were.

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,075
No, no, no,
you wouldn't have

111
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:46,350
had sufficient corporeal
form to interact

112
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,113
with the young woman.

113
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:47,883
Here we go.

114
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,148
It's like
listening to a broken record,

115
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:51,632
but the lyrics
keep on changing.

116
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,861
She had
a bad dream.

117
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,822
No,
I could smell the platform.

118
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:57,770
I saw her baby
staring at me.

119
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,551
I saw her face
before I saw the news.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,246
How is that possible?

121
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:03,688
Opium?

122
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:05,382
It wasn't
just a dream.

123
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,281
Was it?

124
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,012
New York it is.

125
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,282
I love New York.

126
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,084
<i>Oh...</i>

127
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,559
We could catch
a show!

128
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,629
Pippin!

129
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,499
Uh, ooh...
No!

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,318
# Cats fit
on the window sill #

131
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,569
- # Children fit in the snow #
- Walter, you're staying here.

132
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,592
I'll make it
up to you.

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,894
# Why do I feel like #

134
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:44,120
# I don't fit in
anywhere I go? #

135
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,148
That is the Jackson Five,
right?

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,419
Hmm?

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,415
Absolutely.

138
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,110
She said to
meet her at the clock.

139
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,851
There she is.

140
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,669
Uh,
you the two?

141
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,733
Uh, Dunham, Bishop.
FBI.

142
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,033
You know,
you shouldn't eat those.

143
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:17,236
About 30 years
too late on that.

144
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,442
Can you show us
where this actually happens?

145
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,005
Yep.
Let's go.

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,514
Are we safe?

147
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,566
Sorry?

148
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,263
FBI comes
into my house.

149
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:31,500
First thing I need to ask is,
"Are we safe?"

150
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,408
I'm not sure
we're ever really safe.

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,074
We're as safe as houses.

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,889
What can you tell us
about this suicide?

153
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,562
Just like it said
in the papers...

154
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:40,487
Risa Pears, 28...

155
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,892
Decided to take a header
in front of the seven train.

156
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,170
So what makes you think that
it was a suicide?

157
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,180
Security cameras
got it all.

158
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,003
I'd like to take a look
at that tape myself.

159
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,219
All right,
we'll set you up, Agent.

160
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,369
<i>What, exactly,
are we looking for here?</i>

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,530
Humor me.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,148
There's gonna be a balloon
floating on the ceiling.

163
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,185
A red one.

164
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,318
The husband was away
on business in Seattle.

165
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,365
He just flew
back in.

166
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,019
He's giving a statement
down at the station.

167
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,510
Come on,
this doesn't fit the profile.

168
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,403
Married,
a baby.

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,888
You don't take your kid
to the circus

170
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:29,425
and give him a
front-row seat

171
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,198
to watch
you kill yourself.

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,201
And then there's that.

173
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,459
Yeah.

174
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,286
This doesn't make
any sense.

175
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,023
Uh-uh, she'd been waiting to go
to the circus.

176
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,685
And she's from here.

177
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,283
We met in Chicago.

178
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,564
I mean, she kept saying
that she wanted...

179
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:02,737
to take Lucy
to the circus.

180
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:03,996
Okay?

181
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,953
She used to sing you this song
about elephants.

182
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,243
<i>We were happy.</i>

183
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,030
She wouldn't kill herself.

184
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,080
<i>You've gotta believe me.</i>

185
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,947
She would never
kill herself.

186
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,688
Agent?

187
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,926
The surveillance you wanted
is ready.

188
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you.

189
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,892
Sh--she wouldn't do it.

190
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,147
She just wouldn't.

191
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,790
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:06,004
This is the digital backup.

193
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,701
The primary drive
is in evidence.

194
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:16,211
Can you
slow this down?

195
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,099
- Just start at the top.
- Mmm-hmn.

196
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,307
Can I get
a copy of this?

197
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,756
See,
it doesn't make any sense.

198
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,559
I remember things
from the crime scene.

199
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,997
I remember pushing her.

200
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,928
You know dreams
aren't always literal.

201
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,632
<i>Perhaps you killed this</i>

202
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:54,024
young woman...
in some less-direct way.

203
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,134
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

204
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:57,193
We just watched her
kill herself.

205
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,205
Perhaps you compelled her
to jump using your mind.

206
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,934
Do you have any reason
to want her dead?

207
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,337
<i>Romantic rival,
perhaps?</i>

208
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:03,825
What?

209
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,875
I didn't even
know her.

210
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,860
- Then why did you kill her?
- I don't know.

211
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,555
Stop, both of you.
Stop.

212
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,002
Nobody killed anybody.

213
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,121
<i>I'm surprised at you,
Peter.</i>

214
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,145
Agent Dunham
is your friend.

215
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,213
You trust her.
She says she killed that girl.

216
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,493
Are you so presumptuous
to believe her

217
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,595
only when she says
what you want to hear?

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,658
<i>Your mother was
a bit like that.</i>

219
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,390
<i>Consider this question.</i>

220
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,084
What is mankind's
oldest dream?

221
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,908
- World peace?
- <i>Oh, hardly.</i>

222
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:29,984
<i>It's a social construct</i>

223
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,327
imposed by an awareness
of our own mortality.

224
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,152
Should have gone with
"Great taste, less filling," huh?

225
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,917
<i>What is the greatest desire
of the weak</i>

226
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,908
and the subjugated?

227
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,385
Of the man
whose fire is stolen

228
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:41,473
by an opponent
whose only advantage is

229
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,367
the luck of
superior size.

230
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,637
We're stealing fire?

231
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,565
I think we're cavemen
in this story.

232
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,777
Whose woman is wrenched away
by brutality and force.

233
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,243
Sexist cavemen
at that.

234
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,717
Simple.
To kill with thought.

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,964
To wish someone dead.

236
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,085
To murder
with the mind.

237
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,259
Come on,
that's ridiculous.

238
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,073
You're right,
I'm sure.

239
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,975
Unless, of course,
it happens again.

240
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:48,484
<i># We met on the veer #</i>

241
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:59,864
<i># It roam as the sidewalk
can stray #</i>

242
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:05,512
<i># In the candlelight
and wine #</i>

243
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,890
<i># her hand
go and find #</i>

244
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:16,148
<i># No wonder my heart,
lifts away # </i>

245
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,798
- <i># Don't stop #</i>
- Why would you do that?

246
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:19,843
What?

247
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:20,760
<i>Come on.</i>

248
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,970
<i>Do you think
it's okay</i>

249
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,700
<i>to just flirt with her
like that?</i>

250
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>Honey, honey,
please.</i>

251
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,932
What is it...
I'm not young enough?

252
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,850
Honey,
is there something wrong?

253
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,830
- I'm not sexy enough anymore?
- Honey, would you relax?

254
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,000
- What are you doing to me?
- Would you relax?

255
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,912
- What is the matter with you?
- You bastard!

256
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:35,177
- Just calm down.
- You cheating bastard!

257
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:37,761
<i>I can't stand the way
you're looking at her.</i>

258
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,716
You cheating bastard!

259
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:43,500
Uhh! Uhh!
Ahh! Ahh!

260
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:49,305
Uh!

261
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,792
Charlie.
Charlie, it's me.

262
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,941
Uh,
there's been a murder.

263
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,133
<i>I tried to kill him.</i>

264
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,894
<i>I have a half-dozen
witnesses' statements say</i>

265
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,883
she stabbed
her husband.

266
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:19,810
Yeah,
I was there.

267
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:22,306
No.
You were 300 miles away.

268
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,114
Somehow,
I'm killing these people in my dreams.

269
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,545
Hello.
Uh, Agent Olivia Dunham.

270
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,755
- This is Peter Bishop.
- Hi.

271
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:32,689
So what can you tell us,
Doctor?

272
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,875
The, uh,
damage was quite severe.

273
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,700
Upper and lower intestines
both shredded.

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,983
She, um,
essentially gutted him.

275
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,397
He's gonna die.

276
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:42,255
That's why they gave her
permission to be here.

277
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,364
So your name is
Mouse?

278
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,238
Nickname.
From college.

279
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm quiet...
I guess.

280
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:04,444
Maybe just...
tell us what you remember.

281
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,574
We were at dinner.

282
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:11,638
Tuesdays,
we go out.

283
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,667
We decided Italian.

284
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,579
<i>I don't know
what happened.</i>

285
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,189
I just...

286
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,843
It doesn't make
any sense.

287
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,116
Billy's devoted to me.

288
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,851
Suddenly...

289
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,248
I knew he was gonna
leave me.

290
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,437
I was
convinced of it.

291
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,634
And I got so...
scared.

292
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,224
I got so angry.

293
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,495
How could I do this?

294
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,734
Maybe...
you didn't mean to hurt him.

295
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,429
I mean,
maybe somebody made you do it.

296
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,060
- <i>Like, compelled you.</i>
- Agent Dunham?

297
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,430
I mean, did it--did it
feel like there was

298
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,430
someone else in your head
making you stab him?

299
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,154
I tried to
kill my husband, right?

300
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,860
- How-how is this happening to me?
- Agent Dunham.

301
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,460
- Oh, God.
- Okay...

302
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,092
Agent Dunham,

303
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:17,130
I need to talk to you,
right now.

304
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,401
It wasn't you.

305
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,165
Olivia, what, exactly,
do you think you're doing?

306
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,445
I made her do it, Peter.

307
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,701
You're running on
no sleep.

308
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,354
And if I'm right,
caffeine pills.

309
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,652
I faked my way through grad school,
remember?

310
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:36,998
You need to calm down.

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,195
You're not
thinking straight,

312
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,751
and you're not
making any sense.

313
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,265
Peter...

314
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,819
What is happening
to me?

315
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,541
Hey...

316
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,277
- Woah! We're closed.
- FBI.

317
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,069
Great.
Fun times.

318
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,076
So what can you
tell me about

319
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,360
what happened here
last night?

320
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,919
I got nothing
new for you, FBI.

321
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,285
Humor me.

322
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,900
<i>Sure.
Middle of dinner,</i>

323
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,451
<i>bitch gets up
and stabs her husband.</i>

324
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,360
<i>Bitch? Really?
We got a problem here?</i>

325
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,258
<i>Problem?
Yeah, we got a problem.</i>

326
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,154
<i>People rush out last night
in the middle of dinner.</i>

327
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:20,400
<i>No one pays.</i>

328
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,787
<i>Today, I'm out
all of lunch hour.</i>

329
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,817
<i>Oh, yeah, also,
I'm on the cover of the Post.</i>

330
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:26,404
Who was sitting here?

331
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,878
Lady,
this isn't the Palm.

332
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:28,900
We don't keep
a seating chart.

333
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,534
- Who was it?
- Whoa! Whoa!

334
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,245
Was I there?
Was it me?

335
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,415
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

336
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:35,619
Just some guy.

337
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,200
He comes in
every now and then.

338
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,762
Blond hair.
He's got a scar on his face.

339
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,072
I know who that is.

340
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,044
What the hell is
wrong with you?

341
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,174
You think you can do
whatever you want?

342
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,183
What are you,
crazy?

343
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,202
<i>I'm gonna
sue you guys.</i>

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,134
Olivia, stop.

345
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:53,280
What's going on?

346
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,508
That man that he described,
I've seen him before.

347
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,482
What?
Where?

348
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,969
That's a curious word.

349
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,675
So it's got nothing to do
with going underwater?

350
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,039
No.

351
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,570
"Unsub" stands for
unidentified subject.

352
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,230
Actually,
it should more logically mean

353
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,319
going above water.

354
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,364
And still no.

355
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,254
I certainly hope
we find him.

356
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:21,712
Who we looking for?

357
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,419
I think it's after this.

358
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,886
<i>Remarkable.
This is entirely new.</i>

359
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:27,553
What?

360
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:28,927
You're talking about
the coffee.

361
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:31,174
Mm, yes.
What is it?

362
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,030
- Cinnamon?
- Yes.

363
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,217
It's quite good.
Delightful, really.

364
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:36,928
There.

365
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,996
Blond hair, a scar.

366
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,487
And he was at
both crime scenes.

367
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,658
So he's our link.

368
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:46,063
<i>Interesting.</i>

369
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,671
No, no,
not the coffee.

370
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:49,830
Although,
I was wondering if we can--

371
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,060
Walter?
Please.

372
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,994
Well...

373
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,230
You say
he was at the table

374
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,533
where you dreamt
you were sitting...

375
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,900
<i>And he was on the platform
where you dreamt</i>

376
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,991
- <i>you were standing.</i>
- Yes.

377
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,253
And in your dreams
you got

378
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,609
many of
the actual details correct.

379
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:06,899
- Is that right?
- Yes.

380
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:09,139
<i>But you did not see him
in your dreams.</i>

381
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,738
No, I didn't.

382
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,789
Well, perhaps that's
because you were him.

383
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:18,908
<i>As I said,
dreams are not always literal.</i>

384
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,993
What if you weren't
dreaming about yourself...

385
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,279
You were dreaming
about him...

386
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,990
<i>Mr. Unsub?</i>

387
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,305
<i>So he's the one</i>

388
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,409
that's been doing these things
to these people, not me?

389
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,970
That's a
possible explanation.

390
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:35,771
But why would
I be dreaming of him?

391
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,303
I mean,
who is he?

392
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,051
<i>Government armed forces
database is online.</i>

393
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,788
<i>Interpol and
public health systems online.</i>

394
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,200
<i>We can match a partial
from the restaurant.</i>

395
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,298
<i>To one off
the guard rail</i>

396
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,868
at the subway station.

397
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,094
Running
facial recognition software.

398
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,688
Agents.

399
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,521
What, precisely,
is going on here?

400
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,229
Sir--

401
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,506
<i>An unsub
that may be</i>

402
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,300
killing people
with his thoughts

403
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,396
while Olivia is
watching in her dream.

404
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,880
- <i>Uh, by the way...</i>
- Sir.

405
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:16,114
I don't think
this machine works.

406
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,030
- Agent Dunham.
- <i>We've got a hit.</i>

407
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,091
Suspect's name is
Nick Wayne.

408
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,761
Uh, former address is
St. Jude's Mental Hospital.

409
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,935
Well,
I'm not going there.

410
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,307
<i>I have a lawsuit from a restaurant
managed in New York.</i>

411
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,300
I have
unauthorized allocation of

412
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,815
agency time
and resources.

413
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,505
I have access
of government databases

414
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,625
for personal use.

415
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,758
What's going on?

416
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,200
Someone's been coming
into my dreams.

417
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:55,160
And he's either been
making me kill people or...

418
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:58,520
He's been killing people
and making me watch.

419
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,783
You know
how this sounds?

420
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,865
These things...
these things that

421
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,030
we see every day,

422
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,671
these things
that we investigate...

423
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,004
They're happening to me.

424
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,739
Dunham, you understand
what kind of scrutiny we're under?

425
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,744
You're under?

426
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,050
If Sanford Harris
weren't in Washington...

427
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,669
I know.

428
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:27,780
You can't unofficially

429
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,710
investigate a case
where you're the subject.

430
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:31,957
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,048
Dunham,
why didn't you come to me?

432
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:43,502
I should have.

433
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,878
But I didn't want to
sound crazy.

434
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,300
So maybe...

435
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,100
Maybe it's better if
I just take some time off...

436
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,335
Just a few days
to work this out.

437
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,109
Maybe just take
a short leave.

438
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:05,679
I need to do this.

439
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,140
Agent Francis,
we have a status change.

440
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:23,532
I'm opening a new case.

441
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>Subject's name is
Nick Wayne.</i>

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,294
<i>Agent Dunham
is on point.</i>

443
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,302
Please give her whatever
assistance she needs.

444
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,568
Thank you.

445
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,833
Dunham.

446
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,469
Take care of
yourself.

447
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,278
I will.

448
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:58,237
<i>You know,
until this year,</i>

449
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,980
<i>I'd never actually been
to a mental hospital.</i>

450
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:01,748
<i>Learn to like
new things.</i>

451
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,561
Maybe I never gave it
enough thought...

452
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:07,326
What Walter went through.

453
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,430
I only every saw it
from my own perspective.

454
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,005
His being crazy was something
that he did to us.

455
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,311
To my mother and me.

456
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,701
It wasn't something
that happened to him.

457
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:23,782
Well,
you were young.

458
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,359
Well,
I'm not young anymore.

459
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,162
Must be
a terrible thing to not

460
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,611
be able
to trust your own mind.

461
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,641
Yeah.

462
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:43,550
Hey...

463
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,883
Are you two
the federal agents?

464
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,435
Uh, yes.
Agent Olivia Dunham.

465
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,014
This is Peter Bishop.

466
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,342
Dr. Miller.
Come with me.

467
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,004
<i>I remember Nick
very well.</i>

468
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,230
He was already
a residential patient

469
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,174
when I arrived here,
which is about five years ago now.

470
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,662
He had a very comprehensive
insurance policy.

471
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:07,382
Quite old.

472
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:08,591
I'd never seen one
like it.

473
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,325
- What kind?
- Military.

474
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,130
About four months ago,
an attorny arrived here

475
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,100
with a paper saying
that Nick had inherited

476
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,125
a large sum of money.

477
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,630
They met twice more,
and after that,

478
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,965
Nick checked himself out.

479
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,357
He was here voluntarily,
after all.

480
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:25,367
Nick was
an interesting person.

481
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,355
He had
a kind of brightness to him.

482
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,416
Intelligent.

483
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,615
Yes, quite,
but not what I mean.

484
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,378
He had
an emotional brightness.

485
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,593
If he was happy,
he would light up a room.

486
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,330
Sad,
he was like a black hole

487
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:41,904
that would suck you
right down with him.

488
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,062
Hyper-emotive
is the clinical term.

489
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:49,735
<i>Put simply,
his affect was highly infectious.</i>

490
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,330
- Was he dangerous?
- <i>No.</i>

491
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,723
No, if anything, his ideation
tended toward self-contempt.

492
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,075
Toward the suicidal.

493
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,100
Although he did suffer
from some psychosis

494
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,874
when his
delusions were florid.

495
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,500
What sort of delusions?

496
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:07,439
Typical paranoid fare.

497
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,600
Nick was convinced
he'd been recruited as a child

498
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,201
for a series of
top-secret experiments.

499
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,630
<i>That he was being prepared
to serve as a soldier</i>

500
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,100
<i>in the
coming war against Denizens</i>

501
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,968
<i>of a parallel universe.</i>

502
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,160
"There is a war coming.

503
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Not a war of
hatred and anger,

504
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,094
a battle for survival.

505
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,877
<i>Many warriors of the
inevitable confrontation</i>

506
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:38,975
<i>are among us now.</i>

507
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,030
But before they can
be considered soldiers,

508
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,133
they must be
regarded as recruits."

509
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,450
It's all right here.

510
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,982
He might as well
have the ZFT memorized.

511
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:49,916
But this is a manifesto from
a terrorist cell in Germany.

512
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:51,837
Yeah, ZFT...
It translates as

513
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,437
<i>destruction by the
advancement of technology.</i>

514
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:54,505
It's their
mission statement.

515
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,849
<i>Yeah,
that's my point.</i>

516
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,560
You said Nick Lane's been in
the nut farm for years, right?

517
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,478
<i>Well, the records go back
to the mid '90s.</i>

518
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,820
So he's been quoting the ZFT
for at least that long.

519
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,471
So when did
they recruit him?

520
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:06,591
How old is he?

521
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:08,371
What?

522
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,487
Nick Lane.
What year was he born?

523
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,297
1979.

524
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:16,381
Where?

525
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:18,473
Jacksonville, Florida.

526
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,385
Aren't you from
Jacksonville?

527
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,750
We need to
talk to your father.

528
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,199
Why,
what do you think you know?

529
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:28,657
We need to
talk to him now.

530
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,806
<i>Where's the fire?</i>

531
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,300
<i>I always loved that expression,
which is curious,</i>

532
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,930
since my lab assistant
was killed in a fire.

533
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,377
What can you tell me about
Cortexiphan?

534
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,960
Oh,
that takes me back.

535
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,200
I remember belly whipping up
a peyote mash--

536
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:48,870
Walter!

537
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:56,306
Cortexiphan was a
highly experimental drug.

538
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,350
William theorized that it might
enhance certain abilities in...

539
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,534
predisposed children.

540
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,756
Let me guess...
You experimented on people.

541
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,712
Oh, no, no,
not me.

542
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:10,749
William.

543
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,993
We had quite
a disagreement about it.

544
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,127
What abilities?

545
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,849
It worked on perception.

546
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:19,713
Carlos Castaneda,
Aldous Huxley,

547
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,170
Werner Heisenberg...

548
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,691
All focused on
one single elementary truth.

549
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:30,224
Perception is the
key to transformation.

550
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,548
Reality is both
subjective and malleable.

551
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:33,910
If you can
dream a better world,

552
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,153
you can make
a better world.

553
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:37,269
Or perhaps travel
between them.

554
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:40,346
What did you just say?

555
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:44,272
So if Nick Lane was
treated with Cortexiphan,

556
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,800
he could change reality
with his thoughts.

557
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,960
He could make
somebody do something

558
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,100
just by thinking it.

559
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:54,630
<i>Not his thoughts.</i>

560
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,200
It's how you feel
that determines

561
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,828
your view of the world.

562
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,272
You're saying that
Cortexiphan worked on feelings.

563
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,681
That's reductive,
but essentially, yes.

564
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,720
What if Nick Lane...

565
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,330
wasn't affecting people
with his thoughts?

566
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,430
What if he was affecting
them with his emotions?

567
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,537
The psychiatrist said that
he was suicidal, right?

568
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,928
Uh, they said that his
moods were contagious.

569
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,560
What if he was
on the platform because

570
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,283
he was considering
killing himself?

571
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,465
Oh, my...

572
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,236
Look, at the restaurant,
all happy couples.

573
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,649
It triggers his
own fear of abandonment.

574
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,589
And that woman
caught his mood.

575
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,130
For the sake of argument,
let's say that

576
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,425
Nick's emotions
are contagious,

577
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,321
<i>like a virus.</i>

578
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,437
Maybe he's even doing this,
unwittingly.

579
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:40,195
But it still doesn't explain
how it is that you're seeing him

580
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,200
in your dreams.

581
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,370
If William had followed
the usual procedures...

582
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:48,200
<i>You see...</i>

583
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,160
Often when
we experimented on children...

584
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,322
Okay,
can we just stop right there

585
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,891
and analyze that sentence
for a second?

586
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,553
We would put them
in pairs.

587
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,360
Like the buddy system
in summer camp--

588
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:00,130
<i>Listen to him!</i>

589
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,707
<i>He's comparing
human experimentation</i>

590
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:02,622
to summer camp!

591
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:06,609
This pairing kept them
from becoming frightened

592
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:08,363
or feeling isolated.

593
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,416
Sometimes,
an intense bond could form.

594
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,694
A-A bond...

595
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,030
which could be greatly
amplified by a drug

596
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,660
like Cortexiphan.

597
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,268
Alright, stop it,
both of you.

598
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,636
You're creeping me out.

599
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,564
Olivia was never treated
with Cortexiphan.

600
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,561
Is that true,
Agent Dunham?

601
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,233
I might have been.

602
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,005
What?

603
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,926
Well,
that's good news.

604
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:11,999
How is that good news,
Walter?

605
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,588
This Nick Lane
of yours...

606
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,186
It means I may know
how to find him.

607
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,151
<i>He's sexually excited.</i>

608
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,105
His excitement
has infected the dancer.

609
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,406
She's excited too.

610
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,754
<i>They're leaving
the club together.</i>

611
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,057
What, are you nuts,
Ginger?!

612
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,581
You're in the
middle of your shift!

613
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:17,730
What's going on?

614
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm hypnotically
stimulating R.E.M. state

615
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,568
to enhance her
psychic connection to Nick Lane.

616
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:30,254
<i>We're tuning her antenna,
as it were.</i>

617
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,111
Olivia can feel what
Nick Lane is feeling.

618
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,519
She can see
what he's seeing.

619
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:35,837
Oh...

620
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,741
What's happening?
Is he hurting her?

621
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:39,604
- Oh.
- Oh...

622
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:40,327
What?

623
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,812
- Oh.
- What?

624
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,452
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Oh, I see.

625
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,766
<i>He's feeling guilt.</i>

626
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,300
<i>Shame.</i>

627
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,532
<i>He feels dirty.</i>

628
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,010
He hates himself.

629
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,275
He wishes
he was dead.

630
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,396
<i>The dancer...

631
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,978
<i>He's infecting her.</i>

632
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,976
<i>She's catching it.</i>

633
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,299
<i>His emotions are
jumping to her.</i>

634
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,726
How much
he hates himself.

635
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,312
The girl...
He's infecting her.

636
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,672
She's dead.
I killed her.

637
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,579
No, you didn't.

638
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,793
You must stay under.

639
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,052
Agent Dunham,
you must try to stay under.

640
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,215
She must try
to stay under.

641
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:11,099
<i>What is going on?</i>

642
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:12,304
Did he just
kill someone?

643
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,533
<i>Did he kill that dancer?</i>

644
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:14,879
These are dreams.

645
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,995
This boy is essentially
a reverse empath.

646
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,083
His feelings
are killing people.

647
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,530
Put simply...

648
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:25,165
Agent Dunham's mind

649
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,200
is recognizing the effects of
his emotions on his victims and

650
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,255
translating them
into images

651
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,386
that her dreaming mind
can recognize.

652
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:34,105
Put simply.

653
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,110
Peter...

654
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,087
Help her.

655
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,479
<i>Help her calm down.
Go ahead, son.</i>

656
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,418
<i>Agent Dunham...</i>

657
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,668
Where are you?

658
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,868
Where are you?
What can you see?

659
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,019
<i>What can you see?</i>

660
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,586
<i>Agent Dunham...</i>

661
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,155
<i>Where are you?</i>

662
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,116
I know
where he lives.

663
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:48,982
<i>Clear!</i>

664
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,510
Clear.

665
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,151
<i>Come over here.</i>

666
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,622
<i>I think you should take
a look at this.</i>

667
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,473
The torrent attack.

668
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,877
Someone's been
a busy bee.

669
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,744
<i>Look at the dates</i>

670
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:48,718
on these papers.

671
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,605
This guy's been collecting
this stuff for years.

672
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:53,373
I've always wanted
a two-headed goat.

673
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,800
What newspaper is this?
Can I get a subscription?

674
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
- Walter.
- <i>Why now?</i>

675
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,740
<i>He was given
Cortexiphan</i>

676
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,030
over 20 years ago,
right?

677
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,283
Why is this
just happening now?

678
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:04,700
That lawyer shows up
at the mental hospital

679
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,400
with a magical inheritance,
and all of a sudden

680
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,115
Nick Lane becomes an
emotional atom bomb?

681
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,895
Seems a little too
coincidental

682
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:11,262
to be coincidence
in my book.

683
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,482
So what are you saying?

684
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,677
You think
he was activated?

685
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,390
<i>"What was written
will come to pass."</i>

686
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:20,899
What?

687
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,131
It's written on the wall
over here.

688
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:49,074
Got a call from
a security guard downtown.

689
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,370
We've got a positive I.D. of
Nick Lane entering a building.

690
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,056
He's not alone.

691
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:07,166
Nick Lane may be turning
into a walking epidemic.

692
00:40:08,178 --> 00:40:10,039
As his emotions
become more intense,

693
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,754
he may become
more contagious.

694
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,962
Great.

695
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,717
Why can't
"more angry" ever

696
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,220
<i>translate into
"less dangerous"?</i>

697
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,466
<i>And what are we supposed to
do if we find him, anyway?</i>

698
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,502
I mean,
if we get too close to him,

699
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,275
aren't we gonna be infected
with his emotions too?

700
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:22,291
Yes.

701
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:25,823
But perhaps Agent Dunham
would not.

702
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:27,554
Why?

703
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:30,177
You were also treated
with Cortexiphan.

704
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,900
It might afford you
some degree of immunity

705
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,086
from Nick's abilities.

706
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,031
Why do
I get the feeling

707
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,402
you're not telling us
everything?

708
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:42,830
Because I don't know
everything.

709
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,973
Officer,
we're with the FBI.

710
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,447
You don't want
to go up there.

711
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,446
We already sent a guy up,
now he's on the ledge too.

712
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,328
We don't know what the hell's
going on up there.

713
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,617
- It's okay, officer.
- <i>Olivia...</i>

714
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:32,328
I'm gonna be okay.

715
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,892
Nick?

716
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,774
Nick Lane?

717
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,953
Olive.

718
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,198
You heard me.

719
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,569
You heard me.
You came.

720
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,936
You were always
the strong one.

721
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,724
Whenever I got scared,
you could make me feel better.

722
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,969
Do you remember,
Olive?

723
00:42:28,227 --> 00:42:30,134
I'm sorry,
no, I don't.

724
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,557
That-That's okay.

725
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,884
I think they meant for us
to forget.

726
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,717
I just couldn't.

727
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:42,106
I did what they told us.
I-I waited, Olive.

728
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,810
The soldier to come is
both natural and unnatural.

729
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,726
I waited to be called up.

730
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,503
You stay fit,
stay focused, stay ready.

731
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,379
I wore the
blacks and grays.

732
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:53,448
I blended in.

733
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,910
But the call never came.

734
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,135
It never came.

735
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,649
Then,
that man with the glasses...

736
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,334
He showed up
at the hospital.

737
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,788
He spoke
all the old words.

738
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,432
He said
they're coming.

739
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,635
He needed warriors.

740
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,420
He said,

741
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,032
"What was written
will come to pass."

742
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,799
He said he knew
how to wake me up.

743
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,433
I shouldn't have
listened to him.

744
00:43:26,735 --> 00:43:28,390
Sometimes
what we wake up,

745
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,696
it can't be put back
to sleep.

746
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,517
Nick.
You don't have to do this.

747
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,532
I want to
stop hurting people!

748
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,266
Take it.

749
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:47,729
Take it.

750
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,820
Shoot me.

751
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,380
Please, Olive?

752
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,111
I can't fight this
much longer.

753
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,178
Listen to me.
Calm down...

754
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:03,998
Aah!

755
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,135
Uh.

756
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:07,294
Maybe eight miles,
it...

757
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,687
I do hope Agent Dunham
meant to do that.

758
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,848
Shoot me...

759
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,639
Or I will jump,
and they will all jump with me.

760
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:27,286
Shoot me, Olive.

761
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,685
I have to die,
or I will keep hurting people.

762
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,343
Please.

763
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,769
We weren't made
for this.

764
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,963
<i>Don't make me take them
all with me.</i>

765
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,122
Please?

766
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,989
I'm sorry.

767
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,679
Olive...

768
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,646
You'll wish you had.

769
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,225
You'll wish
you'd killed me.

770
00:45:29,195 --> 00:45:31,280
<i>Nick Lane's parents died
several years ago.</i>

771
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:32,240
Car accident.

772
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:34,911
His lawyer's identity appears
to have been falsified.

773
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,115
We've repeated our request
to Massive Dynamic

774
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,392
for information regarding
the Cortexiphan protocols.

775
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,905
But according to Nina Sharp,
the names of the participants

776
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:43,244
were deleted
from the records.

777
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,218
And you still have no
memory of the trials?

778
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,833
- Of being treated with the drug?
- No.

779
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,391
- No.
- But he does.

780
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,023
- Yes.
- Why do you think that is?

781
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,443
I don't know.

782
00:45:57,227 --> 00:45:58,384
You saved his life.

783
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,764
He's being kept in a
drug-induced coma.

784
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,219
For how long?

785
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,266
Indefinitely.

786
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,322
He said sometimes
what we wake up

787
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,952
can't be put back
to sleep.

788
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,108
<i>I wonder if
he was right.</i>

789
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,628
Are you all right,
Dunham?

790
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,740
Yes.

791
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:54,701
Hey.

792
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,036
Aunt Liv...

793
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:01,708
The stuff that they put in me
isn't dead anymore.

794
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,366
It came back alive.

795
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,899
Can that really happen?

796
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:13,601
It's just bad dreams,
baby girl.

797
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,705
It's just bad dreams.

798
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,301
Come on.

799
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,168
Ooh,
you're getting so big.

800
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,221
I'm gonna put you
back to bed.

801
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,709
I'm breaking about a
thousand regulations by doing this.

802
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,554
- Here's Nick Lane's file.
- I know.

803
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,628
I appreciate it, Charlie.
Thank you.

804
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,702
Okay.

805
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,757
<i>Is the incident contained?</i>

806
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,187
<i>Yes, Dr. Bell.</i>

807
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,276
<i>- How bad?
- Bad.</i>

808
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,763
<i>- Casualties?
- Not sure yet.</i>

809
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,134
<i>We can't locate Brenner.</i>

810
00:48:46,196 --> 00:48:47,758
<i>Is she okay?</i>

811
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,129
<i>She's fine.</i>

812
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,662
<i>Hell,
do we know what triggered it?</i>

813
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:53,723
<i>Obviously,
she was upset with you.</i>

814
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,291
<i>It's okay.
It's all right now.</i>

815
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,230
<i>Nobody is
angry with you.</i>

816
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,334
<i>You didn't do
anything bad.</i>

817
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,846
<i>It's all right,
Olive.</i>

818
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:06,860
<i>Everything's going
to be okay.</i>
