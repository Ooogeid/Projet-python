1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,793
You're nearly die
when you were a boy.

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,879
<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,508
I became consumed by saving you.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,216
I don't remember any of that.

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,510
I can't let Peter die again.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,041
What did you mean by that?

7
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,074
I designed a device

8
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,433
intended to cross
the time-space continuum

9
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,186
and retrieve my dying son.

10
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,688
Walter, I gotta tell
Peter the truth.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,817
Things have never been better between us.
I can't lose him again. I can't!

12
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:29,018
Give me time to prepare.

13
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:30,404
Please.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,513
Any change?

15
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,452
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you have any spare change?

16
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:52,127
Thank you. God bless you.

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,667
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have any spare change?

18
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,116
- No, I'm sorry.
- Anything you can manage, sir.

19
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,701
Thank you.

20
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:02,687
God bless you anyway, sir.

21
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:48,982
Spare change?

22
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,289
Oh, god.

23
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,870
No, please!

Walter. It's Peter.

33
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:18,197
Your son,

<i>Peter.</i>

35

<i>Come on, Walter.

36
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,391
<i>Walter, pick up the receiver,</i>

37
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:26,525
<i>and hit the square black button next

38
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,001

39
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,875
<i>All right, fine.
When you get this,</i>

40
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,519
Get your kit together.
I got off the phone with Olivia.

41
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,255
There was an incident on a train.

42
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,219
<i>I know how much you love trains.
Thought it might cheer you up.</i>

43
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,514
<i>Be home to pick you up
in 15 minutes, all right?</i>

44
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,378
Have you noticed anything weird?

45
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,716
Not yet, but give it ten minutes.

46
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,176
I was actually talking about Walter.

47
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,638
- Hello. I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.
- He's been avoiding me all week.

48
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,057
He didn't even look at me
on the car ride over here.

49
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,531
He's stopped eating.

50
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,160
I got him a new box of peak freans.
He hasn't even opened it.

51
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,908
Did he say something?

52
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,733
All week it feels like
he's been enveloped in this...

53
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,318
sadness.

54
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,281
I haven't noticed anything.

55
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,292
Sir.

56
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,836
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking their underwear.

57
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,659
- Their underwear?
- I'm sure you're familiar that with

58
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,395
sudden death

59
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,818
victims often experience

60
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,710
a sudden bladder release of urine,

61
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,099
and sometimes excrement.

62
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,477
Get off this train.

63
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
He's with me.

64
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,048
Thank you.

65
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,400
I don't know what happened
to these people, Agent Dunham.

66
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:04,238
My first guess
is collective heart failure.

67
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,199
You think these people died from having
a heart attack at the same time?

68
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,375
Perhaps it was sympathetic.

69
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,506
Contagious, like yawning.

70
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,432
Come on, Walter.
You really believe that?

71
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,951
Does your theory suggest why
all the lights would be out in this car?

72
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,775
There should be battery backup.

73
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,186
Unless it wasn't serviced properly.

74
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,369
He crossed paths with the man
as he entered the train car.

75
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,000
Six foot, brown hair,
wearing a trench coat.

76
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,797
He's sure that he saw him coming
out of this train car.

77
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,266
The man didn't speak to him
or acknowledge him.

78
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,464
He just exited down the stairs
of the platform.

79
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,549
Did we pick him up on surveillance?

80
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,343
I'm waiting to get word
if they can pull him on any footage.

81
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,075
Hey, Rod.

82
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:33,908
Found this over there.

83
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,914
Oh, my god.

84
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,917
Excuse me, gentlemen.
That's mine.

85
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,512
Thank you.

86
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,554
All the batteries are dead.
It's not just the lights that went out.

87
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,673
This is her cell phone,
but they're all dead.

88
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:51,470
All the cell phones,
laptops, mp3 players.

89
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,665
- They're completely drained of power.
- Any theories, Dr. Bishop?

90
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,755
Except my initial theory

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,697
of collective heart failure
is probably incorrect.

92
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,031
I'll need to take some
of these bodies back to the lab.

93
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,455
Six or seven should suffice.

94
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,658
We have an image
from the platform cameras.

95
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,332
Who is this guy?

96
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,783
And how did he kill everything
on this train?

97
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,021
This is unusual.

98
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,807
Dying organisms struggle
for their last breath,

99
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,644
but these people appear as if their
switches have simply been turned off.

100
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,431
- How's it coming in here?
- Hi, Peter.

101
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,950
Not very good.

102
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,028
Take samples of this man's lung,
brain, and skin.

103
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,865
- Something's not right here.
- I think it's my paycheck.

104
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,159
I'm sure you're gonna make
sense out of it.

105
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,664
What's going on with you?

106
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,392
Is there something wrong?
Something you wanna talk about?

107
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,644
Everything's fine.

108
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,005
Astro, show me those previous

109
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,923
cellular samples, please.

110
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,740
That's extraordinary.

111
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,473
The ATP concentrations
are unusually low.

112
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,121
Cellular process
should continue for hours,

113
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,420
even after death,
but this man's mitochondria

114
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:25,856
seems to have ceased functioning
well before it should.

115
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:30,194
What do you say I take samples
of the rest and see if there's a trend?

116
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,700
So what are you saying, Walter?
That something was able

117
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,246
to reach inside of these people's
mitochondria and just...

118
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,873
Drain them, like the batteries in all of
the electrical devices on the train.

119
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,277
It wasn't just their hearts
that stopped beating.

120
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,085
It was every cell in their bodies.

121
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,612
What do you think could
possibly do something like that?

122
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:50,987
I have no idea.

123
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:56,491
20 years ago a person walking
through Boston for two hours

124
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,640
showed up on an average
of ten different surveillance cameras.

125
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,258
Now, it's hundreds.

126
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,453
Bad for privacy, but good for us.

127
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:06,241
I've asked them to output
each source to a different monitor.

128
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,650
Give us a sense of the route
our suspect took. Play it.

129
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,404
He exits the train station,
crossing Ferris Ave., continuing north.

130
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:18,821
This is from the bank on Howard Street.
Coming around the corner.

131
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,646
There, he enters a café.

132
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,754
He spent almost 45 minutes inside,
then left the establishment.

133
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,918
The guy kills a train full of people
and then stops for a meal?

134
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,006
And the trail goes cold there.

135
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,883
Once he left the cafe, we couldn't
locate him on any other cameras.

136
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,970
But we have a place to start.

137
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,434
Café Wilusa.

138
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:45,435
He was here this morning.
He comes in all the time.

139
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,603
Weird guy.

140
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:47,915
Weird how?

141
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,525
Well, he always draws on stuff,
Like the napkins and the placemats.

142
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,987
- What sort of stuff does he draw?
- Some kind of math, I think.

143
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,532
To be honest, my higher math
ends at calculating my tip, so...

144
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,411
- Does he ever pay with a credit card?
- Sometimes he does.

145
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,790
Here. This is him.

146
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,711
Alistair Peck.

147
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,422
Thank you. This will really help.

148
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,391
<i>Clear!</i>

149
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,455
<i>Clear!</i>

150
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,419
<i>Clear.</i>

151
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,038
Send the Bishops up, please.

152
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:52,169
These mathematical formulae
are extraordinarily complex.

153
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,212
Physicists use diagrams

154
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,341
like these to shorthand ideas
about how subatomic

155
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,885
particles behave.
These are sublime.

156
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,581
This may explain his flourish
for numerical wallpapering.

157
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:06,856
Astrophysics.

158
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:08,821
He teaches at MIT.

159
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:11,921
If I comprehend
this correctly, then this...

160
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:16,046
Alistair Peck has taken
Einstein's theory of relativity

161
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,028
and turned it on its ear.

162
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:20,223
I grasp portions of it,

163
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,332
tachyons are depicted here,
but I fail to see their relevance.

164
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,577
However, it does confirm

165
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,247
that Dr. Peck was dealing with
tremendous energy to do...

166
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,751
Whatever it is he's doing.

167
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,439
What are you doing with my things?

168
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,327
<i>Peck is here, he's downstairs.</i>

169
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,500
He just walked in of the street.

170
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:26,920
I guess that explains
what all the surgical tools were for.

171
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,182
What did you do to the
people on that train?

172
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,477
12 innocent people.

173
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,446
Those people aren't dead, miss.

174
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,699
Not permanently.

175
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,810
Of course they're dead.

176
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:42,863
But they soon won't be.

177
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,949
Although, others soon will be,
I'm afraid.

178
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,743
Dr. Peck, I want you
to lie down on the ground

179
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,169
now.

180
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,978
Don't take my computations.
They're meaningless to you.

181
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:56,209
It is well within my ability
to make it

182
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,004
so that you are never in
possession of the things I require.

183
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,925
You've implanted a faraday mesh.

184
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,384
- What are you talking about, Walter?
- A shield,

185
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,970
to create a temporal
pocket around your body.

186
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,378
- Of course.
- Of course, what?

187
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,476
- Why would he need a temporal pocket?
- That's fantastic.

188
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,186
Dr. Peck, what are you doing?

189
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:15,812
Dr. Peck?

190
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,607
- Walter, what's happening?
- Get down!

191
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,275
I said get down on the ground!

192
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,289
Spare change?

193
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,584
I'm sorry you have to
go through this again.

194
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,666
<i>Leave a message.</i>

195
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,290
Walter. It's Peter.

196
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,407
Your son, Peter.

197
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:13,631
<i>All right, fine. When you get this,
I want you to get your kit together.</i>

198
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:16,983
<i>I just got off the phone with Olivia.
There was an incident on a train</i>

199
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,876
<i>and I know how much you love trains.
Thought it might cheer you up.</i>

200
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,401
I'm coming home to pick you up
in 15 minutes, all right?

201
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,299
Have you noticed anything weird?

202
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,617
Not yet, but give it ten minutes.

203
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,013
I was actually talking about Walter.

204
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,087
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.

205
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,435
- Is this the car?
- Right over there.

206
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,769
Must be the car.

207
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,398
Here's the initial report.

208
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:10,135
You think these people died from having
a heart attack at the same time?

209
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,311
Perhaps it was sympathetic.

210
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,442
Contagious, like yawning.

211
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,441
Does your theory suggest why
all the lights would be out in this car?

212
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,740
There should be battery backup.
Unless it wasn't serviced properly.

213
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,538
I'll need to take some
of these bodies back to the lab.

214
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,536
Six or seven should suffice.

215
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,670
He crossed paths with the suspect
as he entered the train car.

216
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,492
He says the man was in a raincoat.

217
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:54,929
Six foot, brown hair.

218
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,838
Says he touched the rail.
We're dusting for prints.

219
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,718
Hi there.

220
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,395
The man from the train

221
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,339
Did he say something to you?

222
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,483
What did he say?

223
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,194
"I'm sorry you have to
go through this again."

224
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,167
Again?

225
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:28,630
<i>And what then?</i>

226
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,448
He stepped off the stairs
and walked away.

227
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:33,802
Agent Broyles, Agent Dunham.

228
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:38,181
All the batteries are dead.

229
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,184
All the cell phones, laptops,
they're completely drained of power.

230
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:44,755
Hey, Rod.

231
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,000
<i>Look, I found this
on the floor over there.</i>

232
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,560
Oh, my God.

233
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,195
Oh, thank you, thank you!

234
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,120
- That, that's mine.
- He found it on the floor up there.

235
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,478
Thank you.

236
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,526
The mitochondria were depleted?

237
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,252
<i>Yep, completely drained.</i>

238
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,102
They didn't die of a heart attack,

239
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:11,506
but completely
drained of biological energy.

240
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,968
- Just like their phone batteries.
- <i>Pretty much. How is the question.</i>

241
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,220
Walter's still working on it.
I'll let you know

242
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,767
<i>if he finds out anything else.</i>

243
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,480
We managed to ID the print
we lifted off the train car railing.

244
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,631
We got lucky.

245
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,898
They matched a set NASA has on file.

246
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,859
Dr. Alistair Peck.

247
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,736
What did he do in NASA?

248
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,981
He was classified as part
of a think tank.

249
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,658
We don't know much
more than that, yet.

250
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,883
Well, we know that he lives here.
412 Inman Street.

251
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,510
Send the Bishops up, please.

252
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:15,236
Mr. Peck may have done
project work for NASA,

253
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,738
But he's employed locally.

254
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,674
Astrophysics. He teaches at MIT

255
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,039
What?

256
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,913
I'm having <i>deja vu</i>.

257
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,332
I read that <i>deja vu</i> is fate's way

258
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,254
of telling you that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.

259
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,348
That's why you feel like
you've been there before.

260
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,323
You are right in line
with you're own destiny.

261
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,536
Well, do you believe that?

262
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,135
No, it's a bit mystical
for my taste.

263
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:52,132
I never get them, myself.

264
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,484
Maybe that's 'cause I'm not
on track with my own destiny.

265
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:58,238
Look at this.

266
00:19:58,634 --> 00:19:59,684
What is it?

267
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:01,675
A photo album.

268
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,586
But who are you?

269
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,581
What's your name?

270
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:31,898
Well, one of them is bound
to be back sooner or later.

271
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,452
Hopefully sooner.

272
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,785
Shall we go home now?

273
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:47,715
I'm tired of waiting.

274
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:53,054
Olivia...

275
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,628
Might I come with you?

276
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,113
In your car?

277
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,657
I can't drive home with him.
I can't look at him.

278
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,510
Walter, you can't keep doing this.

279
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,804
Peter knows that
something's upsetting you.

280
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,772
I've written him a letter.

281
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:10,569
Instead of me stammering
in fits and starts,

282
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,520
a letter is more concise.

283
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,656
It explains everything
in just the right words.

284
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:21,623
Except that every time I
think I'm ready to tell him, I...

285
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,043
envision his reaction
when he reads it

286
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,242
And I run the scene in my mind

287
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,710
again and again.

288
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,819
And every time, the outcome is...

289
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:33,458
terrible.

290
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,392
But I will do it.

291
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:36,961
But first...

292
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,649
There's something I'm waiting for,
Agent Dunham.

293
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,217
Something important.

294
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:45,806
Hey, guys, check this out.

295
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,215
Templates.

296
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:49,599
Forms.

297
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,270
- What are they for?
- They're used to cast machine parts,

298
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,261
- but these look like they were handmade.
- This one is dated

299
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,226
several months ago,

300
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,861
This one even earlier.

301
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,219
He refers to them as...

302
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,990
prototypes.

303
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,784
But prototypes for what?

304
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:47,365
Alistair Peck was a professor
here for six years.

305
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,910
His focus... obsession,
was particle acceleration.

306
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,381
Creating wormholes
without a particle collider.

307
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,375
Are you saying that Dr. Peck's
area of expertise was time travel?

308
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,878
He kept cranking out theories, and
every one of them was over our heads.

309
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,172
That must have been frustrating
for his superiors.

310
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,367
Embarrassing
is a better classification.

311
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:09,104
They wanted to fire Alistair
but he saved them the trouble and left,

312
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:10,495
about a year ago.

313
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:12,724
Is this his wife?

314
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,241
Ah, the <i>fiancée</i>.

315
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,522
Her name is Arlette.

316
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:22,400
- Do you remember her last name?
- I don't recall, no.

317
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:24,902
Do you know any other friends
he might have had?

318
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,128
- People he knew?
- That's the sad thing.

319
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,782
He was kind to everyone,
but he never socialized.

320
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:31,659
I think I was his only friend.

321
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,078
Well, anything that you
can remember about

322
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,122
Mr. Peck, it could be important.

323
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,818
Alistair sent me these
about six months ago to proofread.

324
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,216
- He had hopes of seeing them published.
- Can we take them?

325
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:50,536
They're only gathering dust here.
They are pretty dense.

326
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,055
Most'd say it's gobbledygook.

327
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,892
Well, I happen to know someone
who's fluent in gobbledygook.

328
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,254
I'm finished.

329
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:05,095
In another 20 years, with the assistance
of some other great minds,

330
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,670
I will have absorbed
this information.

331
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,223
Alistair Peck

332
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,492
has conceived of some extraordinary

333
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,203
theories and is possibly
implementing them.

334
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,776
Meaning what?

335
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,707
He may well be able
to travel through time.

336
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,285
Conceivably.

337
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:23,580
Einstein himself theorized this.

338
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:26,190
10:00 a.m... 11:00 a.m.

339
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,949
He said that

340
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,908
if something could propel an object
faster than the speed of light,

341
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:35,935
Then time would appear to bend.

342
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:40,091
When those two folds...

343
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,601
connect

344
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:44,899
a tremendous amount
of energy is required

345
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:45,944
to absorb

346
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,403
- the jump.
- From any power source.

347
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,198
- So the laptops, the phones...
- And anyone who was near him.

348
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,742
You're saying that

349
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,991
Peck's moving through time is what
killed all of these people on the train.

350
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:00,651
That is my theory, yes,
and Olivia, if it is right,

351
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:03,552
then we may well have
apprehended this man already.

352
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:05,294
Possibly several times.

353
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,811
I found his fiancee.

354
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:10,800
The car in one of the photo
album pictures is registered

355
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,182
to an Arlette Turling. Her license
information is coming through.

356
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,013
That's her.
Find whatever you can.

357
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,829
She's our only connection to Peck.

358
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,892
Third volume is unfinished.

359
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,728
There's a handwritten
segment at the back,

360
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,647
Then the writing stops.

361
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:27,984
The unfinished chapter is entitled

362
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,437
"achieving the Arlette principle."

363
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,738
What'd you just say?

364
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,958
"Achieving the Arlette principle."

365
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:40,538
I think I know why Peck
is doing this.

366
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,875
Arlette Turling was killed
in a car accident ten months ago.

367
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:46,155
On the 18th of may.

368
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,429
What if Alistair Peck is going back

369
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:50,756
to save her?

370
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,052
Grief can drive people
to extraordinary lengths.

371
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,440
Considering the amount
of energy that was drawn

372
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,599
when he landed at the
station this morning,

373
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:13,517
using Peck's own theories,
I estimate

374
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,365
that we witnessed
just a 12-hour jump.

375
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,154
10-month jump...

376
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:21,787
The results would be devastating.

377
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,628
- How many casualties?
- It would depend where he landed.

378
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,336
Hundreds.

379
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:37,396
This is weird.

380
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,011
I did a search for Peck's cell phone

381
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:42,006
when we first ID'd him
as a suspect.

382
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:45,144
He didn't have one, but
Arlette's number is still active.

383
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,002
Someone's paying the bill.

384
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,460
Now, in the past 24 hours,

385
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:52,962
the primary cell tower that's been
handling the signal

386
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,433
from Arlette's cell phone
is a tower near

387
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,068
- Albany street.
- What's near Albany street?

388
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:00,326
MIT.

389
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:03,955
What's he doing at MIT? The professor
said that she hadn't seen him

390
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,900
- for almost a year.
- Walter has a lab here,

391
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,707
maybe Peck has a lab there.

392
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,133
According to the files,

393
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,637
the lab registered to Peck when he was
a professor here was lab 107.

394
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,868
Are there any windows in that lab?

395
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:24,138
Get your men on the rooftops.

396
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,684
Are those guns really necessary?

397
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,065
You okay?
Want me to take you back home?

398
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,280
No, Peter, no,

399
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:31,759
Stay there.

400
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:35,765
If we are correct,

401
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,154
for Peck, this is about

402
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,350
bringing a dead loved
one back to life,

403
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:42,012
then Peck and I,
we have something in common.

404
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,708
Let me speak to him.

405
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,848
Of course I know that killing him

406
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:48,833
is the only way to ensure
that he won't jump, but if I could

407
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,032
talk to him,

408
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:53,147
I think I can
convince him to stop this.

409
00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:58,217
Please.

410
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:01,595
Let's talk to Broyles.

411
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:32,376
Wait.

412
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,724
I am not a threat.

413
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,745
I am an ambassador.

414
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,066
I know who you are.

415
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:43,262
You're dr. Walter bishop.
I've read you.

416
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,775
"New frontiers
in genetic hybridization."

417
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,568
And I know that if you wanted to,

418
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,245
you could disappear
from here in a second.

419
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:58,067
Please, trust me.

420
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:07,631
You and I both know they are
certain things we take for granted,

421
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,727
the laws of nature for example,

422
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:13,072
that are not necessarily binding.

423
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,862
There are places on this earth

424
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,838
where two plus two most definitely

425
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,645
does not equal four.

426
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,510
You've figured out how to bend time.

427
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:25,483
But you're only interested
In traveling to the past.

428
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,202
Your goal, your next jump
is the 18th of may.

429
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:32,327
So you know.

430
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:34,758
The 18th of may.

431
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,755
Don't do that! Don't stand there!

432
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,666
<i>There are snipers outside.
Stay away from the window!</i>

433
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:46,763
I hope he knows what he's doing.

434
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,495
<i>Why are you here?
What do you really want?</i>

435
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,499
My calculations

436
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,793
show what you must already know.

437
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,983
An enormous amount of energy will be
drained from wherever you arrive,

438
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,217
and a large number of people
will be killed.

439
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,761
But each jump back
clears that slate.

440
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,902
If you are reunited
with your fiancee

441
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,482
and you pull her from that car,

442
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:14,661
the victims
of this last massive reset

443
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,579
will remain dead.

444
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:19,498
Listen.

445
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:27,950
On the day of the crash, we argued.

446
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:32,679
Arlette wanted me to go to some store
to register for wedding gifts,

447
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:35,117
and I hurt her feelings and I left.

448
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:39,398
As I walked, I became drawn
to something on the horizon.

449
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,459
A large, red ball.

450
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,382
It was a hot air balloon.

451
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,799
Moored on the city's outskirts,
out in this field.

452
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,141
I spent the whole day in this field,
looking at this balloon,

453
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,144
and I got my answer.

454
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,597
I had an epiphany

455
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:01,318
of how to physically apply
my theories of time travel.

456
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,853
I was in that field

457
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,599
the moment her car was hit.

458
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,813
18 may, 2:18 PM.

459
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,750
If I'd have simply
done what she asked me,

460
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,508
if I'd have said,
"sure, I'll go with you,"

461
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,648
I know it wouldn't have happened.

462
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,008
I will jump back.

476
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:29,154
<i>I can't get it back online,
he turns the radio off.</i>

463
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,593
But I'll jump back
into that empty field, Walter.

464
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,875
And I'll only drain the energy
from the plant life.

465
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,557
Energy will be dispersed,
no one will die, and I will

466
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,976
pull Arlette from that car
and I will save her life.

467
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:39,786
I know...

468
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:44,523
why you haven't gone back
to may 18th, yet.

469
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,489
Because you don't know how to.

470
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:51,249
You haven't been able to jump back

471
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:53,325
any further than the train.

472
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,096
What happened?

473
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,675
Someone get that signal back online!

474
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:11,669
You approximate the time curvature

475
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,864
using a seventh order polynomial.

476
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,995
But you made one small error.

477
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,377
For the distance you require,
it should be at least nine.

478
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,067
I've read you too.

479
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,200
Get a team up there, now.

480
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:38,706
I'm telling you how to do this,
but I'm telling you you cannot do it.

481
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,764
- I must do it.
- You'll never be able

482
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:43,939
- to live with the consequences.
- I told you, no one will die.

483
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,589
That's not the consequences
I'm talking about.

484
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:50,381
I, too, attempted the unimaginable,

485
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:52,906
and I succeeded.

486
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,514
I crossed into another universe,

487
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,060
and took a son that wasn't mine.

488
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:03,051
And since then, not a day has passed

489
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:06,006
without me feeling
the burden of that act.

490
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,176
I'm going to tell you something

491
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:18,078
that I have never told another soul.

492
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:24,492
Until I...

493
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:27,784
took my son from the other side,

494
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,775
I had never believed in god.

495
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,020
But it occurred to me...

496
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,311
that my actions had betrayed him

497
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:42,271
and that everything that
had happened to me since

498
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,123
was god punishing me.

499
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:49,134
So now I'm looking
for a sign of forgiveness.

500
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:52,831
I've asked god...

501
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:55,614
for a sign of forgiveness.

502
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,855
A specific one,

503
00:33:58,258 --> 00:33:59,468
a white tulip.

504
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,874
Tulips don't bloom
this time of year, white or otherwise.

505
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,372
But he's god.

506
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,816
And if god can forgive
me for my acts then

507
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:13,290
maybe...

508
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,022
it's in the realm of possibility

509
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:19,509
That my son, possibly,

510
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,486
may be able to forgive me too.

511
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,344
God is science.

512
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,974
God is polio and flu vaccines

513
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:34,113
and MRI machines,
and artificial hearts.

514
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,574
If you are a man of science,

515
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,812
then that's the only faith we need.

516
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,988
Then allow me to serve
as a precautionary tale.

517
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,963
There will be repercussions

518
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,134
if you pull Arlette from that car.

519
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,794
You don't know how things
will be changed

520
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,782
by your actions, but they will.

521
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,147
It's not our place
to adjust the universe.

522
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,447
And you will never be able to look
at her again without knowing that,

523
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:08,439
just like every time
I look at my son.

524
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:14,218
I have traveled through madness
to figure this out.

525
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,049
And you will too.

526
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:25,517
You're asking me
to just leave her there.

527
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,176
No, no, no! Stop!
I'm all right.

528
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,482
Stop! No, please!

529
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,755
Gentlemen, please!
Don't you see?

530
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,098
We won't remember this.

531
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,022
Don't you see?
We won't remember anything.

532
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,242
<i>We won't remember!</i>

533
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,841
Officer I need a backup.

534
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:00,455
<i>Copy that! What's your twenty?</i>

535
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:03,160
I'm at 412 Inmann Street.

536
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,540
This is weird.

537
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,789
I did a search for Peck's cell phone

538
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:12,942
when we first ID'd him as a suspect.

539
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,305
He didn't have one.

540
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,906
But Arlette Turling's number
is still active.

541
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,711
Now in the past 24 hours,
the primary cell tower

542
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:22,811
that's been handling
the signal is a tower near...

543
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,807
Albany Street.

544
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:29,110
Alistair Peck is back
at his residence.

545
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:31,980
Six dead,
including two Boston PD officers.

546
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:35,046
<i>We have to take him down
before he jumps again.</i>

547
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:44,928
Take it.

548
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:41,670
I haven't seen you look
at that letter for a while.

549
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:43,839
It's been almost a year
since Alistair died.

550
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,343
Today's the day
I'm supposed to send it.

551
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,344
Open it.

552
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,222
Apparently,
Alistair felt whatever it is,

553
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,149
he could put in your trust.

554
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:58,362
He wouldn't have sealed it
if he wanted me to see what's inside.

555
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:28,819
Hey, I got you something.

556
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:31,452
Fixed your turntable.

557
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:37,007
I'd tell you to keep it out of the lab
this time, but I know you won't.

558
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:38,278
Thank you, Peter.

559
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:40,921
I thought maybe you'd like
some music to cheer you up.

560
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,625
Walter, I know that you've been
in a funk for the last couple of weeks.

561
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,466
If there's something you want
to talk to me about...

562
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,278
Something was weighing on me,

563
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,247
a decision, but...

564
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:01,082
I'm fine.

565
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,020
I'm gonna go hit the hay.
