2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:04,295
A storm is coming,
and when it is over,

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,489
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

4
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:09,037
They are looking for someone,

5
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:11,719
someone to open the door
between universes.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,674
Laston-Hennings Cryonics was hit.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,062
They took everything.
All the cryo-capsules are gone.

8
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:17,810
They found who they were looking for.

9
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,895
Remember this symbol.
It's hidden on their leader.

10
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,522
That's how you'll know him.
And if they find him,

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,692
there will be no stopping them,
and that is why you must find him first.

12
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,675
A girl in a red dress...

13
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,186
flowers in her hair.

14
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:45,916
What kind of flowers?

15
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,236
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,348
Thank you, Mr. Slater.

17
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:52,907
It will come.

18
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,246
Heather...

19
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,813
The flowers in her hair.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,568
The flowers in her hair are Heather.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,112
I think so. Yes.

22
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:16,714
Container.

23
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,201
Now hold very still.

24
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,937
I assure you there will be no pain.

25
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,542
Let's close him up.

26
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,884
Hold on.

27
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:49,650
We've got activity.

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,498
Code gray, corridor B.

29
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:11,319
We have two minutes, maybe three.

30
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:13,978
My sincere apologies.

31
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,208
I'd rather not leave you
in such a state.

32
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,477
Mr. Slater?

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,802

Special agent Olivia Dunham
with the FBI.

40
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,534
These two men are consultants...
Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop.

41
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,469
We're here to investigate
the break-in.

42
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,409
And you're Dr. Bishop?

43
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,372
And I'm perfectly sane.

44
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:36,793
Joseph Slater has been a patient here
for the last 14 years.

45
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,885
When he was admitted, he was diagnosed
with acute paranoid schizophrenia.

46
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,126
His file said that
he suffered from delusions,

47
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,265
false memories,
severe emotional swings.

48
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,434
Every symptom of the condition,
he exhibited each one.

49
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,520
- Until last night.
- That's right.

50
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:52,769
And within an hour, after discovering
what had been done to Mr. Slater,

51
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:55,234
the change in his behavior
is nothing short of remarkable.

52
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,736
So basically, two guys broke in,

53
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,281
cut a big hole in his head
and did what, drove him sane?

54
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,610
As unlikely as it sounds, yes.

55
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:06,161
And just as strange, we can't find
evidence that they did anything to him.

56
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,269
Mr. Slater's brain
is structurally intact.

57
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,667
We ran blood tests, tox screens...

58
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,301
nothing came back unusual.

59
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,045
We'll need to see
his medical reports.

60
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:17,675
- And also his personal history.
- Of course.

61
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,736
Doctor, I'd like to see the patient.

62
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:28,156
That's where we're going right now,
to see Mr. Slater.

63
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:30,936
No, Peter, we're going to see
a sane man.

64
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:34,016
I'd like to see him
when he was a patient.

<i>The girl in the red dress...</i>

66

<i>Her mother grows them in a box

68
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,827
<i>And where does
this little girl live?</i>

69
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,510
<i>Across the street.</i>

70
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,512
<i>No, Joseph, she doesn't.</i>

71
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:56,812
<i>She moved.</i>

72
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,608
<i>She was never there.</i>

73
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,616
<i>What did you do with her?</i>

74
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,803
<i>What did you do?
What did you do with her?</i>

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,813
<i>You give her back.
Give her back!</i>

76
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,633
<i>Bring her back!
Bring her back!</i>

77
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,751
And you can't describe
either of the men?

78
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,391
No. To be honest,
I can barely remember them.

79
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,487
My first clear memory of last night,
I was turning from my window,

80
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,392
and miss Holbrook was standing there...
One of the nurses, she was scared.

81
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,292
And they raced me
to the medical ward.

82
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:30,558
But what struck me...
was that I felt unburdened,

83
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,851
like my mind had had
a spring cleaning,

84
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,776
- like I was suddenly...
- Free.

85
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,575
And I seem to remember them being...

86
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,708
pleasant, polite even...
But beyond that, nothing. I'm sorry.

87
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,807
That's okay.

88
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,100
Anything else?

89
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,068
Not right now.

90
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:54,077
Thank you.

91
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:55,593
Okay, in that case,

92
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,728
Mr. Slater, your wife is here.

93
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:00,070
They tell me that she came
to visit me twice a week.

94
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,064
I think I remember
being horrible to her.

95
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,904
I think it'll be fine.

96
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,418
She's right outside.

97
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:08,242
Thank you.

98
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,720
He's a lucky man.

99
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:21,927
17 years that I was in St. Claire's,
never a single visitor.

100
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:29,884
I wasn't trying
to make you feel guilty, son.

101
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,517
It was just an observation.

102
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,190
Have you had any theories
on how this man is suddenly sane?

103
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:43,464
Not yet, but I'm eager to.

104
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,562
A remedy for insanity,
as you can imagine,

105
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,884
I have thought long
and hard about it.

106
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,616
There they are.

107
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,819
You see that lock?

108
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,514
Can you zoom in right there?

109
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,757
That's a lypticro-crypto.

110
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,260
It's top of the line. And these guys
took it down like it's a bicycle lock.

111
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,888
Whoever these guys are,
they're either very smart,

112
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,307
very rich, or very well-connected.

113
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,935
Can you play that bit back?

114
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,615
What?

115
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,695
Freeze it right there,
when he turns around.

116
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,486
I know that face.

117
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,320
Can I use this?

118
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,822
And some privacy, if you don't mind.

119
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:37,817
You know him?

120
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,054
Where do you know him from?

121
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,208
From Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

122
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:48,801
Are you referring to the theft
of the frozen heads?

123
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,473
William Bell told me
that the people from over there,

124
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,806
the people that tried to kill me,
that killed Charlie,

125
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,891
they were looking for someone.

126
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,621
They were looking for their leader.

127
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,521
I've been combing through
Laston-Hennings' files,

128
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,773
trying to figure out,
of all the heads they took,

129
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,747
which was the one that they wanted?

130
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,821
I've been looking at these faces
for the last two months.

131
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,949
Are you really trying to tell us that he
is one of the heads that they stole?

132
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,725
Fine. Let's say for a second
that you're right.

133
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,080
Frozen heads don't just get up
and walk into places.

134
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,209
The dead don't rise out of their graves
and perform midnight brain surgery.

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,419
No. I know they don't.

136
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:27,778
But this one did.

137
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,885
"Thomas Jerome Newton."

138
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,977
So what do we know about him so far?

139
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:47,902
Besides his name, nothing.

140
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,655
Thomas Jerome Newton was the name
on record at Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

141
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,383
But it was an alias.
It led nowhere.

142
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,744
William Bell told me the man
with that marking would try to

143
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:01,911
open a corridor
from our universe to the other side.

144
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:06,003
I managed to infer that the results
would be less than desirable.

145
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,271
Exactly how much less desirable?

146
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:10,061
Global destruction...

147
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,092
biblical proportions.

148
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,934
So what's that have to do
with sneaking into a mental hospital

149
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,016
to perform brain surgery
on a schizophrenic?

150
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,658
You're leaving out the part
where they apparently cured him.

151
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:24,143
As opening moves go,
that one's pretty strange.

152
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,690
Where's Dr. Bishop on this?

153
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,256
He's trying to figure out
exactly how they cured Slater.

154
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:32,179
If he can do that, maybe we can
anticipate Newton's next move.

155
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,607
There's no maybe.

156
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:36,444
I don't know what Newton's up to
but I know what I have to do.

157
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,068
I have to stop him.

158
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,625
Mr. Slater's referring doctor

159
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,482
was a psychiatrist
called Simon Paris.

160
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:48,032
Let's see if you could locate
Dr. Paris, please, dear.

161
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,088
I have some questions about

162
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,664
Mr. Slater's medical history
before his admission to Hennington.

163
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:56,043
Sure. Why, what are you looking for?

164
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,221
Not sure.

165
00:09:57,902 --> 00:10:00,474
Something that would induce
the delusional thinking.

166
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:01,897
Some thing?

167
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,793
Something or someone.

168
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:08,477
You mean you think that someone
made him crazy on purpose?

169
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,074
It's a theory.

170
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:15,689
The truth is there is no cure
for madness. It's a fantasy.

171
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:19,596
The road back from madness
is a struggle.

172
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,403
Only the luckiest of people

173
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,415
find their way, more or less,
back to the world

174
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,583
you live in.

175
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:29,858
And from what we saw of Mr. Slater,

176
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:34,675
well, my only supposition
is that he wasn't mad to begin with.

177
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,303
There is no Simon Paris
in the AMA database.

178
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,671
He's not on the membership roster.

179
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,222
- Does that mean that he died?
- It shouldn't.

180
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,825
Even if he had,
there should still be a record.

181
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,899
Mr. Paris' RX number will be
on Mr. Slater's initial prescription

182
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,024
when he was admitted.
Check the pharmacy records.

183
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,364
Why would someone do that, Walter...
make someone crazy?

184
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,253
Any number of reasons. It would make
them insusceptible to interrogation.

185
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:03,203
According to this, 14 years ago,

186
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:07,124
Dr. Paris set up an indefinite
prescription of medications

187
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,542
for Mr. Slater.

188
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,375
No termination date.

189
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,547
This is interesting.
In the same week,

190
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,675
he wrote the same prescription
for two other patients.

191
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:18,176
In the same week?

192
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,920
At two other hospitals.

193
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,395
I'll call Olivia.

194
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,469
And when I woke up,
I felt like I had been

195
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:29,594
out drinking the night before.

196
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,643
Only the night lasted 14 years.

197
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,799
It says here that you suffered
from a severe form of

198
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,924
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

199
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,260
"Arithmomania" they call it.

200
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,456
You're obsessed with numbers.

201
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,215
Just one, actually...

202
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
28.

203
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,716
I'd see it everywhere,
hear it everywhere.

204
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:51,128
I could never get it out
of my head. 28, 28.

205
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,295
Then... last tuesday morning,
I woke up, and

206
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,320
it was gone, just like that.

207
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,031
Suddenly I was free.

208
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,277
Your doctors have no explanation?

209
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,679
Between you and me,

210
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,078
I think that's why
they're keeping me here.

211
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:08,010
One of them is probably hoping
to get a paper out of it.

212
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,103
So what does this have to do
with the FBI?

213
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,357
We're not sure.

214
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,092
Maybe nothing.

215
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:17,652
Do you mind if we take
a look at your head?

216
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,113
- My head?
- It should only take a minute.

217
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:23,395
Is there somewhere
that you could sit down?

218
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:30,767
Excuse me.

219
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,046
What are you looking for?

220
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:39,976
It's here.

221
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,678
A fresh scar,
but there are no sutures.

222
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,765
Looks more like the burn
from a surgical laser.

223
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,934
I don't understand.

224
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:50,685
What kind of scar?

225
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,771
What are you saying happened to me?

226
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,113
Did you have any visitors
during your stay here?

227
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:57,688
My husband, my son.

228
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,321
What about the doctor
who referred you... Dr. Paris?

229
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,616
Never. I only saw him a couple times
before he sent me here.

230
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,786
But it was Dr. Paris who diagnosed
the arithmomania, right?

231
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,826
He saw me
for mild depression, postpartum.

232
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,418
Told me I needed to rest
a few weeks and sent me here.

233
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,882
The arithmomania
just started one day.

234
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,561
- How we doing?
- It should work,

235
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,395
but we took too long getting to Slater.
The first specimen's dying.

236
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,505
The nutrient bath won't keep it alive
for more than another five hours,

237
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,526
- six if we're lucky.
- Then we better get moving.

238
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,400
Third patient, Stuart Gordon.

239
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,033
Just like Mrs. Crampton.

240
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:58,853
14 years ago, Dr. Paris
refers him to a mental hospital

241
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:00,922
with the psychiatric equivalent
of a cough,

242
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,575
which then develops
into full-blown schizophrenia.

243
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,845
Two days ago,
he miraculously recovers.

244
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,311
Apparently Mr. Gordon thought
he was the actor Sydney Greenstreet

245
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:12,836
and walked around
quoting <i>Casablanca</i>.

246
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,385
That's funny.

247
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,049
What?

248
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,817
He looks a lot more
like Peter Lorre.

249
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,088
That's a joke.

250
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,210
You know, all my life I've been able
to understand what drives people...

251
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,457
Their emotions, like greed
or envy or revenge. But...

252
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,582
Newton...

253
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,207
These people we're up against...

254
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:41,247
How can I fight
what I can't understand?

255
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,584
I know you think
you're alone in this.

256
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,927
Maybe that's because
of what Bell told you.

257
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,179
Maybe that's just your personality.

258
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,306
But this isn't just your fight.

259
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:00,941
That was Olivia.

260
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:05,195
Stuart Gordon is just like the others.
Two days ago, he woke up perfectly sane.

261
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,223
He's got a fresh scar
on the back of his head.

262
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:10,298
I must have missed something.

263
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,223
When did Mr. Slater
have an organ transplant?

264
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,667
I'm sorry?

265
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,177
One of the drugs
that Dr. Paris prescribed

266
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,270
is sirolimus...
It's an anti-rejection drug.

267
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,519
It's only given to
organ-transplant patients.

268
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:24,839
It's absolutely useless
for a paranoid schizophrenic.

269
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,110
It suggests that not only
has Dr. Paris vanished,

270
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:30,385
he's a quack!

271
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:36,518
Unless he's a genius.

272
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,811
What?

273
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,269
Organ transplants.

274
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,829
The human brain.

275
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,084
Well, half of one.

276
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,269
But it's useless dead,

277
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,761
Because when you remove
brain tissue from a living body,

278
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,652
you can keep it alive
for a short time

279
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:57,268
in a nutrient suspension.
But eventually it will die.

280
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:59,944
It's a problem I've tried to solve
many times without success.

281
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,795
- Keeping a human brain alive?
- It's very tricky.

282
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
You see,

283
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
it's not enough to simply
give it blood and oxygen.

284
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,176
You have to give it electrical
stimulation as well. But...

285
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,596
Dr. Paris found a solution.

286
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,117
He stored...

287
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:15,849
the brain tissue

288
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,434
inside of another brain.

289
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,853
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
What brain tissue?

290
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,605
Our mental patients'.

291
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,190
Mr. Slater, Mrs. Crampton,
and Mr. Condon.

292
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,358
Gordon.

293
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,577
These are a few years old.

294
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,540
But you see the slight
discoloration here?

295
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,097
Normally that would be
interpreted as machine error.

296
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,076
But this is not a machine error.

297
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,632
This is foreign tissue.

298
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:40,165
That's why they were all
on anti-rejection drugs.

299
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,626
So the surgeries
that Newton performed...

300
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,775
He was removing
transplanted brain tissue.

301
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,310
And my hypothesis explains
the patients' madness.

302
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:52,185
Putting the tissue of one person
into the brain of another is...

303
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,708
It's like putting a motorcycle engine
into a car. It's simply incompatible.

304
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,051
Of course, because the host mind
would have no way

305
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,944
to process the new information.
Thus, the mental distress.

306
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:05,858
The false memories, delusions. But as
soon as you remove the foreign tissue,

307
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,316
- then they're fine.
- Correct.

308
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:12,947
<i>Hi, this is doctor West.</i>

309
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,128
You asked me to see
if we had any information

310
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:17,452
on Dr. Paris at our facility...
we didn't.

311
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,372
- All right. Well, thank you for...
- <i>I'm not finished.</i>

312
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,916
We also checked with some
of our affiliated facilities.

313
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,590
That just leaves more questions.

314
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,477
Why cut out someone's brain and
store it inside other people?

315
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:32,467
- And whose brain is it?
- That's a good question, of course.

316
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,296
And I have no idea.

317
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:36,674
Can I... speak to you a moment?

318
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:52,529
You said that you never had any visitors
in your time at St. Claire's, right?

319
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,612
That's right.

320
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,993
According to their records, Dr. Paris
visited you on six separate occasions.

321
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:08,072
You mind if I take a look
at your head?

322
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,904
It's there.

323
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,481
It's different.
It's older. But...

324
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,402
It's definitly like a scar.

325
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:44,181
I can see from your chart that you've
been through this procedure before,

326
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,956
several times, in fact.

327
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,511
This is not a good idea, Peter.

328
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,340
These MRI machines have magnets
that rip the metal

329
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,428
out of the patients. And I have that
tracking chip implanted in my neck...

330
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,046
the GPS locator.

331
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,688
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about,

332
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,641
because it's made out of silicon.

333
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,975
And you know as well as I do that
it won't be affected by the machine.

334
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,431
Maybe some valium would help.

335
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,527
I don't do valium nearly enough.

336
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:17,906
That's a good idea.
I'll have 50 milligrams, please.

337
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,492
Well... that's quite a high dosage.

338
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
I have quite a high tolerance.

339
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:24,981
All right.

340
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,484
You're going to be fine.

341
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,833
It's a routine procedure.

342
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,673
And the valium will take care of
any claustrophobia you might be feeling.

343
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,134
I'm not worreid about
claustrophobia, Peter.

344
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:42,772
What do you think
that man did to me?

345
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,930
I don't know, Walter.

346
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,523
But we're going to find out, okay?

347
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,215
You okay?

348
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,780
Walter wanted to stick around
and wait for the results,

349
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:30,949
but there's Walter on drugs,
and then there's Walter on drugs.

350
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,924
I had Astrid take him home.

351
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:40,780
You see the look on his face
when we were talking to Mr. Slater?

352
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,539
What do you think
that's like for him...

353
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,840
wishing that he could turn back
the clock to before he went crazy?

354
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,319
He's just sane enough
to realize how much he's lost.

355
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,607
I don't mean to sound callous but...

356
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:03,546
from what I know of your father,

357
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:06,264
going crazy made him
a better person.

358
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:09,378
It certainly made him
a better father.

359
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:17,151
I should have visited him
in St. Claire's.

360
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,522
I think you're making up
for that now.

361
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:31,409
I've reviewed the scans
of your father's brain.

362
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,684
- And?
- You should take a look.

363
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:35,793
I've never seen anything like it.

364
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:39,642
Three scars, all on the same side
in the left temporal lobe.

365
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:42,467
These incisions go all the way down
into the gray matter.

366
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,801
I'm not following.

367
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,496
Walter didn't have brain tissue
implanted. He had it removed.

368
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:49,618
Yes, from the hippocampus. And as far
as I can tell, there would be

369
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,112
- no medical reason for it.
- So what does it do, the hippocampus?

370
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:56,324
It controls our inhibitions,
helps store long-term memory,

371
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,480
contributes to our sense
of spatial awareness.

372
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:01,277
Do you have the scans
of the other three patients?

373
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:05,127
- What are you thinking?
- Hold on one second.

374
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,527
This is the piece
they put in Slater.

375
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,730
Look...

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,450
It's a perfect fit.

377
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,212
I took too much valium.

378
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:30,877
Confusion, dizziness, nausea.

379
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:35,332
I think I must have
miscalculated the dose.

380
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:38,491
Maybe we should take you
to a hospital, Walter.

381
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,354
I don't want to go to a hospital.

382
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,509
I need Violet Sedan Chair.

383
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,079
Walter, you're not making any sense.

384
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:57,398
My dear, Violet Sedan Chair,
it's a band.

385
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,777
Their debut album...

386
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,089
always helps me come down
from a valium high.

387
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,677
It's in the lab.
We should go...

388
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:13,688
No, you...
You do the driving.

389
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,666
I might puke in your car.

390
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:22,022
Why don't you stay here and rest
and let me get it?

391
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,284
- That might be the best.
- I'll be back.

392
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,705
It must be Paris.

393
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,250
He must have removed
pieces of Walter's brain. But why?

394
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,127
And why preserve them?

395
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,359
Memory.

396
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,885
The hippocampus... Memory storage.
Bell told you that Newton wants to open

397
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,053
a door to the other side, right?
We already know that Walter's done that.

398
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,183
He just can't remember how.
That is why he can't remember.

399
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,644
He literally had
the memories removed.

400
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,063
No way.

401
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:04,192
- So then how does Newton read them?
- In theory, he shouldn't be able to.

402
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,445
But in theory, he should
still be a frozen head.

403
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,161
So in the department of how
to make impossible things possible,

404
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:11,736
what would he need to do?
He would need to...

405
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:15,787
implant the memories into a brain
that could interpret them.

406
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,505
- Where are you and Walter?
- <i>I'm going to the lab.</i>

407
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,174
He's at your house.
He sent me to get him an album.

408
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,342
- How long ago?
- <i>Five minutes ago.</i>

409
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,970
You've got to get back there.
Walter is in danger.

410
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,338
I'm on my way.

411
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,768
Calm down, agent Farnsworth.

412
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:46,146
You don't have to wake
the whole neighborhood.

413
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,549
He was already gone when I got here.

414
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:13,108
I'm sorry.
Peter, I shouldn't have left him.

415
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,501
It's not your fault.
You didn't know.

416
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,266
I got an idea.

417
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:22,016
Last week when Walter got lost, he did
exactly what you'd expect Walter to do.

418
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:24,140
He implanted a transponder chip
into his neck

419
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:27,115
so that if he ever got lost,
I could find him.

420
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:29,481
He can't be far.
Let's go.

421
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,099
Hold still, please.

422
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,801
This wont hurt a bit.

423
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,355
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

424
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
We will.

425
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,543
This is a mild sedative,

426
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,023
something to calm your nerves.

427
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:51,215
I've already had
50 milligrams of valium.

428
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,801
Then this should be very enjoyable.

429
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,186
<i>Dunham, what's your 20?</i>

430
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,693
We're two blocks south
of the Boylston T stop.

431
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:08,030
Boston PD is sending an entry
and apprehension unit.

432
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:10,228
I'm sending them to your location.

433
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:13,029
Keep going. Keep going,
and take the next left you see.

434
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,346
The human brain
is a fascinating organ.

435
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,047
But it's not static.
Removal will damage a section.

436
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:28,294
It reroutes the connections
and grows in new pathways.

437
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:32,890
Now, figuring out where the old
connections once were can be

438
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:34,115
very tricky.

439
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,386
Take the next left.

440
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,991
Here. He's down here!

441
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,816
Go, go, go!
Move, move!

442
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,346
They found the chip.

443
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,108
I'm going to show you a series
of photos. When you see an image,

444
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,042
I want you to tell me
the first thing that comes to mind.

445
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,737
There are no right
or wrong answers. But...

446
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,490
please tell me the truth.

447
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,807
If you don't,

448
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,410
I'll know.

449
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:45,994
You're using associations to

450
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,289
map my brain function,

451
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,888
locate my neural pathways.

452
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:57,402
Are you trying to fix me?

453
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:00,169
I'm afraid not.

454
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:08,561
Tell me what you think
when you see this.

455
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:11,691
My first semester of organic chem.

456
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,944
My lab partner and I
used to sit up in the back,

457
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,196
sniffing benzine fumes.

458
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,521
I'm sorry. I know this is difficult.

459
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:52,951
It's not working.

460
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:55,099
He's not making the connections.

461
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,234
Should I recalibrate the machine?

462
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,404
We need to find something more
powerful to stimulate his memory.

463
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,045
Of course.
Human memory is sensory based.

464
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,662
Vision alone is not
the strongest trigger. Sound...

465
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,999
and smell actually work better.

466
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:14,225
We need...

467
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,362
a proper context.

468
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,382
Walter said
brain tissue can't survive

469
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,387
- for long outside a human body.
- Which means they've got to be close.

470
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:29,552
We've raised the alert level at every
hospital, emergency care facility and

471
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:32,877
outpatient clinic in the greater Boston
area. We're even calling veterinarians.

472
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,762
That's assuming that they need
a hospital to complete the procedure.

473
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,127
With their level of technology,
we can't know for sure.

474
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,733
It's a start and if we're wrong,
we'll have to get creative.

475
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:42,658
The girl in the red dress.

476
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,747
How did I miss this?
The girl in the red dress,

477
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,743
28, 28, Sydney Greenstreet.

478
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,538
Dr. Paris' patients,
they all had obsessions.

479
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,848
Slater was always ranting about
the girl who lived across the street,

480
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:56,467
the one that we thought never existed.
She did exist.

481
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,512
She lived across the street from me
when I lived in Cambridge as a kid.

482
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:02,091
Her name was Sydney.
She lived at 2828 Green Street.

483
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,294
- So those were Walter's memories.
- Exactly. Memory is all about...

484
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:08,512
It's all about context, all about
association. Every time Walter asks for

485
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:11,283
a piece of food or music or art,
he's trying to recreate a moment

486
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:13,686
- in time to help him remember.
- Which suggests what?

487
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,447
I don't know. I don't know. But if
they're trying to get him to remember

488
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,156
how it was that he built a door
to the other side, maybe...

489
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:22,655
Maybe they're gonna take him
to the place that he did it.

490
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,280
Reiden Lake... The lake house.

491
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:28,203
That's where he actually opened the door
but it's not where he had the thought.

492
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:31,829
This place looks familiar.

493
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,270
Last time I was here,
it was a different season.

494
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:38,584
The leaves were falling.

495
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,838
Yes, this place exists
in both worlds.

496
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,328
You see, but on my side,

497
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,099
the trees died long ago.

498
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,284
And the same thing killed the grass.

499
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:48,721
They call it the Blight.

500
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:50,988
That's terrible.

501
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,474
It is, isn't it?

502
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,797
Smith is on lookout, and
I've taken care of everything else.

503
00:30:55,922 --> 00:30:57,814
- You're secured.
- Good.

504
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,944
Now, Dr. Bishop,

505
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,363
I can see which areas
of your brain can make sense

506
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,701
of the data that's stored
in these slivers of flesh.

507
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:12,995
In a perfect world,

508
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,719
I would simply put it back,

509
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:17,833
but I would never subject you
to a process so crude.

510
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,471
But this is the only way

511
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:22,880
we can reconnect
these pieces of your brain.

512
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:30,497
- The connection is complete.
- Now, Dr. Bishop...

513
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,766
you do know where you are,
don't you?

514
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,033
Of course I do.

515
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,363
This is my home.

516
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,943
- It's working.
- Where's my wife?

517
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,832
Where's my son?

518
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,690
You drugged me.

519
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,365
Yes. And now...

520
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,566
I have a question for you.

521
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,672
You once built a door.

522
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:06,910
A door that let you walk
between worlds.

523
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,559
Tell me how you did it.

524
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,767
How are things on your side?

525
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:18,913
Worse, I'm told.

526
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:23,191
I know why you built it, the door.

527
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:27,144
I know what you lost.

528
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:31,365
Now, are you going to pretend that
you're willing to lose him again?

529
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,411
Now,...

530
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,033
tell me...

531
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:39,246
about the door.

532
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:00,144
We got company.

533
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,478
They're here.

534
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,522
That's okay.
We're done.

535
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,606
We've got what we need.

536
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,220
My apologies, Dr. Bishop.

537
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,333
Can you hear me?

538
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,320
Walter, can you hear me?

539
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,033
Hello, son.

540
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,037
Would you help me?

541
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:10,297
It's okay.

542
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,216
I'm... I'm with the FBI.

543
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:14,761
They just left.
Out the back!

544
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,676
Freeze! FBI!

545
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,243
Come out of there.

546
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,118
Okay, step down slowly.

547
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,885
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

548
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,166
You so much as twitch,

549
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,888
and you won't have
a head left to refreeze.

550
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,538
Are they mine?

551
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:34,739
My brain tissue, Peter...

552
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:36,707
it's dying.

553
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:39,355
Whatever was in there...

554
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:43,914
memories I'll never get back.

555
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,514
It's all right.
You don't need them.

556
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:51,873
Hello, son.

557
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:00,654
Hello, son.

558
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,226
Look at me.

559
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,709
I think there's something
you should know.

560
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,504
It's about Walter Bishop.

561
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,867
He's going to die unless
you do exactly what I say.

562
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,824
I injected him with a neurotoxin,

563
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,934
and unless he gets
the antidote in four minutes,

564
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,285
it will kill him.

565
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:26,402
Call it my fail-safe
to ensure my escape.

566
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:27,860
You're bluffing.

567
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:34,308
It's me.

568
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,957
They've done something to Walter.
I don't know what it is, but

569
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:39,321
I think maybe he's been poisoned.
His pulse is racing.

570
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,767
What did you do to him?

571
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:42,866
Ask him if he sees
a medical kit I left behind.

572
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,691
You've got to get back here.

573
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:46,922
Please! Please.
I need your help.

574
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,919
Listen to me.
Do you see a medical kit?

575
00:36:49,044 --> 00:36:50,874
Yeah, there's one here
on the table. Why?

576
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,584
There are three vials in the kit.

577
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,498
Injected in the correct order,
they neutralize the toxin.

578
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,688
Tell me.

579
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,210
Not yet.

580
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,760
You have about two minutes
until Dr. Bishop dies.

581
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:05,601
At a flat run, I estimate
about 40 seconds

582
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,392
until you get back to him.
Now, hand me your phone.

583
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,319
When I hear you go back into
the house, from Peter's phone,

584
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:12,855
I'll tell you what to do.

585
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,323
You're crazy if you think
I'm letting you go.

586
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,860
<i>Please, I need your help.</i>
I think he's dying.

587
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:23,323
The choice is yours.

588
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,347
You can have me...

589
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:27,379
or Walter Bishop.

590
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:36,089
One minute, forty-five seconds.
Come on, Olivia.

591
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,435
<i>Please, you got to get back here.
I need your help.</i>

592
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,832
Make your choice...

593
00:37:40,378 --> 00:37:42,710
Me or Walter Bishop.

594
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,614
Go to hell.

595
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,768
Give me your phone!

596
00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:11,179
Okay, you son of a bitch.

597
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,116
<i>Do you have the medical kit?</i>

598
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,517
Got it.
Okay, tell me how to do this.

599
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,629
Blue, yellow, red.

600
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,674
Blue, yellow, red.

601
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,331
Now I know how weak you are.

602
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,751
I have a terrible headache...

603
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:14,955
and a sudden craving
for chicken wings.

604
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:31,089
He was right.
I made an emotional choice.

605
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,891
I chose my friend
over my responsibility.

606
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,986
And we have no idea
if Walter gave Newton

607
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,719
the plans for the door.
Walter doesn't remember,

608
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,319
and the brain tissue
that Newton extracted is dead.

609
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:44,585
- And Dr. Paris?
- Nothing. He's vanished.

610
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,479
So all we have is more questions.

611
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:48,035
I mean, who is Paris?

612
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,208
How did Newton know
about Walter's memories?

613
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,937
And why did they let Walter live?

614
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,138
I suspect that's the way
this is going to be.

615
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:56,785
The more answers we get, the
more questions they'll lead to.

616
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,518
- We didn't get any answers.
- Sure we did.

617
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:02,797
We've given our enemy
a name and a face.

618
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:03,988
That's something.

619
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,889
And you saved Dr. Bishop's life.
That's something too,

620
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:10,032
because despite what you think,

621
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,555
you made a rational choice,
not an emotional one.

622
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,785
If you had captured Newton
or even killed him,

623
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,788
that wouldn't have been
the end of this.

624
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,194
But there's only one
Walter Bishop...

625
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:23,770
and we'll be needing him
before this is over.

626
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:28,134
Don't be so hard on yourself.

627
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,737
We're gonna be needing you too.

628
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,752
They just want to make sure
that everything's okay.

629
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:48,828
I know.

630
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,872
I should have visited you, Walter,

631
00:40:57,982 --> 00:40:59,885
while you were in St. Claire's.

632
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,909
That's okay, Peter.

633
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,466
If you had, I probably
wouldn't have remembered anyway.

634
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:17,307
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

635
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:48,718
He's ready, Dr. Paris.

636
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:51,022
His system is completely clean?

637
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,700
No sedatives,

638
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:55,113
no antidepressants?

639
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:57,967
- The electrodes are in place.
- Good.

640
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,253
Are you comfortable?

641
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,186
Comfortable?

642
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:16,408
I'm frightened, Belly.

643
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,137
I wish there was another way.

644
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:22,622
But what you've accomplished...

645
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,792
it's just too dangerous.

646
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:29,902
But what if we ever have to go back?

647
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:31,763
Don't worry.

648
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:33,133
Your memory...

649
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:36,200
I'll put it in a place
that only I can find.

650
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:40,154
Now, listen to me, Walter.

651
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:43,369
You designed a door

652
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,090
to the other side.

653
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,449
I want you to think about that door.
