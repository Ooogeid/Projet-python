<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,935
When objects from the other universe

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,048
cross to our side,
they have an energy.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,551
- Someone described it as a glimmer.
- How can I see it?

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,969
The cortexiphan trials.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,055
I was part of the trials
when I was a kid.

7
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,390
It was a highly experimental drug.

8
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:20,561
It might enhance certain abilities
in predisposed children.

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,520
I've never met anyone
who can do the things that you do.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,900
I'll go get my coat.

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,850
Please don't tell him.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,582
You sure you don't want some soup?
Tea or coffee? To warm you up?

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,832
No, thank you.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,025
I have trouble
keeping anything down.

15
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,005
Your office told me
how busy you are.

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,966
I really appreciate you coming.

17
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,656
I'm sorry.
I keep trying to remember you.

18
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,097
I understand.

19
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,500
It was a long time ago.
We were just kids.

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,584
So is that when you think
you were exposed to something?

21
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:07,307
I've seen about
a half dozen doctors,

22
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,532
specialists.

23
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,723
They think it's the only explanation
that makes sense.

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,685
Maybe I can help you.

25
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:18,786
Look, I'm grateful

26
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,039
you're doing this,
but that's not why I asked to see you.

27
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:26,202
- I wasn't looking to make money.
- Of course. I understand.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,506
But if someone's responsible
for your illness,

29
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,247
- my firm can absolutely help...
- The last doctor I saw,

30
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:33,942
he suggested that

31
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,978
if I could find some of the other kids
we went to school with...

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,682
If some of them
have the same symptoms,

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,768
it might help him identify
what it is that's making me sick.

34
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,060
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,857
I really don't remember names.

36
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,768
It's so long ago.

37
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:52,494
You know what?

38
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:56,782
I do remember one boy.

39
00:01:58,738 --> 00:01:59,577
Lloyd...

40
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,419
Lloyd Becker.

41
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:03,998
He made me eat a bug
on the playground.

42
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,223
I remember him.

43
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:08,335
Lloyd Becker?

44
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,630
Sounds like a budding sociopath.

45
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:13,758
Yeah, right?

46
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,357
I really appreciate
you helping me out.

47
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,184
Neil Wilson.

48
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,231
Could you make an appointment with that
oncologist over at Rhode Island General?

49
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,177
- The one who always calls me "honey."
- <i>Was it Gorski?</i>

50
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,228
- Gorlami...
- Dr. Gorlitsky?

51
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,237
That's right.

52
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,691
- I'll call him right now.
- All right, thanks.

53
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,201
I should be back in 20 minutes.
Bye.

54
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,322
Come on!

55
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,163
Hey, what's going on in there?

56
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:27,593
Miss.

57
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,156
You okay?

58
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,184
Help me.

Hello?

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,053
Is that you, Dunham?

66
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,473
I thought you'd quit bowling,
took up another sport.

67
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,517
It's been a while.

68
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,395
I see you're still not sleeping.

69
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,674
Not so much. No.

70
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,774
Can you pass me a nut?

71
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,177
Yeah, sure.

72
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:39,778
Which one?

73
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,405
Dealer's choice.

74
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,245
Perfect.

75
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,084
What's on your mind?

76
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,631
Well...

77
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,313
After my car accident,
you said that...

78
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,636
I would experience things.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I have.

80
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,941
You want a beer?

81
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,421
It's 6:30 in the morning.

82
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:23,362
When you've been up all night,

83
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:25,737
time is just a matter of semantics.

84
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:28,136
Thanks.

85
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:31,322
So I suppose you're here
to find out what happens next.

86
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,261
Suppose I am.

87
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,927
I can't tell ya.

88
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:39,296
You have officially gone
beyond my field of expertise.

89
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,866
But I believe I can tell you
why you're not sleeping.

90
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,427
And it has nothing to do
with your accident.

91
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:49,788
You're a cop.

92
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:54,406
You must make a dozen decisions a day,
many of them life and death.

93
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,513
One of them you're not happy about.

94
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:00,118
You think you did the wrong thing.

95
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,067
I'm right, aren't I?

96
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,646
But it wasn't the job.

97
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:13,546
Not exactly.

98
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,176
I agreed to keep a secret.

99
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:19,883
A secret.

100
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,985
I'm on my way.

101
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:35,394
It's a good thing
you didn't take the beer.

102
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,005
I'll see you later.

103
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,467
You're a good person.

104
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:46,071
One of the few I know.

105
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,712
If you agreed to keep this secret,
I'm sure you had a good reason.

106
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,754
Killington?
As in skiing?

107
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,649
They just had a fresh snowfall.

108
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:07,227
I had no idea you were a skier.

109
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,703
Oh, yes.

110
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,679
I was quite a hotdogger.

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,153
I remember
there was this secret trail.

112
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,444
They called it "the backside,"

113
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,392
but not for the reason
you would think.

114
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,086
It was a nude ski run.

115
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,915
By the time you got down to the bottom,
your testicles would be in your mouth.

116
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,996
I'm sure Agent Dunham
is very thankful for that image.

117
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,165
Walter's advocating
a father-son trip.

118
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,083
And I'm sure Agent Dunham
is not interested in that.

119
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:38,914
I understand that Agent Broyles
has a body for us to look at.

120
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,014
Her name is Miranda Greene.

121
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,494
30 years old, unmarried.
She was an attorney.

122
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,838
Lived here in providence.

123
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,212
EMTs responded to a 911 call
phoned in by a good samaritan.

124
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,600
She was dead
by the time they arrived.

125
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:53,658
Doctor.

126
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:55,891
This is Agent Olivia Dunham.

127
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,021
- This is Peter Bishop and Dr...
- Walter Bishop.

128
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:04,316
John Potash. I took your advanced
biochem seminar, Dr. Bishop.

129
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:06,975
I apologize.

130
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:10,602
I remember I was
a bit of a slave driver.

131
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:11,740
You were.

132
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,408
But also inspiring.

133
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,121
The truth is
I was considering changing majors,

134
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,293
but you encouraged me to stick
with it and become a doctor.

135
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,375
I never thought I'd get
a chance to thank you.

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,754
Your father is a great man.

137
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:27,765
Doctor,

138
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,883
which one is Miranda Greene?

139
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,421
Right this way.

140
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,014
I'm sorry.
This might be a bit unpleasant.

141
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,102
Epidermal blistering.

142
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,403
Tissue necrosis.

143
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,050
Symptomatic of cytotoxins.

144
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:48,944
Could you get a sample
of this pus please, Peter?

145
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,412
I always get the good jobs.

146
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:52,567
According to her coworkers,
when she left for lunch,

147
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,950
she was perfectly fine.
Any signs of illness.

148
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,614
That was about two hours
before the 911 call.

149
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,934
I was considering
that these are contact burns

150
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,880
from some sort
of synthetic chemical.

151
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,793
No, these aren't chemical burns.

152
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,132
They look more like
malignant tumors.

153
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:11,466
Cancer?

154
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,340
Sarcomas, to be exact.

155
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,679
But that kind of cancer

156
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,885
presents beneath the skin,
not on the surface.

157
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,974
Normally, yes.

158
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,070
- Do you have a black light?
- Yeah. Somewhere.

159
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,476
- What is it, Walter?
- I'm not sure.

160
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:29,010
Cancers always start

161
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,154
with a specific point of origin,

162
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,578
and they spread from there, so...

163
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:36,219
Here you go.

164
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,375
Agent Broyles, lights, please.

165
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,947
The cells near the point
of origin of the cancer

166
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,291
should show more progression,

167
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:49,546
and hence refract a different color.

168
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,339
Like that.

169
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,265
- It looks like...
- Fingers.

170
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:04,425
Indeed.
Right hand, I'd say.

171
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,973
Which indicates

172
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:09,877
not only what killed this woman,

173
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,236
but also who.

174
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,169
Of course, somehow
we'll need to retrieve a print.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,252
What you're suggesting
is impossible...

176
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,983
That someone touched this woman
and gave her cancer?

177
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,041
It seems you've forgotten
my very first lesson, Doctor.

178
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:29,207
When you open your mind
to the impossible,

179
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,757
sometimes you find the truth.

180
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,480
28 degrees fahrenheit,

181
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,392
and they're predicting snow
next week.

182
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,202
Hardly ideal beach weather.

183
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,170
Why are you going to Atlantic City?

184
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,257
I was thinking
of taking Peter there.

185
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:53,060
Used to love
saltwater taffy as a child.

186
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:55,627
So what are we looking for?

187
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,240
Why are we cutting off
this poor woman's arm?

188
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,675
The handprint shows

189
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,025
an extraordinary level
of cellular detail.

190
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,454
I'm hoping...

191
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,262
Hoping to be able
to remove the tumor, and...

192
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,222
bake the skin, and...

193
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:19,355
Hopefully identify a fingerprint.

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,389
And I'll need
two hot baths and an oven.

195
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,577
You really think someone may have
touched her and given her cancer?

196
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:28,541
Terrifying possibility,
but a possibility nonetheless.

197
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:33,485
We need glycerin,

198
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,907
corn starch and food coloring.

199
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
Food coloring?

200
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,498
Not for her, but since we're baking,
we may as well make some taffy.

201
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,462
I've worked with Miranda
for about seven years.

202
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:47,399
She was fairly private,
but if she was sick,

203
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:48,845
I think someone would know.

204
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,996
So what sort of cases did Miranda
usually work on, Mr. Messing?

205
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,796
Mostly toxic tort litigation.
Class action stuff.

206
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,793
Asbestos, lead poisoning.

207
00:11:57,185 --> 00:12:00,346
She had a real thing about protecting
those who couldn't protect themselves.

208
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,765
And is this what she was working on?

209
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,101
She was prepping a case
against Intrepus Pharmaceuticals.

210
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,772
Trial was supposed
to start next week.

211
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,025
How much money
was at stake in the trial?

212
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,860
North eight figures.

213
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:24,505
Wait, are you suggesting
that someone did this to her?

214
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,353
I thought she contracted
some kind of crazy disease.

215
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:29,414
we're not sure,
but we like to be thorough.

216
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,292
Can we take her files
on the Intrepus case?

217
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:34,218
Of course. Yeah.

218
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,605
Miss Greene had meetings
scheduled for yesterday.

219
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,131
Do you recognize those names?

220
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:41,134
First two are deposition prep.

221
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,720
I don't recognize the third one.

222
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:46,892
Neil Wilson.

223
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,983
She was supposed to meet him
about an hour before she died.

224
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,898
Do you really think that Intrepus
Pharmaceutical killed this woman?

225
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:57,234
Maybe. You don't?

226
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,039
I've never heard of a drug that can cause
what happened to Miranda Greene.

227
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,812
It seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through to kill somebody.

228
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,238
Why not just hire a hit man?

229
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,108
A hitman would draw
too much attention.

230
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:06,963
Really?

231
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,204
And spontaneous
fatal tumor-growth wouldn't?

232
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,957
I suppose you have a point.

233
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,370
You want to come on inside, we can
noodle on it? Maybe order a pizza?

234
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,285
Thanks, but, no.

235
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,028
I didn't get much sleep last night,
so I should probably head home.

236
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:29,960
Anyway, I'm not
really hungry, but...

237
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,477
- All right.
- Thank you.

238
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,392
Agent Dunham.

239
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,410
You're up early.

240
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,567
I ran Neil Wilson's number.

241
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:06,428
It's a disposable cell phone,
and it was deactivated yesterday.

242
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,917
It's a pretty common name.

243
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,891
I checked, and there's more than
50 Neil Wilsons in the tri-state area.

244
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,263
Do you want me to start
running them down?

245
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,488
I'm pretty sure he gave her
a fake name anyway, so...

246
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:20,609
Could you give
Walter and I a minute?

247
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:22,270
Sure.

248
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,862
Don't mix up the spoons.

249
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,745
Help me stir.

250
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:41,671
Walter, I have to tell him.
I got to tell Peter the truth.

251
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:47,552
- But that's not what we discussed.
- I know, and I'm sorry.

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,285
But he deserves to know the truth
about who he is.

253
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,849
No, you don't understand.

254
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:54,802
Things have never been
better between us.

255
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,316
I can't lose him again. I can't.

256
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,491
You won't.

257
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,148
Once he knows the whole story.

258
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,819
You saved his life.
I'm sure that he will understand.

259
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,137
No, he won't.

260
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,795
He will never forgive me.

261
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,170
I have to tell him.

262
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,737
If it was the other way around,
I would want him to tell me.

263
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:18,884
I'm begging you.
Not yet. Please.

264
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,503
Give me time to prepare.

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,506
Please.

266
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:33,970
Hey.

267
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:36,875
I didn't realize you were coming.
I would have got you one too.

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,065
Cappuccino.
Two squirts of peppermint.

269
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:42,774
And, Astrid,
tall, nonfat, double macchiato.

270
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,484
Just the way you like it.

271
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,608
Miranda Greene used her credit card
at a Downtown Providence cafe

272
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,351
about a half hour before she died.

273
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:55,385
Sounds like her meeting
with Neil Wilson.

274
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,540
Excellent. I'm up for a road trip.
How about you?

275
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,802
I remember her. Pretty lady.

276
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,376
Comes in here all the time.

277
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,598
- She's a lawyer, right?
- Yeah.

278
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,642
Do you remember if she was with anyone
the last time that she was here?

279
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,247
Some guy.

280
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,238
She was taking all sorts of notes.

281
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:23,534
What, does she sue doctors
or something?

282
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,616
- Excuse me?
- Well, the guy she was with,

283
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,654
he looked real pale and skinny.

284
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,195
Dark circles under his eyes.

285
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:31,573
- You think he was sick?
- I'd say pretty bad.

286
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,624
Looked my uncle did
when he was fighting cancer.

287
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,419
You thinking what I'm thinking?

288
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,291
Well, I'm thinking that
cancer isn't contagious.

289
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,652
It wouldn't be
the strangest thing we've seen.

290
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,240
But it would be close.

291
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:08,318
Getting ready for a triathlon?

292
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,515
Just trying to stay healthy.

293
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:18,505
You okay, sir?

294
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,880
Yeah, I just...

295
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,148
You need me to call for some help?

296
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,049
No, I'm fine.

297
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:50,588
Yes, I'm an old friend of Mr. Becker's.
We went to school together.

298
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,790
I must have the wrong Lloyd Becker.

299
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:56,613
I'm sorry to bother you.

300
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,597
Miranda Greene had lunch
with someone just before she died

301
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,588
with a man that may have had cancer.

302
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,889
Does that suggest anything to you?

303
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,059
Cancer isn't contagious, of course.

304
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,453
That's what I said.

305
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,700
Although...

306
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,913
Are you familiar with the chinese
notion of Ch'i, Agent Dunham?

307
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,038
No.

308
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,293
Dim Mak.

309
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:49,871
The Touch of Death.

310
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,007
Exactly.

311
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,576
The Chinese believe that

312
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,511
all living creatures

313
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,065
contain an energy, our Ch'i,

314
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,915
and, that with proper training,

315
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:02,469
a simple touch
can affect their Ch'i.

316
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,602
Reverse it.

317
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:08,321
Can cause sickness, even death.

318
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,081
Except, of course, they can't.

319
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,128
'cause the touch of death
is just a legend.

320
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,464
Of course, what would be
more interesting

321
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:17,333
wouldn't be a transfer of energy,

322
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,735
but an exchange.

323
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,007
Meaning what?

324
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,318
This other man,

325
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,813
you say that he was sick too,
that he had cancer as well?

326
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:25,705
Possibly.

327
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,245
And at the time she met him,
miss Greene was perfectly healthy.

328
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,006
Then I suggest
what we're looking at here

329
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,112
adheres more closely to tantric sex.

330
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:36,423
- Sex?
- Yes.

331
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:39,219
Insofar as the goal of tantric sex

332
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,630
is a heightened state of perception,

333
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:42,931
of awareness.

334
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,599
The partners are not interested

335
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,850
merely in the sexual experience.

336
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:50,396
They are seeking
an exchange of energy.

337
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,167
Okay, so what does this
have to do with Miranda Greene?

338
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,480
His cancer...

339
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,576
For her health.

340
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,116
It's possible that the man that

341
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,816
miss Greene met, did this to her

342
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:08,659
as a way to delay
the progression of his own disease.

343
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,325
Hi.

344
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:16,993
Lloyd Becker.

345
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,925
Oh, yeah, right.
You're Alex.

346
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,427
Alex Taylor. Thanks for seeing me.

347
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,556
Of course.
Yeah. How you doing?

348
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,504
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

349
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,883
Victim's name is Lloyd Becker. 30.

350
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:42,085
A neighbor saw his door open.
She came in and discovered his body.

351
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,797
There's no sign of forced entry.
No sign of a struggle.

352
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,654
Clusters of

353
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:54,671
malignant sarcomas.

354
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:56,700
Just like miss Greene.

355
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,683
Did anyone see the suspect?

356
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,606
Police canvassed the building
and the neighborhood. No luck.

357
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:06,710
The malignancies appear
to originate in this hand

358
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,891
and then appear to spread out.

359
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,918
Maybe from a handshake.

360
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,079
That's a fine deduction, Peter.

361
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,398
What do you see?

362
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:18,021
Nothing.

363
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,924
Nothing that tells me
why Lloyd Becker

364
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,363
was chosen as a victim.

365
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,603
There must be a connection.

366
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,164
Where's Walter?

367
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,638
The ME's gonna transport
the body back to the lab.

368
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,881
He told Walter he could ride along.

369
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,421
- What?
- It's nothing.

370
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:58,261
I think I know what it is
that's bothering you,

371
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,653
why it is you've been
so awkward around me

372
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,278
for the last couple weeks.

373
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:05,735
That trip down
to Jacksonville was crazy.

374
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,704
We were both exhausted.

375
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,354
We were both emotional.

376
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,456
And, you know, if something
had happened between the two of us,

377
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,592
if we had actually kissed, then we'd
have to deal with that, but we didn't.

378
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,117
No. No, we didn't.

379
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,675
Right.

380
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,514
This past year, this is the longest
I've ever stayed in one place.

381
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:27,389
So this thing that we have,
you, me, Walter,

382
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,481
this... This...

383
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:33,473
Our little family unit
that we've got going...

384
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:38,940
I don't want to do anything
to jeopardize that.

385
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:42,567
I don't either.

386
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:47,158
Okay, so we're good then, right?

387
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:49,317
Yeah.

388
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:52,665
Good.

389
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,899
<i>I found more victims.</i>

390
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,361
Five deaths over the past 20 months,

391
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:02,166
from Chicago to Hartford.

392
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,635
Each person died from the same
kind of rapid onset cancer.

393
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:11,167
And healthy people keeling over like
this didn't set off any alarm bells?

394
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,336
A couple were considered
medical anomalies,

395
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:16,706
and local police looked into another,
but nothing suggested it was murder.

396
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,482
So what is it about these people
that's making them targets?

397
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,776
Astrid, we need to
cross-reference their files,

398
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,762
see if we can find
what they may have in common.

399
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,314
All right. I'm on it.

400
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,882
Timothy Ober.

401
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:35,788
Is his middle name Michael?

402
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:40,848
Yeah. Timothy Michael Ober.

403
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,798
Why? You know him?

404
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:45,944
How?

405
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,199
I don't know.

406
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,146
What's up, buttercup?

407
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,648
It's past midnight.

408
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,044
Do you feel like playing a game?

409
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:48,986
Clue?

410
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,358
Yeah.

411
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,317
I thought it might be up your alley.

412
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:58,217
Colonel Mustard with the revolver

413
00:24:58,342 --> 00:24:59,781
in the billiard room.

414
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:03,292
See, that's the third time
that you've guessed the billiard room.

415
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,294
I've always wanted a billiard room.

416
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,930
I thought that you would
make a better detective.

417
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:10,216
I detected that you needed company.

418
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,505
You've lived here a while,

419
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,975
but you're still
living out of boxes.

420
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:22,687
Maybe you moved around
a lot as a kid.

421
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:24,782
A tumultuous childhood.

422
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,401
A hard time forming relationships.

423
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,782
I may not be the gumshoe you are,
but I've got some skills.

424
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:38,153
Well, you're right
about moving around a lot.

425
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,581
- I was a military brat.
- That would explain the uniform.

426
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:44,001
- The uniform?
- Yeah, bland clothes.

427
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,711
I don't think I've ever seen you
in a primary color.

428
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,579
It's because it's more
than a job to you.

429
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,733
You're a soldier.

430
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:53,968
Protector.

431
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,378
God, you'd be a blast
at dinner parties.

432
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:59,916
- I don't get invited to many.
- No.

433
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,527
So what about you?

434
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,465
What made you the way you are?

435
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,958
I don't know.

436
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,733
I'm older than I look.

437
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,702
I barely remember my childhood.

438
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:18,471
I'm also taller than I appear.

439
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:23,767
That's it.

440
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,426
What?

441
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,421
What did I say?

442
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,058
- Hey.
- Hey.

443
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,911
When we were in Jacksonville,

444
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:39,347
there was a height chart
on the wall with names.

445
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:43,017
First name and last initial.
All the kids that I was in daycare with.

446
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:46,687
Yeah, all the kids from Walter
and Bell's cortexiphan trials.

447
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,490
So while I was there,
I wrote down all their names

448
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,271
and I made a list.

449
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:57,490
"Timothy O." Timothy Ober.
He was there.

450
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,909
We were both part of Walter's tests.

451
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,977
So that's where
you remembered him from.

452
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,416
Keep looking.

453
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,667
- Miranda G. and Lloyd B.
- Julie H. Alan D.

454
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,353
They're all there.
All five of his victims.

455
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:12,369
So what does that mean?
Why is this guy...

456
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:14,298
Killing cortexiphan kids?
I don't know.

457
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,419
I think we should wake up Walter.

458
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:18,594
That won't be necessary.

459
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,318
Agent Dunham.

460
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:26,185
Peter.

461
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,871
Is it morning already?

462
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:31,500
Oh, no. No, no.
It's still the middle of the night.

463
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,276
Walter, what is that smell?

464
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,878
It's taffy.

465
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,569
I'm making it for Peter.

466
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:40,241
I think she was probably referring
to your other project.

467
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,314
Is that the killer's handprint?

468
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,551
I think we're close
to getting a fingerprint.

469
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:47,104
The papillary ridges

470
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,383
on the forefingers
are quite clear now.

471
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:52,753
Once it's cooled a little, I should be
able to run it through the scanner.

472
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,507
Well, whoever the killer is, he's
started to target cortexiphan subjects.

473
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:01,182
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

474
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:06,811
Why?
Why would he do that?

475
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,605
Well, we were hoping
you may have some idea.

476
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:12,853
I don't know.

477
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:17,653
But I have an idea why
they might be susceptible.

478
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:19,081
To the cancer?

479
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:21,582
The energy exchange
that this man is creating,

480
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:24,160
I don't think
it would work on everyone.

481
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:27,097
Cortexiphan was designed to...

482
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,793
to allow children to access

483
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,416
untapped parts of their brain,

484
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,794
untapped energies.

485
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,497
So you're saying that whatever
he's doing to his victims,

486
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:38,312
like, exchanging his illness,

487
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:40,801
it could only work
on cortexiphan children.

488
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,287
Yes.

489
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,195
- I think so.
- So then I guess the question really is:

490
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,348
how does he know about
the cortexiphan trials?

491
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:49,727
And then how is he
tracking those people down?

492
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,656
Now, you've said that you and Bell
never kept a list of the children

493
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,163
- that you experimented on.
- I didn't.

494
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:57,566
And if belly did, I never saw it.

495
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,243
Okay, but what about Nina Sharp?

496
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:02,011
I mean, she started working
with bell around the same time.

497
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,930
We asked. Last year.
When Harris was tracking down

498
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,536
Nick Lane and Nancy Lewis, we asked her.
She doesn't have a list.

499
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,539
Yeah, but I believe that Nina Sharp
isn't always so forthcoming.

500
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:16,295
Why would someone be hunting
cortexiphan test subjects?

501
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,571
I don't know.

502
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,299
Walter thinks that they could be
particularly susceptible.

503
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:23,593
That's troubling.

504
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,638
Did William Bell
ever show you a list?

505
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:27,622
Of cortexiphan subjects?

506
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:29,517
No.

507
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,186
And there's nothing in
the massive dynamic archives?

508
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,160
As I've told you before,
there's nothing on record.

509
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:37,441
Do you doubt me, Agent Dunham?

510
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:38,866
I don't know.

511
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:43,072
I've always been a little
foggy as to your motives.

512
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:46,091
What are you implying?

513
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,203
Well, you've kept information
from me since I met you...

514
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,946
Information that has prevented me
from understanding the origin of many,

515
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:55,098
if not all of the cases
I've investigated

516
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:57,169
while working with Fringe division.

517
00:29:58,108 --> 00:29:59,505
And I know about Peter.

518
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:05,026
I know the whole story.

519
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:07,930
Does Peter know?

520
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,456
Have you told him?

521
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,617
No.

522
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:13,298
But I'm going to.

523
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,065
No. You won't.

524
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,942
What makes you so sure about that?

525
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,911
Because you haven't told him yet.

526
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,488
And I'm guessing you've had
any number of opportunities.

527
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,978
Well, I've had my reasons
for waiting.

528
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,786
This is the right thing to do,
and Peter needs to know the truth.

529
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,499
Whether or not
it's the right thing to do,

530
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,789
I recognize the look in your eyes.

531
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:39,642
I know that working together closely

532
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,547
with someone can bring
about feelings.

533
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,710
I'm fairly certain that you're not
prepared to lose him.

534
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,567
You didn't come here today
to ask me about a list

535
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,735
that you already knew I don't have.

536
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,337
And you didn't come here to announce

537
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:57,229
that you're going to tell
Peter who he really is.

538
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,321
You came here...

539
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,079
to have me talk you out of it.

540
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,968
Mrs. Lane?

541
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,181
Yes.

542
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,764
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I... I tried calling.

543
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:33,963
My name is John McHugh.

544
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,577
I went to school
with your son, Nick.

545
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:39,021
No, Nick is my nephew.

546
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,240
You... You look awful.

547
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,947
Why don't you come inside?

548
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,432
Thank you.

549
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,694
The red wire goes in the red hole.

550
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,836
- The blue in...
- Yes, thank you, Walter.

551
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,512
I was able to figure that out
all by myself.

552
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,468
Hey.
How'd it go?

553
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,789
Nina didn't have anything.

554
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:14,014
- How's it going here?
- Well,...

555
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:17,268
- we'll soon see.
- Don't be so skeptical, Peter.

556
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,533
You liked the taffy, didn't you?

557
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,058
Absolutely.

558
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,150
- I have my doubts.
- Ready?

559
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:33,071
What's it doing?

560
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:35,828
Familiarizing itself with
the genetic composition.

561
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,289
Dismissing any foreign elements.

562
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:42,918
It's amazing how much filth
we carry around on our hands.

563
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:44,735
Go ahead, dear.

564
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,090
It worked.

565
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,232
Of course it did.

566
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:55,116
We need to run this through
the joint law enforcement database.

567
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,691
See if we can get
a name for this guy.

568
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:01,125
Well done, Walter.

569
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,355
Thank you, son.

570
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:10,214
Nothing.
He's not in our system.

571
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,239
No priors, no arrest record.

572
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,407
So...

573
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:15,841
we're nowhere.

574
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,681
You said you went
to school with Nick.

575
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:24,256
A long time ago,
back in Jacksonville.

576
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:29,006
We have a mutual friend,
Lloyd Becker.

577
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,941
- He said I could find Nick here.
- I remember Lloyd.

578
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:35,554
Such a sweet boy.

579
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,150
Nick lived here a while
after his parents died.

580
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,753
He moved to Brooklyn...
Several years ago.

581
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,813
Do you know how I could
get in contact with him?

582
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:51,773
- Do you have his phone number?
- I'm afraid not.

583
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,073
I haven't heard from him
for some time.

584
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:59,298
It's funny, though.
Someone else

585
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,874
from Jacksonville came by,
six months ago asking for Nick.

586
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,616
She must have gone
to school with you as well.

587
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:10,505
You don't by any chance
remember her name, do you?

588
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,778
God, what am I missing?

589
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,781
I think I may have found our killer.
His name is James Heath,

590
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,770
and he was
a cortexiphan subject too.

591
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,773
<i>I think that may be
how he's doing this.</i>

592
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,223
James Heath? Wasn't Heath
the last name of the first...

593
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:13,709
<i>Yep, of the first victim...</i>
Julie Heath.

594
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,822
She was his sister.
<i>James was in the hospital.</i>

595
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,690
She was visiting him, and she just
suddenly collapsed and died.

596
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:23,704
He was having chemo treatment.
He had cancer.

597
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,974
Do you have the name of the hospital
where Heath was treated?

598
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,460
It's Abington Memorial Hospital.

599
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,672
<i>It's just outside Philadelphia.</i>

600
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,423
Okay. I'll see if they have
a current address for him.

601
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,223
Thanks.

602
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:43,295
You're Olivia Dunham.

603
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,743
You probably don't remember me.

604
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,019
My name is Nate Reed.

605
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,694
Nick Lane gave me your address?

606
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,832
You and I went to school together
when we were kids.

607
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:10,834
Back in Jacksonville.

608
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:12,712
I see.

609
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,924
What can I do for you?

610
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,706
I was hoping you'd have
a few minutes to talk.

611
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,639
Sure.

612
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,743
Why don't you come in?

613
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:12,804
It's me. He's in my house!

614
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,401
You stay down.

615
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,205
I didn't want this.

616
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,465
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

617
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,615
Then why did you?

618
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:53,936
A man...

619
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:57,718
came to see me
when I was in the hospital.

620
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,891
He said when I was a kid

621
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:04,907
scientists had experimented on me,

622
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:08,075
that because
of the experiments, he could

623
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,203
teach me how to fight the cancer.

624
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:12,846
But it didn't work.

625
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:14,833
I didn't get better.
I got worse.

626
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:18,831
So what happened to your sister?

627
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:22,007
She stayed with me
while I was in the hospital.

628
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,161
She never left my side.

629
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,440
And when the pain got bad,
she'd hold my hand.

630
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,008
For hours.

631
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,481
And then,

632
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:34,776
one day,

633
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,600
it just happened.

634
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,884
I called the nurses for help, but...

635
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,495
it was too late.

636
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,226
I watched her die.

637
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,770
But you got better.

638
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:00,091
I had to find that man.

639
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,632
I thought someone
from Jacksonville might

640
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
know him.

641
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,919
And then I found Timothy.

642
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,263
And you killed him too.

643
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,231
Not on purpose. It just...

644
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,088
happened.

645
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,356
But...

646
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,881
that's when I realized
how it worked.

647
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,611
I think...

648
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,411
if that man had never...

649
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:29,878
come to see me,

650
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:34,103
I would have died
the way I was supposed to,

651
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,374
and my sister would still be alive.

652
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,175
They'd all still be alive.

653
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,302
In here.

654
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:50,539
It's okay.

655
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,941
How come you didn't call Broyles?

656
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:23,045
- I've got you on speed dial.
- Really?

657
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,048
I'm number one on
Olivia Dunham's speed dial?

658
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:29,368
Well, no,
but I didn't think that Rachel

659
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,471
or Mr. Iyer from the indian takeout
would be much use.

660
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,364
Thank you for coming.

661
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:53,344
You're welcome.

662
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,607
He's in a drug-induced coma,

663
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:05,337
which seems to have stopped
the progression of his cancer.

664
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:09,535
And the man who tried to activate him,
do we know who he was?

665
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:12,532
He sounds like the same man
who Sanford Harris hired

666
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:14,429
to activate Nancy Lewis
and Nick Lane.

667
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:18,551
I assume the activation failed,
and Mr. Heath's... ability

668
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,027
was just an unfortunate side effect.

669
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,779
So I don't imagine you called me
all the way down here just to

670
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:27,150
share in your victory.

671
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,350
Aside from Olivia Dunham,

672
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,722
there are still nearly a dozen
unaccounted for people

673
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:38,328
from the Jacksonville experiments, and
30 more from the drug trials in wooster.

674
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:41,599
If they all have capabilities
anything like the ones we've seen,

675
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:44,924
- and if someone were to find them...
- Well, Philip,

676
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,518
then we need to find them first.

677
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,098
Is Peter here?

678
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:00,976
No, he went out.

679
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,728
Good, because
I would like to talk to you.

680
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,946
Please. Please, Walter. Just...

681
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,607
Let me finish.

682
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:15,897
I think that you may be right.

683
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:22,799
I think that maybe some truths
can do more harm than good

684
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:26,923
and that some pandora's boxes

685
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,596
are better left unopened.

686
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,270
So...

687
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,054
I'm not gonna tell Peter.

688
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,338
Thank you, Olivia.

689
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,616
The truth is...

690
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:53,154
I've done enough damage,

691
00:42:53,735 --> 00:42:54,785
and it's...

692
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,930
time to start...

693
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,039
to put things right...

694
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:02,343
whatever the consequences.

695
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:06,332
And that starts with
telling Peter the truth.

696
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:10,938
I have to tell him who he really is.
