1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,560
No,man,whatever.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,330
You're wrong.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,900
Admit you're wrong.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,330
No,she didn't.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,630
What?

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,400
Well,then she's a bigger idiot than you are,

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,400
Which is impossible.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,530
It is impossible.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,830
I'm really good at math. It's impossible.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,830
All right,cool. Late.

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,100
We'll be back around 10:00.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,100
Make sure to take bucky out.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,760
you hear me?

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,430
I love you.

15
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,530
That scared me.

16
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,860
Me too. Your turn.

17
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,360
Okay.

18
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,630
Ella,when you said you brushed your teeth,

19
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you also completely dry your toothbrush?

20
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
I brushed.

21
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,300
Ella.

22
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,100
I just love being lied to.

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,900
Hey,you're a tough mother.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
Ella's a sweetheart.

25
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,830
She is a sweetheart.

26
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,160
She's a lying little sweetheart.

27
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,060
Sure minds me as you?

28
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh!

29
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm gonna go make sure she's brushing her teeth.

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,030
With all due respect,

31
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,830
Darwin got it all wrong.

32
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,160
I used to make the joke that darwin's thinking

33
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,900
was rather...

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,030
unevolved.

35
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,430
Which I'm sure used to be very funny.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,430
For a brilliant man,

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,030
Darwin was occasionally a moron.

38
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,730
he claimed that males tried to spread their genes

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,700
By having sex constantly.

40
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,400
However,the females,with limited eggs,

41
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,300
were more selective in their attempts

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,960
to find genetically superior males.

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,200
I believe that darwin was simply inaccurate,

44
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,030
that females can be just as aggressive as males,

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,300
with males equally dispassionate.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,530
Thoughts! Peter?

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,030
- This is Astrid.  - Hey,it's me.

48
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,460
can you have the guys go outside?

49
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,730
I'm sending over a body.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,300
Yeah. Yeah,I'll have them waiting outside.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,500
- Thank you.  - Okay.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,630
Hey,that was Olivia. She needs you guys outside.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,630
A coroner's on his way with a body.

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,160
You know,this is the part of day

55
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,000
That I look forward to most...

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,730
when I know there's something bizarre out there.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
I just don't know what it is.

58
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,660
Like a grab bag of disturbing events,

59
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,060
Don't you think?

60
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,060
Yeah.

61
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,130
Be right back,Agent Farnsworth.

62
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,660
Okay. Bye.

63
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,330
Thank you for taking the time. We know you're grieving.

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
We're very sorry about your loss.

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
What the hell could have done that to him?

66
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,360
We don't know yet.

67
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,730
But we'll find out.

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Did you notice anything strange

69
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,860
In your son's behavior over the last few days?

70
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,660
No. School is good.

71
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,860
He was looking forward to graduating.

72
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,830
We had dinner together almost every night.

73
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,860
We tried to get a few syllables out about his day.

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,400
Any history of drug use?

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,230
No. I know all parents think that,

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,360
But in Greg's case,it's true.

77
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,730
Whatever happened... He didn't bring it on himself.

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,330
What about any...

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
Preexisting medical conditions?

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,500
Asthma.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
I blame it for all the time he spends on the computer.

82
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,000
Was he on the computer last night?

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,030
Most nights.

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,360
He spends all his free time there

85
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,200
playing games,trading songs.

86
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,900
He chats about girls with his friends.

87
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,900
Which friends?

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,330
Uh...Luke,probably. Luke Dempsey.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,700
E-y?

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,030
Yeah.

91
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,030
We're gonna do everything we can

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,230
to find out what happened to your son.

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,630
He can be rotated onto his back now,

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,400
Drain the remainder of his brain.

95
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,730
Once that's done,

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,360
We can examine his cranial cavity.

97
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh,this is gonna be awesome.

98
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,660
Just get me everything you can and call me right back.

99
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,000
Thanks.

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,330
Everything okay?

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,060
yeah,his parents say he was a good kid.

102
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,260
what do we know from the autopsy?

103
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,700
All I know for sure

104
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Is that his brain matter has been completely liquefied.

105
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,960
How?

106
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,830
My first thought

107
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,400
Is an extremely virulent form of syphilis.

108
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,960
you're saying that his brain

109
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,900
Could have been cooked by an std?

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,100
Safe sex is important.

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,200
You do always have your sexual partners

112
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,800
wear a condom,I hope.

113
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,960
Walter...

114
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,860
Well,if he got this from a girl

115
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,900
or some kind of drug that he was experimenting with,

116
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,460
there may be a record of that on his computer.

117
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,230
Astrid,can you check his hard drive?

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,560
I had it transferred with some of his other effects.

119
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,900
I got it right here. I'm on it.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh,and be sure to check his floppy disks as well.

121
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,800
Floppy disks are a little outdated.

122
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,800
Why don't you focus on what you do best?

123
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,330
All yours... liquid brains.

124
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
Oh. Fantastic.

125
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,960
I will get the bone saw!

126
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,960
Hey,check this out.

127
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,960
What?

128
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,060
Something's wrong.

129
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,330
The hard drive platters must be fused.

130
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
You sure?

131
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,800
Linguistics major. Computer science minor.

132
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,300
Plus,I've been taking computers apart

133
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,930
Since I was,like,six.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,100
So do you think you can get anything off this?

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,500
Uh... I know some pretty aggressive

136
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,700
Data retrieval techniques.

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,930
I can give it a shot.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
Well,I'm gonna go interview that Dempsey kid

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,130
And see if I can dig up something else on the victims.

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,530
Call me as soon as you find something.

141
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,600
Excuse me.

142
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm looking for Luke Dempsey.

143
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,430
Thank you.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,860
Luke Dempsey?

145
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,160
Olivia Dunham. FBI.

146
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,530
Can I have a word?

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
I was just talking with Greg last night.

148
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,560
What happened to him?

149
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,660
To be honest,we're not entirely sure.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,330
What did you two talk about?

151
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,600
A bunch of stuff.

152
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,330
I got him a deal on a split rear exhaust

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,560
for his '93 gt.

154
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,460
told him he could swing by whenever.

155
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,360
And after... a couple hours,

156
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,860
He just... he stopped answering.

157
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,200
I figured he fell asleep.

158
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,930
How do the two of you know each other?

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,230
Our dads worked together when we were kids,

160
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,230
And,uh...

161
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,330
Greg and I stayed friends.

162
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Can you think of anyone

163
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,400
Who may have wanted to hurt Greg...

164
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,760
Or maybe had a grudge against him?

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,400
You think... somebody killed him?

166
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you?

167
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,830
Dunham.

168
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,100
It's Peter.

169
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,060
we just got a call about another body.

170
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,760
Sir.

171
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,960
Dunham.

172
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,230
The general manager of this dealership

173
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,760
was found dead by an employee.

174
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,600
- We have the employee?  - Yeah.

175
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Though he's having a hard time being coherent.

176
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,260
Well,what exactly happened?

177
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,560
Bishop. Doctor.

178
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,330
It appears he died

179
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
the same way as the teenager in Springfield.

180
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,230
Prepare six vials,please.

181
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,130
Yes,sir.

182
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
Where's the guy who found him?

183
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,830
This way.

184
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,560
Anton's a nice man.

185
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,500
Honest guy. He has three kids.

186
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,400
When was the last time you saw him alive?

187
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,600
Last night.

188
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,960
There's a bar we go to sometimes.

189
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,660
Strip club.

190
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,560
My wife doesn't know. Just... please don't judge me.

191
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,230
I'm not judging you.

192
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,530
Oh!

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

194
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,430
He's dead. He can't feel this.

195
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
I wonder if they sell cars here

196
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,700
With those seats that warm your ass.

197
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,430
Why don't you ask 'em?

198
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
Hmm?

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,330
Maybe I will.

200
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Anton's worked here as long as you have?

201
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,000
A little longer than that,actually.

202
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,530
He's been here for three years.

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,960
And is there anyone you can think of

204
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,960
That would want to hurt him?

205
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,830
Anton? No way. He's solid.

206
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,260
Can I take your card

207
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,000
In case I need to ask you some more questions?

208
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah,sure,um... My cell's on there.

209
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,960
And if you're ever interested in a new vehicle,

210
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,030
We have next year's models in,so,um...

211
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,830
Now you are judging me.

212
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,130
It's the weirdest thing.

213
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,260
The fused platters

214
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,900
We found on the car salesman's computer...

215
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,700
They're fried just like the kid's.

216
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,160
Well,that can't be a coincidence.

217
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,400
I'm trying to recover as much data as possible.

218
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,530
These platters are incredibly sensitive.

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,830
A speck of dust is enough to make them unusable.

220
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,000
But this?

221
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,700
It looks like someone took a blowtorch to them.

222
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,530
And from what I was able to pull so far,

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,660
It looks like both the computers downloaded a huge file...

224
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,260
657 megabytes each right before they crashed.

225
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,060
Where'd the file come from?

226
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,200
It's a miracle I was able to salvage this much.

227
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,530
To figure that out,I'd need another couple days

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,060
To access the ISP servers.

229
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,760
That's time that we don't have.

230
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,660
Is it you?

231
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,030
Mm-mm.

232
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,200
I haven't heard that sound for ages.

233
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,000
I think it's the phone.

234
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,100
Who would have that number?

235
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,930
It must be on Harvard's system.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
I didn't even know it worked.

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,700
Hello?

238
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,600
There's nobody here by that name.

239
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,360
Yes,I'm sure.

240
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,700
Sorry. I think you got the wrong number.

241
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,260
Who was it?

242
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,800
Some... student looking for financial aid.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,430
What are you doing?

244
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,260
I think...

245
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,100
I got a guy who can help us.

246
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Who?

247
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,100
You really wanna know?

248
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,100
Good point.

249
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,660
Be careful with that,though,'cause it's evidence.

250
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,030
Just kiddin'.

251
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Okay,I'm gonna go talk to Greg Wiles's friend,

252
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,600
Luke Dempsey.

253
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Agent Dunham?

254
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
I think I might know who's just on the phone.

255
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,200
How's it going,Akim?

256
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
Peter Bishop.

257
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,900
Long time.

258
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,100
Not long enough...

259
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,700
Play nice.

260
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,360
I come bearing gifts.

261
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,560
My god. I can't believe you kept it.

262
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,760
You could have sold this for a fortune.

263
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,960
I kept it to remind me never to wager with anything

264
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,960
That I couldn't bear to live without.

265
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,600
I can have it back?

266
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,130
Sure.

267
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,100
First... I'm gonna need some help.

268
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,600
What do you got?

269
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,600
Just before they fried,

270
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,460
both of these drives downloaded the same program.

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,660
Very good.

272
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,730
And what are we looking for?

273
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,100
I wanna know what it is and where it came from.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,100
Agent Dunham.

275
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,460
I hear Agent Broyles has you investigating

276
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,230
The bridgepoint automotive death.

277
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,930
May I ask what exactly

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
you're looking for?

279
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,760
I'll be cross-referencing the victim's medical records

280
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,930
with the AMA database,looking for anything

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,460
that might connect him to the teenager

282
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,330
and explain what happened here.

283
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,760
Medical records,ama database,liquefied brains.

284
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,100
Come on,Dunham.

285
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,360
This case clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the CDC!

286
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,960
- Qualified,knowledgeable,scientists...  - There was no known pathogen,

287
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,600
- no signs of a contagion.  - who see these things every day!

288
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,100
With all due respect,agent Harris,

289
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,660
I have done my due diligence.

290
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,030
I just got off the phone with my contact at the CDC,

291
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,130
and they have seen nothing like it.

292
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,900
But you tell me,does this look like a flu you've heard of

293
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,800
where people's brains come out their ears?

294
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,230
No.

295
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,160
No.

296
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,700
This looks like yet another excuse

297
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,330
to justify the allocation of FBI resources.

298
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,460
To what's arguably become

299
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,700
a rogue division inside a federal agency,

300
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,400
operating,if not completely autonomously,

301
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,830
then well outside the standard regulatory purview.

302
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
I have news for you,agent Dunham.

303
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm here to remedy that.

304
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll consider myself warned.

305
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,930
12 hours.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,730
After that,I shut you down and put the case

307
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,930
in what I believe will be considerably more capable hands.

308
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,630
- Whoa.  - What's this?

309
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,560
It's particles scattered all over the internet.

310
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,760
This thing must have been insanely complex.

311
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,760
Integrated video,audio.

312
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,060
I mean,some of this isn't even computer code.

313
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,930
Is that even possible?

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Multiple parallel packet routing.

315
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,300
Ten times the usual nodes.

316
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,730
Whoever sent this is trying very hard to cover their tracks.

317
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,460
Akim,come on.

318
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,160
You have no idea where this thing came from.

319
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,630
Nothing yet. There's too many paths.

320
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,060
Wait a second.

321
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,360
Okay,I... I can't tell you where it's originating,

322
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,760
but I got a destination.

323
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,030
This program's being downloaded right now,real time.

324
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
Then that's the next target.

325
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,830
Neighborhood in Brighton,near Boston.

326
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,500
It's close by.

327
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,430
Brighton? Can you pull up the address?

328
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,130
Honing in.

329
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,930
There.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,860
That's where it's going.

331
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,430
Oh,my god.

332
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,100
Dunham.

333
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,830
Olivia,listen to me... just before they died,

334
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,760
both the victims downloaded the same transmission,

335
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,530
- and it's happening again right now.  - where?  - Your apartment.

336
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,460
Hey,I just turned right onto broadway.

337
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,430
I should be there in five minutes.

338
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,230
Uh,look,Rachel's not picking up her cell...

339
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,360
Then call the next door neighbor.

340
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,860
I don't know any of the neighbors.

341
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,860
I haven't seen any of them for months.

342
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,200
Then call boston PD.

343
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,330
I already have.

344
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,500
Mom. Mom!

345
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,030
One minute,Ella.

346
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,330
Olivia,what the hell are you doing?

347
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,930
Okay... is there someone else here?

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Of course not. It's just us.

349
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,300
Ella?

350
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
Ella,everything's gonna be okay.

351
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,400
- You okay?  - Yeah.

352
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,700
- Can you check out the back?  - Yeah.

353
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,300
Ella!

354
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,100
Ella. Ella.

355
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,230
- What's wrong?  - Nothing is wrong,Olivia.

356
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,530
She's just playing her game,right,Ell?

357
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Ella!

358
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,800
Ella... sweetie!

359
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,100
Ella. Ella!

360
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,860
Aunt Liv?

361
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,000
When did you get home?

362
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
I don't understand.

363
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,830
What happened?

364
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,430
There were flashes on the computer screen

365
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,230
When I first came in,like bursts of images.

366
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't know. I can't explain it.

367
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,630
It was like nothing I had ever seen before.

368
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,730
Images.

369
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,060
Yeah.

370
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,130
And they affected Ella in some way,

371
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
like she was hypnotized.

372
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,130
I'm gonna call computer forensics.

373
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,430
They'll be here right away.

374
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,930
Trot,trot to boston,

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,430
trot,trot to lynn.

376
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,700
Better watch out,

377
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,030
or you might fall in!

378
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,960
Do you do birthday parties too?

379
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,660
Not so much,no.

380
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,360
Though I have done my fair share of babysitting lately.

381
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,860
Yeah,well,the way you are with Ella,

382
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,200
It seems like you'd be really good.

383
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,500
At a party.

384
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,700
I'm not really familiar with the word.

385
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,300
Maybe you can talk to your sister,

386
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,000
She can give me the weekend off.

387
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,930
My sister's not really the weekend off type.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,200
That was always more me.

389
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,230
Everything okay?

390
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,900
- Yeah.  - Ella,come here.

391
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,300
What are you doing?

392
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,860
You need to get her checked out as soon as possible.

393
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,200
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,560
She's fine. Look at her.

395
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm sure everything's fine.

396
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,160
Liv,what is going on?

397
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,660
There was a hand.

398
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,330
I remember.

399
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,030
There was a hand coming out of the computer.

400
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,400
Okay,uh...

401
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,730
We're definitely cutting back on the sugar intake

402
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,730
and possibly our visits with aunt Olivia.

403
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,730
- Come on,sweetie.  - Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

404
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
What kinda hand,Ella?

405
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,860
Weird... Glowy...

406
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,060
Scary.

407
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,700
Ell,this isn't funny. Look at me.

408
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,700
You know how I feel about lying.

409
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,230
I'm not!

410
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,060
It really happened!

411
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,860
How?

412
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,300
I don't know.

413
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,930
I was playing with my game,and I saw this hand.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,830
Which game was it?

415
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
My ponies.

416
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't want you on that site again,okay? Promise?

417
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,930
That's right,sweetheart. I'm the one you're looking for.

418
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,300
Who's there?

419
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,200
It... it's just me,dad.

420
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,430
Somebody in here?

421
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,730
I heard voices.

422
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,760
Talking to myself.

423
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,760
What are you doin' here?

424
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,060
Thought I'd bring you some lunch.

425
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,060
Thanks.

426
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,760
How are things at the body shop,Luke?

427
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,800
Fine.

428
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,960
Have you found a job yet,dad?

429
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,730
Who says I'm looking for one?

430
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,960
I went by your place.

431
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,600
The mail was all piled up.

432
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Mrs. Greely said you haven't been home in over a week.

433
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,800
She should mind her own business.

434
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,330
Have you been sleeping here,dad?

435
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,430
Luke...

436
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,230
Thanks for the food,but...

437
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,260
I should be getting back to this.

438
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,460
W... what is it that you're working on?

439
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,100
A new program. I don't wanna jinx it.

440
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,860
I think it's gonna impress a lot of people.

441
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,130
Okay,love you.

442
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,960
Bye.

443
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,260
How's Ella doing?

444
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,330
The doctor says she's perfectly healthy.

445
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,730
There's no sign of neurological damage,nothing.

446
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,830
That's excellent news.

447
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Charlie's taking them back.

448
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,230
He's gonna keep an eye on the apartment until I get there.

449
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,430
God,if something had of happened to her...

450
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,660
But it didn't.

451
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,630
Don't torture yourself with hypotheticals.

452
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,800
She's fine.

453
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,100
Yeah.

454
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,900
This is gonna sound crazy

455
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,330
but I think whoever's responsible was watching

456
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,730
through the computer.

457
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,900
What?

458
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,500
The light next to the camera was on,

459
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,930
and Ella doesn't know how to use it.

460
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,130
You think he was spying on you?

461
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,960
I don't know. Maybe he was trying to scare me.

462
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,360
He knows about the investigation,

463
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,530
and this is his sick way of telling me to back off.

464
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,460
I suppose he could have broken into our network,

465
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,030
learned you were investigating his case...

466
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,260
Which means maybe we can track him.

467
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,200
Well,we have forensics on it as we speak.

468
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Also,I've got a... subcontractor that I've worked with before.

469
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,100
He's trying to track down the origin of the data stream

470
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,630
that was sent to Olivia's computer.

471
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,330
And this... data stream,

472
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,830
you think it may be connected to what killed those people?

473
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,930
The victim,Greg Wiles,

474
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
was found in front of his computer too,

475
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,360
and his hard drive was fused,

476
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,930
just like the car salesman.

477
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,230
A computer program that can...

478
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,660
Kill people. Yeah,I know.

479
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,360
But Walter's working on it right now back at the lab.

480
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,860
But here's what I don't understand.

481
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,230
If a person is responsible for those deaths,

482
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,030
why are they killing?

483
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,800
Have you found any connection between the victims?

484
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,360
Not yet.

485
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,030
Mark?

486
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
Honey?

487
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,360
Can you help me with the groceries?

488
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,660
John and Alice are coming over for dinner.

489
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,000
You remember?

490
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,930
Thought I'd make a roast.

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,360
Hey,Dow Jones. Are you alive in there?

492
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,560
Mark?

493
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,030
Mark...

494
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,400
It's amazing,isn't it?

495
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,360
All these people,and they don't have a clue...

496
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,060
How crazy it all really is.

497
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,700
The world... Everything.

498
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,300
If we do our job,they'll never have to.

499
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,660
Olivia Dunham.

500
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,400
We got another death.

501
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,400
this one,outside Chicago,is a day trader.

502
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,400
It's happened again.

503
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,400
When are you going to start calling them murders?

504
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,400
When you find us a murderer.

505
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,560
Well,send me everything you can on the victim.

506
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,560
Will do.

507
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,560
Okay.

508
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
I'll meet you inside,okay?

509
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,760
Are you Jessica Warren?

510
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,030
Yes.

511
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm Peter Bishop.

512
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,800
I know.

513
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,430
I read your letter.

514
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,430
And I can understand,of course,

515
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,630
why it is that you want to see my father.

516
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,800
It's not the right time for him.

517
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,360
He's only been out of the institution...

518
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,530
... for a couple of months.

519
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
After 17 years...

520
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,430
And three months,Mr. Bishop.

521
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,030
I know exactly how long it's been.

522
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,130
I'm sure you do.

523
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm very sorry for what happened,Mrs. Warren.

524
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,460
I wish this weren't the case,

525
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,960
but nothing will bring your daughter back...

526
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,300
Not even talking to my father.

527
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,460
I need to see him.

528
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,760
To do what? To blame him for the accident?

529
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,260
It's between me and your father.

530
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,730
I'm sorry. It's not going to happen.

531
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,600
Hey.

532
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,800
Hey.

533
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,100
I'm glad Ella's okay.

534
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,130
Oh. Thank you.

535
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,260
Oh,agent Dunham.

536
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,930
I think I worked out how these deaths occurred.

537
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,960
It's a complex combination...

538
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,200
... of visual and subsonic aural stimuli

539
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,130
ingeniously designed to amplify

540
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,700
the electrical impulses of the brain,

541
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
trapping it in an endless loop.

542
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,130
Walter?

543
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,160
It's like a computer virus that infects people.

544
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,530
I don't understand.

545
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,500
Ella said she saw a hand coming out of the computer.

546
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,360
A hallucinatory effect of the stimuli,perhaps.

547
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,960
I need to research further.

548
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,830
Hey.

549
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,360
Where's the latest victim?

550
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,660
Uh... just outside of Chicago.

551
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,030
Any motive yet?

552
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,000
Not yet.

553
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,960
Listen...

554
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,630
I think I know who that woman was... outside.

555
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,000
What do you think you know?

556
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,000
That she's the mother of the lab assistant...

557
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,000
... that was killed in the fire here almost 20 years ago.

558
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
It's none of my business.

559
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,400
Go ahead. What?

560
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,860
Does Walter know? That she wants to see him?

561
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,060
Of course Walter doesn't know.

562
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,730
He couldn't handle it.

563
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,760
I see.

564
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,560
You think that he could?

565
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,330
I don't know why,but I do.

566
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,930
You really think it's a good idea...

567
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,360
... to put him through that?

568
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,600
Well,I was thinking that it's all unresolved.

569
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,960
For him,for her,and I was thinking

570
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,430
that it must be hard for her too,

571
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,000
to come back here to the place where she lost her daughter.

572
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,230
What's your point?

573
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,230
That you underestimate him,your father,

574
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,460
And you shouldn't.

575
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,600
Here is what Charlie was able to dig up

576
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,900
on the last victim.

577
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,130
"Mark Rosenthal. 48. Married."

578
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,960
Any information on his next of kin?

579
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,060
It's sad,actually.

580
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,760
He just got married last year to a...

581
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,330
A Miriam Dempsey.

582
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
I have her number here if you want it.

583
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,660
- Did you say Dempsey?  - Mm-hmm.

584
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,860
I interviewed a Luke Dempsey this morning.

585
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,560
He was friends with the teenage victim Greg Wiles.

586
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,100
Uh... according to this background info,

587
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Miriam Dempsey is Luke's mother.

588
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,430
So that would make the last victim Luke's stepfather.

589
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,930
Yeah.

590
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,300
What are the chances

591
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,400
of the same kid being connected to both victims?

592
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,730
Maybe Luke is a killer.

593
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,960
It's possible,but... he seemed genuinely upset

594
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,260
when I told him his friend was dead.

595
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,360
He did mention something else.

596
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,660
He said that the reason he was friends with the victim

597
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,660
was because their fathers worked together.

598
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,800
Is everything all right?

599
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,500
I heard you and agent Dunham.

600
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,200
From the tone,it sounded like you were having an argument.

601
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,200
Everything's fine.

602
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,330
I tried to expense a couple of Celtic tickets

603
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,800
on the FBI... she caught me.

604
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,100
Oh,I see.

605
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,700
I hope she doesn't notice the $2,000

606
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,860
for the baboon seminal fluid I ordered.

607
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,060
I hope I can recall why I ordered it.

608
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,660
What's up?

609
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,330
I think we have our suspect.

610
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,330
"Brian Dempsey."

611
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,800
He used to work for Paul Wiles.

612
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,830
Greg's dad?

613
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,300
Exactly.

614
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,700
He was Dempsey's boss

615
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,560
until he fired Dempsey six years ago.

616
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,160
According to Wiles,he was a programmer,

617
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,900
way ahead of his time.

618
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,660
Wiles said when he fired him,Brian threw a fit.

619
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,200
Yeah,and the victim outside Chicago

620
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,330
was married to Dempsey's ex-wife.

621
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Really nasty divorce too.

622
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,360
What about the car salesman?

623
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,030
Uh,we're still looking for that connection.

624
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,730
But it looks like Dempsey's m.o.

625
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,730
is to hurt people who screwed him over

626
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,600
by going after their loved ones.

627
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,700
Charlie. Yeah. It's me.

628
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,830
I need you to get to Brian Dempsey's house.

629
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,560
Luke's father. I think he's our guy.

630
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,700
Dunham,where's our suspect?

631
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,230
There was no sign of him at home.

632
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,700
We picked up his son from work.

633
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,830
What's your plan?

634
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,430
We're waiting for the right moment.

635
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,630
Well,why wait?

636
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,300
Just go in and break him.

637
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,960
I... I'm not sure that's the way to go.

638
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,160
You care to share your reasoning?

639
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,660
I think that Luke suspects

640
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,330
there's something wrong with his father.

641
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,160
If we go in heavy-handed,then... he could shut down

642
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,100
Or call a lawyer,and then... He won't tell us anything.

643
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,660
It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen.

644
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,630
I'm more than familiar with passive coercion.

645
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,160
Good.

646
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,230
Then find his pressure points,

647
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,860
Put your little hands around him,and squeeze.

648
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,830
That's an order.

649
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,660
Every time that guy opens his mouth,

650
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,160
I like him more and more.

651
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,800
So?

652
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,160
Come on.

653
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,260
Luke.

654
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,860
This is Agent Francis.

655
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,130
Where's your father?

656
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,160
No idea.

657
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,300
Tell me about him.

658
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,160
Uh,what do you wanna know?

659
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,900
He had a pretty rough ride.

660
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,430
Smart.

661
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,900
Maybe a little too smart for his own good.

662
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,600
couldn't hold down a job,

663
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,630
then he gets dumped by your mom.

664
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,800
that couldn't have been easy.

665
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
People don't understand him.

666
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,030
They don't take the time.

667
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,460
When did you see him last?

668
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,230
Few weeks ago.

669
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,900
We aren't really close.

670
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,060
Have you spoken to your mom recently?

671
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,500
Do you know what happened to your stepfather?

672
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,760
And,uh,I told you about Greg myself.

673
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,360
Come on,Luke.

674
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,600
The only thing that these victims have in common,

675
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,900
besides having their brains liquefied,

676
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000
was that they were all close

677
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,100
to someone who pissed off your father.

678
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,660
This guy died because he married your mother.

679
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,400
And your friend Greg here,

680
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,530
he died because his dad fired your dad.

681
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
That's impossible!

682
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,160
The horror show in this picture

683
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,900
was a friend of yours.

684
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,230
You wanna cover it up now?

685
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,330
No!

686
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,860
I want a lawyer.

687
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,960
D-don't I get a lawyer?

688
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,960
Is it any consolation knowing you were right?

689
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,930
Do me a favor.

690
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
Wait five minutes,then release him.

691
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,530
What about Harris?

692
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,300
Screw him.

693
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,360
My thoughts exactly.

694
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,200
Okay,come on.

695
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,460
What did I miss?

696
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,460
Just trust me.

697
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,230
Yeah,I need a cab.

698
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,300
I need to hear that call.

699
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,760
Thank you.

700
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,400
... 2 Braddock street.

701
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,600
One person going to 1432 braddock street.

702
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,700
I'll have a car there in ten minutes.

703
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,960
Ten minutes,right? All right,thanks.

704
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,600
He just called a cab.

705
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,830
One guess where it's taking him.

706
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,060
Oh,come on.

707
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,060
He cannot possibly be that stupid.

708
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,560
He's 19.

709
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,460
Good point.

710
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,660
I don't underestimate my father,by the way.

711
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,360
I understand him.

712
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,000
sometimes more than I want to.

713
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,860
Look,if I let him talk to that woman,

714
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,600
She's just going to accuse him of killing her daughter,

715
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,160
which is something that he didn't do.

716
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,130
Then why not just let them meet?

717
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Whose side are you on anyway?

718
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,530
I know what it's like

719
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,700
to live with something unresolve... that's all.

720
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,330
Congratulations... you just described the entire planet.

721
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,030
This could provide closure for your father.

722
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,930
He's had to live with the death of that woman.

723
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,660
He got put away because of it.

724
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,930
Who's to say that this wouldn't be a resolution for him?

725
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,900
If I didn't know better,I'd think you actually

726
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,660
wanted the man to have a nervous breakdown!

727
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,060
Then maybe you don't know better,

728
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,200
because I care for your father too.

729
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,500
And I believe that shielding him from the truth,

730
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,830
from what's real,ultimately does him a disservice.

731
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,000
What's real doesn't really seem to concern Walter.

732
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,160
And what you said earlier

733
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,730
about this being none of your business,

734
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,360
that was right on the money.

735
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,500
Okay,you stay here.

736
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,830
You are not going in there alone.

737
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,830
Just stay here and watch the entrance.

738
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,230
Will you at least call for backup?

739
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,730
Harris wants me to screw this up.

740
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,100
If I call for help,

741
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,430
He's gonna do whatever it takes to make me look bad.

742
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,660
Where the hell are Dunham and the kid?

743
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,160
I have no idea,sir.

744
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,530
Hey!

745
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,100
Trace the GPS on Dunham's car.

746
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,860
I wanna know where she is now!

747
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,730
W-why the hell would you do that?

748
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,730
He was a friend of mine!

749
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,430
His has a bad family,Luke.

750
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,060
They were cruel people.

751
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,860
You actually...

752
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,900
you actually killed Greg from here?

753
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,130
Now... how many more,dad? Who else,huh?

754
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,960
All they had to do was give me a chance,

755
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,230
a fair shake,a chance to prove myself.

756
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,730
But they thought they could just drop me to the curb

757
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,100
like a piece of garbage.

758
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Son...

759
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,600
No! No!

760
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
So all this is supposed to fix that?

761
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
I don't know who you are anymore,dad!

762
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,360
I used to look up to you.

763
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,660
And now... you're pathetic.

764
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,900
Go!

765
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,930
They're coming for me,not for you.

766
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,330
- Dad...  - Go!

767
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,100
Stay right where you are.

768
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,700
You ruined everything.

769
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,430
People were gonna respect me...

770
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,060
Respect my work.

771
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,200
Now my son hates me because of you.

772
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,730
But this is how it ends.

773
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,830
Stay back,or I'll kill you,too.

774
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,360
It was their fault... all of them!

775
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,560
I just wanted them

776
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,730
to feel the pain that they made me feel.

777
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,300
Just put the gun down.

778
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,530
Why should you care whether I live or die?

779
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,300
Especially when you know what I've done.

780
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,960
Mr. Dempsey,look away from the screen.

781
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,230
No. I wanna see.

782
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,630
I wanna finally see... my creation.

783
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,230
Stop right there!

784
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,430
Hey there,Luke.

785
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,760
Shut up.

786
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,960
Leave my father alone.

787
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,230
Luke,take it easy.

788
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,400
Stay back!

789
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,330
Dunham!

790
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,300
You okay?

791
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,100
Luke... Luke...

792
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,300
- What did you do to him?  - No,I didn't...

793
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,000
He went into a trance and he shot himself.

794
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,330
Freeze!

795
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,330
On your knees,son.

796
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,400
I don't get it.

797
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,860
He knew he was killing those people.

798
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,460
Why would the kid protect a murderer like that?

799
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,400
Because it's his father.

800
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,900
Sanford.

801
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,100
Interesting day.

802
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,400
So I hear.

803
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,530
For the record...

804
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,560
... your agent disobeyed a direct order of mine,

805
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,260
released Luke Dempsey,

806
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,030
and then attempted to apprehend the suspect

807
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,860
without backup.

808
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,560
From what I can tell,

809
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,760
agent Dunham closed this case

810
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,360
in spite of your obstructions.

811
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,930
She violated too many aspects of FBI protocol

812
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,530
to even count!

813
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,930
She IDed a murderer,

814
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,100
contained a computer program that melts people's brains...

815
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,460
- Listen to me,Phillip...  - No,you listen to me.

816
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,460
What you're passing off as bureaucratic concern

817
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,260
looks an awful lot like a personal vendetta,

818
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,460
and if you push it,

819
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,260
I will stake my career on her behalf.

820
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,930
Are you threatening me,Phillip?

821
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,060
You decide to go after Olivia Dunham,

822
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,460
you're going after me,

823
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,900
and all the red tape in the world won't protect you.

824
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,460
You sure you're up for this?

825
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,500
I got a lotta red tape,Phillip.

826
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,730
Walter.

827
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,600
There's a woman here who wants to talk to you.

828
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,400
She pretty?

829
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,760
She's right there.

830
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,760
Now,look...

831
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,930
If you need me,I'll be right here.

832
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,500
If you need to end the conversation for any reason,

833
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,500
you just say the word.

834
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,660
My daughter's name was Carla Warren.

835
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,530
Oh,dear.

836
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,530
Do you remember her?

837
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,060
Yes.

838
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,830
I want to see you because...

839
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,560
... you were the last person to see my daughter alive,

840
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,660
and...

841
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,130
... I've always wanted to ask...

842
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,160
Was there anything else I could know?

843
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,400
Anything,anything else...

844
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,400
... you could tell me about my daughter.

845
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,200
She was...

846
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,930
... a wonderful girl.

847
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,600
What I remember...

848
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,600
... is her smile.

849
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,500
She had a wonderful smile.

850
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,400
I miss Carla.

851
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,930
Me,too.

852
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,360
I miss her.

853
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,760
I'll tell you everything I remember

854
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,230
about our time together.

855
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,730
Part of me wants to ask you

856
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,230
to explain what happened with Ella.

857
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,030
But I'm not sure I'll feel safer if I know.

858
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,860
You wouldn't.

859
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,400
How do you do it,Liv?

860
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,300
I brushed.

861
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,900
Fantastic.

862
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,400
Say good night.

863
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,330
Okay,come here and give me a kiss.

864
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,400
On the cheek.

865
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,660
I tricked you.

866
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,900
Okay. Good night,sweetheart.

867
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,230
Night.

868
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,060
Hi.

869
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,160
What's up?

870
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,460
First of all,I've had a couple of drinks,

871
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,460
but don't worry... I walked over.

872
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,960
Okay.

873
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,960
And,uh...

874
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:34,830
I wanted to say that...

875
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,260
I've never had him in my life... Walter.

876
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,860
And now,thanks to your insane freak show of an operation,

877
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,700
I do.

878
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,960
Have him in my life.

879
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,330
And I think that I was...

880
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,730
I think that I was a little scared.

881
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,130
And maybe if he... he talked to that woman...

882
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,400
Whatever. I...

883
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,730
... I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

884
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,730
You were right.

885
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,560
Thank you.

886
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,660
You're welcome.

887
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,630
Hi.

888
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,300
Hi.

889
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,730
How's Ella doing?

890
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,430
Good. Thanks.

891
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,230
Liv,she wants you to tuck her in.

892
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,760
Okay.

893
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,100
So I'll see you tomorrow.

894
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,400
Yeah.

895
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


896
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
