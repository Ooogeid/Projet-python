1
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:29,320
Hold on.

2
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,698
What floor?

3
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:33,893
16.

4
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,031
- Gonna be a nice one today.
- I think so.

5
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:45,378
Man, you don't look so good.

6
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,047
Are you okay?

7
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,254
Linda, I think something's wrong
with that guy.

8
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,647
Sir, you have to sign in.

9
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,795
Linda, call 911.

10
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,568
He's dead.

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

16
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,525
May I help you?

17
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,163
Yes, I'm looking for someone
who seems to have gotten lost.

18
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,205
Okay, what school is he from?

19
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,809
He's not from any school. He's a man.
His name is Dr. Walter Bishop.

20
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,171
I see. A special needs individual.

21
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,673
You have no idea.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,787
When the Victoria,
the last surviving ship,

23
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,695
returned to its harbor of departure,

24
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,293
after the first circumnavigation
of the earth,

25
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:09,265
only 18 of the original 237 men

26
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,439
were on board.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,234
- What happened to them?
- They all died, young lady.

28
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,202
Horrible and most likely
painful deaths.

29
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,865
You see, when you open new doors,

30
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,578
There is a price to pay.

31
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,244
Now imagine...

32
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:27,233
Tonight, you look under your bed,

33
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,917
And, lo and behold,
you find a monster!

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,544
And you're immediately eaten.

35
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,668
Now, if you hadn't looked
for the monster,

36
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:37,967
You wouldn't have found it.
And you'd still be happy in your beds,

37
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,595
Instead of being slowly digested
in the stomach sack of the creature.

38
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,714
But, with any luck,

39
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:47,268
your sisters or your brothers
might have heard your screams.

40
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,365
And your endeavor will serve
as a valuable lesson for them.

41
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,648
Excuse me, do you work here?

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,186
No, I'm a season pass holder.

43
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,936
But thank you. Dr. Walter Bishop.

44
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:01,353
They had no right
to revoke my membership.

45
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:04,493
- No right.
- Walter, you terrified those kids.

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,566
- These children should know the truth.
- Hello. Agent Dunham?

47
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,791
They're tragically
coddled and ill-advised.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,557
Have you already told Peter?

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,156
We'll be there right away.

50
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:17,882
Come on.

51
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,059
Detective, I'm agent Dunham.
This is Peter Bishop.

52
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,467
Detective Kassel.

53
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,243
We've been taking witness statements,
trying to figure out what went down.

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,386
- Is the ME here yet?
- On his way.

55
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,901
It's a dutch license.

56
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,268
Radjan Vandenkemp.

57
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,538
I've never seen anything like this.

58
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:51,123
Lucky you.

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,117
I'm gonna talk
to some of the witnesses.

60
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm agent Dunham with the FBI.

61
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,264
- I'll let you two talk.
- Thank you.

62
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,760
Did he have an appointment
here at Vitas?

63
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:06,349
No one knew him.
No one was expecting him.

64
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,599
I don't even think he knew
where he was going himself.

65
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,437
He got off the elevator,

66
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,371
- Seemed confused, and then collapsed.
- Okay, thanks.

67
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,665
It's broyles. He's downstairs.

68
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,113
He's gonna run Vandenkemp
and see what he can come up with.

69
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,776
He didn't know anybody here.

70
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,655
And this doesn't seem like the kind
of business that you just walk into.

71
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,199
Excuse me. Can I ask a question?

72
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,575
Sure, Mr...

73
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,037
Ames. Vincent Ames.
I'm the VP of geotechnical engineering.

74
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:33,415
- Will we be able to leave soon?
- Not yet, I'm afraid.

75
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,816
- Do we know what happened to him yet?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

76
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:39,904
But we'll let you know
as soon as you can leave.

77
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,802
Mike, the courier rode up with him.

78
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,320
Which one's Mike?

79
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,139
He's sitting right over here.

80
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:14,235
Got a deceased male, age 50.
We believe he's from the Netherlands.

81
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,462
Walked into Vitas Petrol
at 7:30 this morning,

82
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,839
and his veins ruptured.

83
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,047
I see. Well, vasculitis
could be a cause.

84
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:25,384
Or, an arteriovenous fistula,

85
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,585
which is an abnormal channel
between the vessels.

86
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,809
Extremely high blood pressure results,
resulting in swelling of the veins.

87
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,726
- Until they rupture?
- No, not usually.

88
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,025
But then, that's why we're here,
I imagine.

89
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,524
Don't, no, don't!

90
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:53,107
This building must be
quarantined immediately.

91
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,788
No one goes in or out.

92
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,752
I believe we have a contagion
on our hands.

93
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,211
But Olivia and Peter...
They'll be trapped inside.

94
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,636
Quarantine the building,
agent Broyles.

95
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,146
I need to find out more
about the first victim, Peter.

96
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,149
The dutchman.

97
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,807
<i>If I can find out where he came from,
where he was,</i>

98
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,693
<i>then I could begin to ascertain
what could have infected him.</i>

99
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:29,907
We don't know yet.

100
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,508
Who was he coming to see?

101
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,795
Someone up there must know him.
Know something.

102
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,713
The CDC is here.

103
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,449
- <i>You be careful up there, son.</i>
- I will.

104
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,213
The CDC is here.

105
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,459
Walter, it's gonna be okay.

106
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,009
We should get to work.

107
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,610
Why is the police holding us here?

108
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,986
We think we're in the midst
of a virus contamination.

109
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,386
The centers for disease
control are here.

110
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,741
- Are you saying we're quarantined?
- For now, yes.

111
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:15,118
What happened to Mike?

112
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,702
He was infected.

113
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:18,705
Is he dead?

114
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,169
He was closest to him.
He was right over the guy.

115
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,505
You were there too, Carl.
You were next to the courier.

116
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,897
And Devon and Vincent.
You all got his blood on you.

117
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,593
Then why aren't they sick too?
How do you explain that?

118
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,302
I don't know, Elaine. But I'm sure
it's just a matter of time.

119
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,184
They shut down the airflow.

120
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,591
I asked detective Castle
to take care of it.

121
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:45,566
His protocol. We don't want it
to spread through the building.

122
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,235
So I'm gonna need to
separate you into groups.

123
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,202
Those who were near Vandenkemp,

124
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,927
if you could gather in one
of the boardrooms.

125
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,466
It's just a precaution
until we know what this is

126
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:57,057
and how it's being spread.

127
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,589
Come on, let's go!

128
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:04,383
Agent Broyles, Arnold McFadden,

129
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,008
Field director, CDC.

130
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,630
I understand
you've got two people up there.

131
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,842
Do we know yet whether this is
the result of a bioterrorism event?

132
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,511
We're looking into that possibility
as we speak, but nothing yet.

133
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,900
You wanted me?

134
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:19,535
Let's get a team into the lobby.
Get blood work on your way.

135
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,813
Cut a two-block radius
with barriers.

136
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:37,132
I will need at least half a dozen
of those samples, young man.

137
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,030
Excuse me, who are you?

138
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,024
Take me to your centrifuge.

139
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,339
Walter has been arrested.

140
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:55,668
Agent Broyles, thank god you're here.
Please tell these men to release me.

141
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,938
He breached the security line.
Claims he's FBI,

142
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:01,308
- but he's got no credentials.
- I said I was a consultant.

143
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,065
Dr. Bishop works with us.

144
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,687
His son Peter's inside the building.

145
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,394
I need to get back to the lab.

146
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm trying to determine
what pathogen I'm dealing with.

147
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,776
I need a blood sample,
something to work with.

148
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,342
I can understand your wanting
to assist, doctor.

149
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,711
But I have a great deal
of experience with pathogens.

150
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,328
And I was chairman
of biochemistry at Harvard.

151
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:22,871
And have little patience
for small-minded bureaucrats.

152
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,331
That's not helping.

153
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:32,897
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,805
We need more information.

155
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,791
My son tells me that several people
got blood on them

156
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,028
from the infected man.
But only one of them died. Why him?

157
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,181
Why aren't the others
showing symptoms?

158
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,806
I must get back to my lab
and find out.

159
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,785
No matter what your impressions are of,
I assure you he's a valuable asset.

160
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:00,802
Hubert, you will escort
Dr. Bishop to his lab

161
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,120
with samples that you will
not let out of your sight.

162
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,205
Thank you. Thank you.

163
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,153
Quickly, get your pajamas off and...
Come on, let's go!

164
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,894
Come on, come on.

165
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,224
I can't find the name Vandenkemp
anywhere in this database.

166
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,098
But he must have been here
to see somebody.

167
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,392
- How far back did you go?
- Two months.

168
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,034
They're all calling their families.

169
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:36,940
Wanna call your sister?

170
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:39,339
Just to let her know
what's going on?

171
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,161
What do you make of this?

172
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,758
This guy, Ames,
he had two appointments this morning,

173
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,916
but he cleared his calendar
last minute yesterday.

174
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,250
But he's here.

175
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,951
That doesn't necessarily mean
anything.

176
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:58,010
And it doesn't necessarily
not mean anything, either.

177
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,201
Guys...

178
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,094
We have a problem.

179
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,954
What's happening to me?

180
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:20,636
Come on in here.

181
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:27,517
I want you to lay down and just try rest
and relax as best you can, okay?

182
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,543
I'm gonna get you some water.

183
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:30,668
Thank you.

184
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,341
Be right back.

185
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,927
So how much time
do you think she has?

186
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:45,326
I don't know, the courier died...

187
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,994
Maybe half hour
after giving Vandenkemp cpr.

188
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,688
She's sick?

189
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:54,980
I'm afraid so.

190
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,775
- But she didn't get blood on her.
- You can't be sure.

191
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,237
She was not near him when he died!
Which means we could all have it.

192
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,758
But we don't know that.
She was friends with the courier.

193
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,617
Maybe he touched her.
And infected her.

194
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,028
The fact is, we just don't know.

195
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:12,161
- But it's important to stay calm.
- Can I talk to you in private?

196
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,433
Okay, I know Mr. Vandenkemp
was here to see you.

197
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:21,670
Your schedule was rearranged yesterday
and your morning was cleared out.

198
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,621
Why was he here?

199
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,268
He came here to sell me information
from one of our competitors.

200
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,673
What kind of information?

201
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,355
All he said was it was
from a recent reserve find.

202
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,845
Maybe Vandenkemp came in contact
with the virus there,

203
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,484
so do you know which oil reserve?

204
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,153
- Which competitor was it?
- He wouldn't say.

205
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,083
All he said was,
"I have something to show you."

206
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,953
Something I would
find very valuable.

207
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,414
He was supposed to be gone
before the staff came in this morning.

208
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,291
Well, where is it,

209
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,501
- the information?
- I don't know.

210
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,718
He didn't have anything with him.

211
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,858
It's a very competitive business,
agent Dunham. I know what I did breaks

212
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,594
a dozen federal laws, but I'd rather go
to prison than die here.

213
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,448
Well, it may be too late
to trade one for the other now,

214
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,598
Mr. Ames.

215
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,069
Radjan Vandenkemp
was an oil consultant.

216
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,697
<i>He arrived at Logan three days
ago on a flight from Dubai.</i>

217
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,235
We've already contacted 174
of the 212 passengers on board.

218
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,119
No one's shown
any signs of infection.

219
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,372
- Were you able to track his movements?
- <i>He was staying at a continental inn.</i>

220
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,875
We have agents at the hotel.
No symptoms reported there either,

221
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,461
but also no indication of any
information he was selling.

222
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,437
Have you heard from Walter?
Has he been able to identify the virus?

223
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,618
No, not yet, but I'll
let you know when I do.

224
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,763
If we can isolate
the strain, we may be

225
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,868
able to understand
this virus's personality.

226
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:54,768
The personality?

227
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,512
- Walter, it's not a person.
- Centrifuge is over there.

228
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,065
<i>No, viruses are not people, Astrid.</i>

229
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,445
But they seem
to have minds of their own.

230
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,482
The rabies virus

231
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,967
can't survive in water.

232
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:17,971
So it inflicts its host
with a paralyzing fear of water.

233
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,818
Walter, that sounds...

234
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,387
Heh, trust me, I know how it sounds.

235
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,090
It's almost beyond belief.

236
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:27,505
The more we learn about viruses,

237
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,670
the more unbelievable they become.

238
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,930
They deny our definitions
of living and dead.

239
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:35,058
And their only function seems to be

240
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,685
to survive, to replicate.

241
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:39,931
And they use us
as a vehicle to do so.

242
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:44,122
It's the folly of humans to believe
we're at the top of the food chain.

243
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,561
In truth, viruses are.

244
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:48,863
The strain won't isolate.

245
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,305
- The sample was too fragile.
- Damn it.

246
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,368
I was afraid of that.

247
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,677
Well, this is one piece
of good news.

248
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,248
I believe the virus is not airborne.

249
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:01,635
No. If it were,
there'd be many more people

250
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,962
showing signs of infection
in that building.

251
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,714
We need a better sample.

252
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,891
Broyles have anything?

253
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:15,807
Whatever Vandenkemp was trying
to sell, they can't find it.

254
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,927
You able to get a hold of Rachel?

255
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:23,727
I didn't try.

256
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,137
She just went through all this stuff
with me in the hospital,

257
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,886
and she's still having nightmares
about me being dead.

258
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,046
What's the point
in scaring her again?

259
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,497
We are gonna get out of this.

260
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,513
That's just like you.

261
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,672
Even now, you're protecting her.

262
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,969
I thought that was
the point of having people

263
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,705
who care about you in your life...

264
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,905
to have someone to talk
to when you're scared.

265
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,041
She's out.

266
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:11,637
The receptionist.

267
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,881
What the hell's happening up there?

268
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:36,948
Peter, be careful.

269
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:18,486
Can't wait any longer.

270
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:20,033
Stop it!
Get away from him now!

271
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,831
I got his blood on me. If I wasn't
infected before, I probably am now.

272
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,857
- Peter, this is insane!
- They're down there and we're up here.

273
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,206
And they're not sending
anybody else up.

274
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:30,418
This is our last chance
to figure out whatever it was

275
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,065
that he came here to try and sell.

276
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:35,799
Rental car keys.

277
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,316
Never take anything into a negotiation
that can land you in jail.

278
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:43,361
Always leave it
in neutral territory.

279
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,239
The CDC is opening
the briefcase now.

280
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,143
You said his car was found
in a garage nearby.

281
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,640
- It's underground?
- That's right.

282
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,241
I believe I have a hypothesis

283
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:10,152
- as to how this virus behaves.
- Go on.

284
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,515
Well, the receptionist had
a very different reaction

285
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,538
to the virus
than the other two victims.

286
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:16,047
And I believe I know why.

287
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,247
This virus...

288
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:20,075
has to spread itself,
but in order to do so,

289
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,762
it needs other organisms to infect.

290
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,636
Vandenkemp arrived alone
at the building,

291
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:29,018
and it wasn't until he was in an
office full of people that he sprayed.

292
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,808
But...

293
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:33,439
having successfully
infected other people,

294
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,432
I believe that the virus
now senses that

295
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,310
it's contained within the building,

296
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:41,364
And... and it wants to get
outside to continue spreading.

297
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,585
The virus wants to get outside?

298
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,995
Doesn't that strike even
you as a bit far-fetched?

299
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,175
No...

300
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,135
the courier only spewed
As he approached the glass doors.

301
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,209
And from what you've said,
the receptionist

302
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,837
showed an irrational desire
to get outside,

303
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,213
and then she sprayed.

304
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,091
The virus compelled her
to leave the building.

305
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,010
It wanted to get outside.

306
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,628
You're saying
the virus made her jump.

307
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,555
Yes. Yes!
I believe so.

308
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:25,860
Among other things in the briefcase,
we found a drill core sample

309
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,744
from an exploratory oil dig.

310
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:43,461
This is our virus.

311
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:51,820
The sample was stolen
from solum oil corp.

312
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,534
By normal procedure,
it would have been stored

313
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,356
in an airtight, protective case.

314
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,724
Which suggests Vandenkemp
may have removed it

315
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:00,254
in order to smuggle it out.

316
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,488
Do those documents indicate
how far down it came from?

317
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,866
It came from ten miles down.

318
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,759
In that case,

319
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,047
I believe we're in the presence

320
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:16,876
of a 75,000 year-old terror.
One that might have been responsible

321
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,447
for wiping out the ice age mammals.

322
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,422
Some things are meant
to be left alone.

323
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,203
Dr. Bishop,
can you find a cure for it?

324
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,992
Maybe, in time.

325
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:29,719
But right now, we need
to keep the safe people safe.

326
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:31,985
Now that I have an isolated sample,

327
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,018
I can produce a tox screen.

328
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,479
At least we can identify
who's been infected.

329
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,731
Would diamonds or emeralds do?

330
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,780
- Bill Hubert, CDC.
- Hi.

331
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,573
So, how do you want to do this?

332
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,393
Two groups.

333
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,244
We divide alphabetically.

334
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,662
Okay, I can do that.

335
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,081
"A" through MS, if you come with me.

336
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,328
And the rest can go
with agent Hubert.

337
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:10,871
Call the state department.

338
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:14,442
Get approval
for a level six eradication.

339
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,106
Level six?

340
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,743
We don't know how to contain it.

341
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:24,516
If anybody on the outside
got infected...

342
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,247
- Thank you.
- No problem.

343
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:50,283
How we doing in here?

344
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:51,936
We're just getting started.

345
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,223
First up, Vincent Ames.

346
00:23:56,597 --> 00:23:58,005
Hohow will I know?

347
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:02,928
If you're infected,
the solution will turn black.

348
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,143
Swab.

349
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:09,320
Please swab the inside
of your cheek.

350
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:32,140
Amber.

351
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:34,344
You're clear.

352
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,520
We'll be in touch.

353
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,879
All right, next is Peter,

354
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:44,649
and then Olivia.

355
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,323
Ladies first.

356
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,488
Swab your cheek.

357
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,392
You're not infected.

358
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:22,063
You're okay.

359
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,197
You're okay.

360
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:26,665
Okay, next.

361
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,102
Okay, let's get
this first group downstairs.

362
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:32,218
You guys, come with me.
Let's go.

363
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,521
This is the first batch of uninfected
from both testing groups.

364
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:49,171
Nona Norris.

365
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:51,655
Lauren Nossel.

366
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,295
Glen Paulsen.

367
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:56,901
Vincent Ames.

368
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:06,205
Wait, stop!
He's bleeding from the nose.

369
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,209
- He's infected.
- I just have to get outside.

370
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,294
Stop him!
Get him away from the door!

371
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,892
I just have to get outside!

372
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,675
I just have to get outside.

373
00:27:22,063 --> 00:27:23,284
I'm infected?

374
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,138
I'm afraid so.

375
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,364
But I wasn't near anyone.

376
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:29,835
Steve,...

377
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,774
you need to come with me.

378
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,791
Olivia, please!

379
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:43,273
- Please, you've got to open this door.
- Peter, I can't. You know that.

380
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:45,071
Look at me.
Just look at me.

381
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,372
I'm fine.

382
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,828
Just look at me.

383
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,296
Amber. You're clear.

384
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,240
Olivia,
we just finished the tox screens.

385
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,700
Peter is infected.

386
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,954
The test was wrong.
I don't know how, but...

387
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,874
but he's bleeding from his nose
and he's still in the building.

388
00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:36,583
What was that about Peter?

389
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,991
The cambodian outbreak of '04...

390
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:46,295
killed 7,300 people, most of which
could have been avoided

391
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,629
if the Chinese authorities
had moved quicker.

392
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:51,812
That was level four.
This is classified as six.

393
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:54,010
Right now, it's the only option.

394
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,277
- They finished the tox screens.
- I heard.

395
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:01,609
11 civilians infected,
and your colleague.

396
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,698
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,281
So what do we do now?

398
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:07,749
Extract the rest
of the ones that tested negative,

399
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,013
and the state department
has authorized us

400
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:13,167
to have the army move
in and contain the rest.

401
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,335
The army?

402
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:17,254
It's the only definitive way to make
sure that the virus is eradicated.

403
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,394
There are still a dozen
people in that building.

404
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,903
You cannot tell me that killing
them is our only option.

405
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,386
Come with me.

406
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:26,330
Run it for her.

407
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:31,823
This model is based on just one
of those people getting out

408
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,688
and infecting someone
on the outside.

409
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,453
This is two weeks from now.

410
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,693
We have no symptom blocker, no cure.

411
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,183
What solution do you propose,
agent Dunham?

412
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,849
Walter, you can't take that off.

413
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:01,843
It doesn't matter.

414
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:04,112
The virus isn't airborne.

415
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,281
It's transmitted by bodily fluids,
blood, saliva.

416
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,125
Walter,
we are going to figure this out.

417
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,767
Peter's gonna be fine.

418
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:18,947
It's time to go.

419
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:22,729
We're taking all non-infected personnel
out of the building... now.

420
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:28,873
Walter, we'll have
to help Peter from outside.

421
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:34,649
Come on, Walter, let's go.

422
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:45,027
- Astrid, where are you?
- Walter won't leave.

423
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:46,802
He thinks he can
come up with a cure.

424
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,846
Does he have any idea
how to do that?

425
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,306
No, not yet.

426
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:53,011
Astrid, they're giving up.

427
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,556
The CDC doesn't want
to risk contamination,

428
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,890
<i>so they're planning on killing
everyone inside.</i>

429
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,356
<i>You can't be in there.</i>

430
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:04,105
Walter will figure something out.

431
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:05,887
We're gonna be fine.

432
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:11,702
What did agent Dunham want?

433
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,204
Nothing.

434
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,120
Help me drag this dutchman
into the kitchen.

435
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:18,792
There's a table in there,
and a sink.

436
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:28,656
Homo sapiens persevered...

437
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,091
100 millennia ago.

438
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:34,790
So something
must have killed this virus.

439
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:38,691
Slower metabolisms,
evolving blood types.

440
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:45,164
Unless the wretched virus
isn't organism-specific.

441
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,948
If I had an animal,
a cat or a mouse...

442
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,411
No, there's no time for that,
of course.

443
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:56,806
What can I do?

444
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,423
I can't let Peter die again.

445
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,205
And he's going to.

446
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:16,924
They all will.

447
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,445
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

448
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:28,464
Walter,
do you remember this morning?

449
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,657
What you said at the science museum.

450
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,906
That Magellan
set sail around the world

451
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,546
with a crew of 237 people.

452
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:38,393
237.

453
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:41,113
Nearly all of whom died.

454
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:42,972
Yeah, but 18 of them didn't.

455
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,081
That's what you said, Walter.

456
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:50,704
Despite the odds, 18 of them
came back to their families.

457
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,529
The rest died of scurvy.

458
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,060
A slow, horrific death.

459
00:32:56,282 --> 00:33:00,168
Uncontrollable diarrhea,
pustulous bleeding.

460
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:01,995
They all died.

461
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,719
Except...

462
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,823
We're still here.

463
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,438
75,000 years ago,

464
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:22,708
our virus here
wiped the planet clean.

465
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,940
Then life resumed.

466
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:30,823
So something...

467
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:32,620
Must have killed...

468
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:34,481
The active virus.

469
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:41,050
- Ash.
- Astrid.

470
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:43,473
Ash.

471
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,280
Mount toba...

472
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:50,161
The biggest volcanic eruption

473
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:52,511
for the last 25 million years.

474
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,674
It blocked out the sun.

475
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:57,494
Sulfuric ash...

476
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,249
rained down.

477
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:01,324
All around the world.

478
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,102
Sulfur.

479
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,086
Sulfur!

480
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,107
- That could be it.
- Where do we get sulfur?

481
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:11,429
Open the fridge.

482
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:13,676
Now, tell me
what we've got to work with.

483
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,157
There's diet soda.

484
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,493
There's relish, there's...

485
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:22,810
There's yogurt, there's string cheese,
there's horseradish, there's milk...

486
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,187
Horseradish! Horseradish, good.
Grab that.

487
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:32,328
The glycoside in horseradish
is high in sulfur.

488
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,736
If I'm right,

489
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:37,454
this should attack the virus.

490
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,087
Thank you.

491
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:29,671
Sulfide
diluted to four parts per million.

492
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,561
Then apply heat
to catalyze the base.

493
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,159
1.5 ccs should be enough.

494
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,259
<i>I got it.</i>

495
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:44,433
After we've notified
the families of the deceased,

496
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,177
We'll release a statement.
The virus has been controlled.

497
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:49,789
And we don't have any fear
of a further outbreak.

498
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:52,775
- Walter found a cure.
- I'll call you back.

499
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:54,874
This is what he needs.

500
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,705
Sulfide base, neuraminidase blocker.

501
00:35:57,946 --> 00:36:00,574
We'd need a chemical supply lab.
The closest one's in wellesley.

502
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:04,080
And several hours
to synthesize the antidote.

503
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:07,949
I'm sorry,
we just don't have that long.

504
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:09,918
That glass isn't gonna hold
much longer.

505
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,836
- What if we could buy you some time?
- What are you thinking?

506
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,295
Fentanyl gas.
Pump it inside the building.

507
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,505
Knock them out long enough
to synthesize a cure.

508
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,436
A gas truck could be
here in 10 minutes.

509
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,173
Even if we could, it wouldn't disperse.
The ventilation system is down,

510
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,556
and I can't risk sending
any more people inside.

511
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,067
Then I'll do it.

512
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,731
That's up to agent Broyles, not me.

513
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:39,154
You've got 15 minutes.
After that, I can't take the chance.

514
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,322
Yes, sir.

515
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,144
<i>Let us out!</i>

516
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:12,376
<i>Dunham, the gas truck is here.
What's your 20?</i>

517
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:15,566
I'm in the elevator,
Proceeding to the parking garage.

518
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,657
- Listen, I'm here to help you.
- Give me the gun.

519
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,232
They're gonna shoot you.

520
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:59,490
They're gonna kill us all anyway.

521
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,540
The cure is out there.
They're lying to us.

522
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,865
And you locked me in here.

523
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,326
You betrayed me!

524
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:30,866
Stay down.

525
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:39,033
Agent Dunham, can you hear me?

526
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:49,038
Agent Farnsworth.

527
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,078
- <i>Sir.</i>
- Is the ventilation system on yet?

528
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:53,907
No, sir. It's still off.

529
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:56,416
Olivia hasn't made it yet.

530
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,378
We have to move.

531
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:01,338
I gave you 15 minutes.

532
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:04,173
I understand you have
operational authority here.

533
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:06,760
But there are people in there
that are like family to me.

534
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,429
- Another ten minutes.
- I'm sorry.

535
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,796
<i>Vents are on. You go.</i>

536
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:57,954
Here, put this on.

537
00:39:58,727 --> 00:39:59,727
Trust me.

538
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,887
You're going to be okay, Peter.

539
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,266
Just rest, son.

540
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:19,404
Son.

541
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:24,272
Thank you.

542
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,403
All of you.

543
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,699
You feeling better?

544
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:43,708
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:48,191
You weren't yourself.

546
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,509
It's lucky for me that you were.

547
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:25,343
Inside... Upstairs...

548
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,099
When you said,

549
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,922
"I can't let peter die again..."

550
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,001
What did you mean by that?

551
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,352
Some things
are meant to be left alone.
