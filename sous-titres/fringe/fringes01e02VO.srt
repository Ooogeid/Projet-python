1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
what is your name

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,000
whoever you're thinking about.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,830
your girlfriend or whatever.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,230
i don't have a girlfriend.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,230
yeah?

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,700
what's in the bag?

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,200
oh, is it a pizza?

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,230
'cause i could really go for a mushroom pizza.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,230
yeah, it's a mushroom pizza.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,660
awesome.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,230
you're not married, are you?

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,660
not that it's any of my business.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,060
well, you never know about people.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,960
my name isn't amber, by the way, obviously.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,730
that's just for the club.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,660
you wanna know my real name or what?

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,060
yes, i do.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,100
very much.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,400
loraine.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,100
ready for this?

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
loraine daisy.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,730
all my sisters have flowers for middle names.

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,060
my mom couldn't even spell loraine right.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,230
what is it?

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,360
i don't know!

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
-what is it? -oh, god, what's happening?!

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,530
stop it! are you...

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,100
it'll be over in a second. hold on.

29
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,660
try and get up. try and get up.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,860
try and get up.

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,700
everything okay?

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,600
you need a lift to the hospital, i got a van right here.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,360
thanks, i'll take her. i'll take her.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,960
what's happening to me?!

35
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,560
help!

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,200
don't leave me!

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,030
i'm dr. steel, okay? everything's gonna be fine.

38
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,860
take a deep breath, all right?

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,260
you're gonna be fine, okay?

40
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,700
you're gonna be fine. take a deep breath.

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,800
now, how many months are you?

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,260
how many months what?

43
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,260
-pregnant. -i'm not--not pregnant!

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,300
hold her down.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,260
we're gonna have to strap her in.

46
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,800
we gotta cut this baby out now, doctor!

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,460
all right, all right.

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,300
v.p. 60, pulse is thready.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,560
what the hell was that?

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,660
we lost her heartbeat.

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,560
go for the baby now. give me a scalpel.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,160
thank you all for convening at this late hour.

53
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,860
43 minutes ago, we were alerted to an incident

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,600
at the wallace bromley medical center.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
while the details are still coming in,

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,830
it appears to be another anomaly

57
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,460
whose mysteries and origins

58
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
remains the sole purpose of this committee.

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,400
i called you together tonight to introduce you to my new team,

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
who will now be responsible

61
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,100
for investigating all these events.

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,900
hopefully, they will have more success than our last.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,730
walter bishop,

64
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,460
dubbed by his contemporaries

65
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,760
as a successor to albert einstein,

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,760
worked for the defense advanced research projects agency

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
from the late '70s...

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,960
until he was committed

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,330
to the st. clair's mental institution

70
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,430
for manslaughter.

71
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,100
he was never convicted of that crime.

72
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,760
but in one of your own reports,

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,330
you theorize that bishop's previous work

74
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,230
may itself be the root

75
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,030
of all these unexplained phenomon.

76
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,460
given that he's been hugging a padded cell for 17 years,

77
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,030
i think we can probably exclude him as a suspect.

78
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,630
however, his knowledge makes him uniquely qualified

79
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,030
to assist our efforts

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,430
while he remains in the legal custody of his son peter.

81
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,260
yes, peter bishop,

82
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,100
whose history of questionable business practices

83
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,560
verge on fraud.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,100
yet you propose

85
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
giving him access to information that,

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,130
if made public, would cause mass panic.

87
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,230
there's nothing we could tell him

88
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,260
that he can't learn from his father

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,460
or deduce himself, with a 190 iq.

90
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,200
what were you thinking when you recruited olivia dunham?

91
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,300
an f.b.i. agent who had an illicit affair with her partner,

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,400
a man who turned out to be a traitor.

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,660
i was thinking that a woman who didn't hesitate

94
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,900
to follow the evidence and expose the man she loved

95
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,430
at the cost of great personal pain and embarrassment

96
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,930
must surely be worthy of our trust.

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,100
i love you.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,130
who--who are you working for?

99
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,060
hello?

100
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,860
wake up--there's something you need to see.

101
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,500
well, waking up's not gonna be a problem,

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,630
but thank you for the gentle nudge.

103
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,630
pick up the others and meet me in 30 minutes

104
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,330
at the bromley medical center.

105
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,930
ah, good morning to you too.

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,200
you're kiddin' me, right?

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,630
your phone was off the hook.

108
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,500
that's 'cause i didn't want to get woken up.

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,200
you need to get your father.

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,860
apparently there's something we need to see.

111
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,400
and this something--

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,930
it can't wait.

113
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,000
okay.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,530
walter.

115
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,530
hey, walter, come on, we're--

116
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,500
walter?

117
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,330
come on.

118
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,800
tell me you're not in the close

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,700
what the hell are you doing here again?

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,630
where i've been for the past 17 years

121
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,200
is a mental hospital.

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,530
st. clair's.

123
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,660
i'm the one that got you out of that place, remember?

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,730
there was a patient there.

125
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,030
carlos.

126
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,560
he would sing

127
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,300
row, row, row your boat

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,600
every night.

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,500
funny how difficult it is to sleep

130
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,830
without that song.

131
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,530
that's nice.

132
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,160
we gotta go, walter.

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
hey, i got here

134
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,500
as fast as we could.

135
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,160
27 minutes. nicely done.

136
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,960
peter bishop.

137
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,930
i'm philip broyles, department of homeland security.

138
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,730
thank for agreeing to work with us.

139
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,600
just to be clear, i haven't agreed to anything.

140
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,830
i'm just here as the babysitter.

141
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,260
my father is the one you want.

142
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,930
nice to meet you anyway.

143
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,060
is he coming out?

144
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,530
well, that's unclear.

145
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,900
he's currently in the car

146
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,700
fiddling around with hiseat warmer.

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,630
dr. bishop, hello.

148
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,730
i appreciate you coming out tonight.

149
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,100
i've never seen a feature like this before.

150
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,960
it warms your ass. it's wonderful.

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,430
have you tried it?

152
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,330
17 past midnight,

153
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,900
a woman, pregnant to term,

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,960
was found alone outside the hospital.

155
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,760
she collapsed, suffering severe abdominal pain.

156
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,460
she's a jane doe.

157
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,160
prints and dna are being run now.

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,460
should have her id'd by sundown.

159
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,660
at 2:24, in less then two minutes after she was pronounced dead,

160
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,000
ms. doe became a mother.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,530
did the baby survive?

162
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,030
the newborn was convulsing.

163
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,930
screaming in obvious pain.

164
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,160
they placed it in a bassinet,

165
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,660
were in the process of transferring it

166
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,200
to an intensive care when they realized

167
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,260
what was happening.

168
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,460
it was growing... before their eyes.

169
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,560
growing? you mean they could...

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
see it getting larger?

171
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
that's right.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,730
so where's the baby now?

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,660
walter!

174
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,430
it remained alive for nearly half an hour,

175
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,460
this way.

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,530
finally dying from natural causes.

177
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,000
natural causes?

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,430
i don't understand.

179
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,560
what they realized is that the child wasn't just growing.

180
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
it was aging.

181
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,530
o-okay, hold on a sec.

182
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,530
it's 4:00 a.m., so i'm a little foggy,

183
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,130
but we're supposed to believe that grandpa here

184
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,230
was born four hours ago?

185
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,160
were there any calls or tips?

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,230
did the security cameras

187
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,400
see how the pregnant woman got here?

188
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,130
did she drive herself or was she dropped off?

189
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,900
we're checking those now.

190
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
dr. bishop,

191
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,130
any idea how something like this might happen

192
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,430
i think you're probably expecting a bit much,

193
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,800
mr. broyles.

194
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
celermitosis.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,060
disabling,

196
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,500
reversing cell cycle inhibitors.

197
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,930
activating them and turning cip/kip

198
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,000
and inka 4a/arfs into catalysts.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,030
ah, 92% of caucasian newborns have blue eyes.

200
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,200
yours were green.

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,530
to understand what happened here,

202
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,130
i'll need to run extensive tests,

203
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,800
get these bodies to a lab.

204
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,660
therefore, of course, i'll need a lab immediately.

205
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,360
doctor, you have one.

206
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,030
your old lab at harvard.

207
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,830
we reopened it for you.

208
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,430
do you not remember that?

209
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,830
no.

210
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,100
no, but that's fantastic news!

211
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,700
all right, let's assume

212
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,230
for a second that bundle of joy here is for real.

213
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,730
what are we doing here?

214
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,930
a series of events has occurred,

215
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,130
continues to occur,

216
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,800
that has us and other agencies on alert.

217
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,860
these events appear to be scientific in nature

218
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,030
and suggest a larger strategy, a coordinated effort.

219
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,960
it's been referred to as "the pattern."

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,100
mr. boyles, i consider myself a fairly intelligent guy.

221
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,630
but i'm not following you here.

222
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,860
inexplicable and frightening things are happening

223
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,630
and there's a connection somehow.

224
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,800
thanks. that much, i understand.

225
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,230
i got henning on the phone.

226
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,930
the hospital got a call from a guest

227
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,300
at the scarlet red motel,

228
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,560
checking to see if the pregnant woman was doing okay.

229
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,060
was she staying there?

230
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
yes, with a caucasian male--

231
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,400
20s, brown hair.

232
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
but there's no description of him

233
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,960
or the car he was driving.

234
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,230
call the motel--make sure they don't touch anything.

235
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,600
they shouldn't even go in.

236
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,830
i already called, and you're good to go.

237
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,100
the motel room's empty and locked.

238
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,300
Dr. Bishop?

239
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,430
i may need you to take samples from the motel room.

240
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,230
i need you to come with me.

241
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,360
Walter.

242
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
do you see what i'm doing here?!

243
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,900
hey...relax.

244
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,230
i can't figure this out with a girl buzzing in my ear.

245
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,100
i am trying to put these pieces together like a puzzle.

246
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,130
how this happened, how he happened to her.

247
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,560
i'm working. come on, olivia.

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,660
i can do this.

249
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,660
my limited stint at m.i.t. did teach me something.

250
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,130
Loraine Daisy Alcott.

251
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,830
Loraine Daisy.

252
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,630
that's just sad.

253
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,400
one "r."

254
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,660
i think i actually got something to sample in here.

255
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,360
it's some kind of orange gel.

256
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,660
i'm sorry about my father.

257
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,530
he's always been a little...

258
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,000
myopic.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,560
her things were left behind, but not his.

260
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,230
checking the thread coun

261
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,860
yes.

262
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,400
open the cabinet.

263
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,430
why?

264
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,330
there are gonna be sheets in there.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,530
okay, how'd you do that?

266
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,800
hey! car's right here.

267
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,900
Olivia, what's going on?

268
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,100
that's what he would do.

269
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,830
he's go to motels ahead of time,

270
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,030
replace the sheets with leak-proof medical grade linen,

271
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,630
so he wouldn't leave any blood evidence.

272
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,030
who?

273
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,760
i know who was in that room.

274
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,030
the killer. i know who's profile.

275
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,360
it was a case that john and i worked.

276
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,230
serial murders in new jersey and new york,

277
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,800
and we never caught him.

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,600
look, you can't beat yourself up

279
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
'cause you didn't catch the bastard on your first try.

280
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,660
i feel like i've been asleep for the last year.

281
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,830
every case that john and i worked together,

282
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,560
i have to go back and try and find whatever i missed.

283
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,060
okay, then, tell me...

284
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,960
how'd the killer do it?

285
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,010
When i joined the fbi.this is

286
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,630
one of the first cases

287
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,700
john and i investigated together.

288
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,130
each time, he'd kill five young women

289
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,360
within a few days.

290
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,200
he's pick them up, take them to motels...

291
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,830
and then he'd give them a muscle paralyzer.

292
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,560
they'd be wide awake, but unable to move.

293
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,630
he's make an incision here, along their gums.

294
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,430
and then he'd pull their mouths open up to their eyes.

295
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,500
okay, that's enough. you can stop right there.

296
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,530
he'd go through their nasal cavity

297
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,000
and remove a piece of their brain.

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,030
and all of this connects to magic old man baby

299
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,130
and pregnant woman how?

300
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,800
i don't know.

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,760
but there's a connection somewhere.

302
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,030
the muscle paralyzer he used was bright orange.

303
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,430
so if that's our sample, then i'm telling you,

304
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,560
this is our guy.

305
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,860
which...means he's gonna kill again.

306
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,030
i'm Stacy.

307
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,100
Boston Federal Building

308
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,060
memorial services for agent scott

309
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,800
are being planned for late in the week.

310
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,500
i know everybody's heard a lot of things

311
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,100
surrounding the circumstances of his death.

312
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,730
but i just want to be clear.

313
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,700
john scott was one of us.

314
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,530
and we pay him the respect of considering him innocent

315
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,960
until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter.

316
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,760
now, as far as any contacts,

317
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,400
our official word right now is no comment.

318
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,160
dismissed.

319
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,300
what are you doing here?

320
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,660
i left you a message.

321
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,760
i know, i got it.

322
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,930
you want to open up a 12-year-old serial case.

323
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,460
The brain surgeon.

324
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,900
i don't think he retired.

325
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,830
how long is Broyles gonna have you on special assignment?

326
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,460
what the hell are you working on, anyway?

327
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,960
you knew, didn't you?

328
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,400
about me and john?

329
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
i like to think that i have some powers of deduction.

330
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,100
i took advantage of our friendship.

331
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,930
you kept quiet, even though you didn't approve.

332
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,760
i hadn't seen you that happy in a long time.

333
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,430
look, olivia, you have nothing to prove.

334
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,400
yeah, i do.

335
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,930
I have to live with the fact

336
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,160
that i didn't see him for who he really was.

337
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,700
i have to live with the feeling

338
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,130
that whatever awful things he did,

339
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,560
i should have stopped them.

340
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,400
livy, you can--

341
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,830
mostly I just wanna take a shower from the inside out.

342
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,260
i'll get you the case files.

343
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:08,450
Stoughton, Massachusetts.

344
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,430
so i--i started working there

345
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,660
a couple weeks ago.

346
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,600
it's a lot better than the one in providence.

347
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,000
that place is a total dive.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
most guys bring me to a hotel.

349
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,400
look at this place.

350
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,830
those windows have a really great view of the bridge.

351
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,230
i don't care about the bridge.

352
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,130
what do you like?

353
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,830
i like the bridge.

354
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,530
go check it out.

355
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,530
Harvard University

356
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,200
hello?

357
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,700
over here.

358
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,260
what are you doing?

359
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,360
i'm doing two things at once.

360
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,860
i'm waiting for you

361
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,400
and i'm doing her a favor.

362
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,300
you were supposed to be doing extensive testing.

363
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,530
because a woman gave birth to an 80-year-old man baby.

364
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,700
remember that?

365
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,100
done.

366
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,360
test is complete.

367
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,260
you underestimate me.

368
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,460
which i suppose i deserve.

369
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,560
but...

370
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,030
wonderful news all around.

371
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,130
dna results confirm my suspicions

372
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,460
that the woman was impregnated by a man

373
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,300
who's the result of experiments

374
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,660
identical to those conducted by me

375
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,360
in this very lab, around 30 years ago.

376
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
so you know how this happened?

377
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,130
no.

378
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,230
no idea.

379
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,700
the specifics elude me completely.

380
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,800
so then what's this wonderful news?

381
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
because i remembered something else.

382
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,500
i remembered where i parked my car.

383
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,460
really?

384
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,430
you remember where you parked your car

385
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,060
17 years ago?


387
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,630
pi to six digits.

388
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,600
i can't fathom that it's still here.

389
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
look at it.

390
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,630
this is your car?

391
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,260
of course it is.

392
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,560
so what, you got cars stuffed with papers

393
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,060
all over town?

394
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,660
not just cars.

395
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,600
you have no idea where i've hidden things.

396
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,930
friend of yours?

397
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,760
oh...i certainly hope not.

398
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,960
come on, boy, we need to get these file boxes

399
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,100
back to the lab.

400
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,360
you may be able to reanimate

401
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
dead guinea pigs or...whatever,

402
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,930
but i can bring anything mechanical

403
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,300
back from the dead.

404
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,260
this is the last of them.

405
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,330
that'll do.

406
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,500
hello, i'm dr. walter bishop.

407
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
yes, dr. bishop. we've met.

408
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,730
i'm junior agent astrid farnsworth.

409
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,360
third time's a charm.

410
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
now, walter, we'd probably be a lot more help to you

411
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,060
if you told us what we were looking for.

412
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,260
my research.

413
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,530
sella turcica, diaphragma sellae--

414
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,330
the dural folds of the pituitary fossa,

415
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,360
in which the pituitary gland sits,

416
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,460
situated in the sphenoid bone.

417
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,030
did you just say pituitary gland?

418
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,530
did i?

419
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,360
well, that's how he killed.

420
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,900
he'd perform surgery on his victims,

421
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,430
remove the pituitary gland before he overdosed them

422
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,430
with anesthesia.

423
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,600
look for anything with the pituitary in it.

424
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,260
i'm sorry. i don't get it.

425
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,860
i mean, what's the link to what happened at the hospital?

426
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,130
advanced, rapid aging, like the disease called progeria,

427
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,700
can be induced artificially

428
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,660
by manipulating the pituitary gland.

429
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,300
"p"--pituitary.


431
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,400
all the hormones in the human body that control growth,

432
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
which is aging, really,

433
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,830
are in the brain.

434
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,600
and the pituitary gland is the boss.

435
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,560
okay. Pinto.

436
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,960
Penny--oh. ah, yes, penny.

437
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,160
progeria. penny.

438
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,530
case file by dr. Penrose?

439
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,960
yes, penrose. penrose!

440
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,460
i remember him.

441
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,760
a former colleague of mine.

442
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,160
although he suffered from severe

443
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,460
pseudofolliculitis nuchae.

444
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,430
razor burn. hell, no!

445
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,700
we ran experiments on rapid growth.

446
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,860
obviously, someone had made a breakthrough,

447
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,300
and Penrose could possibly lead us to that person.

448
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,930
dr. claus penrose.

449
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,260
he moved to the east coast two years ago.

450
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,800
he's a professor at boston college.

451
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,130
agent frances.

452
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,260
charlie, it's me.

453
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,200
dunham, what's up?

454
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,060
i need a cross check of recent unsolved homicides.

455
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,130
see if any bodies have turned up

456
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,030
with a missing pituitary gland.

457
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,630
oh, you say the sweetest things.

458
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,060
only to you, charlie.

459
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,300
i'll get somebody on it.

460
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,130
-dr. penrose. -yes?

461
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,460
agent dunham, f.b.i.

462
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
can we ask you a few questions?

463
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,160
do you drink tea?

464
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,300
the body you see there

465
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,300
was photographed only hours after being born.

466
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,500
where is the mother?

467
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,730
she died during childbirth.

468
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,200
when she was admitted,

469
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,860
she claimed she wasn't even pregnant.

470
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,000
you worked with dr. bishop,

471
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
manipulating growth hormones

472
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,660
at the end of the vietnam war.

473
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
so...what can i do for you?

474
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,900
in the years since,

475
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,230
have you shared your research with anyone?

476
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,760
i must tell you both, our work was--

477
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,500
highly theoretical?

478
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,000
but i was going to say that,

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,730
more than anything, it was wrong.

480
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,900
i resigned from the employ of the united states government

481
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,360
after only one year.

482
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,160
when i refused to continue,

483
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,230
i was harassed.

484
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,660
threatened... with deportation.

485
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,300
it...didn't feel like the america i...remembered

486
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,400
from when i was a boy.

487
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,560
which is why...

488
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,660
as sorry as i was to hear about

489
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,230
dr. bishop's incarceration,

490
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,300
i believe it is the best thing

491
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,730
that could ever happen to humanity.

492
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,100
no one in power should ever learn what he knows.

493
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,760
uh...forgive me for

494
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,630
sounding uncooperative, agent dunham, but...

495
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,430
my work to which you are referring

496
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,330
ended years ago.

497
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,260
since then, i've done all i can

498
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,530
to forget it.

499
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,030
what do you think?

500
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,530
i think you know what i thi..

501
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,830
well, he meant what he said.

502
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,500
he's not telling us everything.

503
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,660
dunham.

504
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,160
sudbury police has a blonde female victim.

505
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,860
surgical incision along her upper gum line.

506
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,060
the central endocrine gland has been removed.

507
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,230
this count?

508
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,960
can you get the body brought to the lab?

509
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
we'll do.

510
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Astrid called, he said you have news.

511
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,800
you're right.

512
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,700
the pituitary gland has indeed been removed.

513
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,000
and i may be able to posit a hypothesis as to why.

514
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
years ago,

515
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,900
when i worked with the defense department,

516
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,000
we were tasked with a program

517
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,100
designed to cultivate soldiers.

518
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
cultivate?

519
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,030
quite literally.

520
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,160
grow them.

521
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,230
it was highly theoretical, of course.

522
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,560
female eggs were to be fertilized in a lab

523
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,660
and given a cocktail of growth hormones.

524
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,160
if perfected, a baby was born

525
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,630
and within three years

526
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,360
aged to the equivalent of a 21-year-old male.

527
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,560
a soldier in prime condition.

528
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
you're telling me you developed a way

529
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,060
to grow soldiers, people.

530
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,460
theoretically.

531
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,200
the only problem was how to slow the aging process

532
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,860
once the subject had reached the desired physical age.

533
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,030
once started, we couldn't turn the aging off.

534
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,600
so you think now what?

535
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,700
that the killer somehow continued your work?

536
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,030
not exactly.

537
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,430
but i believe that someone has made a breakthrough,

538
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,230
that the killer is the product.

539
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,730
the test tube human afflicted with rapid aging.

540
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,630
to slow the process,

541
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,160
he must extract the hormones

542
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,300
from the pituitary glands of his victims

543
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,930
to treat himself, to stay young.

544
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,230
then the pregnant woman at the hospital--

545
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,100
she was an accident.

546
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,130
and the killer's condition was passed on to the baby.

547
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,760
even condoms are not 100% effective.

548
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,430
you two should be aware of this.

549
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,000
that night, he was going to kill her,

550
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
but first they fornicated.

551
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,760
had intercourse, sex.

552
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,830
okay, we got it.

553
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,130
she became pregnant, um,

554
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,960
but the pregnancy became horribly accelerated.

555
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,630
so someone must have heard her scream.

556
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,060
and he couldn't go through with his plan.

557
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,460
he couldn't kill her.

558
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,200
which is why he didn't kill this girl at a motel,

559
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,900
because he was scared.

560
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,760
and if his m.o.'s changed, then...we have nothing.

561
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,600
we have to go back and start again from the beginning.

562
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
no, this is okay. we're making progress--

563
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,860
why don't you tell her that everything's going to be okay.

564
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,230
i thought you had a way with women.

565
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
christopher!

566
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,530
the f.b.i. came to see me today.

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,460
i know what happened.

568
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,130
you got that woman pregnant.

569
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,800
son, we have to be so careful.

570
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,300
i know.

571
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,600
how's the pain?

572
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,800
getting worse.

573
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,760
yes, well, we're almost there.

574
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,560
you just need to get one more,

575
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,000
and you'll be okay again.

576
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,130
yes. yes. yes!

577
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,060
something on your mind?

578
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
please.

579
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,700
the term "on your mind"

580
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,800
vexes me with its depictive inaccuracy.

581
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,860
aw, stop.

582
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,600
would you just talk like a person?

583
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,030
-what are you thinking? -jules verne.

584
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,300
20,000 leagues under the sea jules verne?

585
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,600
yes.

586
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,030
although i was referring to his lesser-known masterwork,

587
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,800
the kip brothers,

588
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,530
in which he posited that the last image seen in life,

589
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,230
right at the moment of death,

590
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,560
is permanently imprinted on the retina of the eye.

591
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,900
also a work of fiction.

592
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,360
which is a small but critical distinction.

593
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,660
when was it you lost your imagination, son?

594
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,060
all right, do you want to play?

595
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,330
let's play.

596
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,200
the only way that we can see what she saw,

597
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,730
even in theory,

598
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,260
is if we could recover the electric impulses

599
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,860
that were traveling along her optic nerve.

600
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,900
which we can't.

601
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,160
ah, we're in luck.

602
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,330
this woman was given a muscle relaxant.

603
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,860
the drug would have frozen her neural pathways

604
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,900
at the moment of death

605
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,460
and the last images she saw with it.

606
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,260
okay, assuming we're actually having this conversation,

607
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,700
we would still need a...

608
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,100
well, i don't know.

609
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,760
we still need something that could translate what she saw--

610
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,800
something that could translate

611
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,400
from her eyes to a monitor.

612
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,860
a tv screen.

613
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,830
i'm sorry about the lab.

614
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,230
i don't usually...

615
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,760
what?

616
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,060
lose control.

617
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,600
to tell you the truth, it was kind of a relief.

618
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,630
you've been so together with everything that's going on,

619
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,560
i was starting to develop an inferiority complex.

620
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,130
knowing that walter's work

621
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,930
is responsible for all those murders...

622
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,100
i just want you to know that you're not alone here.

623
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,630
listen...

624
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,930
i can't believe that i'm about to propose this.

625
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,730
but i--i think...

626
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,330
we've actually figured out a way

627
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,700
to track down that psycho.

628
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,400
how?

629
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,160
well, we need a piece of equipment.

630
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,460
it's, uh, laser optic hardware.

631
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,260
very crazy and very, very hard to find.

632
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,500
but as it turns out, only one company

633
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,830
has the patent.

634
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,160
please, have a seat.

635
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,000
ms. sharp will be right with you.

636
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
i have reservations

637
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,900
about asking massive dynamic for a favor.

638
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,230
the corporate mind always looks for quid pro quo.

639
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,800
can i ask you a question?

640
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,760
of course.

641
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,930
before he died, agent scott suggested

642
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,630
that this was more than a coincidence

643
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,100
that you recruited me for this assignment.

644
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,960
agent dunham...

645
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,330
do you mind if i ask you a personal question

646
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,200
about you and agent scott?

647
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,960
the very last time you were...intimate...

648
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,260
were you safe?

649
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,130
you weren't, were you?

650
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,730
agent dunham?

651
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,330
ms. sharp will see you now.

652
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,960
i hope the ride was comfortable.

653
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,730
i'm not a big fan of airplanes myself.

654
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,360
despite the obvious intellectual understanding of their safety,

655
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,730
my hands still get sweaty on takeoff.

656
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,530
thank you again for your cooperation, we're very--

657
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,030
no need to thank me.

658
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,630
you know, i've been thinking of you.

659
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,030
meaning to thank you for being a woman of your word

660
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,160
and keeping massive dynamic out of the press.

661
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,500
i also wanted to say...

662
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,030
you have my sincere condolences

663
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,430
on the loss of agent scott.

664
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,260
what do you know about agent scott?

665
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,100
i know that he was your partner.

666
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,930
i've lost people close to me.

667
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,430
i know how hard that can be.

668
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:43,800
not to mention the rumor about what he was involved with.

669
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,060
and, of course, the joy of being a female

670
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,300
in a traditionally male line of work.

671
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,330
no doubt some of your male colleagues

672
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,630
are assuming that you two were intimate.

673
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,300
the millimeter wave camera.

674
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,460
travel safely, agent dunham.

675
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,160
are we ready?

676
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,800
dear, the lights.

677
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,800
goggles, all of you.

678
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,330
do not look directly into the light.

679
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,700
is this really gonna work?

680
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,060
faith.

681
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,830
never a bad thing to have.

682
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,460
this is taking too long.

683
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,560
if he's already picked up another--

684
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,900
impatient!

685
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,230
you always were.

686
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,800
as if you ever knew me well enough

687
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,230
to make a statement like that.

688
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,100
huh! you're a smart boy.

689
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,560
but there is much you don't know.

690
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,960
did you see that?

691
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
what was that?

692
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,930
wait, wait. what was that?

693
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,630
can you focus?

694
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,460
it's not a slide projector.

695
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,260
wait...astrid, can you flip it over?

696
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,000
that's a bridge.

697
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,330
i know that bridge.

698
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,700
i used to live in denton.

699
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,800
that's, um, that's sargent bridge.

700
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,930
that's in stoughton.

701
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,100
what's in stoughton?

702
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,760
the warehouse district.

703
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,500
this would be one of the last images she saw?

704
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,860
in theory, yes.

705
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,400
where would she have to have been

706
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,900
to see that angle of the bridge?

707
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,730
pull up n.r.o. online, image mapping database.

708
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,730
okay, match the angles.

709
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,800
wait, stop.

710
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,560
that's it.

711
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,060
pull out to aerial view and triangulate.

712
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,360
it looks like she's in this warehouse district.

713
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,630
the 1600 block of bond street.

714
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,100
i want satellite images of that area

715
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,700
for the last 24 hours.

716
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
okay.

717
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,030
street sweeper on the access road

718
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,760
at 8:05 p.m.

719
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,030
i got nothing between 6:00 and 7:45 p.m.

720
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,330
what are we looking for, exactly?

721
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,030
she died in one of these buildings.

722
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,230
i've got a gray sedan parked outside unit 17

723
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,830
at 8:05 a.m.

724
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,330
i've got the same vehicle eight hours later.

725
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,200
that's the estimated time of death of our last victim.

726
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,300
if you get anything more specific, call me.

727
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
you got it.

728
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
i'm coming with you.

729
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,260
it worked, peter! see that?

730
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,030
it worked!

731
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,360
so lessing...borrow... belmont.

732
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
hold on--did you say borrow?

733
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,930
did we pass borrow already?

734
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
there.

735
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,030
stay there.

736
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,630
that's just not gonna happen.

737
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
f.b.i.! hands in the air!

738
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,000
i said put your hands up.

739
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,100
she's alive.

740
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,260
is there anyone else here?

741
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,230
you have your phone?

742
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,230
yeah.

743
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,300
dial 1-7-2-2-4.

744
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,560
ask for charlie francis.

745
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,060
tell him we need field assist.

746
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,560
tell him to ping the g.p.s. for the location.

747
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,900
safety's on the right. do not let him move.

748
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,700
freeze!

749
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,860
hey, hey! back off!

750
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
hello?

751
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,830
it's peter.

752
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,400
just making popcorn.

753
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,360
walter, i'm with a woman in her mid-20s.

754
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,660
she is going into cardiac arrest

755
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,500
due to an overdose of anesthesia.

756
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
her heart just stopped.

757
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,300
do you have any cocaine?

758
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,130
cocaine? no, i don't have any cocaine.

759
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,860
oh, then too bad.

760
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,330
you'll have to shock her heart.

761
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,030
yeah, i know that.

762
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,460
unfortunately, i don't have a defibrillator!

763
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,100
hey, you still there?

764
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,700
what is the optimum voltage for cardiac resuscitation?

765
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,260
try 200 volts.

766
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,730
all right, here it goes.

767
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,860
it's not working.

768
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,660
well, you'll have to crank it, won't you?

769
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,500
hey, it worked.

770
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,300
good work, son. good work.

771
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,600
you're gonna be okay.

772
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,260
he--he should have let me die...

773
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,000
a long time ago.

774
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,730
i'm not...i...

775
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,100
i was an experiment.

776
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,960
someone...

777
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,200
someone paid him.

778
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,760
the man i called my father.

779
00:43:16,930 --> 00:00:00,000
he should have let me die.

780
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,600
that was his mistake.

781
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,100
but he was blinded...

782
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,660
because he loved me.

783
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,730
he loved me.

784
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,600
he...

785
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,830
-Thank you again for your help -that's what i'm here for.

786
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,330
i hope it served you well.

787
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,300
i'd ask you what you wanted the camera for,

788
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,300
but i respect your confidentiality.

789
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,760
well, we're grateful for your help.

790
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,560
seems you're settling well into your new position.

791
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,800
excuse me?

792
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,700
i don't think a woman of your talents

793
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,230
should be in public service.

794
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,760
oh?

795
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,830
and where should i be?

796
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,060
here, at massive dynamic.

797
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,430
you're offering me a job?

798
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,930
philip broyles is a good man,

799
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,560
and his record speaks for itself.

800
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
well, i'm sure you got into law enforcement

801
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
because you wanted to make a difference.

802
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,130
so consider this:

803
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,830
massive dynamic is one of the ten largest

804
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,960
economic entities in the world.

805
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,760
our weapons technologies

806
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,200
shape the defense department's strategies.

807
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,930
our investments sway the markets

808
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,800
and make or break presidential elections.

809
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,660
overseas, we have responsibilities

810
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,260
traditionally sacred to the state.

811
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,430
the right to direct private armies,

812
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,860
to manage global affairs into stable equilibrium.

813
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,500
you're serious.

814
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,060
yes, i am.

815
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,530
not to mention, i believe a position here

816
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,830
would speed your effort to find answers.

817
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,700
you're referring to the pattern?

818
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,560
among other things.

819
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,260
penrose took a hit.

820
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,560
forensics tracked a two-mile spatter trail

821
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,030
leading from the warehouse out to route one.

822
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,230
local pd's on the lookout,

823
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,260
and i've ordered checkpoints along the intersta.

824
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,830
but nothing so far. he's still out there.

825
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,760
listen...

826
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,260
every aspect of these investigations

827
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,200
is strictly classified.

828
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,560
all of it.

829
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,630
you understand that?

830
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,360
of course.

831
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,600
certain private individuals have been granted clearance

832
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,630
regarding the pattern.

833
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,560
including nina sharp.

834
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,330
but that clearance is limited.

835
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,960
i understand.

836
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,130
sure, but, uh...

837
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,160
i'm not clear on what you're getting at.

838
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,930
when you were with her, did she share anything with you?

839
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,600
did she mention the pattern?

840
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,260
did she comment or ask you anything

841
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,830
about the details of your investigation?

842
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,360
yeah, she did.

843
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,430
she said you were a good man.

844
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,600
and that was it?

845
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,860
she offered me a job.

846
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,260
and what did you say to that?

847
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,630
i told her you were gonna give me a raise.

848
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,230
"i acknowledge that by signing this document,

849
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,260
"i waive my constitutional right

850
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,400
against unreasonable search and seizure."

851
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,600
i'm not signing this!

852
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,230
i, however, will.

853
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,060
well, of course you will. what have you got to lose?

854
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,960
you're already committed to a mental institution.

855
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,800
you have to sign it too.

856
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,360
i'm not signing my rights away to the federal government.

857
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,130
i already got enough trouble in my life.

858
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,200
about my former colleague and his son.

859
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,400
it's one of the inherent pitfalls of being a scientist.

860
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,360
trying to maintain that distinction...

861
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,400
between god's domain and our own.

862
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,060
sometimes, i forget myself.

863
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,560
but then, you already know that.

864
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,700
what do you mean?

865
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,700
if you've read my file,

866
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,100
then you know the truth about peter's medical history.

867
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,700
i've been meaning to ask you to--

868
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,300
walter...

869
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,560
there was no mention of any medical history.

870
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,860
just his birthday.

871
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,630
i was going to ask you

872
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,700
to keep it between just the two of us, but, uh...

873
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,700
i suppose, then, there's no need.

874
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,500
zero.

875
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,800
one, two.

876
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,360
three.

877
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,360
eight.




881
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,260
hey! walter...

882
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,960
you're awake, peter.

883
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,100
me too.

884
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,730
i was trying to lull myself to sleep.

885
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,460
yeah, i'm...

886
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,130
i'm aware of that.

887
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,130
i can hear you.

888
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,060
you think you could do that in your head?

889
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,400
wasn't i?

890
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,930
i thought i was.

891
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,600
sorry.

892
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,760
that's okay.

893
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,730
just...try and keep it down, all right?










903
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,400
son?

904
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,500
is that you?

905
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,030
yes, walter, it's me.

906
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,360
just...stop talking

907
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,600
and close your eyes, okay?
