1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,298
<i>They're called
Fringe Division.</i>

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,252
<i>FBI Agent Olivia Dunham...</i>

3
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:07,123
<i>Peter Bishop.
His father, Dr. Walter Bishop...</i>

4
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:09,579
<i>They're investigating
strange cases.</i>

5
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:12,136
<i>Which have led them
to Walter's former lab partner,</i>

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,684
<i>Dr. William Bell.</i>

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,010
We have evidence
that William Bell

8
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,403
may be involved
with several biological attacks.

9
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:19,587
<i>The search for Bell
has taken them to places</i>

10
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,133
<i>beyond the impossible.</i>

11
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:23,275
I will turn this world over
looking for him.

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,590
William Bell is not
in this world.

13
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,311
I've been waiting
quite a long time for this.

14
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,322
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

15
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,745
<i>'scuse me.</i>

16
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,715
Are you--
are you okay?

17
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,290
<i>It's car v. car.</i>

18
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,536
NYPD's taking
witness statements now.

19
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:05,045
What the hell
happened to the drivers?

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,521
Hey, you caught
the case.

21
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:10,816
So who's our man?
Who was driving this vehicle?

22
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,663
<i>Walter, come on.</i>

23
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,130
<i>I don't need you
to make me anything.</i>

24
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,290
I insist.

25
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,667
You know, there's something
you don't know about me, son.

26
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:29,352
What's that?

27
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,603
That once you enter a grocery store,
you never leave again?

28
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:32,250
Ever?

29
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,974
No. Before I became chair
of biochemistry at Harvard,

30
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,477
which was after
Oxford and M.I.T.,

31
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:42,968
I was sous chef at
the Bakersfield food lab.

32
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,716
- Sous chef.
- Uh-huh.

33
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:48,948
Well, technically I worked
under Seymour Brodien.

34
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,968
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

35
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,474
He invented
the ho-ho.

36
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,962
Of course he did.

37
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,965
Walter, I want
to leave this place.

38
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,731
And I don't need you
to make me a cake.

39
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,435
I'm not making you a cake,
I'm making you a custard.

40
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:04,436
It's my specialty.

41
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,739
I don't like custard.

42
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:07,513
In fact, I've never
liked custard.

43
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:10,642
As a boy, you loved it.

44
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,144
You've just forgotten.

45
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:14,813
Friday is your birthday.

46
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,686
You deserve
something wonderful.

47
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,884
Well, for my birthday,

48
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,319
can I have getting the hell
out of here?

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,787
We need
to celebrate

50
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:24,151
and make sure that
Agent Dunham can attend.

51
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:27,028
I want to see her face
when she eats my pudding.

52
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,595
That's disturbing.

53
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:31,396
Peter Bishop.

54
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,834
What?

55
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,908
- Mr. Bishop?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,976
- Agent Jessup. Hi.
- Hi.

57
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,667
- This is my father Walter.
- Yes.

58
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,090
I have a couple
questions for you.

59
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,736
- How bad is she?
- We don't know.

60
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:49,937
Excuse me?

61
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:50,834
<i>How do you not know?</i>

62
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,811
<i>Can you just explain</i>
<i>exactly what you do?</i>

63
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,775
You're some sort
of special consultant?

64
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,911
- Where's Charlie?
- I'm sorry, Charlie who?

65
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,224
<i>Agent Charlie Francis.</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

66
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,714
<i>I believe he's</i>
<i>en route from Quantico.</i>

67
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:00,588
I'm the agent
in charge.

68
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,745
Well, agent in charge,
where is Olivia Dunham?

69
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,320
<i>Witnesses report that</i>
<i>after the crash, a man was seen</i>

70
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,589
leaving the car on foot, but
no one saw anyone leave the SUV.

71
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,791
<i>The doors are still locked,</i>
<i>the seatbelt still buckled,</i>

72
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:11,966
<i>the airbags deployed,</i>

73
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,512
but there's no indentation
which implies

74
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,413
<i>no one was behind the wheel</i>
<i>at the moment of impact.</i>

75
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:17,481
Did you check
to make sure

76
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:18,716
these skid marks
match the other vehicle?

77
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,608
Look, you still haven't
told me what it is you do.

78
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,382
You, Agent Dunham,
your father.

79
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,232
I checked with
the field office,

80
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,466
they said that
all of your work is--

81
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,966
Classified, and that
you don't have access.

82
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,488
I don't have
time for this.

83
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,251
<i>It's not that</i>
<i>I don't appreciate</i>

84
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,558
<i>petulance, Mr. Bishop,</i>

85
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,365
<i>But the sooner</i>
<i>you cooperate--</i>

86
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,874
I would love to cooperate
as soon as you can

87
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:35,721
find me an agent
who can actually help me.

88
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,827
"A New Day in the Old Town"

89
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,187
Walter.

90
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm afraid your friend's
injuries were too severe.

91
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:34,777
Oh, come on.

92
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:37,181
We were unable to restore
any brain function.

93
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,548
Patients who suffer
this kind of head trauma

94
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,458
simply don't regain
consciousness.

95
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:46,722
Simple.
Reductive. Absurd.

96
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,694
Life and death,
these are relative terms.

97
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:58,409
Contextually defined, dependent
on cultural specifics.

98
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:58,887
Walter--

99
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,268
He is undoubtedly indulging
in primitive diagnostics.

100
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,559
Agent Dunham
is not dead.

101
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,241
She's not dead.
She's not dead.

102
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,594
- Walter--
- She's not.

103
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:09,923
Walter!

104
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,968
Walter, wait, stop.

105
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,337
- <i>You can't go back there.</i>
- Doctor, please...

106
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,169
Back off.

107
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,321
I'm so sorry, Olivia.

108
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,504
Mind if I join you?

109
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,422
I'm guessing
you don't drink.

110
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:36,744
Double.

111
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:43,848
How did you find me?

112
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,492
I work for the F.B.I.

113
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,437
Where's your father?

114
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:56,448
My father is off
in la-la land.

115
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,542
Mixed himself up
a really nice cocktail

116
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:03,824
of Valium, Haldol, Seconal,
and I think Lorazepam.

117
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,505
Astrid is baby-sitting.

118
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,661
I've been called
to Washington tomorrow.

119
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,685
The efficacy of the division
is being questioned.

120
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,560
I've been informed that
our failure to deliver

121
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,104
any useable results
is unacceptable.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,780
They're shutting
you down?

123
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,636
What were we even
doing, anyway?

124
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,085
We'd sit around and wait
for somebody to die,

125
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:44,987
some grisly,
macabre death,

126
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:46,955
or for the entire fabric
of the Universe

127
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,490
to come
shredding apart.

128
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,259
We were
the clean-up crew,

129
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,960
sent in to mop it up
and make sure it was

130
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,986
all neat and tidy
for the file.

131
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,234
We were always
too late anyway.

132
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,436
That's not
entirely true.

133
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:05,489
We were too late
for Olivia.

134
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,315
To Agent Dunham.

135
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,436
To Agent Dunham.

136
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,404
Hey, Rach.

137
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,079
When'd you get back?

138
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,707
A few hours ago.

139
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:32,807
Ella's at
a friend's house.

140
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,369
You know, I didn't want her
to remember her aunt like this.

141
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,716
She had a living will.
No life support.

142
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:46,842
They're gonna do this in--
in the morning,

143
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,865
so I've just been
sitting with her, and...

144
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,673
Do you wanna...

145
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,137
Yes.

146
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,765
You know
she liked you, Peter.

147
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,233
Did you know that?

148
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,196
Hey.

149
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,393
Good-bye, Olivia.

150
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:23,028
<i>Einai kalytero anthropo</i>
<i>apo ton patera toy.</i>

151
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,581
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>your name?</i>

152
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:29,780
It's Olivia Dunham.

153
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:30,798
Do you know the year?

154
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,852
Why am I in a hospital,
and what is wrong with my leg?

155
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:35,088
You were in an accident.
Do you remember?

156
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,762
In New York.

157
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:39,961
Is Peter here?
I need to see him.

158
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,185
He's here, he's here.

159
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:46,205
I-I went somewhere.

160
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,704
I know, you went
to New York.

161
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:49,936
No.
Yeah, but no.

162
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,365
Olivia, look, you were
in an accident.

163
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,808
No, no, I was trying
to get somewhere

164
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:55,877
and someone was
trying to stop me,

165
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,110
but I went there
anyway, and--

166
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
Oh, God,
what is happening?

167
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,660
<i>Mr. Bishop, please!</i>
<i>She needs to stay calm.</i>

168
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,409
He told me something.

169
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,894
- Who?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

170
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,888
But, oh, it was
very important.

171
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,356
There's something
that I have to do.

172
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,025
Who, Olivia?
Who told you to do what?

173
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,358
I don't know, but there's
something that I have to do,

174
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,462
- and I--
- What?

175
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,597
I think that our lives
may depend on it.

176
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:19,524
Whose lives?

177
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,577
Everyone's.

178
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,238
That beta blocker.
Get her pulse down.

179
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:28,599
No, Peter, I need my gun.
Please, I'm not safe.

180
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,210
Somebody hurt me,
they did this to me.

181
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:32,754
Please, Peter, my gun.
I need my gun.

182
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,325
Please, Peter.

183
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,167
'scuse me.

184
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,163
I need to speak
with Special Agent Broyles.

185
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,738
Agent Broyles
is in Washington.

186
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:55,235
Uh, then Agent Francis, please.
Charlie Francis.

187
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:57,504
Sir, what is
this regarding?

188
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,906
Okay, I work
for you guys.

189
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,341
I'm a consultant.

190
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:02,776
I need access to a file
on a car accident

191
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,116
yesterday in
New York City.

192
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:08,782
I'm sorry, these credentials
have been revoked, Mr. Bishop.

193
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,483
What?

194
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:13,453
Look, lady,
you need to help me.

195
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:16,189
Please feel free to file a
civilian request on our website.

196
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,357
Web--
No, listen to me.

197
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,025
One of your agents
is in the hospital,

198
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,460
and her life--
and possibly yours--

199
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:21,661
depends on the work
that I need to do,

200
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,307
so you find me somebody
who can help me.

201
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,183
Okay, sir, if you'd
exit the building--

202
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,333
<i>I'll take him.</i>

203
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,163
I'm with her.

204
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,884
What're you
doing in Boston?

205
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:46,052
You like to fight, Mr. Bishop?

206
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,595
All that time in Iraq.
Mob connections.

207
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,854
You've got quite
a combative history.

208
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,725
Look, you said
you were gonna help me

209
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:53,705
get my hands
on that file.

210
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:54,994
It's on the seat
behind you.

211
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:56,259
What?

212
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,548
Something wasn't adding up
about those skid marks.

213
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,600
<i>They were darkest at the back,</i>
<i>not the front.</i>

214
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,427
So maximum torque farthest
away from the incident.

215
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:06,873
That means the driver
wasn't slowing down.

216
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,007
He was speeding up.

217
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,498
Then he must've
been waiting.

218
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,412
<i>Those are pictures</i>
<i>from the surveillance camera</i>

219
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,839
in the parking structure
adjacent to the accident site.

220
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,949
<i>George Reed.</i>
<i>524 Littlefield Road.</i>

221
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,908
Here, in Lexington.
We're 15 minutes away.

222
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:20,675
<i>All right,</i>
<i>now it's your turn.</i>

223
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,036
What's
the Fringe Division?

224
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,083
<i>What do you</i>
<i>people do?</i>

225
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,014
Nothing.

226
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,719
Not anymore.

227
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,081
F.B.I.

228
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,429
George Reed?

229
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:37,749
Mr. Reed?

230
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,022
Body.

231
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,212
Look at his lividity.

232
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:46,899
If this guy was driving
a car in New York,

233
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,626
it wasn't yesterday.

234
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,236
I need to get a ride
for someone.

235
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:55,841
Feel his anus.
It's soaking wet.

236
00:17:56,972 --> 00:18:02,743
Expansion of the <i>Oral mucosa</i>,
the eyes, and the rectum

237
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:05,418
to accommodate
rapid fluid loss.

238
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:10,154
If it's a virus, it obviously
doesn't affect birds.

239
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,474
<i>Or people,</i>
<i>at least not quickly.</i>

240
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,222
Agent, I need this body
taken back to my lab.

241
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,549
Hey, lunatic, this body's
going to the morgue.

242
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:19,542
Is he crazy?

243
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:20,294
Peter?

244
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:21,630
Who is the agent
in charge here?

245
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,032
I am.

246
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,186
<i>Take it wherever</i>
<i>he wants.</i>

247
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:26,827
Lovely.

248
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,755
Is he crazy?

249
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,398
Oh, yeah.

250
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,571
<i>Whatever Fringe Division</i>
<i>is or was,</i>

251
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,406
<i>F.B.I. says</i>
<i>it's been shut down.</i>

252
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:41,582
<i>And yet I just</i>
<i>sent you a body.</i>

253
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,583
Which does begs
the question,

254
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,226
why are you doing this?

255
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,339
Just following
the case.

256
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:51,603
It doesn't pay to bluff
a bluffer, Agent Jessup.

257
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,028
You know, a lot of people
would be scared by this.

258
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,336
Most, actually.

259
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,207
There are more things in Heaven
and Earth than are dreamt--

260
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:03,337
Oh, wow.
Really?

261
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:04,872
Butchered Shakespeare.

262
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:06,474
<i>Peter.</i>

263
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:07,490
Peter!

264
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:14,193
They said I can ride
in the back with the body.

265
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,049
<i>Can I?</i>

266
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,406
Sure.
Of course you can.

267
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:20,730
Stay out
of the medications, though.

268
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,460
<i>Please.</i>

269
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,392
Think I've been waiting
for you people my whole life.

270
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,089
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

271
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:46,992
So what can
I do you for?

272
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,105
I'm looking
for a selectric.

273
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,812
Selectric 251.

274
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,866
Doesn't exist.
They never made one.

275
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:56,320
It's 245,
straight to 255.

276
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:56,691
No, no, no.

277
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:59,166
I'm still gonna
need the 251.

278
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,005
Ah.

279
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:05,048
You're one of them.

280
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:11,582
You know,
it's been six years.

281
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:14,384
<i>I just kind of</i>
<i>figured that, uh...</i>

282
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:29,641
<i>Straight back.</i>

283
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,713
Last door.

284
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:35,778
Hey.

285
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:39,644
You--you tell 'em.
I'm not waiting around forever.

286
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:46,340
I am not waiting
around forever.

287
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:00,755
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

288
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,462
<i>As I'm sure you're</i>
<i>probably already aware,</i>

289
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:03,743
my father
was a scientist.

290
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,324
Who was sent
to St. Claire's.

291
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,623
A mental institution,
yes, but there is more.

292
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:13,307
Worse. And some good, too.
It's complicated.

293
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:14,870
But for right now,
all you really need to know

294
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:17,411
is that this building
is where he used to work.

295
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,235
He was working here
as a professor.

296
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,770
Simultaneously,
he was working

297
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:24,272
on a number of top-secret
government projects.

298
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:26,078
We do our thing
down here in the lab

299
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,476
because
according to him,

300
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,312
it's the only place
that he can work.

301
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,677
You're coming up on
your last chance to turn back.

302
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:34,802
Are you kidding?

303
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:36,161
Agent Jessup...

304
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,491
Welcome to Fringe Division.

305
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:43,325
Astrid, Amy.
Amy, Astrid. Nice haircut.

306
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:44,977
Thanks. Hi.

307
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:46,625
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

308
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,468
Again.

309
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:51,913
I need four bunsen burners,
eight metal bowls yea big,

310
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:52,829
and a freezer.

311
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:53,902
The bowls need
to be sterilized?

312
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:56,605
It's not for the autopsy.
It's for the custard.

313
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:57,706
For Peter's birthday.

314
00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,574
Walter, will you
forget about the custard?

315
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:00,809
I refuse.

316
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,389
Also rib cutters,
toothed forceps,

317
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,248
and a bone saw
for the autopsy.

318
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,074
Not for the groceries.

319
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:14,890
I got here
as fast as I could.

320
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,056
I'm all right.

321
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,178
You didn't have to come
all this way.

322
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,462
You're not all right.

323
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,330
Charlie, I'm fine.

324
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:32,339
My second year
with Brooklyn P.D.,

325
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:35,143
one night we get
a domestic disturbance call.

326
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:36,745
Partner and I
go over to his house.

327
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,580
I'm with the guy, right?

328
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:39,782
And he's, uh...

329
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,486
saying it's nothing, you know,
just a little argument.

330
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:47,489
My partner calls
from the other room

331
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,791
and says that we need
an ambulance for the girl.

332
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:53,663
And I just know the guy beat
the crap out of his girlfriend,

333
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,848
so I go for my gun,
I get him on the ground,

334
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:56,992
and I'm cuffing him.

335
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,541
And I hear a gunshot
from the other room.

336
00:24:01,594 --> 00:24:02,870
I turn around,

337
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:04,756
and this, uh,

338
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,303
bloody girl--

339
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:12,781
brutalized,
brutalized girl--

340
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:14,258
is, um...

341
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,405
aiming a gun
at me.

342
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,559
What I didn't know
at the time

343
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,087
was she'd just
killed my partner.

344
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,179
She fires.

345
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:38,086
Hits me in my chest.

346
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:43,267
Anyway, um...

347
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,848
I'm in I.C.U.
for six days.

348
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:49,652
You know, and, um,
hospital for two weeks.

349
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:53,863
Kept on telling my wife,
"I'm fine."

350
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,285
I was shaken,

351
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:58,896
and I was scared.

352
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,581
Now, if you're
like me,

353
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:11,306
you got a gun
underneath your pillow.

354
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:14,928
Peter called me.

355
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,040
Hey.

356
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:28,866
You can fool the doctors,
kiddo.

357
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,004
You can't fool me.

358
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,391
I don't know
what happened to me.

359
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,415
I'm so scared.

360
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:51,962
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>load it.</i>

361
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,815
<i>My hand won't</i>
<i>stop shaking.</i>

362
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,126
Charlie, I can't.
I can't even load it.

363
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,490
You're gonna be
all right.

364
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,524
Hey, it'll be all right.

365
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,733
It's a shame.

366
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,664
These lungs were
in excellent condition once.

367
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,234
Is the half and half
boiling?

368
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,936
Yeah, just about.

369
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:18,270
Mix the eggs, sugar,
and salt in a separate bowl.

370
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,344
Please.

371
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:23,888
Walter, there's nothing
wrong with the blood sample.

372
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,497
What are you thinking?

373
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,102
It's funny.

374
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:33,279
I love custard,
but I hate flan.

375
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,270
Which could be
an issue of semantics.

376
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:39,154
Or difficulty
with the French.

377
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,104
Which I doubt,

378
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:44,532
given my near obsession with
<i>Moules a la creme normande.</i>

379
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,901
Well, that's fascinating,
but what I actually meant

380
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:49,871
was are there any theories
about how this man died?

381
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:52,507
No, the water
expulsion,

382
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,542
though dramatic
and messy,

383
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:58,513
seems to be a symptom
of some other process.

384
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:02,350
But I stumbled upon something
that did the unthinkable.

385
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:04,880
Look inside the mouth.

386
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:09,605
You can come
closer, dear.

387
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,697
Look at the soft palate.
What do you see?

388
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,134
<i>There are three markings.</i>

389
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:21,711
Indents like stab wounds.
What are they?

390
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:22,715
<i>And while</i>
<i>we're at it,</i>

391
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,252
what do you mean
you stumbled across something

392
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:25,559
that does
the unthinkable?

393
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:28,880
It made me
remember something.

394
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:34,816
Is this you?

395
00:27:34,817 --> 00:27:35,942
Yeah.

396
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:38,586
My father recently took
a little trip down memory lane,

397
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,121
and for no reason
has become

398
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:42,388
wildly obsessed
with my childhood.

399
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:44,759
He also likes to check and make
sure that I'm still breathing

400
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,860
when he thinks
that I'm asleep,

401
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:47,153
which is
a little creepy.

402
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:49,292
Focus, please.

403
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:53,015
This is an experiment
that Belly and I did.

404
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:56,079
<i>We came up with such</i>
<i>a spectacular blend of drugs.</i>

405
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:58,758
One day,
Leary came by,

406
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:01,218
and he said,
"You're kidding me."

407
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:03,678
Is this gonna make
her head explode or something?

408
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,448
Well, in a sense, yes,
but not physically.

409
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,694
We're trying to augment

410
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,518
her fifth, sixth,
and seventh chakras.

411
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,920
Throat, third eye,
and crown.

412
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,588
That is correct,
Asterix.

413
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,756
Astrid.

414
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:17,526
Communication, speech,
clairaudience,

415
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,251
cognition,
and thought.

416
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:21,393
Spirituality.

417
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:22,125
<i>I can see Him.</i>

418
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:23,631
You wanted her
to see God.

419
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:25,908
<i>Who is he?</i>

420
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:28,328
<i>The man
with the machine.</i>

421
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:35,443
<i>The three--
the three nails.</i>

422
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:37,712
<i>The three nails
go in the mouth.</i>

423
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:39,427
There.

424
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:41,915
<i>He is a soldier.</i>

425
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:45,599
<i>From somewhere else.</i>

426
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,643
<i>He's--he's from a place
that looks like this,</i>

427
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,313
<i>but it's not here.</i>

428
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,089
<i>Oh, he's--</i>

429
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:56,131
<i>He's from
another universe, man.</i>

430
00:28:56,132 --> 00:29:00,001
<i>Oh, I can see him.</i>

431
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:02,083
<i>He pushes up
the machine.</i>

432
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:03,570
<i>He pushes up the machine?</i>

433
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:05,957
Oh, yes,
in the mouth.

434
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:10,352
And then he changes.

435
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,880
<i>That's how they change.</i>
<i>They're like shape shifters.</i>

436
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:16,018
<i>That's how they hide.</i>
<i>They can look like us.</i>

437
00:29:16,774 --> 00:29:18,892
They can look
like any of us.

438
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,056
Astrid.

439
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:24,373
I need you to log on to the
joint law enforcement database.

440
00:29:24,408 --> 00:29:25,193
We need to be
informed immediately

441
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:27,227
of any corpse
that matches that description.

442
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:31,503
<i>They can look
like any of us.</i>

443
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,074
Unsubstantiated claims
of invasion.

444
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,435
Reports of technology
run amok.

445
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,714
The old "X" designation
and your fringe investigations

446
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,050
have been indulgences
in the federal budget

447
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,518
for over
half a century.

448
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,690
Well, the salad days
are over, Mr. Broyles.

449
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,598
Colonel.

450
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,025
Excuse me?

451
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:14,399
<i>Or Special Agent,</i>
<i>as you'd prefer, Senator.</i>

452
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:16,278
<i>Colonel Broyles.</i>

453
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:21,203
Philip, listen. We all have
a job here, and we--

454
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:22,958
Yes, Senator,
I have a job.

455
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:27,209
The same job I have had in three
administrations and six wars

456
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,343
to defend our
national security,

457
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,946
and I assure you
we are not secure.

458
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,515
Yes, sometimes
a threat is familiar.

459
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:37,351
But I have come to learn
that sometimes it is far worse.

460
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:39,987
And when it is worse,
when the threat is unimaginable,

461
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,337
that is when
we are at the door.

462
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,767
And you should
thank God for that.

463
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,098
Phillip, without
something usable,

464
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,829
something to support
the human and fiscal cost...

465
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:58,090
I-I'm sorry.

466
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,115
If your appearance
is any indication...

467
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,355
Now I don't have
to tell you

468
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:17,663
how important it is that
Fringe Division not be shut down.

469
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:18,926
I'm not the one
who needs convincing.

470
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,094
But we've tried.

471
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:22,796
I'm afraid that this one
is out of our hands.

472
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,516
Do what you always
used to do, Phillip.

473
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,313
Save the day.

474
00:31:58,682 --> 00:31:59,656
Feds?

475
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,001
Yeah, that's us.

476
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,836
Well, her, technically,
but say us.

477
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,972
Where's the body
that triggered the alert?

478
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,792
The one that has
the three holes in its mouth?

479
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:08,907
It's right over there.

480
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,111
Thank you.

481
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,588
They found this guy two blocks
from the accident site.

482
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:22,456
Shape shifters must leave
the original body behind.

483
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,231
Do you remember
the girl from the video?

484
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,698
That she said
he was a soldier?

485
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,297
My father
was a soldier.

486
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,333
They do one thing,
life or death.

487
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:34,950
They stay on mission.

488
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,005
These killings
weren't random.

489
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,108
Which means this man,
this thing, whatever it is,

490
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:42,916
it's still trying
to accomplish its goal.

491
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:43,377
Olivia.

492
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,970
Oh, my God.

493
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:11,847
You scared me
to death.

494
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:16,151
<i>We've sent his description
to hospital security</i>

495
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:17,507
and dispatch
all available agents.

496
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,833
<i>If he's there,</i>
<i>we'll get him.</i>

497
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,995
You're looking better.

498
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,244
Thank you. I'm starting to feel
a little bit more like me.

499
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,370
So how's your memory?

500
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,571
Still all
just fragments.

501
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:37,498
I remember going to New York,
I remember driving,

502
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:40,067
but I can't seem to see
anything past that.

503
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,186
Happens with
head injuries.

504
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,475
People can lose days
before an accident.

505
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,295
The best thing to do is just
to keep trying, Olivia.

506
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:58,896
I was on my way somewhere
to meet with someone.

507
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,657
And I guess
someone hit my car.

508
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,054
But--

509
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,311
But...?

510
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,324
It doesn't
make any sense.

511
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:17,289
Mm-hmm.

512
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:22,737
It's as if I went somewhere
and talked to someone.

513
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:23,913
And then...

514
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:28,145
came back
to the accident.

515
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,055
Do you remember who
you were going to meet with?

516
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:37,369
No.

517
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,019
Almost.

518
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:45,933
He told me something.

519
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,151
What?

520
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:50,990
Go on.

521
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,372
I can't, uh--

522
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:53,851
Try.

523
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,303
Something's hidden.

524
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:01,813
Yes. Where?

525
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:05,307
I-I can't--

526
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,005
Where is it hidden?

527
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,692
I can't remember.

528
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:22,102
That's really all
you know then, isn't it?

529
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:23,869
Yeah.

530
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,606
Okay.

531
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:46,864
They have surveillance of
your suspect entering the lobby.

532
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:47,516
Olivia's room?

533
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:49,363
The floor's locked up
six ways from Sunday.

534
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,052
The only person
allowed in is the nurse.

535
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,578
Don't fight it.
It's over.

536
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:09,117
Agent Francis,
suspect is now white female,

537
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,784
black hair, scrubs,
gray sweater.

538
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:11,920
She jumped down
to the loading dock,

539
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:13,384
but she's heading
into the basement.

540
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:16,349
You okay?

541
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,457
Go get that bitch.

542
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

543
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,169
Charlie! Hey!
You okay? You hit?

544
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,294
<i>I'm good.</i>

545
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,217
So who was she?

546
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:17,691
Walter thinks that she was
a shape-changing soldier

547
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,137
from another universe.

548
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,165
He thinks that might be
where you went.

549
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:25,564
Hmm.

550
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,803
Do you think it's a bad sign
that I can say that out loud

551
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,568
and neither one of us
thinks I'm crazy?

552
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:36,603
She thought I knew where
something was hidden.

553
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:38,111
No matter what happened
to you,

554
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,782
and no matter where
you went,

555
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,631
Walter will
figure it out.

556
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,125
Olivia, I need
to ask you something.

557
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:54,830
Sure.

558
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:02,869
<i>Einai kalytero anthropo</i>
<i>apo ton patera toy.</i>

559
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:09,175
<i>You said that to me</i>
<i>just after you woke up.</i>

560
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,000
<i>Do you remember it?</i>

561
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:13,505
No.

562
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:16,782
Latin?

563
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,675
Mm-mm. Greek.

564
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:25,692
My mother used to
say that to me

565
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,408
every night before
I went to bed.

566
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:31,531
There really
isn't a point

567
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,764
where things just can't
get weirder, is there?

568
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:40,577
What does it mean?

569
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:45,133
It means, "Be a better man
than your father."

570
00:39:51,117 --> 00:39:52,581
Walter was already gone.

571
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,539
It was like a code
between my mother and me.

572
00:39:59,025 --> 00:40:01,020
It meant keep
your people close.

573
00:40:02,195 --> 00:40:04,100
Take care of the people
you care about.

574
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,389
Well, you're
good at that.

575
00:40:17,777 --> 00:40:20,297
It's good to see you again,
Olivia Dunham.

576
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,798
It's good
to see you too.

577
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:27,876
<i>It's time to check your vitals.</i>

578
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,630
You should get
some rest.

579
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:36,882
<i>Peter.</i>

580
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:40,315
Is it true that
they're shutting us down?

581
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:44,027
No.

582
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:51,644
Agent Broyles.

583
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:53,158
Mr. Bishop.

584
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,048
At the bar, you said
they needed to see results.

585
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:57,736
Yeah.

586
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:03,265
Walter says this tech
isn't from here.

587
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,256
And that it's broken.

588
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:05,844
But it is proof.

589
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,561
And if they can fix it,
they can have an army

590
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:11,563
who can look like
anyone they want them to.

591
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:13,052
You tell them
you can get this tech,

592
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:13,839
and they can have it,

593
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,738
but they are not
shutting us down.

594
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,601
From now on,
we're calling the shots.

595
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,160
We're done reacting.

596
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,191
We're not gonna be
too late anymore.

597
00:41:30,016 --> 00:41:30,711
After all,

598
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:33,663
somebody's got to save
their asses, right?

599
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:39,873
You surprise me,
Mr. Bishop.

600
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:44,251
Thanks.

601
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:29,921
Happy birthday, Peter!

602
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,611
Look.
Custard.

603
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:34,613
<i>Happy birthday, Peter.</i>
