1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,396
<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,243
When we were in Jacksonville,
there was a pie chart with names.

3
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:08,049
Yeah, all the kids
from Walter and Bell's trials.

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,425
I made a list.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,924
Nick Lane and James Heath.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,633
They were both part
of Walter's tests.

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,725
Of all the children
that Walter and I have prepared,

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,143
you are the strongest.

9
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,603
The storm is coming,

10
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,556
and when it is over, I fear there
will be little left of our world.

11
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:25,524
I'm not from here, am I?

12
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,235
You didn't just open up
a hole to the other side.

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,817
You brought me back.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,131
That's why I can't remember
my childhood.

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,700
- You were dying.
- That's why my mother committed suicide.

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,868
She knew.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,996
Walter, Peter checked himself out
of the hospital three hours ago.

18
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,164
He's gone.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,875
Mr. Secretary.

20
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:47,661
Hello, son.

21
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,552
Anomalous energy signature detected.

22
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:55,888
Local... Brooklyn.

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,527
Confirmed...
We've got a breach.

24
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:02,937
I was thinking, "Maybe a slow day,
it being Saturday and all."

25
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,605
No rest for the wicked.

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,171
You're not wicked, Charlie.
You just pretend really well.

27
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:11,539
- Somebody playing my song?
- Class one event, sir.

28
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,823
I can see that. You?

29
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,417
- Yes, I can.
- Clear as day.

30
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,718
Okay, people, nap time's over.

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,496
Let's go to work.

32
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:27,336
So exactly how big would the worms get
if you stopped dosing yourself?

33
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,671
They're not worms.

34
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,586
They're arachnids.

35
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,300
Sit rep as follows.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,428
Class-one molecular dissolution.

37
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,055
Numbers show severe
molecular cohesion failure.

38
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:41,100
This isn't just a little tear.
We got a full-fledged hole here.

39
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,144
- Has anything come through it?
- No data yet.

40
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,181
On site in less than 60 seconds.

41
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,439
Long as it's not bugs.

42
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,023
It's probably bugs.

43
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,985
What? Bugs like you.

44
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:52,716
On my six!

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,697
I want science and risk reports
in three minutes.

46
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,093
Site's secure, boss.

47
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:33,444
Chief, this is bad.

48
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,654
<i>I'm showing stage-three degradation.</i>

49
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:38,700
I need data that tells me
this event is contained, Captain.

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,784
<i>I'm trying here.</i>

51
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:42,799
Damn it.

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,915
We're in potential
quarantine range here, sir.

53
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:48,793
Send up a looker, stat.

54
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>The looker's being
dispatched now, sir.</i>

55
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,255
Hi. I'm agent Dunham
with Fringe Division.

56
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,837
- Could I see your show-me, please?
- Sure.

57
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,551
You ain't gonna
quarantine the place.

58
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,339
There's nothing to worry about.

59
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,355
But if you could tell me
what you saw...

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,682
Even small things
could be important.

61
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm getting decreased gravity
measurements here, Colonel.

62
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,242
Activating quarantine potentiator.

63
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,440
Agent Farnsworth?

64
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,303
Broyles. Phillip. Colonel.

65
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,998
Risk assessment.

66
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,342
I need to know
if this thing is spreading.

67
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,589
- We can't have another Boston, Captain.
- <i>I know that.</i>

68
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,681
You think I don't know that?

69
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,928
<i>Quarantine device unlocked.</i>

70
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,562
Recommendation, Agent.

71
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:46,642
Quarantine will result in excess
of 10,000 casualties.

72
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,506
<i>Warning.
One minute to quarantine.</i>

73
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:52,439
<i>Massive loss of life will result.
Warning...</i>

74
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,149
Recommendation, Agent.

75
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,841
Gravitational and molecular
degeneration are decreasing,

76
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,696
but outside acceptable parameters.

77
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:01,907
- Recommendation, Agent Farnsworth?
- Calculating.

78
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,909
<i>Massive loss of life will result.</i>

79
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,911
- Really?
- <i>40 seconds to quarantine.</i>

80
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:09,828
- <i>Quarantine device unlocked.</i>
- God, and I didn't even update my will.

81
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:12,626
- <i>Massive loss of life will result.</i>
- Frank would just spent it all anyway.

82
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,587
<i>30 seconds to quarantine.</i>

83
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,630
Recommendation, Agent Farnsworth?

84
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,357
Event is terminating.

85
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,768
No quarantine recommended.

86
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,979
Captain, you are clear.
Do not quarantine. Repeat...

87
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,897
<i>- Do not quarantine.</i>
<i>- 20 seconds to quarantine.</i>

88
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,860
We got to stop doing this.

89
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,361
Hey, guys!

90
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,261
We got something up here.

91
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:46,842
I wish it was bugs.

92
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:50,998
What is that?

93
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
These look like carcinomas.

94
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,728
There's no way anyone could live long
enough to develop tumors this severe.

95
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,753
- Witnesses have anything?
- The usual...

96
00:04:57,878 --> 00:05:01,066
They heard a tearing sound. They saw
a blue flash through the window.

97
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,510
I gave them chips
so they could get radiation scans.

98
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:05,515
See if he has any ID.

99
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,425
Guy may have had a wife and kids

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,739
before the universe sucked him up
and spat him out.

101
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,435
Poor guy.

102
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,906
That's not a show-me.

103
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,528
Check this out.

104
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:27,618
Who the hell is Jackson?

105
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,228
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

106
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:36,001
Come on, everyone.
Keep down.

107
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,236
Come on. Come on.

<i>But if you come with me,</i>

116
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,237
<i>you won't be able to come back here.</i>

117
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,549
<i>You have to make a choice, Peter.</i>

118
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,610
<i>Let's go.</i>

119
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,662
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Agent Dunham.</i>

120
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,747
There is something
I am supposed to remember,

121
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,958
and I can'remember what it is,
but it's about Peter.

122
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,917
<i>I think something is going
to happen to him,</i>

123
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,189
<i>something...</i>

124
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,065
Something terrible.

125
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:43,185
I think this is what
I'm supposed to remember.

126
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,609
One of those men, the Observers...
I think he left it for me.

127
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,667
After I brought
Peter from the other side,

128
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,780
some years later,
one of them came to visit me.

129
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,085
He told me that I had to agree

130
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,452
to never let Peter
return to the other side.

131
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:58,620
Why?

132
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,206
Because if I did, this would happen.

133
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,787
What is this, Walter?
What does it even mean?

134
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,870
It is exactly
what it appears to be. See?

135
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,191
I think my son...

136
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:13,010
is going to be responsible
for the end of the world.

137
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,141
Walter, we have get Peter back.

138
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,727
- He went off by his own free will.
- But he didn't know about this.

139
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,964
- Even if he wanted...
- How do we get him back?

140
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,857
We have no way of contacting...

141
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,693
How?

142
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:37,404
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't let you go...
- Don't even think about it!

143
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,196
- What is this?
- We believe your company

144
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,834
is manufacturing weapons.

145
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,582
- That absurd.
- I want every data

146
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:50,130
- related to the other universe.
- Are you out of your mind?

147
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,495
Stop it, both of you!

148
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,433
Peter is in danger.

149
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,805
Walter says that this technology
has a very specic

150
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,728
and recognizable design.

151
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,604
- I dare say Nina would agree.
- Dear God.

152
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,980
- What side is this?
- Does it matter?

153
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,984
This is William's technology,
but we didn't build it.

154
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,361
Nina, listen to me.

155
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,202
Peter's been taken.

156
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:16,073
You have to help us cross over.

157
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,740
The thing is, to get over there,

158
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:27,375
that's really a misnomer.

159
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,079
In truth,
the two universes are overlapping.

160
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,633
And to get to the other side,

161
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:41,162
our universe needs
to pass through you,

162
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:45,102
literally, like water passing
through a cheesecloth.

163
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,022
Our cells need to separate
on an atomic level.

164
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,879
The problem is,

165
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,106
when they come back together,

166
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,169
they don't come back together
with the same cohesion.

167
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,690
Somehow, Bell managed to
cross back and forth,

168
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:14,982
although precisely how,
we can find no record of.

169
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,185
But I suspect that
whatever methodology,

170
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,649
he crossed so many times

171
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:24,998
that he's become
like this coffee cup.

172
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,252
Molecularly unstable.

173
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,264
As many atoms in each of us

174
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,608
as there are stars in the sky.

175
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,913
It's why Belly never
came back, isn't it?

176
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,242
Because he was scared that
the same thing would happen to him.

177
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,560
I don't know.

178
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,856
I've sent him communications,
but if he got them,

179
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:47,935
he hasn't been able
to communicate to me.

180
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,349
There has to be a way.

181
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,855
What about how you crossed over
when you first got Peter?

182
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
The last time I opened a door,

183
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,224
it set in motion the ripples

184
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,835
that weaken the very fabric
of our reality.

185
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,668
To do so again could
instantly shatter both worlds...

186
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,223
And likely would.

187
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,028
Brandon, give us a moment.

188
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,270
Unlike William,

189
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,397
you have the ability to
cross over safely.

190
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,233
I can't. I mean, I can't control it.

191
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,700
I've flashed over for a few seconds,

192
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:21,698
or Bell's pulled me over,
but I can't control it, not on my own.

193
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,166
Not on your own,

194
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,700
but if there were
two or three of you,

195
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,290
a larger power suply, as it were.

196
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,794
- I'm not following.
- With more cortexiphan children,

197
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,671
their collective
psychic energy could...

198
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,373
You know, Belly and I always agreed

199
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:44,206
that primal part of the brain
which allows us to cross universes

200
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,891
is also responsible for a host
of paranormal activities...

201
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,709
Pyrokinesis, telepathy,

202
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,392
thought control.

203
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,107
And that we all had these abilities

204
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,275
until there was a moment in history

205
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,986
when something was done to us,
and it was shut down.

206
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,365
I suspect aliens.

207
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,117
Unfortunately,

208
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,700
the only other cortexiphan children
that we have located,

209
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:11,184
they have failed worse.

210
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:12,791
You...

211
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,584
are the only one left.

212
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:18,748
Actually...

213
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,299
she's not.

214
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,100
There's still over a dozen of
cortexiphan subject unaccounted for.

215
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,186
Prudence dictated we determine what
we might be dealing with in the future.

216
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,504
So you woke all three of them up?

217
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:36,929
Actually, five.

218
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,900
We've tracked down some others.

219
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,820
About six weeks ago,

220
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,078
Massive Dynamic proposed
a series of experiments

221
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,450
to help them gain control of
and repurpose their abilities.

222
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,035
These three have been
quite successful.

223
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,554
James Heath can now cure disease,
not cause it.

224
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,624
Sally Clark is becoming a fully
functional pyrokinetic.

225
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,711
And your friend Nick Lane's empathic
transfers can now be controlled.

226
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,809
Olive.

227
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:19,891
Nick.

228
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:24,072
Very good, baby.

229
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,491
Welcome to the monkey house.

230
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,011
This is new. Who authorized it?

231
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:49,787
Senate intelligence...

232
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,206
Thanks to Peter.

233
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,132
It was part of a list
of demands he gave me

234
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,148
right before I went
to secure our funding.

235
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,802
This is very <i>Mission: Impossible</i>.

236
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:06,009
I know you. You're the man
that experimented on us.

237
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:10,158
- I could kill you where you stand.
- Each of you could.

238
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,116
What I did...

239
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:15,902
was inexcusable...

240
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,000
Barbaric.

241
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:23,493
The collateral damage
has been extensive.

242
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,717
But know that we had noble goals,

243
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,095
We believed

244
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,120
that our world needed guardians,

245
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,345
protectors, that you children
would be those protectors.

246
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:39,417
We fostered your talents

247
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,113
because we foresaw
that the day would come

248
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,470
when both universes
would be in jeopardy.

249
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:48,747
So...

250
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,283
Horrible as it is to say,

251
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,535
today is the day

252
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:56,181
for which you were created.

253
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,386
What I could never have imagined

254
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,256
is that I would be asking you

255
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,385
to help me save son.

256
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,329
I'm so sorry.

257
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,985
If none of you are gonna kill me...

258
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,446
I think I'll go
and have a bit of a cry.

259
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,962
Man,

260
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,367
that's not the same guy I remember.

261
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:42,667
He's exactly the same.

262
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,827
Dr. Bishop has identified a likely spot
to attempt a crossover.

263
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,134
Brooklyn, New York.
You go at 0800 tomorrow morning.

264
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,263
- You might want to get some rest.
- Hey, FBI guy.

265
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,988
We're about to go
save the world, right?

266
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:00,143
Two worlds even.

267
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:04,522
Can't we have a night off?

268
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,283
Whatever they want.

269
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,097
Who are you?

270
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,900
I was never lucky, you know?

271
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,894
Sometimes people
need some good luck.

272
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:48,900
Tonight I guess that's me.

273
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,622
Who else do we have?

274
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,672
Sweet.

275
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,583
Me or the strawberry?

276
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,714
Both of them.

277
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,591
So what would you like this time...

278
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,894
To feel what I'm feeling

279
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,512
or what you're feeling?

280
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:19,960
Both.

281
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,372
Please, God...

282
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,611
Aunt Liv, what time is it?

283
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:07,585
It's early.

284
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,944
I have to go on a trip, and...

285
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,447
I wanted to give you
something before left.

286
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,035
It's pretty.

287
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:27,956
My mother...

288
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,500
Your grandmother...

289
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,629
gave it to me before she died.

290
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:39,062
She told me
that it would keep me safe.

291
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,183
So now I'm giving it to you.

292
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,542
Thanks, aunt Liv.

293
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,125
You are welcome, baby girl.

294
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,543
You're up early.

295
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,701
I didn't even hear
you come in last night.

296
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,538
No, I've been working a case.

297
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,458
Think you'll be home for dinner?

298
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,890
I hope so.

299
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,370
I'll call you and let you know.

300
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,763
You okay?

301
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,436
We should do this more often.
It's nice.

302
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,161
Sure.

303
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,787
Look what aunt Live gave me.

304
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,493
Even assuming this works,
that you make it to the other side,

305
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:58,241
you still have no idea how
you're going to locate Peter.

306
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:01,540
No, but I spoke to Nina Sharp, and
she sent a message to William Bell

307
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:04,637
asking him to meet us at the Grayshot
bridge in central park at 4:00 p.m.

308
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,829
I think he'll help us find Peter.

309
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,360
Massive Dynamic didn't
make that weapon over here.

310
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,853
That means Bell may have made
it on the other side for them.

311
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,688
No. I trust him.

312
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,249
In any case, Nina has no confirmation
that Bell even gets her messages.

313
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,988
In which case, you're essentially
invading enemy territory without a plan.

314
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,339
You don't know anything
about the opposition, the landscape...

315
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,009
We're ready.

316
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:29,803
We're ready to try this.

317
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,751
You can't tell me you
think this is a good idea.

318
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:39,421
I don't think that
this is a good idea.

319
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,427
Do you got a better one?

320
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,577
It was lovely, wasn't it?

321
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,878
Now...

322
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,621
faded and broken...

323
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,514
just like me.

324
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,763
So how does this work, Walter?

325
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,003
Remember your shakespeare, dear.

326
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:04,210
"All the world is a stage"...

327
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,046
Or in this case, both worlds.

328
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,996
You will form a circle.

329
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,086
I will stand in the middle,
and I will lead you across.

330
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,581
You can't do this.

331
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:22,173
- He is my son, Olivia.
- You can't do this. I won't allow it.

332
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,807
I believe I can.

333
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,844
Or else they cannot.

334
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:31,593
I can't ask them to do something

335
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,769
that I'm not willing
to chance myself.

336
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:43,275
Thank you.

337
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,777
Well, if any of you have chang
your minds, I will understand.

338
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:50,755
We were talking about
it on the way over here.

339
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,997
Maybe you did damage us.

340
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,583
But on the other hand,
maybe you made us special.

341
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,879
Fate is a tricky thing.

342
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:07,819
So...

343
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:11,889
you would want to take a few steps back,
I think, Agent Broyles.

344
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:18,049
Now, I want you to clear your minds

345
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,647
and just relax.

346
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,066
All right?
Now, ignore everything

347
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,485
except the sound of my voice.

348
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,043
Now...

349
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:29,477
Spread out your arms.
You remember how.

350
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,074
Spread them out to each other.

351
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:33,347
Yes.

352
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,039
Good.

353
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,865
Now, I want you to think back

354
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,666
to when you were
just young children,

355
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:47,694
back to when you were
just young boys and girls.

356
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,503
Think back to when your imagination

357
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:04,317
could take you
wherever you wanted to go.

358
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,300
Imagine this universe slipping away,

359
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:16,145
opening like a curtain.

360
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,618
Allow the universe
to pass right through you.

361
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,424
Allow your imagination

362
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,838
to take you to the other side.

363
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,636
Help me.

364
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,013
- Walter, what do we do?
- Look...

365
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:39,488
We made it.

366
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:49,612
We're on the other side.

367
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:52,365
Okay, come on, James.

368
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,744
You've got to get up.
We've got to hide now.

369
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,911
Nick, I don't feel so good.

370
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,937
Through here.

371
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,136
Come on.

372
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,848
I want science and risk reports
in three minutes.

373
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,390
Nick, make them leave.

374
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:22,201
I've been trying.
It's not working.

375
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:23,563
What's wrong with us?

376
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,980
- I don't know.
- Nick, I'm scared.

377
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,240
Check this out.

378
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:40,329
Who the hell is Jackson?

379
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:43,605
- Got a junior?
- Yeah.

380
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,514
Going to a strip club later?

381
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,726
Someone's got to visit your sister.

382
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,819
The paper's real.

383
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,848
The detail is amazing.

384
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:02,633
Why would someone go
to this kind of trouble?

385
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,159
What in God's name did you all find?

386
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:13,946
Nothing useful. Dead end so far.

387
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,116
Well, whatever it is you scanned
just raised a red flag over at the DOD.

388
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:19,327
The Secretary wants to see you.

389
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,381
Charlie, you ever met him?

390
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:27,253
I shook his hand once when
I graduated the academy.

391
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,682
- What about you?
- My dad knew him.

392
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:31,738
That explains so much.

393
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,854
Yeah, you don't want to
leak worms all over the guy.

394
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,427
Makes a bad first impression.

395
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:39,222
They're not worms.

396
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,932
He's waiting for you.
Go ahead in.

397
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:52,026
Mr. Secretary.

398
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,648
Thank you.

399
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,366
Agent Lee...

400
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,848
I'm sorry about your father.

401
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:02,036
- He was a good man. Fine jurist.
- Thank you, sir.

402
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:04,497
- And this is your team?
- Yes, sir.

403
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,707
Agents Francis and Dunham. Sir.

404
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,711
I understand you're investigating
a fringe event in Brooklyn.

405
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,016
That's correct, sir.

406
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:14,507
And in this event,
there was a casualty... a man?

407
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,903
- That's correct, sir.
- So far, we haven't been able to...

408
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:19,980
Agent, I believe that I may
have insight into who that man is

409
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,362
and where he was from.

410
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:27,653
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

411
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:31,744
But I think it's time you knew
what you were dealing with.

412
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:36,529
Agent Dunham, what can
you tell me about the Fringe Division?

413
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,389
Okay, I'll play.

414
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:45,526
The Fringe Division is a special adjunct
branch of the Department of Defense.

415
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:49,041
It's primary focus are natural
and environmental disasters that began

416
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,545
in 1985

417
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:52,712
with the zero event at Reiden Lake.

418
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,839
And what are these
natural disasters?

419
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,174
They're holes in the fabric
of the universe, sir.

420
00:27:57,564 --> 00:28:00,174
A-plus.
And how do you know all this?

421
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,247
I know it because I read it
in <i>The ZFT</i> in 1995

422
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:05,349
when you wrote and published it.

423
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:08,160
<i>ZFT</i>.

424
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,140
The natural decay of our world.

425
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:17,695
What would you say if I told you
that <i>The ZFT</i> is a lie

426
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,448
or a half-truth anyway?

427
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,199
These tears are not natural.

428
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,125
They are the work of man.

429
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,328
These holes...

430
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,746
don't simply lead to nothing.

431
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,666
There is something

432
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,197
on the other side.

433
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:33,669
What?

434
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,838
- Another one.
- Bravo.

435
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:38,823
- Another what?
- Another universe...

436
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,854
A parallel Earth just like this,
but slightly different.

437
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:46,557
And it was their attempt
to penetrate our world which created

438
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:49,977
the pattern of destruction
that we struggle with daily.

439
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:51,479
The $20 bill was...

440
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,897
From the other side, and so was he.

441
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:56,240
And I suspect he didn't come alone.

442
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,944
As you know,
I am not a lover of war.

443
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,760
But I have reason to
believe that these

444
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,253
invaders are anything but peaceful.

445
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,591
They must be found,

446
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:11,457
and they must be found quickly.

447
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:13,575
We'll get them, sir.

448
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,630
I'm burning up, Nick.

449
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,899
It'll be fine, baby.

450
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:52,466
Scan your ID, lady.

451
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,210
Sorry.

452
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,337
We're gonna have to walk.

453
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,088
Central Park is 59th street.
That's three miles from here.

454
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,363
Okay, then we better get started.

455
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:06,155
How are you feeling?

456
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,033
I'm okay.

457
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,401
You've been asleep for three days.

458
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:13,886
Your fa...

459
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:20,836
Walter said you might feel a bit dizzy.
Maybe you'd like to sit down.

460
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,246
I'm okay.

461
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:29,525
You must be starving.

462
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,826
I made some eggs and...

463
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
bacon.

464
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,600
Do you still like bacon?

465
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,703
When you were a boy, we...

466
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:45,027
I love bacon.

467
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:04,693
I've missed you so much.

468
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,447
- Stop for a second.
- It's fine. I'm fine. Let's go.

469
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,935
You've got to know something.
What the hell is wrong with us?

470
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,241
I suspect that somehow
the human circuit was flawed.

471
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,222
Did any of you engage in extreme use
of your abilities last night,

472
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:36,897
far more than normal?

473
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,664
Perhaps poor Mr. Heath...

474
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,625
- You've got to help her.
- I can't.

475
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,805
But if we're lucky,

476
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,379
perhaps William Bell can.

477
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,300
It's the Grand Hotel.

478
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,457
They never built it.

479
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:57,607
Things that might have been
in our world, but weren't.

480
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,062
Come on.

481
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,380
It's not far.

482
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:12,473
Coffee's quite hard
to come by over here.

483
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:14,998
It's been rationed
for some time now.

484
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,576
But Walter's very well connected.

485
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:20,677
It's funny, I...

486
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,202
I never had bacon
when I was growing up.

487
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,544
My mother was vegetarian,
so she never made it.

488
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,262
Until today, I always thought
I imagined having it as a kid.

489
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:34,758
I'm sorry...

490
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:38,393
My mother from the other side.

491
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,813
I'm sure you don't wanna hear
about that.

492
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,782
No, on the contrary. I want
to hear all about your childhood.

493
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,529
What's...

494
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:55,512
Are you close with her still?

495
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:56,877
I mean...

496
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,087
Did she take good care of you?

497
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,762
She took very good care of me.

498
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:06,772
But...

499
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,254
she committed suicide
about ten years ago.

500
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,509
My mother from the other side...

501
00:34:13,904 --> 00:34:16,112
She was wonderful,
but she wasn't strong.

502
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,615
In fact, she was very, very sad...

503
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:29,024
- Which I suppose is because of me.
- No, listen.

504
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,580
In the end,

505
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,576
we have to take responsibility
for our own decisions,

506
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,251
the good and the bad.

507
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:44,957
Your father's going to
be so pleased to see you.

508
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:48,528
He had said he wanted me
to help him with something.

509
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,243
Yes, he's staying in the city tonight.
But he asked me to give you this.

510
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,867
God.

511
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:07,921
Look, Nick.

512
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:09,816
These were my favorite.

513
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,676
Can I get one?

514
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:16,029
I don't think so, baby.
We got to go.

515
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,140
I like it here.

516
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,931
Maybe... maybe we can stay.

517
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:28,904
I'm gonna stay.

518
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:32,807
I know, baby.

519
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:35,731
I know.

520
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:39,042
Come on, let's go.

521
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:09,110
Do you see him, William Bell?

522
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:17,266
There's a water fountain.
Come on, I think it'll help.

523
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,321
Are we late?

524
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:24,139
Maybe he didn't get the message.

525
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,861
- Bell has betrayed us.
- Run, run, run!

526
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:46,288
Don't move!

527
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,317
I think I'm staying here.

528
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:10,697
You stay.

529
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,188
We'll stay together.

530
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,322
I don't want to hurt you.

531
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,399
Step away.

532
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:27,196
Screw you.

533
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,793
<i>Man down. Med team
to Grayshot Bridge. Man down.</i>

534
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:09,286
Where's the ambulance?

535
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:39,212
Dizzy...

536
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:43,122
Must be the onset
of hemorrhagic shock.

537
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,910
But...

538
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:56,628
I'm still walking, so...

539
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:59,822
the bullet couldn't
have hit my spinal column.

540
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,089
I'll be perfectly fine.

541
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:04,787
Excuse me.

542
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,273
Do you really understand all these?

543
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:22,286
Maybe.

544
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,517
I'm not sure yet.

545
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,160
Good night, Peter.

546
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,070
Good night.

547
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:17,456
I tried to wait up.

548
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,284
How is he?

549
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,713
Well, he's got third-degree burns
over 90% of his body.

550
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:29,148
He's gonna need three months
in a nanite regeneration chamber,

551
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:30,721
but he'll live.

552
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:32,951
I'm sorry, and on your last night.

553
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,967
I'm going for a week,
not until the end of time.

554
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,779
- Details.
- Might be a good day to start drinking.

555
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,689
God. I would if I could
only stand the taste.

556
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:47,624
So what happened out there?

557
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,846
Just a small anomaly
that set off a fuel cell.

558
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:00,454
It was just bad luck
of the draw is all.

559
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,566
Come on, no more work.

560
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:06,662
- I know what you need.
- Yeah? What's that?

561
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,217
Back rub.

562
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:12,719
You are a god.

563
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,679
- I'll get the oil.
- Really?

564
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,128
On your last night?

565
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:23,077
I'll take it.

566
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:56,336
It's good to see you again.

567
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,766
- How did you know that I...
- I suspected you would come here.

568
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,139
- So where were you at the park?
- I received Nina's message,

569
00:42:03,264 --> 00:42:06,648
but when I got to the park, it was
too late. There was nothing I could do.

570
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:08,314
My dear Olivia,

571
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:09,832
I know...

572
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,853
you have good reason
not to trust me.

573
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:14,906
But I'm afraid you're gonna have to.

574
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,200
Walter is in trouble.

575
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,513
And I'm quite confident

576
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,705
we don't have much time.
