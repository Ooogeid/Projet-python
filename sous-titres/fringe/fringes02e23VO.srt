2
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,128
We have to get Peter back.

3

<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

4
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:07,673
This technology
has a very recognizable design.

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,202
This is William's technology,
but we didn't build it.

6
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:12,511
Peter is in danger.
You have to help us cross over.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,264
We don't have a way to cross over,
but you do.

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,059
We made it.
We're on the other side.

9
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,747
Peter, I've missed you so much.

10
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:24,690
Your father's so pleased to see you.
He asked me to give you this.

11
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,112
This is your team?

12
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,947
Agents Francis and Dunham.

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,451
I understand you're investigating
a fringe event.

14
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:38,204
- That's correct, sir.
- I have reason to believe

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,915
that these invaders
are anything but peaceful.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,958
They must be found.

17
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,836
Run, run, run!

18
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,094
Hello, Olivia.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,666
Walter is in trouble,
and I'm quite confident...

20
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,637
we don't have much time.

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,855
<i>The grand hotel, designed

00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:09,834
Mr. Secretary.

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,425
- You said anything odd, sir.
- Yes.

38
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,011
Sir, Homeland Security received
a report of a high-priority individual

39
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,306
being admitted into the ER
at New York general hospital.

40
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,223
Who?

41
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:24,477
That's the odd part, sir.
It's you.

42
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:46,860
It's Sunday.

43
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:47,917
Day off.

44
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,418
<i>Afraid not.</i>

45
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,791
<i>I'm uploading your assignment now.</i>

46
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,811
<i>Team's on the way. We'll get them, sir,
quickly and quietly.</i>

47
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:06,519
Mr. Secretary.

48
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:11,816
Hello, son.

49
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,180
I've imagined this moment
so many times.

50
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,451
I can't imagine how strange
it must be for you.

51
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,064
I've seen the strange.

52
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,018
But this...

53
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,095
This is something else.

54
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,539
This is the last hospital
before the park.

55
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,896
If we don't find Walter here,
we'll start heading uptown.

56
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,954
How do you know
that he's not already in custody?

57
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,750
I've checked with Homeland Security.

58
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,977
I don't believe Walternate's people
have found him yet.

59
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,737
- "Walternate"?
- A nickname Walter gave him years ago.

60
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,427
"Walternate." Over here,
he's the secretary of defense.

61
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,854
- The fringe team answers to him.
- To Walter?

62
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,770
I know it takes a little
getting used to, doesn't it?

63
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,115
- Excuse me.
- How big were the bees? This big?

64
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,440
- Bigger than a grapefruit?
- Excuse me...

65
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,828
Hey, pal! If you ain't bleeding,
back of the line.

66
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,661
Excuse me, sir, I didn't realize.

67
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,871
That's quite all right. I believe
a friend of mine is being treated here.

68
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:16,422
- What's the patient's name, please?
- Bell.

69
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:18,340
Sir?

70
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,906
You go. I'll buy you some time.
You find Walter.

71
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,596
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

72
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,557
I'm sorry. A misunderstanding.

73
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,868
Give me a second.
I'll find him for you.

74
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:42,577
We're also gonna need his medical files
purged from the system.

75
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,611
Fringe authorization.

76
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,884
I purged his file. He's in bed 18.

77
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:52,791
Thanks.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,503
Excuse me, excuse me.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

79
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,522
I have it.

80
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,299
You're agents. Fringe division.
You work for the Secretary.

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,096
- Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush.
- I'd imagine you would be.

82
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,554
Chaotic times, aren't they?
Chaotic times indeed.

83
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm terribly sorry.

84
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:10,392
The secretary and I are old friends.
I'm William Bell.

85
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,578
I see you're carrying
76 pulse side arms.

86
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:16,784
- I designed those, you know.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Bell, but we have to...

87
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,403
The 76 models don't
have the phase repeater.

88
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,819
That's a design flaw.

89
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:26,700
It is you, isn't it?

90
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,840
Yes, Walter.

91
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,831
- Prove it.
- Come on. We don't have time for this.

92
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,126
Yes, it is you.
That's wonderful. Hi.

93
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:37,670
Hi.

94
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,690
They also don't have
the pulse function.

95
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:41,590
Which I am putting in the 77.

96
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,258
Excuse me, sir.

97
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,684
Walter, can you walk?

98
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,536
I can dance, if you like.

99
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:56,196
They have absolutely
fabulous drugs here, Olivia.

100
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,487
I feel great. And look, look.

101
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:01,895
Accelerated healing techniques.
It's miraculous.

102
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,363
Okay, come on, Walter.
Bell's waiting for us.

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,651
- Bell is here?
- Yes. Yes, he is.

104
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,828
That's nice of him
to finally show up.

105
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:17,014
Here.

106
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:20,690
Clothes are gone.

107
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:23,257
He was wounded.

108
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,635
- I'll lock down the hospital.
- You looking for something?

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,845
I need the security footage
for this unit. Now.

110
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,398
- Hello, William.
- Walter.

111
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,067
- I see you've aged.
- It appears I'm not the only one.

112
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,027
Get in.

113
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,069
You okay?

114
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,059
Looks like you just saw a ghost.

Thank you.

121
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:45,344
- What's the red?
- That's the quarantine areas.

122
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:48,684
Boston?

123
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:50,513
Most all of them.

124
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:53,958
Because of what that man did.

125
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,183
The man who stole you.

126
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,522
That's a lot of blame
to place on just one man.

127
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,933
It's true, I'm afraid.

128
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:07,220
When our two universes
first interacted,

129
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,810
it caused soft spots
on the other side.

130
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,008
But it was much worse here.

131
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:16,203
The laws of physics were
turned into mere suggestions.

132
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,165
But I'm hoping
you can change all that.

133
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,790
I don't know what
you heard about me, but...

134
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,839
changing the laws of physics
might be slightly above my abilities.

135
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,379
That's fair enough.

136
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,435
But there have been

137
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:38,322
breakthroughs on the the other side
in science and engineering that...

138
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,061
that we haven't achieved yet.

139
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,268
And these are things
that you understand.

140
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,942
The schematic I left
with your mother...

141
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:48,989
Yeah, I looked at them, and...

142
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,698
Whatever it is, it's unlike
anything I've ever seen before.

143
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,725
So what is it?

144
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,234
It's very old tech.

145
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,624
It's something that...

146
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,503
I believe can be applied to heal
the problems of this world...

147
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,210
of your world.

148
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,148
I've...

149
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,871
replaced missing parts
with new equipment,

150
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:13,719
but, unfortunately,
it still doesn't work.

151
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,181
My engineers tell me
that the problem

152
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:18,951
probably lies

153
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,810
in the power source.

154
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,489
I was hoping
that you would have a look at it.

155
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,774
Of course I would.

156
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,737
Peter, I know it wasn't easy...

157
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,698
Making the choice to come home.

158
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,354
But I'm very glad you did.

159
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,749
Sir, Agent Dunham is here.
She doesn't have an appointment.

160
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,644
- Tell her...
- Olivia's here?

161
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:47,836
Send her in.

162
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,039
Agent Dunham.

163
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:00,947
- Sir.
- This is Peter.

164
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:03,602
Thank you, major.

165
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,778
Do I have something in my teeth?

166
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,371
No, you remind me
of somebody I know.

167
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,545
But your hair is different.

168
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,254
Think I like yours better.

169
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,792
Would you excuse us, please, Peter?

170
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,727
I need to speak to Agent Dunham.

171
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,515
I'll be out in a moment
to show you around.

172
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,575
Agent.

173
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,581
We lost him at the hospital, sir.

174
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,979
- We think he had help escaping.
- That's not why you're here, is it?

175
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,480
No, it is not.

176
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,346
I told you there would be invaders
coming over from the other side,

177
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,270
but I didn't tell you
they would be us.

178
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:54,889
No, you did not.

179
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,782
They're our doubles,

180
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,427
Alternate versions of ourselves,
but don't be deceived, Olivia.

181
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:04,454
They're monsters in our skin.

182
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:08,917
They'll do and say anything to gain
our trust, but they can't be trusted.

183
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:11,704
That man.

184
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,123
He knows me.

185
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,424
Or her.

186
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,011
That's why he was staring at me.
Is he from the other side?

187
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:23,177
That man... Is my son.

188
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,102
Your son who was
kidnapped 20 years ago?

189
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,054
Yes.

190
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,314
Kidnapped by them.

191
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,233
May I ask a favor of you?

192
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,634
They had cameras everywhere.

193
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,714
We must be on the hospital
surveillance tapes.

194
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,791
Which means we are fugitives.

195
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,333
Double breaded for a big crunch.
It's so good.

196
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,839
Tastes just like on our side.

197
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,091
It was Wednesday, 1983,

198
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,946
when I happened to identify the last

199
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,159
of the 11 secret herbs and spices.

200
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,490
I think that we should split up.
I can look for Peter faster

201
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,154
- if I'm on my own.
- We have a larger problem.

202
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,297
Without Mr. Lane and the others,

203
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,404
we won't be able to
cross back to our side.

204
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,215
Olivia can still open the door.

205
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,242
That's her gift, is it not?

206
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,995
I don't know how much of a toll

207
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,906
crossing over took on her.

208
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:32,125
You may be able to open a crack,

209
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,631
but without the others
to enhance your power...

210
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,458
- That's it, then.
- What?

211
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,962
We need a doorstop.

212
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,577
Something to hold the door open

213
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,847
Where Olivia has already
provided a crack.

214
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,946
- You could build one, Walter.
- A doorstop!

215
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:54,213
I'd need a particle accelerator.
I don't think they exactly sell those

216
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,179
- at the local drugstore.
- No.

217
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,235
But I think I know
where we could get one.

218
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:00,374
Of course.

219
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,487
I'm sure you opened Massive Dynamic
on this side as well.

220
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,951
- As a matter of fact, I did not.
- To get rich and famous

221
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,044
while I was rotting
away in a padded cell.

222
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,744
Walter, will you please...

223
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,333
Come on, you can work
this out another time.

224
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,175
You build a doorstop, if you can.

225
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,714
I'm gonna go look for Peter.
Do you have a cell phone?

226
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,281
They monitor all the
communications networks.

227
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:24,737
That's probably how they
knew about central park.

228
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,597
It's safest if we don't try to
communicate with one another.

229
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,279
We'll meet back
at the opera house in 12 hours.

230
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,102
Be careful.

231
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:38,163
We've accomplished
a lot together, Walter.

232
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,884
But she may be our
greatest achievement.

233
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,620
The secretary thinks
you'll be comfortable here.

234
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,053
Thanks.

235
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,946
So, it's UV-proof glass.

236
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,778
State-of-the-art anti-fire tech.

237
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,688
There's viral purging,

238
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,515
Air filtration, and there's a gym
and a pool upstairs.

239
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:15,562
The secretary's gonna send a car to pick
you up at 8:00, take you to dinner.

240
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,866
What was it like on the other side?

241
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,609
Secretary told me.

242
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,577
A lot like it is here.

243
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,299
Just...

244
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,199
slightly different.

245
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:39,341
It's subtle,
but definitely different.

246
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,307
You know, when people find
out that you're back...

247
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,427
you're gonna be famous.

248
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:49,429
What do you mean?

249
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,224
Well, your kidnapping.
It's a famous story.

250
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,850
I'm like the Lindbergh baby?

251
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,935
The what?

252
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,370
Nothing.

253
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:07,781
What's she like?

254
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,246
Who?

255
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:12,702
Me.

256
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,723
She's a lot like you.

257
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,961
Darker in the eyes, maybe.

258
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,704
She's always trying to
make up for something.

259
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,913
Right some imaginary wrong.

260
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,470
Haunted, I guess.

261
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,122
Maybe she's nothing like you at all.

262
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:46,559
Thanks for the ride.

263
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:48,600
Of course.

264
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,672
Am I responsible for this?

265
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:09,990
Yes, Walter.

266
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:12,816
I'm afraid you are.

267
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,267
Of course.

268
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,320
At one time,

269
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,657
Walternate was intent on finding
a means to cross between universes.

270
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,812
Just as you were.

271
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,203
He didn't succeed, but...

272
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,162
it stands to reason
the technology we need

273
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,683
might be here.

274
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,966
Didn't Walternate work with you?

275
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,545
Or, rather, the William Bell
from this side?

276
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,963
Walternate? No.

277
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,310
It seems that William Bell on this side
was killed in a car accident

278
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:34,552
as a young man.

279
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,533
Over here...

280
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,236
the other you and the other me

281
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,150
never had occasion to meet.

282
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,392
What a shame.

283
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:47,524
Imagine how much money you could
have made if there were two of you.

284
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,260
Creating massive dynamic

285
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,344
was not my idea, Walter.

286
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,830
We both talked about borrowing this
world's technologies to help our own.

287
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,719
You didn't help the world, William.

288
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,611
You helped yourself.

289
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,652
You pilfered this world for profit.

290
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,445
As a byproduct, yes.
Let's remember,

291
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,468
the only reason I came back
over here was to prevent a war.

292
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,081
And to stop a chain of events

293
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,265
set into motion
the day you stole Peter!

294
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,482
A little truth, if you please.

295
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,855
You say you want to prevent
the war while you quietly fuel it.

296
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,475
I know th you helped craft
the shapeshifters.

297
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,027
Your design signature
is all over it.

298
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,176
I had little choice.

299
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,880
If I wanted to keep
tabs on walternate,

300
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:39,659
I had to remain valuable to him.

301
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:45,493
I've lost...

302
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:49,485
17 years in a mental institution,
William.

303
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,982
17 years!

304
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,478
And even now, I'm...

305
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,844
I'm still incomplete.

306
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,571
I forget things.
Names.

307
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,762
Places.

308
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,365
Connections that I used to be able
to make so easily. They just...

309
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,566
they just dangle,
just outside of my reach.

310
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,861
I know what you did to me.

311
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,157
I know that you cut out
pieces of my brain.

312
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,993
- Walter...
- What kind of man could do that?

313
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,024
You robbed me
of my memories of my wife,

314
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,081
of my son, of my past!

315
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,284
Walter!

316
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,704
I believe you've found
what we're looking for.

317
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,223
We should get started.

318
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:29,477
How did you... We both leave
our hide-a-key in the same place.

319
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,809
This should do.

320
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,819
With some modifications,
this should act as a doorstop.

321
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,261
Yes.

322
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:43,132
Now, we need to simultaneously
amply and limit

323
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:45,243
the molecular
destabilization margins.

324
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:49,696
Well, we should try not
to electrocute everyone in the process.

325
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,328
Well...

326
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,456
This will reopen
the crack in the door.

327
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,901
But without the others,
I'm not sure that Olivia

328
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,966
will be strong enough
to keep it open.

329
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,213
Well...

330
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,386
Leave that to me.

331
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,521
Now, I need your help.

332
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,104
Well, you have
a funny way of asking.

333
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,487
Okay, I need you
to take me to Peter bishop.

334
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,276
I assume that you know where he is.

335
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:22,947
Don't.

336
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,733
It's getting heavy.

337
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,901
Is that mom?

338
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:36,984
Yeah.

339
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,255
She's alive?

340
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,010
What is she like?

341
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:49,390
Well, the last few years
have been hard for her

342
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:57,506
my sister died during childbirth.

343
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,446
You have a sister too?

344
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,386
And a niece.

345
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:09,327
Ella.

346
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,735
She's seven.

347
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,283
Ella.

348
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:20,640
I need to speak to Peter bishop.

349
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,800
He's in danger here,
and he needs to understand that.

350
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,224
This isn't just an assignment,
is it?

351
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,956
Are you two a couple?

352
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:38,022
Is that what this is about...

353
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,947
Please, I need to speak to him.

354
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,279
You gotta trust me.

355
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,394
I'm you.

356
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:52,723
- You haven't answered my question.
- What question?

357
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,581
Why did you remove my memories?

358
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:00,378
- I had my reasons.
- Belly...

359
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,599
Walter...

360
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,979
Let the past be the past.

361
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,510
We have less than four hours
to get back.

362
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:08,821
We should go.

363
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,132
Will you help me?

364
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,413
Stop. Stop.

365
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,599
I was just getting my keys.

366
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:42,957
Put it down.

367
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,562
You keep your backup gun
in your purse, don't you?

368
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,193
I keep mine in my jacket.

369
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,185
Now put your gun
slowly down on the table.

370
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:34,806
I thought we had an agreement.

371
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:38,572
You know, I don't know what you are,

372
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:40,696
but you are nothin' like me.

373
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,251
You know, he was right.

374
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:49,821
Call fringe. This is Dunham.

375
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:44,726
Hey, Liv.

376
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:50,524
I tried your cuff a couple of times.
Everything okay?

377
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,639
Yeah.

378
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:56,220
What's up, Charlie?

379
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,659
Got a power surge
at the secretary's old lab.

380
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:02,203
So Broyles wants us
to go and check it out.

381
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,914
You sure you're okay?

382
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,147
The secretary just called.

383
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,885
He wants us to move Peter bishop.

384
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,923
- Apparently, he's not safe where he is.
- They found Peter bishop?

385
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,306
Yeah.

386
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,018
Object is totally unresponsive.

387
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:26,769
But there's nothing wrong with it.
There's no...

388
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,910
Obvious damage to the structure.
And yet...

389
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:33,958
Somehow it just feels incomplete.

390
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,823
All right, this is
gonna sound crazy. In fact...

391
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,353
This is kind of crazy. But...

392
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:45,921
what if...

393
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,811
the object was symbiotic in nature?

394
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,898
Which is to say that it
wasn't entirely mechanical,

395
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:54,308
that it needed some sort of...

396
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:57,732
So sort organic interface?

397
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:13,343
So how much do you know?

398
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,782
How did they find him?

399
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,542
I don't know.

400
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,306
After all these years.

401
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,910
Can you imagine when
the tabloids get hold of this?

402
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,581
You know, I think it
has something to do

403
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,226
with why these people have
come from the other side.

404
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,590
Yeah, I suppose so.

405
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,589
- Have we got any new leads?
- No, nothing new.

406
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,317
I gotta tell you, Livvy,

407
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,927
this job isn't what
it was ten years ago.

408
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,097
You got alternate universes.

409
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:49,313
I an, it just... Just wasn't part
of my training, you know?

410
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,271
I mean, how are we supposed
to fight these people?

411
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:55,548
Truth is, Livvy,

412
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,670
this makes me feel obsolete,
you know?

413
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,881
The parameters are human...

414
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:21,457
a reflection of the human genome.

415
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,427
The spectrum isn't random.

416
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,772
In fact, the specificity
of the configuration would seem

417
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,488
to suggest that the object

418
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,451
would only respond
to a subset of people.

419
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,854
And a narrow subset at that.

420
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:37,812
A subset of one.

421
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,879
Me.

422
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,297
It's pleasure to meet you.

423
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,427
Come on in.
What can I do for you guys?

424
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,845
- We're concerned for your safety.
- What's this?

425
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,140
This was given to me by an acquaintance
of your father. An observer.

426
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,142
An observer?

427
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,139
He gave it to me, I think, to warm me
about what would happen to you

428
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:16,327
- if you ever returned here.
- What's going on?

429
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:19,427
He wants you to know that your friends
are here and that they have come

430
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:22,653
- to keep you safe.
- What the hell are you talking about?

431
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:29,087
- Peter, it's me.
- Thanks,

432
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:31,312
I think I just figured that out.

433
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:36,628
He lied to me.

434
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:40,170
He told me I could heal
the problems of this world.

435
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:42,429
My father told me
that all the problems out there

436
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,967
started when Walter came over
and stole me.

437
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,012
And that, now that I was back,
I was gonna be able to help to fix it.

438
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,957
But his bringing me back
was never about fixing this universe.

439
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,954
It was about destroying yours.

440
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,821
I'm sorry.

441
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:09,700
How long did you know?

442
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:14,205
A few weeks.

443
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:20,263
- Peter, I...
- Don't worry.

444
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,576
I'm not gonna let them do this.

445
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:25,174
I don't think that he can.
I mean, not without you.

446
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,311
You don't belong here.

447
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,940
No, I don't belong here.

448
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,030
But I don't belong there, either.

449
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:50,968
Yes, you do.

450
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:02,113
I have thought of 100 reasons...

451
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,798
why you should come back.

452
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:08,985
To fight the shapeshifters,
to take care of Walter,

453
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:10,594
to save the world.

454
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:12,243
But in the end...

455
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:18,227
You have to come back.

456
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,849
Because you belong with me.

457
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:51,927
Colonel Broyles, listen up.
I need everyone's attention, now!

458
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:55,889
I want all surveillance retasked
to find a fugitive.

459
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,683
- What fugitive, sir?
- Me.

460
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:07,234
I've got her. Her show-me just passed
the auto scan checkpoint at sector 47.

461
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,654
They're heading back
to the opera house.

462
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,823
Let's move. This is not a drill.

463
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,470
- They should be here by now.
- They'll be here.

464
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,579
Help me get this thing inside.

465
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,119
I'm William bell.

466
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,654
Haven't seen you in many years.

467
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:47,650
You're holding up
better than I would have thought.

468
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,653
What's a little universe
hopping between friends?

469
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,071
That's not what I meant.

470
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,890
Okay, so what do we do?

471
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,250
Help your father
get this device inside

472
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,788
and powered up.
Olivia and I will hold them off.

473
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,633
I supplied Fringe Division
with the 76 model.

474
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:23,769
This is the 77.

475
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Come on.

476
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,857
Peter, I don't even
know where to begin.

477
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,528
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

478
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:35,239
How do we do this, Walter?

479
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,714
Phosphorous grenades.

480
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,543
Be careful. They're prototypes,
they could be unstable.

481
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,461
- What do you mean, unstable?
- Just try not to jostle them.

482
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,385
Cover me.

483
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,339
We move on my mark.

484
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:31,422
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

485
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,382
I understand.

486
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,726
Damn it.

487
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,898
Dr. Bell!
Get down!

488
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:00,833
Can you hear me?

489
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:07,523
- Thank God.
- What happened?

490
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,595
I used a grenade.

491
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,285
I think I bought us a few minutes.

492
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,450
Come on.

493
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,329
Walter, they're here.

494
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:26,804
Is it working?

495
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,173
Yes.

496
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:32,310
It's opening a crack in the door,
but we don't have enough power

497
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:34,608
- to keep it open.
- Yes, we can do it.

498
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,779
We can't.
Olivia doesn't have the power,

499
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,654
and I haven't thought of a solution.

500
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:42,658
Please don't argue with me, William!
Always thinking you're smarter than me.

501
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,326
I will be the power.

502
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,038
I've traveled between
universes so many times,

503
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,166
my atoms are ready to split apart
with the slightest provocation.

504
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:55,153
You taught me there are as
many atoms in the human body

505
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,449
as there are stars in the sky.

506
00:36:57,688 --> 00:36:59,788
That's how many atom bombs I am.

507
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:03,178
That should be enough power
to get you home.

508
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,523
I should never have doubted you.

509
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,977
It's okay, Walter.

510
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:19,570
You always were as stubborn
as a donkey with a nail in his head.

511
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,465
Walter, start the sequence.

512
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,418
Thank you, old friend.

513
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,798
You asked me
why I took out part of your brain.

514
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:43,274
I did it because you asked me to.

515
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:45,846
Because of what you were becoming.

516
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,336
Freeze!

517
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,410
Welcome back.

518
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,041
Seriously?

519
00:38:56,443 --> 00:38:59,943
This is the third piece, Astrid.
Are you trying to kill me?

520
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:01,592
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:04,002
When I'm nervous, I cook.

522
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,259
And I've been baking pies
for about a week.

523
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:10,078
Pies and muffins and cakes.
And I've been eating them all too,

524
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:12,933
so don't be surprised
when I send you a bill for my lap band.

525
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,397
I'm sorry I make you nervous.

526
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,760
That's okay.

527
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,448
At least you're back.

528
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,051
You mind giving Walter a ride home?

529
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:34,874
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

530
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:35,999
Sure.

531
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:42,170
Good night, Walter.

532
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:47,473
You are back now, aren't you?

533
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:49,720
You're not leaving again?

534
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,684
I'm trying to see this
your way, Walter.

535
00:39:58,142 --> 00:39:59,271
I can't.

536
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:05,293
But...

537
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,114
you did cross universes twice
to save my life.

538
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,245
So that's gotta count
for something, right?

539
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:19,992
Thank you, Peter.

540
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:26,084
My son.

541
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:42,522
Help you, gorgeous?

542
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:44,035
I hope so.

543
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:46,443
I'm looking for a typewriter.

544
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,528
Well, you're in luck.

545
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:50,432
A Selectric.

546
00:40:50,557 --> 00:40:51,573
Model 251.

547
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,225
I see.

548
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,026
It's in the back.

549
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,397
Please let me out of here.

550
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:39,474
I know you can hear me!

551
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,017
Please...

552
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:45,478
Please let me out of here.

553
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:50,432
I know you can hear me!
Please let me out of here!

554
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,107
