1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>And the bear came
across a fox.</i>

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,325
And the fox said,

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,451
"Bear, bear,
stop right there.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,613
"There's a monster
up ahead."

5
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:10,065
Okay, bedtime.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,360
No, no,
this is the last book.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,160
Oh, I thought that
the last book

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,947
was the last book.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,491
We are
almost done.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,964
You guys work well together,
and I don't like it.

11
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,307
Hello.

12
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,241
<i>Hey, it's Peter. </i>

13
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:27,470
Hi.
What's wrong?

14
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:29,390
"What's wrong?"

15
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:30,800
Is there
something wrong?

16
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:32,480
No.
Why, what's wrong with you?

17
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:33,680
<i>Uh, nothing. </i>

18
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,755
I assumed
there was an emergency.

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,466
<i>Nope.
No emergency. </i>

20
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,237
What's up?

21
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>Nothing,
I was actually calling for Rachel. </i>

22
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:42,264
<i>Is she there?</i>

23
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,116
Yeah.

24
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:47,325
Actually,
it's kinda stupid.

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,500
I can call back later
if you guys are

26
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:50,077
in the middle of
something.

27
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:51,620
No, no,
she's-she's right here.

28
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,053
Uh, Rach,
it's for you.

29
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:54,560
It's Peter.

30
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:56,014
Oh.

31
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,211
Hey.

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,528
Yeah,
did you remember it or not?

33
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,968
Are you serious?

34
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:08,094
<i>Oh, what is it?</i>

35
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,161
Aunt Liv,
can we keep on going?

36
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,099
<i>No, I-</i>

37
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:13,501
Yeah.

38
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:14,499
<i>I don't know
that one. </i>

39
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,552
<i>All right,
hold on. </i>

40
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:18,252
Hold on a second.

41
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:18,916
<i>Hold on. </i>

42
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,851
Uh,
"But I don't see any monster,"

43
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,960
the bear said.

44
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,870
"And he kept walking.

45
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,244
"Because he didn't believe
there was a monster up ahead. "

46
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,611
Aunt Liv?

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,875
Yeah?

48
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,787
Monsters aren't real,
right?

49
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,625
No, sweetheart.

50
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,986
They're not.

51
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,945
The cameras are dark.

52
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:07,168
Let's go.
We gotta move.

53
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,471
I told you, relax.
The alarm's disabled.

54
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,626
There might be
a backup system.

55
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,160
No, there isn't.

56
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,628
<i>I checked
all the security. </i>

57
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:13,652
<i>Why don't you
finish up in here?</i>

58
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>I want to see
what's behind this door. </i>

59
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:39,631
Come on, Jonathan.

60
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,766
We've gotta get
outta here.

61
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:42,884
<i>Hold on a second. </i>

62
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,662
Stop right there!

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,665
You should be arrested
for what you do.

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,294
<i>We let them go.
All of them. </i>

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,158
<i>These animals
deserve better. </i>

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,103
<i>How would you
like to be

67
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>caged up
and tortured?</i>

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,962
Shame on you
for what you do.

69
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,589
<i>These are living creatures
and you murder them. </i>

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,545
<i>You're a killer. </i>

71
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:24,896
Tell me you didn't
open that door now.

72
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,223
Yeah, you bet I did.

73
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,161
Get out. Now!
All of you get out!

74
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:30,300
<i>You should be
arrested. </i>

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,955
Experimenting on animals
is a crime.

76
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:32,889
Somebody shut her up!

77
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,189
Let's go!
Let's go!

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,740
Come on.
Get out! Go!

79
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,546
Let's go.
Come on!

80
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>Jonathan!</i>

81
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,265
Let's go.
Come on, go!

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,959
What the hell
was that?

83
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,421
That thing,
that thing grabbed that guy.

84
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,860
- <i>I'm freaking out, man. </i>
- We got to get out of here.

85
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:55,276
<i>What do we do?</i>

86
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:55,996
Do we call the police?

87
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,472
We can't leave Jonathan.
We have to go back.

88
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,360
No, no, no.

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,780
<i>Dude, this is crazy.
This is crazy. </i>

90
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,753
What is that?

91
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,967
I don't know!
I can't see!

92
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,241
<i>Chris?</i>

93
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,880
What did that?

Unleashed.

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,877
<i>One cream,
one sugar.</i>

98
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,156
Thank you, Peter.

99
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,392
Peter, no!

100
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,464
Walter,
we talked about sharing.

101
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,344
That's not to eat.
You've ruined it.

102
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,268
It's an omelet.

103
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,010
It's not an omelet!

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,449
Oh, my--
<i>Ugh!</i>

105
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,108
Walter, why is there
an ear in the omelet?

106
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,527
It was an experiment.

107
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,709
It was a
protein-rich incubator.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,739
It was growing.

109
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,942
It was growing?
That's perfect.

110
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,578
No, it's not perfect.
You just ruined it.

111
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,115
<i>And you could have died,
had you eaten it.</i>

112
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,041
- Hello?
- <i>Really?</i>

113
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,040
- Okay.
- You know,

114
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:55,786
maybe in the future

115
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,955
you could do me a favor
and just put up a sign

116
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,553
warning me not to confuse
your toxic playthings

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,548
with breakfast.

118
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,006
Maybe you should get
your own breakfast

119
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:03,928
and not poach mine.

120
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,125
Dad,
that is hardly the point.

121
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,667
Remember yesterday,
when I nearly washed my face

122
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:07,764
in a sink full of acid?

123
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:08,476
Or three days ago,

124
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:09,868
you hooked Gene up
to the solar panels

125
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,241
<i>and I nearly
electrocuted myself.</i>

126
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,746
<i>This is a lab.</i>

127
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,556
You're the one
who should be careful.

128
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:17,075
I trust you look both ways
when you cross the street.

129
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,790
Yeah, but the difference being
that if I don't,

130
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,733
I'm the only one
who gets flattened.

131
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,377
You, Walter,
you live in a society

132
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,916
with other people.

133
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,546
Hey!

134
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,400
- What?!
- What?!

135
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,004
That was Olivia.

136
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,319
Local P.D. found the vehicle
a couple hours ago.

137
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,324
Three bodies inside:
two male, one female.

138
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,399
And the cause of death?

139
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,240
They appear to have
been attacked by an animal,

140
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,945
but the coroner's
never seen anything like it.

141
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,382
Whatever did this

142
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,144
doesn't appear to be
indigenous to the area.

143
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,037
Well,
wherever it is indigenous to,

144
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,076
I don't wanna
live there.

145
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:47,027
Oh, interesting.

146
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,062
Some would say
disgusting.

147
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,688
Whatever did this
had enormous claws,

148
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,427
<i>like those of a bear</i>

149
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,975
<i>or one of the
big cats.</i>

150
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,634
The spread of the digits,
V-shaped.

151
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,679
It's too wide
for one of those creatures.

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,068
Configuration
closer to that of an eagle.

153
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,992
<i>Of course much,
much larger.</i>

154
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,056
Hey.
We're looking for big bird.

155
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,249
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

156
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:11,507
Perhaps a pterodactyl.

157
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,538
Have evidence techs
bag their IDs?

158
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,170
Um, no.

159
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,709
I don't think
they were carrying any.

160
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,344
Maybe this is why.

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,027
That's a Brockhage
lock pick gun.

162
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:23,720
They work great.

163
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,314
A little bulky for my taste,
but--

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,954
Looks like these kids were out
for more than a joyride.

165
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,176
Mmm,
this is quite delicious.

166
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,485
Where did you
get that?

167
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:33,926
In the car,
uneaten.

168
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:35,193
What is the matter
with you?

169
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:37,237
Oh,
forgive my son.

170
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,705
He's been in a mood
all day.

171
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,574
I just figured,
"Don't eat the evidence,"

172
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,523
went without saying.

173
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,862
<i>It has no bearing
on the case.</i>

174
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:43,597
<i>I assure you.</i>

175
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,803
Four drinks.

176
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,060
Three bodies.

177
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,552
There were four people
in this group.

178
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:56,936
We're missing a body.

179
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,751
Have we searched
the woods?

180
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,830
We had canine units
canvas the area.

181
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,013
We didn't turn up
any other bodies.

182
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,060
Well, maybe one of them
got away and survived.

183
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:05,778
<i>If they did, they could answer
a lot of questions.</i>

184
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,283
I'm gonna go check
local hospitals...

185
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,234
See if
the emergency room has

186
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,022
anything that lines up
with an animal attack.

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,416
All this stuff
is from Junkie Genie's.

188
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,396
<i>It's a fast food joint
up by M.I.T.</i>

189
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,380
Food is crap.

190
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,025
But it's cheap,
and it's open late.

191
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,585
<i>So it's always
filled with undergrads.</i>

192
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,830
I thought you falsified
your degree from M.I.T.

193
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,550
Yeah, Peter...

194
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,735
Why commit to anything

195
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,065
when you can
just fake it?

196
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,405
I spent some nights there.

197
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:31,336
Maybe we should go
through the student database

198
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,267
and see if we can I.D.
any of the victims.

199
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,433
- Hey.
- Hi.

200
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,354
I understand
Chris Hawkins lives here.

201
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,262
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

202
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,838
Yeah, um,
Chris isn't here.

203
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,450
I know...

204
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,234
But would you mind
if I asked you a few questions?

205
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,241
I'm Carl.

206
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,027
And no,
I would love it.

207
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,651
Come on in.

208
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,040
Thank you.

209
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,442
Oh, yeah, uh,
that isn't mine.

210
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:25,757
That was
left here by a stranger.

211
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,113
Can I get you
something?

212
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,537
Orange juice?
Candy?

213
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:31,685
How 'bout some pants?

214
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,275
Yeah,
I can do that.

215
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:39,486
So how well
do you know Chris?

216
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,038
Oh, you know,
okay.

217
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,481
Kinda, "Hey, how's it going?"
"Nice, whatever."

218
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:44,560
"What's for dinner?"

219
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,721
That kinda stuff.

220
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,248
Why,
is he in some kind of trouble?

221
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,691
I'm not at liberty
to say.

222
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,716
Oh, no, no, no.

223
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,837
It's just because
he doesn't seem like the type,

224
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:54,271
you know,
to get into FBI kinda trouble.

225
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,431
Why do you say that?

226
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:58,494
He's always making flyers,
going to rallies.

227
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:59,823
You know, political.

228
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,101
So what kinda causes?

229
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,570
It's really just the one.

230
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:06,238
Uh, Animals Forever,
I think it's called.

231
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,352
Or no, no, no.
Animals First.

232
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,326
He was an
animal rights activist?

233
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,018
Yeah, definitely.

234
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,161
He'd save anything
with a beak or a claw.

235
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,263
<i>Jeez.</i>

236
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,345
Whatever got to him
had some pretty nasty claws.

237
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,634
And some
very large fangs.

238
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,839
What is that?

239
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,007
Punctures from the fangs

240
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,269
of most likely
some type of viper.

241
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,330
So this thing had
the claws of a lion

242
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:34,718
and the fangs of a snake?

243
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,164
It reminds me of a woman
I once knew in Cleveland.

244
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,330
Walter, these punctures
are over four inches apart.

245
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,660
And that would make this snake
eight-feet long.

246
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,095
Her name was
Harriet something.

247
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,119
How is everything?

248
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:48,657
Well,
apparently you're looking

249
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,589
for a lion-snake
named Harriet.

250
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,432
Did you find anything
at M.I.T.?

251
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,801
Yeah, the victims were all
animal rights activists,

252
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,572
a group called
Animals First.

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,989
So you think that they
were breaking into labs

254
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,218
that were doing
animal testing?

255
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,286
And releasing
the animals,

256
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,967
which would explain
the burglary tools

257
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,374
and the lack of I.D.

258
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:03,978
<i>It would,</i>

259
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,021
but it wouldn't explain
how whatever it is

260
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,342
that these guys released was
able to rip a door off their car

261
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,101
and kill 'em all.

262
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,892
Walter, have you got any idea
what kind of animal

263
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,536
would be in a lab
that could do this?

264
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,639
Well,
judging by the wounds,

265
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,485
I'd say two or three
different ones, actually.

266
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,773
Right, a motley crew of lab animals
got together

267
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,978
and decided to
exact their revenge on mankind.

268
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,627
<i>Astrid,
let's look up labs</i>

269
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:28,132
in the area that do
research with animals and--

270
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,880
See if any of them
reported break-ins.

271
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,142
Yep, I'm on it.

272
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,396
Thank you.

273
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,824
Oh, no.

274
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,630
<i>This is Unit 81.
We're responding to the

275
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,983
<i>monster sighting
on Route 30.</i>

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,429
<i>Roger that, 81.</i>

277
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,311
It's always a monster.

278
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,930
Monster must be housewife
for raccoon.

279
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,277
You hear that?

280
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,051
Any leads on
the fourth victim?

281
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:37,322
No.

282
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,026
What?

283
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:43,741
Nothing.

284
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,694
You called Rachel
last night.

285
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,045
- Anything important?
- Hardly.

286
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,652
You know that song
"If you like pina coladas"?

287
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,908
We were trying
to remember the name.

288
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,029
It turns out;
it's called Escape.

289
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,904
So you two
are friends now?

290
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,791
Does that bother you?

291
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,863
No.

292
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,995
Hey, Charlie,
what's up?

293
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,351
Oh,
good heavens.

294
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,047
Astrid,
Charlie just called.

295
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,387
Animal Control
got a call from

296
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:35,948
a woman in Newton
who claims that

297
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,404
she nearly hit a monster
on Route 30.

298
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,770
So I'm gonna
meet him there.

299
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,269
Will you call me
if you find anything?

300
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,874
- <i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>
- Thanks.

301
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:43,888
Olivia.

302
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,560
Be careful.

303
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,001
Thank you,
Walter.

304
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,998
What was that
all about?

305
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,169
Nothing.

306
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,373
Just want her
to be safe.

307
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,660
Hello?

308
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,633
This is Francis.

309
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:42,818
I need Medevac teams
and backup sent to my location.

310
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,687
Charlie?

311
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,480
Charlie?

312
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,328
<i>Charlie.</i>

313
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,861
How bad is it?

314
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,795
I don't know.
Uh...

315
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:45,999
I'm all right.

316
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:48,421
What was it?

317
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,547
Big.

318
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:55,287
What the heck
is that?

319
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,808
Put the stinger in here,
please.

320
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:59,068
Now, please, in here.
Excellent.

321
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:00,838
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

322
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,238
Agent, I'd like you to get that
eyed down at the hospital.

323
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:04,694
No,thanks.

324
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:05,939
It won't be necessary.

325
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,671
Agent Francis,

326
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,739
I-I'm told you were
attacked by the beast.

327
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,683
- What did it feel like?
- It hurt.

328
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,311
No,
I mean the animal's dermis.

329
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,859
Was it rough, uh,
like a rhinoceros?

330
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,161
I haven't felt any
rhinos lately.

331
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:20,569
But, uh,

332
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:23,427
<i>it was course
like sandpaper.</i>

333
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:24,325
And the metasoma,

334
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,216
<i>the tail,</i>

335
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:27,357
was it segmented
like a scorpion?

336
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:28,786
<i>I didn't get
a good look at it.</i>

337
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:31,073
It kept on
knocking me on my ass.

338
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:33,368
Perhaps you did,
you just can't remember.

339
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:36,494
Trauma can do that.
I could hypnotize you--

340
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,136
Walter, I think that that's
enough for the moment.

341
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:39,964
But it would be
very helpful

342
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,240
<i>to identify the traits.</i>

343
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,161
Are you okay?
Did you take something?

344
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:44,206
Psychedelics?

345
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,408
No,
not since Thursday, no.

346
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,531
Walter, why don't you share
on what you're thinking?

347
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:53,275
I believe
we may be dealing

348
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,967
with a transgenic species.

349
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:55,940
Which is what?

350
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,123
It's an animal creation.

351
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:01,162
Um, an organism
made up of the genes

352
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:02,703
of multiple species.

353
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,820
The best of the best,
as it were.

354
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:06,046
<i>You're saying
that you think</i>

355
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,485
the creature is
man-made.

356
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,016
Accelerated Darwinism.

357
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,992
Is that even possible?

358
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,089
<i>I-In theory, yes.</i>

359
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,262
<i>Although
one would have to solve</i>

360
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,908
many problems:

361
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,868
Incompatible species,

362
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,501
massive mutual rejection.

363
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,915
Similar to when
a transplant recipient

364
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:24,624
rejects a donor organ.

365
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,123
<i>And there's
a reason for that.</i>

366
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,234
Mixing a bunch of species
to create a franken-rhino

367
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,238
is unnatural.

368
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,810
And a really bad idea.

369
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,818
- Dunham.
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

370
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:33,926
Is Charlie all right?

371
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:36,041
Yeah,
he's okay.

372
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,245
<i>Thank God.</i>

373
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:40,803
Okay, um,
you wanted me to look into any labs

374
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,915
that might house animals
near the first crime scene.

375
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,176
And?

376
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,316
How can I help you,
Agent Dunham?

377
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:50,815
Dr. Swift?

378
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,544
You could start by telling me
what sort of work

379
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,206
you do here at
Swift Research.

380
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,691
Well,
we're commissioned

381
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,638
by pharmaceutal
and cosmetic companies

382
00:17:58,638 --> 00:17:59,768
to test their products.

383
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:01,941
Uh,
to make sure they're safe

384
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,020
before using them
in human trials.

385
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:07,598
Oh, by testing them
on animals first?

386
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,212
It's an unfortunate,
but necessary step.

387
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,156
You know,
it's better to have an animal

388
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,693
experience
an allergic reaction

389
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:18,114
to a certain perfume,
so that you don't have to.

390
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,433
Uh, Dr. Swift,

391
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,371
are you aware that
a group of college students

392
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:24,163
were attacked and killed
near this facility last night?

393
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:25,981
Attacked?
By whom?

394
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,647
That's what
we're trying to determine.

395
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,032
We believe these students
may have been--

396
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:34,415
Are you okay?

397
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,366
Um, no, actually.

398
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,665
We're three days
behind on a deadline.

399
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,596
Uh, you'll excuse me
if I seem insensitive,

400
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,925
but what does this have to do
with me and this lab?

401
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,222
We believe they were
animal rights activists.

402
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,420
That they were killed
after they broke in

403
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,880
and released animals
from a facility

404
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,397
much like you have here.

405
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,157
So you're suggesting
that a lab animal is responsible?

406
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,917
Well, maybe one that was
genetically altered?

407
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:02,150
Do you do any of that
sort of work here?

408
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,673
No,
Agent Dunham.

409
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,708
I told you
we only test products.

410
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,180
And what's more,
there was no break-in.

411
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,041
Doing some cleanup work?

412
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:13,095
<i>Oh, hundreds of animals</i>

413
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,550
in and out of here
every week.

414
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:16,828
As I'm sure
you can probably imagine,

415
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,160
<i>the cleanup never ends.</i>

416
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,488
Mind if I take a look?

417
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,302
Uh,
not to be a rude host,

418
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,167
but you actually
do need a warrant.

419
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,588
Understand, we deal with
billion-dollar trade secrets,

420
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,534
and I am obligated
to respect

421
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,996
my clients' confidentiality.

422
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,255
No, hmm?

423
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,156
H-How would
we accomplish that?

424
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:40,871
Wait, damn it!

425
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:41,842
How can I
concentrate

426
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:43,208
with you running around?

427
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,482
Walter,
are you talking to me?

428
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,693
No,
just thinking out loud.

429
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:49,607
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

430
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,502
Walter.

431
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:53,421
Walter,
I need you to tell me

432
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:56,234
what exactly you would need
to create a genetic hybrid.

433
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,156
Like,
specific items,

434
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,300
so that I can see if
Robert Swift's bought any of it.

435
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,589
I would need some
sodium bicarbonate...

436
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,673
and a house in the country.

437
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,531
A place to be alone
with my thoughts.

438
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,380
Some mahler
for the late nights.

439
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,097
And time.

440
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:14,471
A lot of time.

441
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,604
<i>I know,
it's like he's on another planet.</i>

442
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,380
You've seen him.
He's been like that all day.

443
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:24,647
But can you focus him?

444
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,638
Focusing Walter
is even at the best of times

445
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,051
just a matter of degrees.

446
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:33,860
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

447
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,497
Hey, Walter,
I need you to step back

448
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:39,603
to the Planet Earth
for a second

449
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,160
and focus on something
that isn't about you.

450
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:42,743
Peter...

451
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm afraid
this is about me.

452
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,030
About my work.

453
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,812
I found this book
among my old files.

454
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,643
What is this,
Walter?

455
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:58,963
Olivia.

456
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:00,948
Is this the creature?

457
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,291
No.

458
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,473
But I fear
it is quite similar.

459
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,172
Where did you
get this?

460
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:10,485
I tried to make it,
20 years ago.

461
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Are you saying
that you created this?

462
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,546
<i>Not this one specifically.</i>

463
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,815
My experiments
were a failure.

464
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,439
You knew.

465
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,391
You knew all along.

466
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:21,288
You knew that this
was connected to your work,

467
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,083
and you knew you had information
that could help us

468
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,129
but you kept it
to yourself.

469
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:25,620
<i>My creatures didn't survive.</i>

470
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:27,606
Someone else
must have finished my work.

471
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:28,775
<i>Who, Walter?</i>

472
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:30,391
Who could have
done this?

473
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,332
Twenty years ago,
who were you working with?

474
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:34,026
Kelvin Genetics.

475
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,839
<i>We were doing classified work
for the U.S. Army.</i>

476
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,072
- <i>I need a name, Walter.</i>
- Uh, guys.

477
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,022
Do you remember
anybody specific?

478
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,369
- No.
- <i>Guys.</i>

479
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:42,592
This body is moving.

480
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:43,990
What?

481
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,015
They're still alive.

482
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:48,217
Quick, unzip it.
They may be suffocating.

483
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,761
- Uh, maggots!
- No, not maggots.

484
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:55,586
<i>Larvae
from the creature.</i>

485
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:57,447
You mean that
these are baby monsters?

486
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:58,456
Yes.

487
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,205
We must collect them.

488
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,559
Peter,
a Petri dish.

489
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:03,877
Make it a bucket.

490
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,068
I'm gonna be sick.

491
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:06,243
Two buckets.

492
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,091
<i>Walter,
how is this even possible?</i>

493
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:11,666
The stinger.

494
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,154
It must
carry the eggs.

495
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:17,086
It transfers them...

496
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,201
to a suitable incubator.

497
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,779
What, you mean
it plants the eggs

498
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:21,669
when it stings you?

499
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,134
Yeah.
It's fascinating.

500
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:26,588
Oh, God.
Charlie.

501
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:30,221
<i>So far there have been
three reported sightings</i>

502
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:31,434
<i>in the
Greater Boston area--</i>

503
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,536
<i>Two in Medford
and one in Arlington.</i>

504
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:37,185
<i>Authorities advise if you see it
or any other wild animal,</i>

505
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:38,741
<i>do not try to
confront it yourself.</i>

506
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:39,791
Do you hear this?

507
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:42,217
There's some kind of
mountain lion on the loose.

508
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:44,002
<i>Mountain lion?</i>

509
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,372
Yeah, in Boston.

510
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,754
Where does a mountain lion
come from in Boston?

511
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,418
Maybe it escaped
from the zoo.

512
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,584
Well,
I doubt that,

513
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,203
otherwise
they would just say so.

514
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:56,819
<i>The mountain lion,</i>

515
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,008
<i>also known as a cougar
or a puma,</i>

516
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,185
<i>is found in most--</i>

517
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,859
Well, baby,
that's why you married me.

518
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:02,773
- <i>The possible--</i>
- Why?

519
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:04,248
So I can protect you...

520
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,069
From all the scary things
that are out there.

521
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,694
And, uh,
who's gonna protect you?

522
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,340
I told you,
it's just a scrape.

523
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,350
Bad guy...
Broken bottle.

524
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:15,153
Ohh.

525
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,533
Nothing I haven't handled
before a dozen times.

526
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,708
Who's that?

527
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,696
- Liv.
- Charlie, hey.

528
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:29,271
What's up?

529
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:31,407
- Uh...
- You okay?

530
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,452
Yeah, Charlie,
um--

531
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,175
But you may not be.

532
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:48,436
Electro-conductive gel
for the ultrasound.

533
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:49,687
<i>Enough
with the suspense.</i>

534
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,687
What is it exactly
that we're looking for?

535
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:54,284
I believe the stinger
we found in you

536
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,000
may have carried
the creature's embryos.

537
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,347
I think this is why
the creature didn't eat you.

538
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,460
I think you may be
carrying its offspring.

539
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,764
You trying to tell me
that I'm pregnant?

540
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,512
We're hoping not.

541
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,645
- So?
- <i>Ten times magnification.</i>

542
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:42,391
Is that--

543
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:46,538
I'm afraid so.

544
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:50,956
<i>One small piece
of good fortune.</i>

545
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,911
At least,
the creature doesn't mate

546
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,214
in the traditional way.

547
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:56,162
Thanks for that,
Walter.

548
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,409
That's great bedside manner.

549
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:58,491
So what do we
do now?

550
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:00,845
I don't know.

551
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:03,241
<i>I can't simply
remove them.</i>

552
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,822
They've already spread
throughout his system.

553
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,686
Just give me a second.
Astrid.

554
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,389
Walter.

555
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,255
Walter,
calm down.

556
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,757
Liv, uh,
the other victim.

557
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,066
How were these things
actually born?

558
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:28,782
It doesn't matter...

559
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,580
Because, um,
it's not gonna go that far.

560
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:37,626
<i>Walter,
there's gotta be</i>

561
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:38,735
something
that you can do.

562
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,011
All right?

563
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,157
Hey, look at me.
You can't check out right now.

564
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:43,548
We cannot
let this man die.

565
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,102
Don't you think I know that,
Peter?

566
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,015
Think, damn it.

567
00:25:57,317 --> 00:25:58,315
Agent Farnsworth,

568
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:00,435
<i>draw 25 milliliters
of blood.</i>

569
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:02,009
Peter,
get some trichlorimide.

570
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:02,886
What are you gonna do?

571
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:05,279
Poison them.

572
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:08,433
This is gonna pinch
just a little bit.

573
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,656
Careful, Peter,
it's highly toxic.

574
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:24,914
If this doesn't work,

575
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,860
how much time
do I have?

576
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,251
The last victim...

577
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:35,226
We figured 24 hours
after he was...

578
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:37,314
Knocked up.

579
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:39,515
Yeah.

580
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,522
So I have about
16 hours.

581
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:46,937
Careful.

582
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:50,073
Okay,
get your toy out.

583
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,130
Hello?

584
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,875
Hey, Catherine--
Woah, woah, slow down, honey.

585
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:56,555
<i>Be careful.</i>

586
00:26:57,757 --> 00:26:59,437
<i>Hey, yeah, sorry.</i>

587
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,246
<i>Oh, the house.</i>

588
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,577
<i>Yeah,
we saw it yesterday.</i>

589
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,589
<i>Oh. Perfect.</i>

590
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:14,196
<i>I made a few calls for you.

591
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,746
<i>This is what I was able
to get the army</i>

592
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,494
to declassify on
Kelvin Genetics.

593
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,654
Five lab assistants
worked there with

594
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,085
<i>Dr. Bishop and
William Bell.</i>

595
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:22,765
<i>All of them now
in the private sector.</i>

596
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,952
None working in biogenetics,
as far as I can tell.

597
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:25,937
And Robert Swift?

598
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:27,128
No connection.

599
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:30,382
I've been through the
missing persons records

600
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:31,320
a dozen times.

601
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,511
There's nothing from
any of the local hospitals either.

602
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,279
You're still thinking
there was a fourth activist.

603
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,103
And if they're out there
and impregnated,

604
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:38,688
then who knows
how many more

605
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,836
of these things
we're looking at.

606
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,226
Though presumably,
we'd have heard something by now.

607
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:43,729
Any more sightings?

608
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,877
Not any
within the last ten hours.

609
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:47,598
Maybe it's gone.

610
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:48,617
Maybe it went
into the river

611
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,257
or died from
lack of proper food.

612
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,745
Agent Dunham,
Peter Bishop's on line six.

613
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:58,359
- Hey.
- <i>It's bad news.</i>

614
00:27:58,453 --> 00:27:59,637
The poison
killed the larvae,

615
00:27:59,663 --> 00:28:01,513
but it also poisoned
Charlie's blood.

616
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,708
Have you
spoken to Charlie?

617
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,196
<i>Yeah.</i>

618
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:04,498
He's putting on
a brave face

619
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,507
but he's not doing well.

620
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,717
His blood pressure's down.
His kidneys are failing.

621
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:09,420
I don't understand.

622
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:10,830
<i>Walter seems to think
that the larvae</i>

623
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,917
<i>act like parasites,</i>

624
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,454
They feed on their host
for nutrients.

625
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:15,358
So they're killing him
so that they can gestate.

626
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:17,838
Tell her, Peter,
about the blood?

627
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,216
What blood?

628
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:20,623
<i>Walter has a theory.</i>

629
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:22,130
He thinks he knows a way
he can trick the larvae

630
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,024
to self-destructing.

631
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:23,960
How do we do that?

632
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:25,862
<i>Well, we'd have to
transfuse Charlie</i>

633
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,672
<i>with the creature's blood.</i>

634
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:28,411
Mix their mother's blood
in with his own.

635
00:28:28,446 --> 00:28:29,858
That way,
maybe the larvae would think

636
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:31,162
he's one of their own
and stop feeding.

637
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,002
Die of starvation.

638
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:33,676
<i>Which sounds crazy,
I know.</i>

639
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,080
<i>But he seems
to think it'll work.</i>

640
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,183
Okay.
Then that's what we'll do.

641
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:37,929
Bye.

642
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:39,942
What?

643
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:42,715
We need to
find the creature.

644
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,288
<i>It's got
three bedrooms,</i>

645
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,682
<i>so if we want
to have another baby</i>

646
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:48,551
<i>we'll be fine.</i>

647
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:50,429
<i>Oh, and, uh...</i>

648
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,459
The best part about it

649
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,277
is it's got
this amazing yard.

650
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:57,116
It's even got
a tree house for Tuck.

651
00:28:58,644 --> 00:28:59,928
<i>Catherine,
let me call you back.</i>

652
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:02,200
Tuck!

653
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,069
Tuck,
come out of there.

654
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,398
Tuck!

655
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:12,835
Tucker!

656
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:23,138
Medford,
Waltham, Newton,

657
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,514
and an unconfirmed report
of a giant snake

658
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,938
out of Watertown.

659
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:28,297
What are you thinking?

660
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:29,891
It doesn't make sense.

661
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:31,898
I mean,
something this big...

662
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,762
Why aren't there
more sightings?

663
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:35,581
<i>This is just
a mild sedative.</i>

664
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:39,422
It might make you
feel more relaxed.

665
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:40,299
Thanks.

666
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:41,557
You're welcome.

667
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:43,757
I'm sorry
this has happened to you.

668
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,418
It's not your fault.

669
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:50,232
They didn't tell you.

670
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:51,533
Tell me what?

671
00:29:52,387 --> 00:29:53,712
The creature...

672
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,464
Where it came from.

673
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,922
<i>Astrid,
I need a schematic of the sewers,</i>

674
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:02,351
section E-3
and F-5.

675
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:03,503
You've had a thought?

676
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:05,765
Yeah, I think it's
traveling underground.

677
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,524
Here you go.

678
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,166
Thank you.

679
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:12,669
Look at that.

680
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:15,028
All the sightings
are near major storm drains.

681
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,279
And each one of them
large enough

682
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,201
to accommodate the creature.

683
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:18,147
<i>That makes sense.</i>

684
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:22,754
If it's part tiger,
then it would prefer dark.

685
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,863
<i>And a python
would seek out water.</i>

686
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,504
So it's probably only
surfacing to eat...

687
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:28,096
Or to mate.

688
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:30,592
What?

689
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,584
<i>If it's traveling
in the sewer,</i>

690
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:33,993
then we have nothing.

691
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:35,164
<i>It could be anywhere.</i>

692
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,918
Walter, it's okay.
We're making progress.

693
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:38,622
<i>No.</i>
It's not okay.

694
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,673
You tell
Agent Francis it's okay.

695
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,169
I'll go talk to him.

696
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,717
- Ahh. Uhh.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

697
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:57,317
- Hold him down, hold him down.
- Uhh.

698
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,190
Charlie.

699
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,134
Lift his shirt.

700
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:07,995
They're getting bigger.

701
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:11,065
When?

702
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:13,713
Did you get
any witness statements?

703
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:17,081
Okay, well,
can you send me them

704
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:18,018
as soon
as you get them?

705
00:31:18,664 --> 00:31:19,446
Thank you.

706
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,581
Another sighting?

707
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,195
Yeah,
this time in a public park

708
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,293
off Hawthorne,

709
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,950
which is nowhere
near any of the other places.

710
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:29,520
So there's
no predictable pattern.

711
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,511
No, this thing could
show up anytime, anywhere,

712
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:32,698
and we'd have
no idea.

713
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,238
Hello.

714
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:36,021
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

715
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,361
Hey, this is Carl Bussler
from M.I.T.

716
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:39,740
<i>Uh, what can
I do for you, Carl?</i>

717
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,549
Uh, you said to call
if anything came up,

718
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,246
and I think
maybe something might have.

719
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:44,913
What is it?

720
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:45,894
<i>Uh, this kid Jonathan</i>

721
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,607
hasn't been in class
for the last few days.

722
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,309
And I don't know if he was friends
with Chris or whatever,

723
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,912
but he was into
all that animal rights stuff too.

724
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:55,298
<i>Anyway,
no one's seen him.</i>

725
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,357
Okay, well, I'll check it out.
What's his last name?

726
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,265
<i>Uh, Swift.
Jonathan Swift.</i>

727
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:03,575
Miss.

728
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,120
You can't go
back there.

729
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,674
Agent Dunham.

730
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:09,755
You lied to me.

731
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:10,817
I did?

732
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:12,842
You obstructed the course
of a federal investigation

733
00:32:12,903 --> 00:32:14,494
into the deaths
of five people.

734
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,148
Will you excuse us
for a minute?

735
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:18,984
Dr. Swift,
you failed to tell me

736
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,767
that your son Jonathan
was at M.I.T.

737
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,147
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

738
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,001
Three of his classmates were torn,
limb from limb,

739
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,828
the other night,
and he hasn't been seen since.

740
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:28,881
I would say that that
would be very relevant.

741
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,106
I don't know
how that happened,

742
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:31,878
but my son
was not involved.

743
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,494
When was the last time
you spoke to Jonathan?

744
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:34,506
A few days.

745
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,284
He's very busy at school.

746
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:36,913
Yes, I know.

747
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,124
Politically active.
Animals First.

748
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,791
He wasn't too
fond of the work

749
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:41,465
you did here,
was he?

750
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:42,743
I really can't say.

751
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:44,825
Is this going somewhere,
Agent Dunham?

752
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,018
Yes, a motive.

753
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:48,176
I believe that he
found out about your studies.

754
00:32:48,244 --> 00:32:50,184
That your lab
was testing on animals,

755
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,271
and he and his friends
broke in here two nights ago.

756
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,510
But what
he didn't know...

757
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:56,025
was that you do much more
than just testing on animals.

758
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:58,782
You create them,
dangerous genetic hybrids.

759
00:32:58,869 --> 00:32:59,526
We're done here.

760
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:00,671
Any further questions,

761
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:02,022
you're gonna have to go
through my attorney.

762
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:05,106
Dr. Swift, this thing has already
killed five people

763
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:06,540
and infected
one of our agents.

764
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,857
As we speak,
it's offspring is growing

765
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,049
inside of him,
killing him.

766
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,077
Do you really want his death
on your conscience?

767
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,618
Now your son is out there,
maybe injured, maybe infected,

768
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:16,880
and I can help.

769
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,347
But you need
to help me too.

770
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:25,251
It didn't kill
five people.

771
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:26,981
Excuse me?

772
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:29,729
It was seven.

773
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:35,527
Hello.

774
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,796
<i>Hey,
Swift broke.</i>

775
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,328
He admitted that the hybrid
came from his laboratory.

776
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,998
Apparently,
he was collaborating

777
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,419
<i>with a geneticist
called Cameron Degelmann.</i>

778
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:46,482
Oh.
Well, where is this guy?

779
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:48,328
Uh, dead.

780
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:50,984
He was at the lab
along with Swift's son

781
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,135
when the students
released the creature.

782
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:55,102
So what is the link to
Kelvin Genetics?

783
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:56,630
Well,
that's the interesting part.

784
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:57,698
You got a pen?

785
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,830
Good news.
That was Olivia.

786
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:01,822
Swift confessed.

787
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,113
Apparently,
this monster has nothing

788
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,422
to do with your work,
Walter.

789
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,044
What?

790
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:06,965
Well, Swift was working
with a geneticist.

791
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,761
For years,
he was pursuing this work,

792
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,483
a Cameron Degelmann.

793
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,474
Degelmann,
of course.

794
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,229
Whoa, whoa,
who's Degelmann?

795
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,604
Pioneer in hybridization.

796
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:16,299
Quite brilliant.

797
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,825
In fact,
it was his work

798
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:19,772
that inspired my research
in the first place.

799
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:21,443
And it never even
crossed your mind

800
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:22,524
that he might be involved?

801
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,857
He had a
very forgettable face.

802
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,068
And in the more
good news column,

803
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,385
Olivia was able to get
the combination of animals

804
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:29,347
that went into the hybrid.

805
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:30,854
Oh, oh, go on.

806
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,702
Uh,
Heloderma suspectum.

807
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:35,055
Yes, a venomous lizard
native to North America.

808
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,747
Also called
the Gila Monster.

809
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:38,242
Megarhyssa macrurus.

810
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:39,508
Parasitic wasp.
Interesting.

811
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,795
Desmodus rotundus and--

812
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,648
Wait, did you say
Desmodus rotundus?

813
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:45,180
Yeah.
Why, what is that?

814
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:46,631
It's a type of bat.

815
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,563
Oh, of course.

816
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:50,664
<i>Why didn't
I think of it before?</i>

817
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,910
Their immune system.

818
00:34:51,962 --> 00:34:55,346
Makes it a perfect candidate
for genetic hybridization.

819
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:56,438
I'm lost.

820
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:57,617
Bats have
an immune system

821
00:34:57,658 --> 00:34:58,742
that's unique
in the animal kingdom.

822
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:00,347
They can carry on
hundreds of different diseases

823
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:01,403
without ever being affected.

824
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,647
That same system
makes it possible

825
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,194
for the creature
to mature

826
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:07,394
without rejecting
its various parts.

827
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:11,293
The bat was the
missing ingredient...

828
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,991
that allowed
the creature to survive.

829
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:17,557
So now that you know
what it is,

830
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,840
can you help Charlie?

831
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,541
No.

832
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,915
We'll still need a specimen
of the creature's blood.

833
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:26,082
Okay.

834
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,488
Okay, well,
we know what it's made of.

835
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,327
We know that it moves
through the sewer.

836
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:35,023
So can't we...
I don't know,

837
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,509
Like,
bait it or something?

838
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,924
Just so I'm clear,
are you actually suggesting

839
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,174
that we go
down into the sewers

840
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,441
and wait for this thing
to eat us?

841
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:42,948
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

842
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,199
- Yes.
- Oh, no.

843
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:45,271
No?

844
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:47,285
- It's not interested in food.
- No.

845
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:49,800
But we do have something
that it is interested in.

846
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,847
Bats are a
highly maternal species.

847
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:58,494
They are quite protective
of their young.

848
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:01,285
Walter, are you saying
that we can lure this thing

849
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,164
by dangling those larvae
in front of it?

850
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,171
Yes.
But no.

851
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,070
Oh, great, this again.

852
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,516
It won't be necessary
to be in front of it.

853
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,961
Bats are capable
of seeking out their offspring

854
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:13,927
from miles away.

855
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:15,268
We've already determined

856
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:16,754
that it's traveling through
the sewer systems.

857
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,109
So we just need to
lure it from the central location.

858
00:36:19,145 --> 00:36:20,918
Wonderful,
so we're gonna antagonize this thing

859
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,627
into chasing us
and then what, Walter?

860
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,769
Well, now that
I have a better idea

861
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,236
of its biological makeup,
I think I can kill it.

862
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:29,471
Assuming that
you can provide us

863
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,811
with 50-caliber incendiary rounds,
Agent Dunham.

864
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:34,733
Well, that's not exactly
FBI standard-issue, Walter.

865
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:36,107
Are you sure
about this?

866
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:37,958
Hey.
If my theory is correct

867
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,373
and the bat traits

868
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:40,664
<i>are dominant
in the creature,</i>

869
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:43,789
then yes, I believe
we can successfully lure it.

870
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:48,090
Whether we can
survive the encounter

871
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:49,557
is the more
intriguing question.

872
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,988
Okay,
we're missing anything?

873
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,451
Could you carry these,
son?

874
00:36:58,712 --> 00:36:59,568
Sure thing.

875
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:00,521
Be careful.

876
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,668
You must be
very gentle with them.

877
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:05,049
Right, 'cause we wouldn't want to
hurt the monster babies.

878
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:08,251
You need anything?

879
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,198
A shot of J.D.

880
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:12,187
and a chaser of beer
would be nice.

881
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:15,645
You know,
hunting this thing in the sewers...

882
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:19,597
It's not a good idea,
Liv.

883
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:22,080
You got a better idea?

884
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:23,241
Yeah.

885
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,631
Don't get hurt for me.

886
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,227
Well,
that's not really very fair.

887
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,646
Considering you would do
the same thing for me.

888
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,220
I'll be back soon,
I promise.

889
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,780
You will call me
if his condition changes.

890
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:47,702
I will.

891
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:50,151
We ready?

892
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,215
Ready as I'll ever be.

893
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,667
Walter, let's go.

894
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:55,786
Be right there,
son.

895
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:08,353
<i>Based on
the sewer map,</i>

896
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,291
this will make
a fine infiltration point.

897
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:15,811
Nothing to see here,
ma'am.

898
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:17,835
Just routine maintenance.

899
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,382
<i>Smells great down here.</i>

900
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:23,621
So what's next,
Walter?

901
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:26,940
There's an intersection
a 100 feet down here...

902
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:30,648
that will conduct
the sound most effectively.

903
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,139
Nearly there.

904
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,736
The larvae
are creating a vibration...

905
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,860
Frequencies of sound...

906
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:08,153
detectable by bats.

907
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:13,250
And hopefully,
our guest of honor.

908
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,904
Well, now I know
what it feels like

909
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:18,959
to be live bait.

910
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,037
Hey, come on,
let's get in position.

911
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,076
Hello.

912
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,620
You just get in?

913
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:40,298
Hi.

914
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,662
I thought
it might be you.

915
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:43,128
<i>I just got in
from the market.</i>

916
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,138
<i>I ran into Jody.</i>

917
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,076
What is it?

918
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:51,670
<i>Oh, uh, she just told me
a really funny joke.</i>

919
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:52,770
<i>Tell me.</i>

920
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,068
So the patient
goes to his doctor

921
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,199
and he says,

922
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,872
"Doctor, if I give up wine,
women, and song,

923
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,342
<i>"will I live longer?"

924
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:04,664
<i>And the doctor says,</i>

925
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:06,497
<i>"Well, no.</i>

926
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:08,859
<i>"But it'll feel longer."</i>

927
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,133
You don't think
that's funny.

928
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:18,682
I do.

929
00:40:18,805 --> 00:40:19,753
<i>No, you don't.</i>

930
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,585
Are you gonna be home
for dinner?

931
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,998
I don't know.

932
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,112
Okay, all right.

933
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:27,994
Well, I will see you
when you get home.

934
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:29,622
And I love you,
babe...

935
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,532
<i>Even more for laughing
at that joke.</i>

936
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:33,734
And I love you too.

937
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:35,275
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

938
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,468
Frightening situation
like this...

939
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,348
Two things
occur to me.

940
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,862
The first is a song
I used to sing to Rufus.

941
00:40:58,605 --> 00:40:59,498
Our dog.

942
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:02,488
When he was young,
he used to have night terrors.

943
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:19,585
<i>Hey, Walter.</i>

944
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:21,145
Think we can
wait down here

945
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,723
to be mauled in silence,
please?

946
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:25,872
Of course.

947
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:27,603
So what was
the second thing?

948
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:28,882
Hmm?

949
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:30,509
You said
two things occur to you.

950
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,603
Oh,
the second thing.

951
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,028
I need to tinkle.

952
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,792
Could either of you
direct me to the facilities?

953
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,854
The facilities?

954
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,566
You're in the sewer,
Walter.

955
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:47,339
You're knee-deep
in the facilities.

956
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:48,349
Quite right.

957
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,384
Excuse me.

958
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:04,589
Don't say that
I never take you anywhere.

959
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:17,679
Hey!
Open this up right now.

960
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:19,348
I'm afraid
I can't do that, Peter.

961
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,976
No one else
is going to get hurt.

962
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:22,254
This thing is a mistake,

963
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,900
and I'm going
to correct it alone.

964
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,547
Walter, hey!

965
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:28,342
Walter,
you open this gate right now.

966
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:29,421
You were right,
Peter.

967
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,118
I live in a society.

968
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:33,764
And I need to
clean up after myself.

969
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:35,229
Walter,
this is not your fault.

970
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,475
You did not do this.

971
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:37,984
No.
But I could have.

972
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,000
- I pursued the same science...
- <i>Walter, Walter.</i>

973
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,183
You're not prepared
for this.

974
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:42,535
That thing
could tear you apart.

975
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:44,970
That's right.
I almost forgot.

976
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:48,161
I've already...
considered that possibility.

977
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:49,929
<i>Walter,
is that the trichlorimide?</i>

978
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:50,832
No.
No, no, no!

979
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:51,617
What are you doing?

980
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:52,929
<i>That's gonna kill you.</i>

981
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,701
Should the creature
consume me,

982
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:58,598
it will only be
poisoning itself.

983
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:01,403
Afterwards,
you remove its blood

984
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:02,800
and save
Agent Francis.

985
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,525
Walter, listen to me.
I don't want you to do this.

986
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:07,600
Okay?
Do you hear what I'm saying?

987
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:09,237
I do not want you
to do this.

988
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:11,779
Should I live,
there's an antidote in the lab,

989
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,678
which I should ingest
within the hour.

990
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,148
So time is of the essence.

991
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,149
Walter.

992
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,125
Walter,
stop right there.

993
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:19,673
Walter,
come back here!

994
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,815
Stop right now!

995
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,523
Walter!

996
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,424
Selfish
son of a bitch.

997
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:45,007
If he lives through this,
I am gonna kill him myself.

998
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,222
Oh, dear God.

999
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:02,596
Walter!

1000
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,338
Walter!

1001
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,991
Ohh!

1002
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:24,848
Are you okay?

1003
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:26,735
Yes.

1004
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,875
Although,
when I mentioned

1005
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,793
<i>that the poison
would kill me within the hour,</i>

1006
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,710
did either of you
happen to notice the time?

1007
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,077
That's it then?

1008
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,680
Now we wait.

1009
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,173
Prepare Agent Francis
for the ultrasound.

1010
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,483
What?

1011
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,426
Sonia and I...

1012
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,724
We've been
talking a lot lately...

1013
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,181
About having a baby.

1014
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,057
Sorry,
I gotta gel you up.

1015
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,211
You were right.

1016
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:36,687
What you said before,
about the consequences,

1017
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,414
I don't think of them,
never have.

1018
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:42,305
Don't know if I can.

1019
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:44,050
That's not who I am.

1020
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:46,095
I know.

1021
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:49,117
But you were brave
today.

1022
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,492
Yeah.

1023
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,650
Checking on
Agent Francis.

1024
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,137
Let's look in
on our little friends.

1025
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,383
It didn't work.

1026
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:16,802
Ever the pessimist.

1027
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,469
Look.

1028
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,059
They're dying.

1029
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,706
What happens now?

1030
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,844
Now you crap 'em out.

1031
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:47,862
<i>Hey, you're home.</i>

1032
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:49,530
Yeah.

1033
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,848
You feel good.

1034
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,800
So do you.
