1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:01,817
Previously on fringe...

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:03,851
They're calling these
events "the pattern,"

3
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:05,584
As if someone out
there is experimenting.

4
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,784
Only the whole world is their lab.

5
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:09,117
Anybody you need, you can have.

6
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:10,717
His name's walter bishop.

7
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,117
You're saying i can talk to john?

8
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:15,551
You could access his memories.

9
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,950
You fall in love with your partner,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,818
Who betrays you... he dies in your arms.

11
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,150
I saw him last night. Hello, liv.

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,150
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.

13
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,918
When you were in the tank,
part of his consciousness

14
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:28,017
Crossed over into yours.

15
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,117
Hey.

16
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:33,184
Hey. Sorry.

17
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,350
I've been calling your cell.

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,417
The west side highway was a parking lot.

19
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,651
Did they start?

20
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:38,150
Charlotte's been tap dancing
for the last 20 minutes.

21
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,651
Wait, wait...the tie.

22
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,217
Oh. Thank you.

23
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:42,551
Don't forget this. Thanks.

24
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,751
Breathe.

25
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,851
And extenzalife's market has
remained remarkably stable.

26
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:51,451
Especially given wall street's
recent financial difficulties.

27
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,417
But let me turn things over
to the man you've come to hear.

28
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,484
Mark.

29
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,250
Sorry. I'm late.

30
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,417
Thank you for your patience.

31
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,751
It's quickly fading.

32
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,851
Right. So let's get started.

33
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,417
Okay, as you can see from figure six,

34
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:08,417
The three-Year rate of return
on extenzalife products...

35
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,884
Well, mr. Young, a rocky start.

36
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,350
But i'll be letting the board
know we're in good hands.

37
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,350
Thank you.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,918
Bastard.

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,551
Son of a...

40
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,717
Lauren and craig will be here.

41
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,350
Remember craig? He's from south africa.

42
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah, i remember him.

43
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,284
Are you sure bobby's
gonna be okay with it?

44
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,917
You know, beth, not
everybody likes a surprise.

45
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,417
<i>Oh, please, the man loves
being the center of attention.</i>

46
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,984
<i>Do you know how many times he told me</i>

47
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,650
<i>The he didn't want a
party for his birthday?</i>

48
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,984
<i>Anyway, i'm glad you're coming.</i>

49
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,284
<i>It's been ages since...</i>

50
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,750
<i>...had a chance to really talk.</i>

51
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,417
Yeah, can you hold on one sec?

52
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,517
I've got another call.

53
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,184
Hello?

54
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:56,717
<i>I need you to pick up the others</i>

55
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:59,318
<i>And get to marlboro airport.</i>

56
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,717
Okay, i'm gonna tell you something.

57
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,483
You're gonna think i'm
joking, but i'm not.

58
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,984
I quit.

59
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:05,550
Only just for the next couple of days,

60
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,550
Ani'i'happy to rejoin the others

61
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,383
After the weekend.

62
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:12,851
<i>Runway 14. The plane will be waiting.</i>

63
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,051
So where are we going?

64
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:33,318
Multinational corporation.
Secret biological research.

65
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:36,218
Defense department's largest contractor.

66
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,184
Massive dynamic.

67
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,284
Seems like such an innocent name

68
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,884
For a corporation, don't you think?

69
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,117
<i>Hmm. That's odd. What?</i>

70
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,151
The lacerations on the body.

71
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:48,218
These, no doubt, were
caused by shards of glass.

72
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,650
But these under the shirt...

73
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,284
If they were caused by the glass,

74
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,750
How come the shirt's not torn?

75
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,450
<i>A fall of such height</i>

76
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,417
Would cause compound fractures,

77
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,284
Massive internal bleeding,

78
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,750
All in evidence in this poor chap,

79
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,951
I'm sorry to say.

80
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:05,184
But wounds this delicate
are most unlikely.

81
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,650
So what do you think caused 'em?

82
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,784
Too early to tell.

83
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,483
It's a shame i don't have a lab,

84
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,750
I'd like to examine him.

85
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,417
You do have a lab, walter.
Your lab at harvard.

86
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,218
Yes, i do, don't i?

87
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,617
Mark young was a capable executive

88
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:42,550
Who displayed no signs
of emotional dysfunction.

89
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,517
He was one of our more
promising analysts, in fact.

90
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,284
Popular among his co-Workers.

91
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,951
Then why do you think he
would jump to his death?

92
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,084
I don't want to sound
callous, agent dunham,

93
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:58,017
But when you run a company
of over 300,000 employees,

94
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,951
You sometimes see a small percentage

95
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:04,117
Who succumb to the stress
of their responsibilities...

96
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,917
And on occasion, the nature of our work.

97
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,951
What do you mean by that,

98
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,517
"The nature of our work"?

99
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:13,550
I was simply referring to the pressure

100
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,750
To deliver results,

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,383
Which the private
sector seems to require.

102
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,450
You would find it exhilarating.

103
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,383
Are you trying to change the subject

104
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:22,584
By offering me another job?

105
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,483
Well, i'd hate to sound like a suitor

106
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,684
Who is constantly being
turned down for a date.

107
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,884
Just to be clear, as flattered as i am,

108
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:32,350
I'm going to go wherever
this investigation takes me.

109
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,617
I would expect nothing less.

110
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,750
And i would expect more from you

111
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,051
Than the polite
appearance of cooperation.

112
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,617
You knew this man.

113
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:45,151
He was a rising star in your company.

114
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,650
There must be something mo
you can tell me about him.

115
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,884
When one's domain includes
the cutting edge of science,

116
00:07:56,884 --> 00:08:00,417
There is a risk of exposure to...

117
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,251
Ideas that aren't easy to reconcile.

118
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,218
Certain realities.

119
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,650
I'm sure you know what i mean,

120
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,117
Doing the work that you do.

121
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:14,151
For some, it's too much to take.

122
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:19,750
Do you ever wonder how
we survived as a species

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,684
Without drugs?

124
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:26,284
The hard drive is password protected.

125
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:28,117
Once we break the encryption,
we'll send you his data.

126
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:29,617
Okay. Thank you.

127
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,984
<i>Well, he wasn't planning
on killing himself</i>

128
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,383
<i>Three days ago.</i>

129
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,318
<i>He just booked a plane ticket. To where?</i>

130
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:47,517
Omaha, on the 22nd of december.

131
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,051
Christmas in nebraska.

132
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:50,318
<i>Sounds depressing.</i>

133
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:53,251
Yeah, well, maybe he's got family there.

134
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:05,318
Did you find something?

135
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,584
No.

136
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,684
Seems my suspicions were correct.

137
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,750
These wounds go all the way down

138
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,218
To the bone itself.

139
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:21,483
As if they originated on the inside

140
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:25,184
And pierced their way up
through the body tissue.

141
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,318
How did that happen?

142
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,318
That is an excellent question.

143
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:33,017
Peter, do you know what
i've been remembering?

144
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:35,550
Aspects of your childhood.

145
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,251
That's charming, walter.
Blood samples are ready.

146
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,517
Anything in there that
explains those lacerations?

147
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:42,917
No, i don't believe so.

148
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,117
Typical medications.

149
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,517
All of them surprisingly legal.

150
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,117
So they wouldn't have harmed him?

151
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,284
<i>That is correct.</i>

152
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:54,383
Although they could have
been used as a carrier

153
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:57,784
To transfer the foreign
compound to the victim's brain.

154
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,984
What foreign compound?

155
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:02,350
<i>Oh, didn't i mention? A
synthetic in the blood.</i>

156
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,951
An ergoline derivative.

157
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:08,450
Perhaps he was treated for migraines.

158
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,350
But it does not explain
what caused these wounds.

159
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,251
Coffee yogurt.

160
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:16,550
The synthetic compound?

161
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,584
Peter.

162
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,750
<i>When he was 13,</i>

163
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,784
<i>All he would eat was coffee yogurt.</i>

164
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,750
Almost drove his mother to tears.

165
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,218
walter, that wasn't me. That was you.

166
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:28,817
Hello?

167
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:30,051
If that's agent dunham,

168
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:32,517
<i>Tell her to bring some coffee yogurt.</i>

169
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:33,684
Can you hold on for one second?

170
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:37,450
He's right. About the yogurt.

171
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,084
In case you haven't noticed,
i can be quite obsessive.

172
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:43,151
Really?

173
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:45,284
Hey, you still there?

174
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,517
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

175
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:49,717
<i>I just... i just didn't
realize what it would do,</i>

176
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,717
<i>You know, hearing your voice.</i>

177
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,218
Listen...

178
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:54,884
<i>No, listen, don't bother
making up a story, peter.</i>

179
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:57,084
<i>I know you're back.</i>

180
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:59,483
<i>I need to see you.</i>

181
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:02,218
<i>Peter?</i>

182
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,851
I can't get away right now.

183
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,584
<i>Well, then, when?</i>

184
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,251
Hey, liv, what do you know
about a bunch of frogs?

185
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:55,517
I just got a p.O. Request
from agent farnsworth

186
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,218
Asking to send a terrarium

187
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,184
And ten pounds of live insect larvae,

188
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,617
And charge it off to
the mark young case.

189
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:04,051
There something you
want to talk to me about?

190
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,650
I had some frogs transferred
to the lab as evidence.

191
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,117
These frogs, you think
they had something to do

192
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,017
With why the guy jumped
out of the window?

193
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,584
Probably not.

194
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,750
Okay.

195
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,584
Charlie.

196
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:24,617
Yeah?

197
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,851
Come with me.

198
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:31,251
You know after john died,

199
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:34,450
You told me that i should
maybe take some time off?

200
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,383
You said that what happened with him

201
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:37,717
Was going to affect me in ways

202
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,084
That i couldn't even anticipate.

203
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:40,417
Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,450
You were right.

205
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,584
I feel like i'm going clinically insane.

206
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,784
Literally.

207
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:49,750
I told you i saw him

208
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,517
Standing right in front of me.

209
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,550
This happened again?

210
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,284
And he's called me.

211
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,117
And he sent me an email.

212
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,750
And at first i thought
it was him helping me,

213
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,951
Like when we were partners.

214
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:07,717
I know how it sounds.

215
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,017
Have you spoken to dr. Katz? Uh-Uh.

216
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:11,750
Even though it's confidential,

217
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,517
I'll still have a psych eval ony record.

218
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:18,851
I know, it seems so
selfish to even say it,

219
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,184
But i... i was thinking maybe

220
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,017
I could just take a personal leave.

221
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,884
Just do nothing for a week or two

222
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,417
And maybe clear my head.

223
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,051
Think that'll help?

224
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:32,383
I don't know.

225
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,984
<i>Dunham.</i>

226
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,218
<i>Agent dunham, it's me.</i>

227
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:42,383
<i>Dr. Bishop wants you back immediately.</i>

228
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:43,617
<i>He thinks you've cracked the case.</i>

229
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:44,684
What?

230
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,450
You are not gonna believe this,

231
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,318
But, um, the guy who
jumped out the window?

232
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,884
Dr. Bishop thinks it's
because of the frogs.

233
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,217
Oh, thanks.

234
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,918
Hi. Hi.

235
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,050
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

236
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,050
That makes two of us.

237
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,050
You look good, tess.

238
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,818
You look older.

239
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:24,784
Older?

240
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,417
When my father first saw me,

241
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,317
He told me he thought i'd be fatter.

242
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,784
But i gotta tell you,
older actually kinda hurts.

243
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,551
Your father... since when
do you see your father?

244
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,551
Long story.

245
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,317
Wait, listen to me.

246
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,250
If i can find you,
then they can find you.

247
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,317
I know.

248
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,884
They'll hurt you.

249
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,384
Can i get you a cup of coffee?

250
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:48,684
Something to eat, maybe?

251
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:52,050
Nothing changes with you, huh?

252
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,918
It's the same old peter.

253
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,184
You just play it fast and loose

254
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,484
Until it's too late. Tess...

255
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:57,983
It was easy enough for you
to leave the first time.

256
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,851
<i>Why should it be any
different now, right?</i>

257
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,117
I know that you believe that, tessa.

258
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:05,083
But you have to trust me,
it was harder than you think.

259
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,751
Trust you?

260
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,451
<i>I'm not sure i ever even knew you.</i>

261
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:19,451
Yeah, you did.

262
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:22,717
Maybe better than anyone.

263
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,551
You still do.

264
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:27,417
What does that say about you?

265
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,651
I'm not kidding.

266
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:34,050
You need to leave boston
and never come back ever.

267
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,217
Is that what you want me to do?

268
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:36,584
How can you ask me that? Come on.

269
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:37,784
Tessa, look, it's comp...

270
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,517
Michael. Things have changed.

271
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:50,617
Yeah, apparently.

272
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:54,717
It'll be worse for you if you stay.

273
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,617
<i>Psychophysiologic effect,</i>

274
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:11,584
<i>Otherwise known as psychosomatic.</i>

275
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:14,818
The ability of the mind to cause actual

276
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,017
Physical changes in the body.

277
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,250
Mind over matter, like
when you get scared

278
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,751
And yoget goosebumps. Precisely.

279
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,217
Although it is possible
for the body to manifest

280
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:25,484
Physical changes imagined in the brain

281
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:27,484
In a far more dramatic fashion,

282
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:31,584
This test subject is in a
highly suggestible state,

283
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,684
As you can see in this archive footage.

284
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,150
A form of hypnosis.

285
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,818
<i>I convinced him that
he was in a meat locker.</i>

286
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:45,651
And what is more impressive,

287
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:48,317
I told him that this ice cube

288
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,818
Was a burning coal.

289
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,484
Oh, my god.

290
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:00,517
<i>Cruel, i suppose,</i>

291
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,350
But very enlightening.

292
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,818
So, walter,

293
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:05,451
What does this have to do with frogs?

294
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,350
<i>Uh, toads, actually... bufo alvarius.</i>

295
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,584
A species which secretes
a psychoactive compound.

296
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,717
The substance which i couldn't identify

297
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,484
<i>In mr. Young</i>

298
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:17,818
<i>Was in fact a concentration</i>

299
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:21,417
Of the venom produced in the skin.

300
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,384
Properly altered, it's an hallucinogen.

301
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:25,517
A very powerful one.

302
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:28,017
Quite unlike anything i have taken.

303
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,484
It directly affects the amygdala,

304
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,651
Which is the fear center of the brain.

305
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:36,217
So you're saying that
mark young hallucinated

306
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,451
Being cut on his body,

307
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,250
And then his mind made
it actually happen.

308
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,517
Yes.

309
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,417
A very clever means of murder.

310
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,751
What do you mean "murder"?

311
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,484
Oh, come on, we've discussed this.

312
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,717
I'm sure we have discussed this.

313
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:47,918
<i>No, no, you and i did</i>

314
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,851
Before olivia got here.

315
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:53,484
The potency of the dose that i found

316
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,818
In mr. Young'slolo

317
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,617
Was at least 30 times that

318
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,717
That any sane person would ingest.

319
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:02,517
Which suggests that someone
else gave him the drugs.

320
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,517
So whoever those frogs belong to

321
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,083
May be the killer.

322
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,517
I already ran a property record search

323
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:08,517
On the shed where you found the toads,

324
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,884
But nothing came up.

325
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:12,884
How'd you even find
it in the first place?

326
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:17,117
It's a long story.

327
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:20,950
Walter. Walter.

328
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,950
The shed where i found the frogs,

329
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,884
John scott led me to it.

330
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:30,184
You've been seeing him again...

331
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,117
Because his memories
are still in your head.

332
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,751
His memories?

333
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,484
Yes.

334
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,617
Trapped like fragments...

335
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,317
<i>Snapshots in your mind.</i>

336
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,083
Your work on this case must be a trigger

337
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,484
To some knowledge he had.

338
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:50,818
So how long?

339
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,017
I mean, how long is this
gonna keep happening?

340
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,417
Could last for many years.

341
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,484
I need to get it out.

342
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:05,317
I can't keep having john's life

343
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:06,983
Flash in front of my
eyes every few days.

344
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,184
There must be something you can do.

345
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,784
Perhaps...

346
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:21,284
Using a form of
repressed memory therapy,

347
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:22,884
We may be able to bring the memories

348
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,017
To the surface,

349
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,284
And purge them from your unconscious.

350
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:29,918
But...

351
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,417
Bubuyou'd have to put
me back in the tank.

352
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,184
Yes. Yes.

353
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:38,684
And i would always advise against that.

354
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:40,017
<i>The risk of physical,</i>

355
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,818
<i>Not to mention mental
damage, it might cause</i>

356
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:43,384
<i>Could be catastrophic.</i>

357
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,584
Walter, i'll do it.

358
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,217
<i>I need to do it.</i>

359
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,451
Yeah?

360
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:21,451
<i>Peter, it's agent farnsworth.</i>

361
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:22,884
<i>Um, where are you?</i>

362
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,584
Putting some gas in
the car. Why, what's up?

363
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:27,384
<i>I think you should just come back.</i>

364
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,451
Ugh, walter!

365
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,451
How long is going to take?

366
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,884
Miss dunham, what we're doing,

367
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:10,117
What you have asked me to do,

368
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:12,217
Is pushing the boundaries
of all that is real

369
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:14,350
And possible.

370
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,950
We're not roasting a turkey.

371
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,551
<i>The library was not open.</i>

372
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,451
I had to go to the book store.

373
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:23,384
What for?

374
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:26,651
<i>When you're in the tank,
you must listen to my voice</i>

375
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:29,250
At all times.

376
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,384
Uh... uh, this is a technique
i developed decades ago

377
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:35,818
In this very lab.

378
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:37,150
Most of which i don't remember.

379
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,950
Is pet c cing? Yes.

380
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,818
Is that a bible?

381
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,717
Yes.

382
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:45,884
Yes.

383
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,517
Last time you were in the
sensory deprivation tank,

384
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:52,284
You went into a state
of shared consciousness

385
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:53,717
With agent scott.

386
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:56,217
During that time, part of his memories

387
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,284
Crossed over into your brain.

388
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:02,150
By putting you into a
state of deep hypnosis,

389
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,651
And by giving you substantial doses

390
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,983
Of psychoactive drugs,

391
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:09,284
I can help you to access
those alien memories

392
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:11,317
At your mind has repressed.

393
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,150
<i>My voice is your guide.</i>

394
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,117
It is also your tether to reality.

395
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:19,751
You must focus on my voice,

396
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,884
Or you may risk being
lost in the memories.

397
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:29,117
What?

398
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,717
I just got an erection.

399
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:33,484
Oh, fear not.

400
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:35,150
It's nothing to do with
your state of undress.

401
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,451
I think i simply need to urinate.

402
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:38,050
That's good to know.

403
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,117
Will you get her in the tank, please?

404
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:03,651
Are you sure

405
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,317
<i>About doing this again?</i>

406
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:11,384
<i>All i want is for it to stop.</i>

407
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,184
But if his memories can do some good,

408
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:17,517
Then at least i wasn't
deceived for nothing.

409
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,284
You'll begin to feel sleepy.

410
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:24,950
You must listen to
my voice at all times.

411
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,584
Concentrate on the name of the man

412
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,717
From whom you seek information.

413
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,551
And look for signs.

414
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,250
Signs?

415
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:39,784
I'll tell you when you get there.

416
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:42,384
<i>Walter,</i>

417
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:44,317
What was the bible for?

418
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:50,517
Well, you're taking
untested psychedelics,

419
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:53,184
Lying in saline with an electric charge

420
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,517
In the base of your cranium.

421
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,484
Among other things, i
thought it appropriate

422
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:59,884
To pray you don't get electrocuted.

423
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:03,617
Praise the lord.

424
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,484
Amen.

425
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,650
<i>Next!</i>

426
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,051
"Then i will sprinkle
clean water upon you."

427
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,051
"And ye shall be clean.

428
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,717
"And of all thy filthiness,

429
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:17,251
"And all thy idols,

430
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,251
"I will cleanse thee and a new spirit

431
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,617
"I will give to thee.

432
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:25,951
And a new spirit i
will put within thee."

433
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,483
Wow, nice.

434
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,017
I didn't know you were so religious.

435
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:30,951
I'm not. Not anymore.

436
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,717
Olivia, can you hear me?

437
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,251
<i>Yes.</i>

438
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,951
Good.

439
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:42,217
You see the end of
the escalator, olivia?

440
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,917
You will step off in five,

441
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:49,884
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

442
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:52,817
<i>Take a moment.</i>

443
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:54,184
<i>Look around.</i>

444
00:26:54,184 --> 00:26:56,884
<i>What do you see?</i>

445
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,684
I see nothing.

446
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,750
Just light.

447
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,583
Olivia, listen carefully.

448
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,917
Apart from my voice,

449
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,051
<i>What else do you hear?</i>

450
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,217
Music.

451
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:12,884
Excellent.

452
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:14,084
Where's it coming from?

453
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,318
You should be able to see something.

454
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,884
There's nothing.

455
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:23,917
<i>I don't know where i am.</i>

456
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,784
<i>stand by.</i>

457
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:30,284
She needs a passage way.

458
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,917
Anything now?

459
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,318
<i>What do you see?</i>

460
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:38,450
<i>Nothing.</i>

461
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,850
Wait.

462
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:47,784
There's a door.

463
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,351
Good.

464
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,550
Walk through it.

465
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,583
<i>Tell me where you end up.</i>

466
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,617
I'm in a restaurant.

467
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:15,184
Does it look familiar?

468
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:18,750
Sort of.

469
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,084
But i don't know why.

470
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:28,051
This is where we had our first date.

471
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:32,650
And there we are.

472
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,117
This is our first date.

473
00:28:34,117 --> 00:28:37,684
Can... can you see yourself and john?

474
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,550
What's going on?

475
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,384
She's gone back in.

476
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:42,951
What?

477
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,184
<i>Olivia went back in the tank? Why?</i>

478
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,450
Son, i need your help.

479
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,684
Walter, you said that
this was dangerous.

480
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,717
Oh, it is. Very.

481
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:49,884
<i>She thinks john scott</i>

482
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,617
Had information about the
man who killed himself.

483
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:53,017
So what?

484
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:54,217
She went back in the tank
to go talk to john scott?

485
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:56,617
To see his memories.

486
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,117
<i>Look at him.</i>

487
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,650
He looks so alive.

488
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,850
So real.

489
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,717
I need you to adjust the drugs.

490
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,217
Well, what did you give her this time?

491
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,684
Drugs i'd rather be taking myself.

492
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:17,884
Set the iv to ten drips per.

493
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:19,418
Peter, please.

494
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:35,984
I'm getting up.

495
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,817
What should i do?

496
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,684
Fear not. This is just a memory.

497
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:42,117
Um, just visiting.

498
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,384
They cannot see you.

499
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,483
He's alone.

500
00:29:56,384 --> 00:29:57,483
John.

501
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,684
He cannot hear you or speak with you.

502
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:03,750
You're in a memory.

503
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,284
He cannot interact with you.

504
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:11,583
Olivia, i'm going to take you elsewhere.

505
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:15,084
I loved you.

506
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:19,750
Tonight, during dinner,

507
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,418
I loved you.

508
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:33,117
But you were lying to
me about who you were.

509
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:35,784
I mean, did you ever have
any feelings for me at all,

510
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,251
Or was it all just...

511
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:52,717
Mark young killed himself yesterday.

512
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:55,917
He sees me.

513
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,650
<i>No, olivia.</i>

514
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,884
He definitely does not see you.

515
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:13,084
I'm somewhere else.

516
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:15,117
I'm in john's car.

517
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:16,550
Good.

518
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,817
Do you see any clues?

519
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,917
I'm alone.

520
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,684
He must be there.

521
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:23,717
Find out where you are.

522
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,884
There's no one here.

523
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:33,951
It's his memory.

524
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:34,951
He must be there somewhere.

525
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:41,117
I see them.

526
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,117
Who?

527
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,217
Ask her what she sees.

528
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:47,151
Wh... what do you see?

529
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:48,384
There's four men.

530
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,351
<i>There's john, a black guy,</i>

531
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,684
<i>One who looks latino,</i>

532
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,617
<i>And the fourth i can't see.</i>

533
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,318
I don't know who they are.

534
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,151
Let's give him a minute.

535
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:01,617
<i>This is a big decision
he's about to make.</i>

536
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:03,717
All right, i'm good.

537
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:04,684
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

538
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:05,984
It's mark young.

539
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:06,951
I see him. He's here.

540
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:10,750
Can you hear him?

541
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,550
I'll get closer.

542
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,151
<i>Young's leaving with the latino.</i>

543
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:21,450
I'm going after them.

544
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,917
Now you just do your part

545
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,684
And we'll take care of you.

546
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:25,784
What did i tell you?

547
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:26,951
I don't mess around.

548
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,017
They've disappeared.

549
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:37,017
That's because you're
not in their memories.

550
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,084
You're in john's.

551
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,217
You must go back to him.

552
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,750
<i>You know if it's on time?</i>

553
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,784
<i>It will be.</i>

554
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:46,817
He'll deliver.

555
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:48,684
He's just a little nervous.

556
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:49,817
See the look he gave
me when you told him

557
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:51,750
How much you'd be willing to offer?

558
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,384
I hope you're right.

559
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:54,583
<i>If we get into another ashby situation,</i>

560
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,817
<i>We're screwed.</i>

561
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:02,217
No! Stop!

562
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:03,284
Get me outta here!

563
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:04,483
<i>Walter!</i>

564
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:10,683
So just a little less chin.

565
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:12,850
Okay.

566
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,618
How'this?

567
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,683
That's it.

568
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:16,817
<i>That's the latino guy</i>

569
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:18,518
<i>I saw in john's memory.</i>

570
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,518
<i>He's the only one of
the four still alive.</i>

571
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:22,650
<i>We need to figure out
who he is and find him.</i>

572
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,184
So can we get this to charlie,

573
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:25,518
And maybe we can get it id'd?

574
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:26,884
Got it.

575
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:30,683
Hey.

576
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:32,717
Hey.

577
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:34,284
You're on my clothes.

578
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:35,284
Oh, sorry.

579
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:37,317
That's okay.

580
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:39,317
You okay?

581
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,317
Yeah.

582
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:51,284
John's memories gave us a lead.

583
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:53,351
So i better get a move on.

584
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:54,817
I need to see broyles.

585
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:56,518
You want some company?

586
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:58,783
No.

587
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,817
Thanks.

588
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,650
Olivia, if you need me, i'm here.

589
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:10,384
Yeah, i know.

590
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,484
We believe mark young was murdered

591
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,750
For selling technologies
to black market buyers.

592
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,950
And we believe at t ts man

593
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,151
<i>Was part of an underground group</i>

594
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:23,351
<i>Responsible for brokering a sale</i>

595
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:24,650
Of a synthetic hallucinogen manufactured

596
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,184
By massive dynamics' drug division.

597
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,451
And what would be the
black market applications

598
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,783
Of this hallucinogen?

599
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,384
The drug could easily be mass produced

600
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:34,217
As a cheap street drug or worse.

601
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,151
In its potent form,

602
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,451
Used as a chemical weapon.

603
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,783
Apparently it can literally
scare you to death.

604
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:41,117
Then don't let me slow you down.

605
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:42,151
Sounds like you're doing fine.

606
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:45,551
There's just one more thing.

607
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,251
We're gonna need massive dynamic

608
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,451
To disclose every
project that mark young

609
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,584
Was working on.

610
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,584
You're right.

611
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:56,084
Although that'll be
easier said than done.

612
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:58,950
I'll see what i can do.

613
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,984
If you touch her again, i'll kill you.

614
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,251
Any luck?

615
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,618
We've been running facial
recognition software.

616
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:56,917
So far no matches.

617
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,050
Witness sightings?

618
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,117
Nypd's passing the composite around

619
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,717
<i>Young's apartment building
and office as we speak.</i>

620
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,384
<i>Oh, yeah, i need you to cross reference</i>

621
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:06,984
All of john scott's case
files with mark young.

622
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,317
Yeah.

623
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:09,451
Hold on.

624
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,817
From nina sharp.

625
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,151
Mark young's projects.

626
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,984
Yeah, can you call me
back if you find something?

627
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:22,484
Thank you.

628
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:15,518
Hello?

629
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:17,950
Hello, i'm calling on behalf

630
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,484
<i>Of your long distance carrier.</i>

631
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:20,650
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

632
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,251
<i>And i don't want you calling again.</i>

633
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,417
So you better take me
off your list, okay?

634
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,451
'Cause i don't mess around.

635
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:31,084
What did i tell you?
I don't mess around.

636
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,850
I need this phone traced.

637
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,217
This is our guy.

638
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:37,184
<i>How do you know?</i>

639
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:38,184
I recognize his voice.

640
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:40,950
You recognize his voice?

641
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,984
It's him, charlie. I swear.

642
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:45,451
Come on.

643
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,618
Almost there.

644
00:37:46,618 --> 00:37:47,917
Got it.

645
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,518
It's a land line, but it
was forwarded to a cell.

646
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,084
Where?

647
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,618
He's in transit on route 3
heading to lincoln tunnel.

648
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,518
How far out are we?

649
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,284
About a mile and closing.

650
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:10,284
<i>We got 'em.</i>

651
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:13,017
Name on the account is george morales.

652
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:14,783
Age 43.

653
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,184
Purchased a plane ticket this morning.

654
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,817
3:45 flight down to
sao paolo out of jfk.

655
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,284
So he must be on his way there now.

656
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:21,683
According to ncic,

657
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,217
He's a black market
trafficker, high end.

658
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,217
So how far out are we?

659
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,084
550 yards.

660
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,750
<i>Echo flank left foxtrot.</i>

661
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,750
<i>Flank right.</i>

662
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,417
Wait, he stopped.

663
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,584
What, did we lose the signal?

664
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:34,650
No, he just stopped.

665
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,050
So do you think he ditched his phone?

666
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,451
I don't know why he would.

667
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:38,783
There's no way he could've spotted us.

668
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,184
So what happened?

669
00:38:45,384 --> 00:38:46,451
Looks like he hit traffic.

670
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,584
Where's the transponder?

671
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:49,017
<i>Let's go.</i>

672
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,551
Charlie!

673
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,850
I'm told you wanted to see me.

674
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,351
Yes.

675
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,617
I want to make a deal.

676
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,650
<i>I'll tell you everything i know.</i>

677
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,284
I'm not sure what you have to trade.

678
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:17,351
Under title 18 of the u.S. Code,

679
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,784
We have you for possession
of chemical weapons.

680
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,817
On top of suspicion

681
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:23,351
Of murder of mark young.

682
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,750
I want protection. You mean immunity.

683
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,650
No, i mean protection.

684
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,051
From massive dynamic.

685
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,984
You ed to move me from here right now.

686
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:31,384
What are you talking about?

687
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:33,717
I didn't kill anybody.

688
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:35,017
Why would i?

689
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,550
That guy was a treasure
trove of unbelievable things.

690
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,084
Massive dynamic killed him.

691
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:51,351
Massive dynamic killed mark young?

692
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,684
That's right.

693
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:53,684
Why would they?

694
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,450
Maybe as a warning to any employee

695
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,951
Who's thinking of doing the same thing.

696
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:59,251
Maybe?

697
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,850
I think it's easy to invent a story

698
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,884
That you think i want to hear.

699
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:02,917
Really?

700
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,084
Did i invent zfd?

701
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:07,450
Flight 627?

702
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,684
The northwoods group?

703
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,017
John scott? The pattern?

704
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,684
The whole thing is... is a hoax.

705
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,251
It's all a smoke screen

706
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,550
So massive dynamic can
do whatever it wants

707
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,351
To whoever it wants.

708
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:21,351
Do you understand that?

709
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:24,984
Massive dynamic is hell.

710
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,617
And its founder, william
bell, is the devil.

711
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:29,051
And i can prove all of it.

712
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,517
But only if i get protection.

713
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:33,951
So why me?

714
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,184
Why do i get the privilege
of your cooperation?

715
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,450
Because i know i can trust you.

716
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,351
You don't even know me.

717
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:43,850
John scott told me about you.

718
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,051
Immunity...

719
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:47,217
And complete protection.

720
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:51,483
And i will tell you everything i know.

721
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:00,117
Agent dunham, i don't recall seeing you

722
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,517
On my schedule today.

723
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:03,784
Well, i don't need an
appointment, ms. Sharp.

724
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:08,318
It's all right.

725
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,951
No matter where my
investigations take me,

726
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:14,051
They always come back here.

727
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:15,750
Well, i don't know what you've heard

728
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,318
Since we last saw each other,

729
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:19,550
But i would hope that my cooperation

730
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,318
Would've garnered some
benefit of the doubt.

731
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:24,517
<i>Massive dynamic has nothing to hide.</i>

732
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,017
It's about time.

733
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:38,017
What took you so long?

734
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:48,784
See, i believe that your
cooperation is an illusion.

735
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:51,884
It never leads to something tangible.

736
00:42:51,884 --> 00:42:53,750
It only leads to more questions.

737
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,817
And that's the point, isn't it?

738
00:42:57,817 --> 00:43:01,251
To keep us all asking questions?

739
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:03,318
All just chasing our own tails?

740
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,817
Are you sure you're
feeling well, ms. Dunham?

741
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:08,217
I think perhaps you're perceiving things

742
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:10,384
That are entirely in your mind's eye.

743
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:24,151
I wanted to thank you
for all your job offers.

744
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,684
And i'm sorry that it's taken me so long

745
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:27,084
To give you an answer,

746
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,617
But i, um, i think i finally have one.

747
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:34,583
Yes, it's obvious in your expression.

748
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,617
Well, i understand that
you've captured your suspect.

749
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:39,717
I imagine that in an effort

750
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,884
To seek anmmmmity
agreement from your agency,

751
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:44,117
He's attempting to blame massive dynamic

752
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:46,717
For all his foul deeds.

753
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:51,117
Are you protecting
your ceo, william bell?

754
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:52,284
Because if you are,

755
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:54,583
Now is the time to tell me.

756
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,517
Once our witness talks,

757
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:59,051
You lose all leverage in a plea.

758
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:02,517
I seriously doubt that
your witness will be able

759
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:04,984
To provide any actionable evidence

760
00:44:04,984 --> 00:44:06,717
To implicate massive
dynamic or william bell

761
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:09,017
Of any wrong doing.

762
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,617
Oof!

763
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:18,650
<i>No, please!</i>

764
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,650
<i>No, john, please!</i>

765
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,217
Don't...

766
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:22,517
I won't say anything.

767
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:23,517
<i>No!</i>

768
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,450
Dunham.

769
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,418
Our witness is dead.

770
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:44,650
What?

771
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,051
<i>seems he was drugged</i>

772
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,650
<i>With the same substance as mark young.</i>

773
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,684
How?

774
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:50,318
<i>We had guards on his room.</i>

775
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:51,418
We don't know yet,

776
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:53,284
<i>But a nurse saw his throat open up</i>

777
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,951
<i>Right before her eyes.</i>

778
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:56,884
Nina sharp.

779
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:58,117
<i>Excuse me?</i>

780
00:44:58,117 --> 00:44:59,318
She got to him.

781
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:00,318
And there'll be no evidence of that.

782
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:01,550
Just like you said.

783
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,517
<i>Dunham, nina sharp and massive dynamic</i>

784
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:04,850
<i>Have been nothing but cooperative</i>

785
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,251
<i>With this investigation.</i>

786
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:10,217
<i>I suggest you keep your
unfounded accusations in check.</i>

787
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:25,483
Walter.

788
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:27,517
Hi.

789
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,517
Can you come out?

790
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,850
Um, i need to go back in.

791
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:37,784
In our room?

792
00:45:37,784 --> 00:45:39,284
Uh, no.

793
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:40,450
In the tank.

794
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,318
There are too many questions.

795
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:43,351
Like who's working for whom?

796
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:44,884
And why?

797
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,583
Who should be arrested?
Who's plotting what?

798
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,717
And if john had the answers,

799
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:50,550
Then the answers are
still in his memory,

800
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,550
Which means that they're in my memory.

801
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,951
Ms. Dunham... please, walter.

802
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:53,951
We're wasting time.

803
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,017
It's dangerous.

804
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:57,251
I am prepared to take that risk.

805
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:05,650
There is little that makes me happier

806
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,984
Than taking drugs.

807
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:10,784
Perhaps administering them,

808
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:13,517
Designing and carrying out experiments

809
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:18,017
That bend the plane of
what we consider reality.

810
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:21,684
I'm rarely if ever opposed
to such things except now.

811
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:23,617
But i tell you,

812
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,318
You'll damage yourself.

813
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:26,951
Every time you go back in,

814
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,517
The risk of permanent damage:

815
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:31,784
Seizures, aneurysms,
memory loss, death...

816
00:46:31,784 --> 00:46:33,817
But if i don't go back
in, others may die.

817
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:38,817
And if you do, the
death could be your own.

818
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:41,251
There are no guarantees
that you will retrieve

819
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,884
The memories you're looking for.

820
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:47,318
And remember, there can
be no interaction with him.

821
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:50,318
You can't just ask.

822
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:52,051
He did see me.

823
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,984
No.

824
00:46:53,984 --> 00:46:58,917
No, that is not possible.

825
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,351
Give me some time.

826
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,951
I will try to develop a safer technique.

827
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:06,051
But not tonight.

828
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:07,784
You need to rest.

829
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,450
Sleep well.

830
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:24,051
You too.

831
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:29,850
Tell him to have the money

832
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,384
Or i'll have to break his legs too.

833
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,217
I gotta go.

834
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:37,351
What the hell happened to you?

835
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:39,184
He's back in town.

836
00:47:39,184 --> 00:47:42,418
Peter bishop.

837
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:44,017
Peter bishop, really?

838
00:47:44,018 --> 00:47:45,018
