00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,814
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:03,586
What can you tell me
about cortexiphan?

3
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:04,962
It worked on perception.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>Attention all citizens.</i>

5
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:09,009
Of all of the children
that Walter and I prepared,

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,301
you were the strongest.

7
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,637
A storm is coming,
and when it is over,

8
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,680
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

9
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,819
William bell told me the man
with that marking, Newton,

10
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:20,010
would try to open a corridor

11
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,271
from our universe to the other side.

12
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,857
Dr. Bell was afraid
that if the doorway

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,984
between the two universes
was ever opened...

14
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,781
only one world would remain.

15
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,160
Thought you were getting
out of here.

16
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,883
Afraid not.
It's gonna be a late one.

17
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:56,972
Wait a second.
Is that real coffee?

18
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:01,332
- Where did you get that?
- I don't know. I have my sources.

19
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:04,834
I got a cousin in Hawaii.
She has a secret stash.

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,567
She sends me stuff every...

21
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:11,492
This is getting nuts.

22
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,030
What is that, six since yesterday?

23
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:16,424
I'm from California,
so I'm used to it, you know?

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,547
But this is New York.

25
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:20,818
Don't you think it's strange?

26
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:27,890
- What are they saying on the news?
- That they're just these little quakes.

27
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,004
Microquakes.

28
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,292
Probably just some by-product
of global warming.

29
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:33,914
Well, see you tomorrow.

30
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:37,183
And if you have any extra coffee...

31
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,114
call me.

32
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:40,614
- Good night, Pauline.
- Night.

- You've got to be kidding me.
- <i>Congratulations, Mr. Bishop.</i>

39
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,164
You've just won an all-expense-paid trip
to New York City.

40
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,178
I thought I told your people
to take me off your contestant list.

41
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,752
<i>Not according to our records.</i>

42
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,702
It says here that you're a fan
of fine dining and excitement.

43
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,370
Do you have a supervisor?

44
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,134
Anybody there I could complain to?

45
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,035
- <i>'Cause this has to stop.</i>
- Did I mention there's excitement?

46
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:46,878
Walter, wake up.

47
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,437
We just won an all-expense-paid trip
to New York City.

48
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,329
That's fantastic.

49
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,285
I've never won anything before.

50
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,833
An earthquake in Manhattan.

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,720
It's possible, but highly unlikely.

52
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,787
Perhaps a small comet.

53
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,810
Any witnesses?

54
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:13,043
Witnesses outside felt the ground shake,
but no one saw what happened.

55
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,753
What about the people inside?

56
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:37,767
Emergency services secured this entrance
into the building,

57
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,488
scouring the place for survivors.

58
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,968
How many did they find?

59
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:42,323
Zero.

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,850
- It looks...
- rearranged.

61
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,305
Extraordinary.

62
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,183
Oh, my god.

63
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,941
I don't suppose you have any idea
what could have caused this?

64
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,402
Quantum tectonic event
would be my guess.

65
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,864
Until now, this phenomenon
has just been theoretical.

66
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:26,260
A quantum tectonic event?

67
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,293
Well, yes.

68
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,630
Imagine a sudden
momentary disturbance

69
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,159
at a subatomic level.

70
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,347
The energy disperses the atoms,

71
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:37,594
literally tearing the very fabric
of reality itself.

72
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,371
Meaning that all the atoms come apart,
but when they reassemble,

73
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,064
they come together all wrong.

74
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,680
So what are the odds of something
like this occurring naturally?

75
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,053
It's possible.

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,078
But if so, God has a far
more disturbed sense of humor

77
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:50,618
then even I could have imagined.

78
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,018
- <i>We got a survivor!</i>
- Third floor! Let's move!

79
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,025
ID says his name is Ted Pratchett.

80
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,441
Help, please.

81
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,485
Hold still, sir.

82
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,238
- It's important you try not to move.
- Please help.

83
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,134
I don't know if we can cut him loose
from that beam. He might not survive.

84
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,232
Call my wife.

85
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:13,610
Someone please call my wife.
I just want to hear her voice.

86
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:17,209
Mr. Pratchet, I'm special agent Broyles
with the FBI. This is agent Dunham.

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,586
We're going to do everything we can
to find your wife

88
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,275
and get you out of here safely.

89
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll call this in.

90
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:26,788
Mr. Pratchet,

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,057
It would help us a lot if you could
describe what happened here.

92
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,515
Tremors.

93
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,559
Just like the other ones.

94
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,372
Then a really big one
that just kept getting worse.

95
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,232
I'm so thirsty.

96
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,955
He can't drink anything.

97
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,130
Maybe some ice, but no liquids.

98
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:45,831
I'm on it.

99
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,798
Mr. Pratchet, did anything unusual
happen before the disaster?

100
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,259
Maybe someone in the building
who shouldn't have been here.

101
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:10,070
Just the same things everyone saw.

102
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,514
Yesterday,
the dogs all started howling.

103
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:16,212
Then all those little tremors.
The microquakes.

104
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,732
Did you hear about any tremors
in New York?

105
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,871
Ted Pratchet doesn't have a wife
and it appears he never did.

106
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:39,040
Makes sense.
Trauma from his injuries.

107
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,460
- He must be delirious.
- I don't think so.

108
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,669
Excuse me, miss.

109
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,133
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:45,968
Sir...

111
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,940
What year is it?

112
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,529
- 2010.
- Good. Good.

113
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,471
And who is the president?

114
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:54,575
- President Obama.
- Good. Good.

115
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,305
Now, I'm sorry to do this...

116
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,320
What's the point of this?

117
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,232
I'm sorry about this,
but it is very important.

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,551
On September the 11th,
when the terrorists struck,

119
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,253
which buildings did they attack?

120
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,312
The pentagon.

121
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,690
And the white house.

122
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,997
I think I know what happened here.

123
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,299
What is that?

124
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,575
My theory was wrong.

125
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,884
This wasn't a quantum event at all.

126
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,943
We're standing in two buildings.

127
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:18,477
One of which comes from
the alternate universe.

128
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,681
I've asked them to send
Mr. Pratchet's bodies back to the lab.

129
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,503
Maybe they'll provide some insight
into how this thing happened.

130
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,170
- I already know how this happened.
- How?

131
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,508
Two universes colliding.

132
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,091
This is what William Bell
warned me about.

133
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,317
He said that Newton would
try to open a doorway

134
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,305
from our universe to the other side.

135
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,600
And that when it happened
this would be the consequence.

136
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,921
Two objects trying to occupy
the same space at the same time.

137
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,554
This was Newton. I'm sure of it.

138
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,030
He was here.

139
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,700
Walter, I don't think I can do this.

140
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:28,272
I've seen some pretty disturbing things
in my time working with you,

141
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,990
and I think I've handled them
pretty well, but this....

142
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,313
I can't do.

143
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,312
Awful, isn't it?

144
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,964
Those boxes over there
have evidence from the building.

145
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,305
You can go through them.

146
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,473
Thank you.

147
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,020
All right, so what am I looking for?

148
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,189
Anything that looks like
it doesn't belong.

149
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,074
I think this qualifies.

150
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:01,285
Richard Nixon on a silver dollar.

151
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,189
That's disturbing.

152
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:09,054
So when you separate them, Walter,
how are you going to tell them apart?

153
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,504
Mr. Pratchet from over there was
married. He was wearing a wedding ring.

154
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:17,175
So as far as his wife will ever know,
he just disappeared?

155
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:20,979
That is so sad.

156
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,244
Yes, it is.

157
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:24,683
Look at this.

158
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,597
It's a double-decker car.

159
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:30,547
Does this mean
that they drive these over there?

160
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:33,205
I suppose so.

161
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,281
What?

162
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,626
I know what Newton did.

163
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:50,222
And I'm afraid I've just remembered
what's going to happen next.

164
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,506
Newton. He was there.

165
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,842
This was taken two hours
before the incident.

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,790
He and his men disguised themselves
as a construction crew.

167
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,026
So how do we find him?

168
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,689
We're running down vin numbers.
We're looking into equipment rental,

169
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,852
but I would like to take
a crew back to New York.

170
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:11,980
It's Walter.

171
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,859
Peter, I need you back at the lab.
Agent Dunham as well.

172
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,361
We're busy.

173
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,187
Don't argue with me, son.
Get back here now, both of you.

174
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,413
That is what's so important?

175
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,437
This happened almost 25 years ago
right here on campus.

176
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,257
I know.
I've heard this story before.

177
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,089
MIT Students fused a car
to the statue of John Harvard.

178
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,758
They had to cut the car away.
They never figured out how they did it.

179
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,719
This wasn't MIT students, was it?
This was one of your experiments?

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,216
When billy and I
first tried to generate

181
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,474
a stable door between universes,

182
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,789
our first test subject was a car...

183
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,396
Billy's old Monte Carlo
and it did not go well.

184
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,147
First times are always sloppy.

185
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,637
It wasn't our first time.

186
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:00,028
11 minutes after we successfully
made the car disappear,

187
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,155
this car appeared
from another reality.

188
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,908
- How do you know that?
- It was in 1986.

189
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,515
The car had a CD player.
It wasn't an option at the time.

190
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,974
Assuming what you're saying
is true, why?

191
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,041
I mean, how did the car appear?

192
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:14,349
The universe seeks balance.

193
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,730
We sent a car over there,
so a car of equal mass came back.

194
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,114
Now, a building from the other side
appeared here.

195
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:28,693
The laws of physics demand
both sides of the equation balance.

196
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,763
I calculate
that a building from this side

197
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,105
will be pulled over there,
inhabitants and all...

198
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:37,858
Within the next...

199
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,152
just under 35 hours.

200
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:42,779
Okay, so how do we stop it?

201
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,698
That's the thing, agent Dunham.
We can't.

202
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,375
We need to evacuate the building.

203
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,875
So how do we identify
which building it's going to be?

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,399
The one thing that billy and I learned
from our experience

205
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:54,793
is that when objects
from the other universe

206
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,221
cross to our side,
they have an energy.

207
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,547
Someone once described it
as a glimmer.

208
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,883
I believe that

209
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,204
in the moments before the event

210
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,001
when the fabric of the two
universes is rubbing together,

211
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,385
that the building on this side

212
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,519
will begin to take on that glimmer.
So then we'd be able to see it?

213
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,380
Well, unfortunately, no.
It's not visible to the human eye.

214
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,578
Then how the hell are we
going to find it, Walter?

215
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:21,031
We can't, Peter!

216
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,362
- But you can, agent Dunham.
- How can I see it?

217
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,240
Because you saw it once before.

218
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:35,314
Walter, when did I see things
from the other side?

219
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,167
26 years ago when you
were a little girl.

220
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,015
The cortexiphan trials.

221
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,795
As I've said, the drug

222
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,185
worked on perception.

223
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,091
Of the 30 children that William Bell
and I experimented on,

224
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,138
you were the first with the ability

225
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:49,471
to identify things
from the other side.

226
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,877
We gave you the ability.

227
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:53,237
You were conducting
illegal drug trials on children.

228
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,230
Don't make that sound
like charity work.

229
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:57,270
Was it me who described
it as a glimmer?

230
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,981
I can't see it anymore.

231
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,016
Because I believe you
stopped wanting to.

232
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,904
When you did,
there were consequences,

233
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,529
but I was able to

234
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,074
elicit the ability once. I believe
I may be able to do it again.

235
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,946
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not experimenting on Olivia,

236
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,745
- and besides...
- Okay, I'll do it.

237
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,414
We don't have time, so just
tell me what it is I need to do.

238
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,344
First, I need a plane. I need
to go to Jacksonville to the lab

239
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:22,086
where Billy and I first conducted
the cortexiphan trials.

240
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:24,305
It's a day care center
you attended as a child.

241
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,803
I should be able to recreate
the procedure there.

242
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,804
Walter,
Jacksonville's 1,000 miles away.

243
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,727
It's 1,016 to be exact, not counting
the trip to the airport.

244
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,371
Look, Walter, I'm sure whatever
you need, we can get it here.

245
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,295
What I need is in Jacksonville!

246
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,526
Jacksonville is where
the process worked.

247
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,567
If I am able to do it again,
it has to be there.

248
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:52,099
A building in Manhattan is
just going to disappear?

249
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,228
Yes, that's what Walter believes.

250
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,497
What makes him think whatever
he needs to trigger this ability

251
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,962
of yours is still inside
the facility in Jacksonville?

252
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,132
When William Bell
founded Massive Dynamic,

253
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,490
he bought the building
and the entire military base

254
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:07,507
it was sitting on from the government.
He shut it down and closed it off.

255
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,202
I believe that everything
is still inside.

256
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,795
And you're sure you want to do this?

257
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,140
Submit yourself
to Dr. Bishop's experiments?

258
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,213
I don't see another choice.

259
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,105
Then how can I help?

260
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,492
The events that ted pratchet said
led up to the incident...

261
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,111
the dogs howling,
the small earthquakes...

262
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,489
Walter thinks that
they will likely occur again

263
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,116
and that we can use them
to infer when it's about to happen.

264
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,822
I'll contact Nina Sharp,

265
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,317
ask to her to have Massive Dynamic
enlisttheir geologic division

266
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:38,913
to track any seismic activity.

267
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,124
- Thank you.
- And Dunham?

268
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,002
Stay in touch.

269
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,839
I will.

270
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,577
5...

271
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,292
20...

272
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:22,512
10.

273
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:24,751
I always use the same

274
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,969
combination, though I can't
remember the significance.

275
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:19,973
Come.

276
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,086
Do you see anything?

277
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:41,578
Like what?

278
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,873
16 items in this room...

279
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,751
are from the other side.

280
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,425
Perhaps if you look a little closer.
Come.

281
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:13,719
Go ahead.

282
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:30,627
Nothing.

283
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,040
Well...

284
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,767
We should get started.

285
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,090
I was hoping to avoid this.

286
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,793
I have a freakishly good memory.

287
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,403
I remember everything.

288
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,377
But not this.

289
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,761
There's just nothing
that's familiar.

290
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,097
Maybe that's a good thing.

291
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,561
You just about ready?

292
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,010
You may want to change into
something more comfortable.

293
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:12,534
Perception is largely
an emotional response.

294
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:15,792
How we feel...

295
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:18,365
affects the way we see the world.

296
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,707
And so Billy and I reasoned
that extreme emotions

297
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:25,259
would stimulate this perception,
that acute feelings

298
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,241
of fear and love

299
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,806
or anger would
heighten the awareness.

300
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,891
Open the mind, as it were.

301
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,685
The drugs help, of course.

302
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:35,937
Is that cortexiphan?

303
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,606
Start the I.V. Drip, please,

304
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,066
and lift up.

305
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:49,200
You sure you want to do this?

306
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:51,501
Wait!

307
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,579
Right arm.

308
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,423
No, left arm.
Left arm.

309
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:04,090
When you're under,

310
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,467
the drugs will generate an obstacle.

311
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,177
I can't tell you what it will be.

312
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,368
It will be uniquely yours.
Do you understand?

313
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:12,617
- I think so.
- It will make more sense

314
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:15,518
when you're under.
The point is this. That...

315
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,872
facing that obstacle will
elevate your emotional state.

316
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:23,359
Much as running on a treadmill
will elevate your heartbeat.

317
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,729
And then when I've got you
to the proper level,

318
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:29,198
well, then I'll pull you out, okay?

319
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:31,701
I am singing in the rain.

320
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,024
The drugs are working fast.

321
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,685
- Perhaps it was the right arm.
- What?

322
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:40,752
She'll be fine, Peter.

323
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,118
Would you turn that around?

324
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:50,234
Thank you.

325
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,793
Olivia,
I want you to open your eyes.

326
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,193
Can you hear me?

327
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,503
If you can hear me, open your eyes.

328
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,886
Where are you?

329
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,441
I'm in a forest.

330
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:20,840
I can see very tall trees.

331
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,087
That's good, Olivia.

332
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,479
Theta rhythms are normal.
Stable neocortex active.

333
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,470
It's working.

334
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,649
There's someone else here.

335
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:11,545
- Is she all right?
- No, but she's not supposed to be.

336
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,153
In my bag, Peter.

337
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,734
The pretzels.

338
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:24,764
Pretzels.

339
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,140
- It's all right.
- Please.

340
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:01,379
I don't want to do this anymore.

341
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,228
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

342
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,731
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

343
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:16,032
Wait!

344
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,847
She's close.

345
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,332
Wait, wait...

346
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:30,314
It's okay.

347
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,721
Please. Make them stop.
Please make them stop it.

348
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:43,504
It's okay.
I'm here now.

349
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:45,436
Nothing can hurt you.

350
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:47,047
It's okay.

351
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:49,857
That's better.

352
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,406
What's your name?

353
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:28,312
Good news.

354
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:31,524
- It worked.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

355
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,597
You did this to little children?

356
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:43,857
We should get to work.

357
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,799
- Anything?
- Nothing.

358
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:32,960
Now what?

359
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,254
Should we find
some more kids to scare?

360
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:42,933
I have no idea.

361
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:06,818
Phillip, it's me.

362
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,708
It started.

363
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,051
<i>Is she okay?</i>

364
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:39,638
<i>She's fine.</i>

365
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,868
<i>Hell, do we know what triggered it?</i>

366
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,739
<i>Obviously she was upset, William.</i>

367
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,688
<i>It's okay. It's all right, Olive.</i>

368
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,004
That's me.

369
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,445
What happened?

370
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:03,467
This was the first time
you saw the other side.

371
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,942
You were frightened.

372
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,597
Started a fire with your mind.

373
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:13,811
It should have worked.

374
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:17,343
This is the very sort of thing
that William and I were preparing for.

375
00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:19,692
You abused us, Walter.
Me and those other children.

376
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:24,488
We were trying to help you,
to make you more than you were.

377
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,081
Is that what you were doing?

378
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,793
Or were you searching
for answers to questions

379
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:31,243
that you shouldn't have been
asking in the first place?

380
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:34,039
- I was a different man then.
- I was a defenseless child.

381
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:41,885
Yes, you were.

382
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:48,582
Yes, you were.

383
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,187
Olivia, I think I'm starting
to understand

384
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,673
why the process didn't work.
You are different.

385
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:58,606
You're not that
frightened child anymore.

386
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:01,641
I thought all we needed
was a heightened

387
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,789
emotional response from you,
but I was wrong.

388
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:06,030
We needed a specific one.
Fear.

389
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,241
And you're not capable
of that anymore.

390
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,920
Well, not like she was.

391
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,521
What we did to you...

392
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:15,281
You found a way to protect yourself.

393
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:18,592
You channeled your fear into anger,

394
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:22,028
which is why you were
so good at your job.

395
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:25,735
But if you want
to save those people,

396
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:28,186
you have to find your way back

397
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,304
to that scared little girl.

398
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,806
And how do we do that?

399
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,226
I don't know.

400
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,987
Is this a part of Walter's test?

401
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:19,288
Are you all right?

402
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,929
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

403
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:38,432
Okay, let me know
if anything changes.

404
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,239
Four tremors in the last two hours.

405
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:43,009
Most recent measured 2.6.

406
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,105
They're increasing in frequency.

407
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:54,948
I'm sorry.

408
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,531
You didn't send
that building over here.

409
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,005
So what's plan "B"?

410
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:00,920
We're compiling data.

411
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,494
Trying to predict where
the next incident will take place.

412
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,251
Satellite images,
seismic activity, weather patterns.

413
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:09,630
- You need a fresh set of eyes?
- Yes. I'll take you to the lab.

414
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,596
We've still got time.

415
00:34:20,262 --> 00:34:22,483
We've been plotting the epicenter
of each microquake

416
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,675
Looking for some sort of pattern.

417
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,923
Can you regress any
of the data points?

418
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,282
It's a waste of time.

419
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,060
Useless attempt to impose order
on random, meaningless data.

420
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:33,990
Tried the same thing 25 years ago

421
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,215
when the car came over,
tried to tell them why.

422
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,333
Why there? Why'd it land
in the middle of the quad?

423
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,296
The answer is there was no answer.

424
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,408
Except mass.

425
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:47,470
The two cars.
You said they were the same mass.

426
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:50,636
You two have something going on?
Do you want to fill me in?

427
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,465
Walter seems to think that the two
universes have to be in balance.

428
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,544
So a building from over
there travels over here.

429
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:57,849
That means a building over here
of exactly the same mass

430
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:00,389
- has to travel back.
- Raiders of the lost ark.

431
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,974
The bag of sand and the idol.

432
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,226
Not the metaphor I would have used,
but, yes, exactly.

433
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,256
- Do you have a pencil?
- I have a pen.

434
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:09,803
I need satellite data and 3D imagery
to calculate the cubic feet.

435
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:11,563
I'll also need a comprehensive list

436
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:13,819
of all building materials
used during construction.

437
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:17,406
For every freestanding
structure in New York city?

438
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,951
I think we can rule out
the Empire State Building.

439
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,579
Peter. Anything?

440
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,957
Good news.
We have a plan.

441
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:42,483
He can eliminate the three buildings
in Tribeca, because they're way too big.

442
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,391
- Are they lofts?
- Yeah, why?

443
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,023
Lofts have no interior walls.

444
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:49,272
Even though one of the buildings might
be bigger, they could be the same mass.

445
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:52,107
The guys downstairs
on the supercomputer

446
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,068
are crunching numbers on the buildings,
but it's gonna take some time.

447
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:57,097
What else can I do to help?

448
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,617
It's time.

449
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,332
It could happen any moment now.

450
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,836
How many buildings are we down to?

451
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:14,958
<i>147 buildings</i>

452
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,046
spread out all over Manhattan.

453
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,454
Three hospitals,
a cancer treatment center,

454
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,779
a nursing home.

455
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:24,973
The NYPD and the fire department
have a standing evacuation protocol.

456
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,518
With our help, they could clear
most of those buildings...

457
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,173
The evacuation itself would
kill a lot of these people.

458
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,746
Not to mention cause a city-wide panic
that might kill thousands more.

459
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,570
The largest building
on this list has, what,

460
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,746
500 people?

461
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,157
So you think we should just
let the building disappear?

462
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,119
Let those people disappear?

463
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:49,954
There are times when
the only choices you have left

464
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,500
are bad ones.

465
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,864
I figured if I could shut down
all the non-essential functions,

466
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,847
I can make these things run faster.

467
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:06,849
It's too late.

468
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:08,429
I failed.

469
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:12,978
I failed and I'm supposed to be the one
who can stop things like this.

470
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,783
You...

471
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:25,318
I've never met anyone

472
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:27,543
who can do the things that you do.

473
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,222
I'm scared.

474
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:49,826
Don't be.

475
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,440
What?

476
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,369
Peter, I'm scared.

477
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,107
It was in the West Village
near the Hudson, I think.

478
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:32,970
- I couldn't see exactly where.
- <i>Was it near the piers?</i>

479
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:35,488
- A couple of blocks from the river.
- Were there any landmarks?

480
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,728
- Other buildings nearby there?
- Yeah, that new tower,

481
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:40,092
- the one near the elevated tracks.
- The high line.

482
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,110
Still too many potential candidates.

483
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,260
Olivia, we need you
to narrow it down...

484
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:48,404
<i>I'm trying.</i>

485
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:56,416
Okay, I see it.
It's on Washington.

486
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,435
Peter, there was a hotel
on Washington.

487
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,039
What do we have on Washington?

488
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:02,965
Brayson place hotel. 13th
and Washington, number's right there.

489
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,871
Call chief Solomon at the NYPD.

490
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:06,685
Call the fire department...
Hello, yes.

491
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,845
This is special agent
Phillip Broyles with the FBI.

492
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,765
You need to evacuate everyone
from the building immediately.

493
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,709
- Is everybody out?
- I think so.

494
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:38,060
I guess it's safe to say that you've
got the rest of the night off work.

495
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,931
<i>... Hundred miraculously escaped
what federal authorities</i>

496
00:40:47,056 --> 00:40:49,732
<i>are calling
an unschedule control demolition</i>

497
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,445
<i>at the Brayson Place hotel.</i>

498
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,743
The conspiracy nuts are
gonna have a field day.

499
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,828
You'd be surprised what you can make
The general public believe.

500
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,253
You saved a lot of people.

501
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,708
We all did.

502
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,519
This ability you've demonstrated...

503
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,198
what finally activated it?

504
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,918
I think it was just time.

505
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,085
Yeah, monopoly is great.
He loves the colored money.

506
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,847
Okay. Thanks again.

507
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,113
I'll see you soon.

508
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,237
That was Astrid. She's gonna come over
and play some games with you.

509
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,386
Good.
I hope she likes monopoly.

510
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,295
- Where are you going?
- Me? I'm going out for drinks.

511
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,082
Who are you drinking with?

512
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,137
A date?

513
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:48,004
No, just drinks. Apparently,
that's what normal people do.

514
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,730
They go out for drinks.

515
00:42:11,178 --> 00:42:12,792
If you need to reach me,

516
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,657
I'll leave you the number
of the restaurant right here, okay?

517
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,877
- She's here, Peter.
- I know, I heard it too.

518
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,418
- Shall I get the door?
- Absolutely not.

519
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:25,169
In fact, it would be my preference

520
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,327
if you could be someplace
else all together.

521
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:29,171
- Where?
- Chicago?

522
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:33,246
Come on in.

523
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,351
I know a great place.
