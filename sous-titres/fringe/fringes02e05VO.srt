Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,234
Unh!

BROYLES:
<i>You had no choice.</i>

5
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,782
Whatever that thing was,
it wasn't Charlie.

<i>quite an ordeal.</i>

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,959
<i>What's this?</i>

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,563
<i>Sam Weiss--the man who helped</i>
<i>put me back together.</i>

9
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:19,593
You can take the shoes
off now, we're done.

10
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,523
- I just got here.
- Come back tomorrow.

11
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:23,849
By then, I'll have found you
the perfect bowling ball.

12
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,794
I was told that
you could fix me.

13
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:29,700
Take care, Agent Dunham.

We're closed.

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,229
I think I owe you
a thank you.

17
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:47,681
I got my memories back
from the accident,

18
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,880
so...

19
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,061
I figured I wouldn't be
needing these.

20
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,529
Who died?

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,901
You and your partner,
Charlie,

22
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:04,055
were pretty close, huh?

23
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,324
<i>Yeah.</i>

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,209
I guess getting
your memory back

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,385
wasn't your only problem.

26
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,236
Oh, of course
I have problems, but...

27
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:17,549
The problems I have
I can handle.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,996
Sure you can.

29
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,063

30
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:32,731
<i>what you need right now,</i>
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

31
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:33,866

32

<i>with everything</i>
<i>you've been going through...</i>

33
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,462
Something to help you...

00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,630
make sense of it all.

35
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:47,378
Like bowling.

36
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,816
Well, what do you know?
She makes a joke.

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,864
No, I got
another project for you.

38
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,087
Uh, yes, like bowling.

39
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:57,722
You're gonna think
I'm full of it,

40
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,651
but here's
the thing, Olivia...

41
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,814
Whether you admit it
or not,

42
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,896
your life is something
of a nightmare.

43
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,611

<i>Jeez, Greg. Carl's really</i>
<i>pissed off at you.</i>

47
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,065
What, uh--
what'd you do, man?

48
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,756
- <i>You better get in there.</i>
- I'm going.

49

[distorted voices]

50
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,672
Finally.
We've been waiting.

51
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,894
Are you okay?

52
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:09,295
Whatever happened, make sure
we all go away.

53
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:12,741
You know how much
trouble you caused me.

54
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,253
I am going
to destroy you!

55
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,198
What the hell?

56
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,175
[grunting]

57
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,905

You can bring that
in here, please.

61
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:05,384
Hang on.

62
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,392
Walter,
what are you doing?

63
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:09,870
Making my bed.

64
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,016
I've got a fireplace
to keep me warm,

65
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,750
and if I get hungry
in the middle of the night,

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,022
the kitchen is only
13 steps away,

67
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,220
which is a prime number

68
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,803
and a sign
of good fortune.

69
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,915
You know that
you have a bedroom, right?

70
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:23,738
<i>Upstairs.</i>

71
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,033
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

72
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,347
Don't worry, son.

73
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:29,341
I promise to wear
my shorts to bed

74
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,521
so that if you bring
any young ladies home,

75
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:33,458
there won't be
any embarrassing moments.

76
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,704
Knock, knock.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,748
<i>Agent Farnsworth.</i>

78
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,354
Welcome to our new home.

79
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:38,909
Thank you.

80
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,941
Oh.
Oh, housewarming.

81
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:43,647
I love presents.

82
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:45,945
Hey.

83
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,832
- Oh.
- Walter, come on.

00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,288
Italian ciabatta bread.

85
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,136
- Very impressive, Walter.
- Yes!

86
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,443
It's for good luck.

87
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,512
I brought something
for you too.

88
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,605
Oh, you shouldn't have.

89
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,459
Agent Dunham
sent this over.

90
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,104
A man kills his boss,
he doesn't remember,

91
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,016
<i>and then he has this really</i>
<i>crazy thing with his eyes.</i>

92
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,831
This says there's
video surveillance.

93
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,524
<i>I saw it.</i>

94
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,438
Whatever was happening
to that man,

95
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,583
it wasn't normal.

96
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,685
Do I eat it or keep it?

97
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,876
I suppose
whichever you'd like.

98
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,098
Pack a bag, Walter.

99
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,489
We're going to Seattle.

100
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:44,885
PETER:
<i>Thank you.</i>

101
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,210
There you go.

102
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:51,787
Do you have a card?

103
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,122
In case we need a ride
while we're in town.

104
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:55,890
Thank you.

105
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,259
MAN:
Thanks for coming out.

106
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,130
We brought Mr. Leader here
around 6:00 last night.

107
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,339
We haven't managed to get
anything out of him.

108
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,259
He hasn't been
cooperative?

109
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:08,549
He hasn't been
responsive.

110
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,114
We only just managed
to wake him up.

111
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,008
Wait.

112
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:13,710
He's been asleep
for 16 hours?

113
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:14,941
Like he
was drugged.

114
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,466
The doctors only managed to wake
him up a few minutes ago.

115
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,872
[ominous music]

116
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,350
Peter, I-I don't want
to go in there.

117
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,529
I'd rather
stay out here.

118
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,146
Sure.

119
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,045
OLIVIA: Can you tell us
what happened, Mr. Leader?

120
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,374
It doesn't make sense.

121
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:43,139
I remember driving
to work from lunch,

122
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,153
pulling into the garage,

123
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,710
and then I was on the floor
in Carl Langdon's office.

124
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,089
They were
holding me down.

125
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,777
And there's nothing else

126
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:57,441
that you remember
from yesterday?

127
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,325
Nothing unusual?

128
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,969
You're gonna think
I'm crazy.

129
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,269
Try me.

130
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:06,670
The office...

131
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,382
It was like the office

132
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,772
was infiltrated
by these creatures.

133
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,148
And Carl,
he was their leader.

134
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,617
<i>He had horns...</i>

135
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,127
<i>like some demon.</i>

136
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,706
I know.
It sounds nuts.

137
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,660
Almost like
I'm dreaming,

138
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,413
or like it was...

139
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,849
[breathing heavily]

140
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:31,612
Mr. Leader?

141
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,615
- Mr. Leader?
- Walter!

142
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:40,995
<i>What is it?</i>

143
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:44,672
WOMAN: <i>Greg!</i>

144
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,673
MAN: <i>You can't go</i>
<i>in the room, Mrs. Leader.</i>

145
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,746
<i>What's happening to him?</i>

146
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,248
- <i>Greg!</i>
- <i>Mrs. Leader. Please!</i>

147
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,669
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

148
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,645
No, Greg!

149
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,119
No! No!

150
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,489
WALTER: That's odd.

151
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,354
Warm.

152
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,158
He should be cooler
by now.

153
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,239
The oven--

154
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,732
Peter, I think we forgot
to turn it off at home.

155
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,173
Walter, we've never
even turned it on.

156
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:14,944
You sure?

157
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:17,072
Walter, we never
turned the oven on.

158
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,527
We did not leave
the front door unlocked,

159
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,348
and the toaster is not
gonna burn the house down.

160
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,284
What's going on
with you, Walter?

161
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,617
<i>You've been acting weird</i>
<i>ever since we got here.</i>

162
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,358
Apologies, we're still waiting
on the tox screen.

163
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,210
But the blood CBC
is, uh--

164
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:28,687
Severe thyroxine deficit,

165
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:31,547
curiously high levels
of adrenal hormones.

166
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:32,894
How did you know that?

167
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,825
Shock-induced
achromotrichia,

168
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,392
hyperkeratotic
skin lesions,

169
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:41,190
and clear signs
of dehydration.

170
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,497
It seems that this man
died of--

171
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,490
Of acute exhaustion.

172
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,725
That doesn't make
any sense.

173
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,421
- Human beings can't die of--
- Not that we're aware of, no.

174
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,026
It has been documented
in rats.

175
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:57,202
I need this body
taken back to my lab.

176
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:57,804
Your lab?

177
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:00,920
- In Boston, Massachusetts.
- Walter, whatever you need,

178
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,068
I'm sure
they have it here.

179
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,753
Would you excuse me,
Doctor?

180
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,219
Peter,
I-I need to go home.

181
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,007
I don't like it here.

182
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:12,323
- Walter.
- This city has a smell.

183
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:13,709
- Walter.
- It's wet!

184
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,721
It reminds me
of St. Claire's,

185
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,781
the mental institution
where I lived.

186
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,025
Peter,
I want to go home.

187
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,889
You stay.
Help Agent Dunham, but--

188
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,557
Okay.

189
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,856
We'll find someone
to take you home.

190
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:34,065
Thank you.

191
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:37,213
Seems pretty harmless.

192
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,902
Looks can be deceiving.

193
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,225
Buddy, I've been with
the bureau for three years.

194
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,417
Flying your father home
shouldn't be a problem.

195
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,667
Right.

196
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:47,784
You'll want to keep
his Sudoku pad handy.

197
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:48,744
There's also a copy

198
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,611
of Max Planck's book on entropy
in his backpack.

199
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:52,013
That should keep him busy
for a couple hours.

200
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:54,297
And whatever you do, under
no circumstances let him drink.

201
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,590
Bit of a tippler, huh?

202
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,206
No, at any given time,
there's a good chance

203
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,742
there's about a half dozen
psychotropic drugs

204
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,401
in his system, so drinking--
It's not a good idea.

205
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:03,705
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:06,625
You know, I really
appreciate your cooperation.

207
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:07,719
Yeah, no problem.

208
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:10,213
Do you have
a business card?

209
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,280
So that I-I can send you
a copy of the results.

210
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:15,817
Uh, of course.

211
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:19,641
Thank you.

212
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:20,959
<i>[Walter groaning]</i>

213
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:21,733
<i>No!</i>

214
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:24,834
You can't put the body
in feet first.

215
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,904
Lunatics.
Out, out.

216
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:28,598
You think he'll be
all right?

217
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,422
Walter,
or Agent Cashner?

218
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,854
MRS LEADER: Greg used to call me
every day after lunch.

219
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,727
When he didn't call,
I knew something was wrong.

220
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,074
But there'd...

221
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:48,835
There'd been no change
in his behavior recently?

222
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:52,740
He was a little more tired
than usual,

223
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,840
but he'd been
working a lot.

224
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,577
But no illnesses?

225
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,803
<i>No hallucinations?</i>

226
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:00,720
No, not at all.

227
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:02,929
I can't believe
he's gone.

228
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,236
Mrs. Leader...

229
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:07,985
Did your husband
have any sleep issues?

230
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:11,407
These books--
<i>Guide to Sleep Disorders,</i>

231
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,693
<i>Understanding Sleep...</i>

232
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,655
He used to sleepwalk.

233
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,073
<i>Sometimes he'd wake up</i>
<i>in the kitchen</i>

234
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:21,068
having cooked a whole meal.

235
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,619
Was he ever violent?

236
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:27,318
No, never.

237
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,395
And he was cured.

238
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,447
He had seen
a few specialists.

239
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,647
He hadn't had an episode
in six months.

240
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,132
Uh, we'll need the names
of those doctors.

241
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,069
And did he by any chance
keep a sleep journal?

242
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:42,903
Yeah.
Would you like to see it?

243
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:45,038
Yes. Please.

244
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,220
WALTER:
Just in time, dear.

245
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,810
Help me with this
infernal body bag.

246
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:52,640
This is
Agent Cashner.

247
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:53,984
Walter,
it's almost midnight.

248
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,104
Yes, I'll hold.

249
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:57,043
The ride back
was invigorating.

250
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:59,310
The turbulence over Ohio

251
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,780
was like being in the belly
of a seizing whale.

252
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,909
I screamed
like a little girl.

253
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:06,996
I'm sure
that went over well

254
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,520
with the rest
of the passengers.

255
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:09,639
No, it's Bishop.

256
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,539
B-I-S-H-O-P.

257
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,271
<i>Yes, we got the body.</i>

258
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,385
What's that about?

259
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,397
They detained our bags.

260
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:17,480
Raw milk?

261
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,042
No, I'm pretty sure

262
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:21,429
Dr. Bishop wouldn't have packed
a bottle of raw--

263
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,341
[moos]

264
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:23,816
Milk.

265
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,237
Yes, I understand
it's against the law.

266
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:27,052
I'm a federal agent.

267
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,774
That's odd--
nine stitches...

268
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,072
Surgical.

269
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:37,695
There's no reason
for an incision there.

270
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:42,092
Astricks,

271
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,156
my small bone saw,
please.

272
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,420
Astrid.

273
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,422
Yes?

274
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,483
<i>Dr. Bishop,</i>
<i>I-I'm sorry,</i>

275
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,964
but, uh, those bags
won't be available to us

276
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:51,745
<i>until morning.</i>

277
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,775
That's okay.

278
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,194
In fact, you can assist us
in removing his scalp.

279
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,037
Once you get used to the smell,
it's really quite something.

280
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:01,617
Come on.

281
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,272
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,186
I didn't wake you,
did I?

283
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:17,713
What?

284
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:19,188
Cute.

285
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:22,230
Except in my case,
I actually graduated.

286
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,449
I'm guessing,
uh, you bought yours

287
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,654
to impress the girls.

288
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,324
Yeah, more or less.

289
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,890
So what you got?

290
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,310
Greg Leader's sleep journal.

291
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:32,886
His wife was right.

292
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,911
For the last couple months,
he's been averaging

293
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,919
between eight and ten hours
of sleep every night.

294
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,894
Then how can he die
of exhaustion?

295
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:39,733
<i>It gets weirder.</i>

296
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,702
<i>He was also using it</i>
<i>as a dream diary.</i>

297
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,021
Guess what his
nightmares were about.

298
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:45,904
Demons?

299
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,305
Yeah.
At least once a week.

300
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,762
Then a couple months ago,
all of a sudden, they stop.

301
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,762
So do you think this is some kind
of extreme sleepwalking?

302
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:56,440
No, sleepwalkers
don't generally get violent.

303
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,382
And unlike Greg Leader,

304
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,774
they don't remember
their experiences.

305
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,859
Where'd you learn that?
M.I.T.?

306
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,228
As a kid, I used to get
these terrible nightmares,

307
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:05,294
almost every night.

308
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,197
So I know a thing or two
about dreaming.

309
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,183
I'm sorry.
That must have been awful.

310
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,786
Actually, it was one
of the rare occasions

311
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:14,927
in my childhood
that Walter was helpful.

312
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:18,110
He taught me
to condition myself.

313
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:19,860
Every night
before I went to sleep,

314
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,489
I had to say
a mantra in my head.

315
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:24,698
"Please don't dream tonight.
Please don't dream tonight.

316
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:25,929
Please don't dream tonight."

317
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,056
Did that work?

318
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:29,837
Well, you can't stop yourself
from dreaming,

319
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:31,380
but it did make it
so that I didn't remember.

320
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:35,881
From the age
of 8 to almost 19,

321
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,122
don't remember
a single dream.

322
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:38,977
No more nightmares.

323
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,554
[cell phone rings]

324
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:49,113
There's been
another incident.

325
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,464
MAN: <i>Guy on the bike</i>
<i>was dead on impact.</i>

326
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,421
<i>Must have been driving</i>
<i>40 miles per hour</i>

327
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:57,472
- <i>which killed him.</i>
- <i>Crash-killed her, too?</i>

328
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,571
<i>She's dead</i>
<i>but it wasn't the crash.</i>

329
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:01,440
MAN: <i>Ellen was calling</i>
<i>to let me know</i>

330
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:03,101
<i>she was heading home</i>
<i>from the office.</i>

331
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:05,832
We were on the phone
when she...

332
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,334
She said
she saw a monster.

333
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,478
Did--did you see
her white hair?

334
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:13,697
What happened to her?

335
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,826
Hold it steady,
Agent Casper.

336
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:19,293
It's Cashner.

337
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:22,255
Do this kind
of thing often?

338
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,123
Brains? No.

339
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:28,150
Although Walter
gets particularly excited

340
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,071
<i>whenever we do.</i>

341
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:31,865
Hmm.

342
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,660
Look at that.

343
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:37,724
Would you call Peter?

344
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:50,170
Ugh. I'm out.

345
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:53,743
Hey, I've got Walter
for you.

346
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,124
PETER: <i>A filament?</i>
<i>What kind of filament?</i>

347
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,231
Hold on a second, fellas.
Mind if I take a look at her?

348
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,684
Some kind
of little computer chip

349
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,351
imbedded in his midbrain.

350
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:07,972
The thalamus?

351
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:10,489
Yes, that would make sense.
Well done, son.

352
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,695
Hold up, Walter.
Agent Dunham!

353
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:14,190
Excuse me.

354
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:16,929
What does that do--
the thalamus?

355
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,604
Why is it relevant?

356
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,998
It's the part of the brain
that regulates sleep.

357
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,050
What are you looking for?

358
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,658
That.

359
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,662
BROYLES: <i>Both the victims</i>
<i>had been surgically implanted.</i>

360
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:42,893
<i>It's a bio-chip.</i>

361
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:46,066
<i>Technically a brain-computer</i>
<i>interface, or BCI.</i>

362
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,510
<i>This particular chip</i>

363
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:49,416
has a transmitter,
which makes it wireless.

364
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,755
So it can commit the brain
to a remote computer?

365
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:53,739
That's right.

366
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,405
From what
we can ascertain,

367
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,001
we think it works
a lot like a pacemaker.

368
00:16:58,883 --> 00:16:59,880
It monitors sleep cycles

369
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,509
and, when necessary,
stimulates the thalamus,

370
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:04,374
which induces
a deeper sleep state.

371
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,690
<i>There is a researcher</i>
<i>in Seattle</i>

372
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,890
<i>who has worked on</i>
<i>several prototypes like it.</i>

373
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:10,732
<i>The man's a genius.</i>

374
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,332
<i>We've been tracking him</i>
<i>for years.</i>

375
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,875
Thank you.

376
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,267
I'll let the team know.

377
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,788
Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak?

378
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,115
I'm Olivia Dunham.
I'm with the FBI.

379
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,619
We were wondering if you
were familiar with Greg Leader

380
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,200
and Ellen Rosiello.

381
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,671
Yes, they're patients.

382
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,821
What's this about?

383
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,792
Both of them recently
committed homicidal attacks

384
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:39,494
and then died,

385
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,795
as a result of what appears
to be extreme exhaustion.

386
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:43,575
Oh, God.

387
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:45,585
Dr. Nayak,
we found a bio-chip

388
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,331
imbedded
in Mr. Leader's brain.

389
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,636
- Do you know--
- Yes. Yes, of course.

390
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,512
They both had them.
They were part of a study.

391
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,511
So you've implanted those chips
into other people?

392
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,274
It's a large-scale,
clinical trial.

393
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,880
There are 60
in the control group

394
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,177
and 82
with the bio-chips.

395
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:01,733
We're gonna need
their names,

396
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:03,078
all of them.

397
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,490
I've been working
on this chip for years.

398
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,292
I've tested it extensively.

399
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:08,769
PETER:
And there's no malfunction

400
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,513
that could have caused
the kind of reaction we saw?

401
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:11,997
What if
the chip shorted out?

402
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,453
Even if it had, the chip
should have remained benign.

403
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,103
Why is this...?

404
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,021
[ominous music]

405
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:25,744
Wait here.

406
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:37,807
The main computer server.

407
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:41,197
It contained all my research--
the patients' files.

408
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,362
It's all gone.

409
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:46,497
<i>The patients' files</i>

410
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,409
are backed up
on a remote server.

411
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:50,470
I'll give you
the password.

412
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:55,847
Dr. Nayak.

413
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:57,751
My research assistant.

414
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,002
Zach, call the nurses.

415
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:01,513
We need the names
of all the patients.

416
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,655
<i>Everyone</i>
<i>they can remember.</i>

417
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,685
Sure.
Uh, I-I'll get right on it.

418
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:08,417
The password.

419
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:10,509
Thank you.

420
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,217
Dr. Nayak,
can you think of anyone

421
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,825
who would want to steal
your data

422
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,713
or might
want to sabotage you?

423
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,523
I-I don't know.

424
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:21,219
I-I suppose there are
any number of companies.

425
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,369
The chip was valuable?

426
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,487
Oh, the initial testing
has been remarkable.

427
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,957
It's cured sleepwalking,
night terrors...

428
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:29,301
All major non-REM
sleep disorders.

429
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,315
These people
just wanted some rest,

430
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,545
and my chip
was helping them.

431
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,454
It wouldn't make them
hurt anyone,

432
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,092
and it certainly
wouldn't kill them.

433
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,208
It just doesn't make
any sense.

434
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,023
Dr. Nayak, do you have
a business card?

435
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,953
Just for our records.

436
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,362
I'll get you one.

437
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:02,842
Well, the doctor
is beside himself.

438
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,687
And aside from the obvious,
which is money,

439
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:05,799
he can't think
of any reason

440
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,735
why someone would want
to steal his research.

441
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:08,511
I can.

442
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,015
The bio-chip plugs directly
into the thalamus,

443
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:12,283
which not only
regulates sleep,

444
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,505
it also works
as a relay tower

445
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:14,497
to the cerebral cortex,

446
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,281
which also controls
motor function.

447
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,657
WALTER:
<i>Mind control, Peter.</i>

448
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,627
Wouldn't be the first time
someone's attempted it.

449
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,229
I told you
about my work

450
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,161
with the MK-ultra project.

451
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,236
Of course, at that time,
we supposed we could do it

452
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,904
<i>with LSD</i>
<i>and hypnotic suggestion.</i>

453
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,135
So it is possible?

454
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:35,350
<i>Theoretically, yes.</i>

455
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,141
If I faxed you a schematic

456
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:38,701
of the device's
internal architecture,

457
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:40,202
could you test
the chip you have?

458
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,804
Yes, but I'd need to replicate
the chip's function

459
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,380
in a neutral environment.

460
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,179
Of course, I-if I had
a live subject...

461
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:49,706
Walter, no.

462
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,313
<i>No student volunteers.</i>

463
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,601
Good news:
The bags are back.

464
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,989
<i>Walter. Walter.</i>

465
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:59,112
Walter, say it--
"No students."

466
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,001
All right,
no students.

467
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:04,986
[phone beeps]

468
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:07,657
OLIVIA: Okay, well, get back
to me as soon as you can.

469
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:08,974
<i>Hey.</i>

470
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:09,773
Hey.

471
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,218
So, uh,
did you reach Walter?

472
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:14,170
Yeah.

473
00:21:14,682 --> 00:21:15,976
He thinks it could be
mind control,

474
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,618
but modifying the bio-chips

475
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,896
would take a lot
of trial and error.

476
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,260
So he thinks
that someone's

477
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,725
trying to perfect
mind control

478
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,029
one patient at a time?

479
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,536
Well, that would explain
why the events

480
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,514
are seemingly
without motive.

481
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:28,055
Yeah.

482
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,388
How's the patient
roundup going?

483
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:31,753
<i>Nayak could only list</i>
<i>26 patients.</i>

484
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,104
So the local P.D. are taking
them into his clinic

485
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:38,432
and removing their chips,

486
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,337
so to speak.

487
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:40,934
That still leaves, what?

488
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,268
50-odd patients.

489
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:56,982
Listen...

490
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,011
Olivia,
I think I understand

491
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:03,874
what it is
that you're going through, but...

492
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,599
that thing
that you killed...

493
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,984
<i>That wasn't Charlie.</i>

494
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:08,685
I know.

495
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:15,529
It's just, I--

496
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,082
You know,
my first week on the job,

497
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:21,963
I was on
a sting operation.

498
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,774
These Irish thugs

499
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,496
were smuggling guns
and--and cocaine.

500
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,551
And I had been
a military prosecutor,

501
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:33,587
so I hadn't handled
a gun

502
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,355
since basic training.

503
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,532
And suddenly,

504
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,469
I'm underground
in this garage,

505
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:43,304
wearing
a bulletproof vest

506
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,902
and--and wondering
how the hell I got there.

507
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:48,911
So I did what
any rookie would do,

508
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:50,358
and I started looking
for an exit.

509
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:54,495
And then Charlie
walks over.

510
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,067
This man
that I didn't know--

511
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,107
This gruff guy.

512
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,376
And...

513
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:02,794
He said...

514
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,251
"You're gonna be fine."

515
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:18,455
And, um,
I have to face it...

516
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:21,786
That he...

517
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:23,956
He's gone...

518
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:27,638
And that
he's not coming back.

519
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:30,459
So I'm just gonna go

520
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:32,583
to Nayak's clinic

521
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:36,161
and--and see if
I can help the nurse

522
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,083
identify
some other patients.

So what'd your friends
think of my moussaka?

536
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,360
Would you say good-bye

538
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,857
Certainly.

539
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:43,720
Oh, before you go,
could you do me a favor

540
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,175
and smell this?

541
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,303
It seems my olfactory sense
is a bit muddled.

542
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:51,082
Must be the French roast coffee
I had for breakfast.

00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:17,982
Keep Miss Barage sedated

546
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,065
Then bring in
my next patient.

you're all upset.

549
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,571
We should contact
the local pharmacies too.

550
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:30,073

00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,143
Excuse me.
Hello?

00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,800
What's shakin', Bacon?

00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,740
<i>Oh, the usual--I'm just</i>

You get

558
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,782
Uh, yeah.

559
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,812
I got, uh--
I got eight of them.

560
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:52,396
Eight? You asked everyone

561
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,337
<i>Yeah.</i>

562
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:55,445
So what do I do now?

563
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,775
<i>Lay them out in front of you</i>

<i>When you're finished,</i>

<i>take all the letters</i>
<i>you've circled</i>

568
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,205
<i>and write them down</i>
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

569
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:11,349
<i>Got it?</i>

570
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:12,492
Okay.

571
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,157
<i>Now what?</i>

572
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:17,442
Now jumble.

573
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:19,878
Jumble?

574
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:22,457
Jumble, anagram,
word puzzle.

575
00:27:22,492 --> 00:27:23,721
<i>Find the phrase.</i>

576
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,500
What phrase?

577
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,270
What--what am I
looking for?

578
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:30,047
<i>Whatever it is</i>
<i>you need to hear.</i>

579
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,591
You'll figure it out.
Got to go.

581
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,358
You know, I really don't have

Agent Broyles?

584
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,042
Nayak's patient files

585
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,443
The server
at the data-storage facility

586
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,723
was wiped some time
within the last 24 hours.

587
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:56,090
Can we trace
the hacker's I.P. address?

588
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,139
<i>We don't think</i>
<i>there was one.</i>

589
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:59,452
There's no sign
of a D.D.O.S. attack,

590
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,521
and given the level of online
security in the facility,

591
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:02,614
we think whoever
wiped the files

592
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:03,697
must have
had a password.

593
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,391
So it was someone
in the clinic?

594
00:28:05,513 --> 00:28:06,462
It would seem that way.

595
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:08,709
It's not possible.

596
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,858
My employees
are good people.

597
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:13,029
They've all
worked here for years.

598
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:14,300
We're a family.

599
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,749
But they all
had the password?

600
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,437
There was no reason
for them not to.

601
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:18,806
I'm telling you...

602
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:21,186
none of them

00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:22,614
PETER:
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

604

I don't understand.

608
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,764
She screamed
we were cannibals

<i>and then attacked</i>
<i>with a knife.</i>

610

I had to wrestle it
away from her.

611
00:28:39,494 --> 00:28:41,405
She--she was so happy.

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,589

NAYAK: <i>Leanne suffered</i>

00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:01,376
She was just
in my office last week.

616
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,872
We're gonna have to make
a public announcement.

617
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,358
I'm gonna get

619

Zach Miller,
my lab assistant...

620
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:14,820
skipped work today.

621
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,345
He hasn't been answering
his phone.

622
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:21,719
Zach Miller?
FBI.

623
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,857
Olivia.

624
00:30:10,186 --> 00:30:12,297
I guess that's why he wasn't
answering the phone.

625
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:25,832
Walter, what's wrong
with Agent Cashner?

626
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,400
I drugged him.

627
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,237
<i>You</i> drugged him?

628
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:33,634
Walter...

629
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:36,216
Don't tell me you put
that chip in his head.

630
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,717
No, but I wanted to.

631
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:42,198
Then I realized
that I could attach the chip

632
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,804
<i>to an E.E.G. net,</i>

633
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,247
<i>and the signal</i>
<i>would reach his brain.</i>

634
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,020
And how are you going
to send him commands?

635
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,654
I have wired
the neurostimulator

636
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,064
to the same frequency.

637
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,006
If Peter's theory
is correct

638
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,976
<i>and this is
mind control,</i>

639
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,396
then the chip should receive
commands from here,

640
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:04,510
<i>through the neurostimulator.</i>
<i>It's then translated</i>

641
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:07,905
into impulses
that Agent Cashner's brain

642
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,821
can understand.

643
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,986
I need help
putting this on.

644
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,968
Walter, I do not think
this is a very good idea.

645
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,744
Don't be such a grinch.

646
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:19,002
I've told you,
science should be fun.

647
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:19,705
Come on.

648
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:21,934
WALTER:
Look at his feet.

<i>Feet. Got it.</i>

650
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:26,460
Anything?

651
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:28,598
Nope.

652
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,926
[sighs,
breathes heavy]

653
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,205
Walter, what is it?

654
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:38,641
[groans]

655
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,460
Either a green unicorn
just raced across the lab,

656
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:43,365
or I accidentally
took some LSD.

657
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,308
Oh, it must be mescaline.

658
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,982
It's peaking
too quickly.

659
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,856
Oh. Oh, God.

660
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:55,833
That's not mescaline.

661
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:59,394
<i>It's something else</i>
<i>entirely.</i>

662
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,261
I think it's not
the drugs at all.

663
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,919
I think I have an idea
what it is.

664
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,071
And you've never gotten
anything like this before?

665
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,615
No, of course not.

666
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,639
Okay, I'm gonna send
a copy of this

667
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:22,250
to our
question documents unit.

668
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,449
<i>They'll analyze</i>

669
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,801
the paper, and the ink.

670
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,858
But in the meantime,
the police have offered to put

671
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,132
a protective detail
outside your clinic,

672
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,494

will watch your house.

673
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:35,452
Now, if you'll excuse us,

674
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,952
we're gonna try and track down
the rest of your patients.

675
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:40,970
Don't worry, Dr. Nayak.

676
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,135
We're gonna catch
this guy.

677
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,678

I showed them

<i>So it's not mind control?</i>

686

WALTER: <i>No, Peter,</i>
<i>your theory is wrong.</i>

687
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:25,526
Dr. Nayak's chips
aren't receiving commands.

688
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,565
They're transmitting
massive amounts of data.

689
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:30,460
Walter, the bio-chips
are supposed to transmit data.

690
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:32,548
That's their function,
to monitor sleep cycles.

691
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,411
<i>The chips aren't simply</i>
<i>monitoring sleep.</i>

692
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,399
They're accessing
all the sensory information

through the thalamus--

00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:43,723
Every color, sound,

695
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,709
<i>and picture</i>
<i>while we sleep.</i>

696
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,231
Walter, are you saying
that Dr. Nayak's bio-chips

697
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,447
are stealing dreams?

698
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:50,402
<i>That's right, dear.</i>

699
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,583
Leader's sleep journal.

700
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,783
He slept for hours,
but he never had any dreams.

701
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:58,956
Before they reached
his consciousness,

702
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:00,602
they were
all siphoned off,

703
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,261
<i>which means no dreams.</i>

704
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:04,938
<i>The brain can never recharge,</i>
<i>and that...</i>

705
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:06,290
Would lead
to death by exhaustion.

706
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:07,486
<i>Exactly.</i>

707
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,429
What's more,

708
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,138
I believe the chips
have the ability

709
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:14,659
to turn on a dreaming state
while the patient is awake,

710
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,792
which would lead
to paranoia, hallucinations,

711
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:19,597
and a complete inability

712
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:21,975
to differentiate
between reality and dreams--

713
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,473
<i>The very behavior</i>
<i>we've been witnessing.</i>

714
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,857
Walter, why would anybody

715
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:27,680
want to access
another person's dreams?

716
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,520
<i>The rush, Peter.</i>

717
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,343
Think of your
most pleasant dream,

718
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:37,643
multiply that feeling
tenfold,

719
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,575
all mainlining
through your cortex

720
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,676
in a few seconds.

721
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,815
It's really quite something.

722
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:48,972
Walter, are you saying that
we're dealing with an addict?

723
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,431
<i>Not just an addict,</i>
<i>dear.</i>

724
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:54,482
<i>A man who came in contact</i>
<i>with this drug--</i>

725
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,622
<i>In my estimation,</i>

726
00:34:56,623 --> 00:34:58,460
<i>that man would become</i>
<i>its slave.</i>

727
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,704
We got to go back
to the hotel.

728
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,118
What are you thinking?

729
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,748
Walter thinks we're looking
for an addict, right?

730
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:11,482
Well, my stepfather
was an addict.

731
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:12,749
He was a drunk.

732
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:16,243
And it was like he had
two different personalities--

733
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:20,202
<i>One when he was sober</i>
<i>and one when he was smashed.</i>

734
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:23,971
The deeper the addiction,
the more extreme the rift,

735
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:26,363
like, uh,
Jekyll and Hyde.

736
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,653
So this is the patient list
that Dr. Nayak wrote out,

737
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,301
and here is the death threat
he received.

738
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,459
The handwriting's sloped.

739
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,843
Look at the "G"s
and the "F"s.

740
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,722
These are written
by the same person.

741
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,414
Thank you,
Detective Green.

742
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:52,390
[machine beeps]

743
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:54,658
<i>You have one message.</i>

744
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:55,665
NAYAK:
<i>I told them.</i>

745
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,667
<i>I showed them</i>
<i>your damn note.</i>

746
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:00,448
<i>So you might as well stop.</i>

747
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:04,522
<i>Please.</i>

748
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,662
[computers hum to life]

749
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,779

750
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,081
Water rudder set.

751
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,066
Thanks, hon.

752

[air traffic controller chattering]

755
00:38:10,013 --> 00:38:10,935
Jack,
what are you doing?

756
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:15,151
Jack.

757
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:18,184
Jack.

758
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,474
Jack, what are you doing?

759
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:32,314
Jack, we have got to get

760
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:33,297
this bird in the air.

761
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,806
Jack! November 822,
pilot in distress!

762
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:36,649
<i>Jack!</i>

763
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:42,729
OLIVIA:
<i>Peter, he's plugged in.</i>

764
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:44,216
PETER: Let me try
to shut down the program.

765
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,168
November 822 to ATC,

766
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,169
I've got a problem!

767
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,270
PETER:
I'm gonna have to try

768
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,235
to disable the server.

769
00:38:58,238 --> 00:38:59,171
Can you shut it down?

770
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,254
I think it's locked.

771
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,490
Jack!

772
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,240
November 822,
squawking 7700!

773
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,268
Okay, stand back.

774
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:07,965
Whoa.

775
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:09,568
[gunshots]

776
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:20,054
Jack! Jack!

777
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,578
Jack.

778
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:33,849
He's dead.

779
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,232
Hey.

780
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,405
Got a call from, uh,
radio control at Lake Union--

781
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,234
Incident with a seaplane pilot,
one of Nayak's patients.

782
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,671
They're all safe.

783
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:53,803
Good work.

784
00:39:57,303 --> 00:39:59,095
I checked out
Nayak's control panel.

785
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,375
All the dials were cranked up
into the red.

786
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,609
You think
he decided to go down

787
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,483
in one final blaze
of glory?

788
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,293
Actually, I think it was a lot
more complicated than that.

789
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,217
You remember
how horrified Nayak was

790
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:14,662
when we told him
his patients were dying?

791
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,022
I don't think
that he was fully aware

792
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:18,365
of what his darker side
was up to...

793
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,373
Until tonight.

794
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:22,014
So this was his way of trying
to put a stop to things.

795
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:23,547
I guess
that's the irony.

796
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:26,401
His addiction to dreams
became his nightmare,

797
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,582
one that he couldn't
wake up from.

798
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,618
Maybe that was his only way
of ending the nightmare.

799
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,234
[door opens, creaking]

800
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,995
<i>Dad, what's wrong?</i>

801
00:42:23,438 --> 00:42:24,734
[gasps, screams]

802
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:31,530
<i>What is it?</i>

803
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:35,033
Nothing.

804
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,245
You were talking
in your sleep.

805
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:41,568
Yeah, I think I was having
a bad dream.

806
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,578
[chuckles]

807
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,392
I was a kid,

808
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,575
in my room.

809
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:51,351
You were there.

810
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,404
<i>And the rest?</i>

811
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,108
You don't remember it?

812
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,660
Mm-mm.
