00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,337
<i>Bon épisode...</i>

6
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,107
Sorry I'm late.

7
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:04,345
Where is Walter?

8
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:07,250
He's practicing
some self-actualization.

9
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,335
In a taxi?

10
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,180
Yes part of it.

11
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,360
It's also cooking for himself now,
and taking out bath from himself.

12
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,045
You should've him tell you
why choosing his own wardrobe

13
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,859
is an important sign of independence.

14
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,243
So how many are they? It's bad?

15
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,410
Did you eat?

16
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,621
Well, that's unfortunate.

17
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,444
- Hello Agent Dunham.
- Hello Walter.

18
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:30,579
You made it.

19
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:41,011
I saw you following the taxi
in the station wagon.

20
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,265
I wasn't follow you, Walter.
We were coming to the same place.

21
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:46,539
You don't trust me.

22
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,707
It's a Chinese merchant ship
registered in Hong Kong.

23
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,269
Four hours ago,
it ran aground and caught fire.

24
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,742
Strong current, freezing water.

25
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,367
They died attempting to swim ashore.

26
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,528
We pulled out 27 bodies so far.

27
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,982
At first, it appeared
they all died of hypothermia.

28
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,315
And then we found these.

29
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:10,643
Excuse us, Agent.

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,776
Dr. Bishop, have you ever seen
anything like this?

31
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,960
It's similar to a tiny parasite
found in Livestock.

32
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:33,512
I've never seen them
this size, or in humans.

33
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,610
I want this creature
transported back to my lab.

34
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,302
It might still be alive.

35
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:55,139
This woman's still breathing!

36
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:02,094
Step aside please.

37
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,799
We haven't much time.
If she's also infected,

38
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,891
we've got to get
this organism out her.

39
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:10,422
Go!

40
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:55,238
My name's Tao Chen.
I'm from the Chinese consulate.

41
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,880
The woman we pulled from the water,
how long has she been awake?

42
00:05:58,005 --> 00:05:59,115
About an hour.

43
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,405
Is she talking?

44
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,366
A little. Her name's Mai Lin.

45
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,104
She's from outside of Hong Kong.

46
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,380
She happen to mention how she got
a gigantic worm stuck in her stomach?

47
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,785
Doctor said she just had
a severe case of dehydration.

48
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,947
- No worm.
- She wasn't infected.

49
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,754
She says they came for work
and a better life.

50
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,443
She asked if we're gonna arrest her.
I told her we're just here to help.

51
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,931
- I didn't know you spoke Cantonese.
- Get to know me a bit.

52
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,196
She says she doesn't know.
The men on the boat... they knew.

53
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:40,180
They gave her medicine
for seasickness.

54
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,835
Everyone got it.

55
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:45,378
But her father was a fisherman...

56
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,579
So she was used to the sea...
So she didn't take it.

57
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,721
She wants you to help her find
her daughter and husband.

58
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,708
She doesn't know
what happened to her family.

59
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,084
Crewmen said they were two days
behind on another boat.

60
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,054
- There's another boat?
- So chances are they're infected too.

61
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,223
Okay, that gives us
maybe 36 hours before it lands.

62
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,187
Seven pounds and ten ounces.

63
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,277
Walter, this is
our largest worm yet.

64
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,984
Parasitic worm to be precise.

65
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,968
Truly, Agent Farnsworth, it never ceases
to amaze me the infinite variation

66
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:29,635
that mother nature gives us.

67
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,043
She truly has quite
a disturbing sense of humor.

68
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,238
Considering your new pet,

69
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,197
I think mother nature's
a real bitch.

70
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,446
- How's it going in here?
- You mean here at Bishop's live bait?

71
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:44,628
Actually,

72
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,156
I think these things would scare
off the fish, don't you?

73
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,515
Walter, we spoke to the woman
we found on the beach

74
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,406
and she said that everyone
on that boat took some sort of...

75
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,098
capsule medicine.

76
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,400
Mai Lin's the only one
who didn't take the capsule

77
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,227
and the only one
who didn't get affected.

78
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,758
So do you think it's possible that that
could've been inside the capsule?

79
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,733
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.

80
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,994
If the time of gestation
is equal to the time of transport,

81
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:12,119
it would explain
why the creatures need the host.

82
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,920
These bodies provide nutrition,
warmth and protective shelter.

83
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:19,289
They enable the parasite to grow.

84
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,417
Are you saying that these people were
used as some sort of human incubator?

85
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,919
Quite ingenious, really.

86
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,398
And yes to your question.

87
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:28,215
It is possible
for the larvae of the parasite

88
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,909
to fit into a capsule.

89
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:33,636
It would allow the parasite
to grow on the journey here.

90
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,710
Which leaves "why?"

91
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:38,006
Why would someone
be smuggling these in?

92
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,687
It's Broyles.

93
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,862
The coast guard found a manifest

94
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,649
on the sunken Chinese ship.

95
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,709
They traced it to a local shipyard.

96
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,565
Somebody is in custody now.

97
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,614
Find out everything else you can
on those worms, all right?

98
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,482
Parasitic worms.

99
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,329
We found him at the shipyard
where the boat was supposed to dock.

100
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,172
He had just finished burning
every document in the place.

101
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,646
We're letting him sweat
before we question him.

102
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,561
He's not gonna talk.
He's a Triad gang member.

103
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,976
- They got a strict code of honor.
- Triad?

104
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,084
You sure?

105
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,563
Yeah, his whole biography's
written on him in ink.

106
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,120
He's like a decorated soldier.

107
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:59,469
See the mark on his arm there,
the extra powerful hook?

108
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,099
That means he's killed five people.

109
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,769
He also enjoys broadway shows,
long walks on the beach.

110
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,049
The one on his neck,
it says Sun Hong Triad.

111
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,435
Sun Hong is known for smuggling
heroin out of the golden triangle,

112
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,819
not trafficking people.

113
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,947
Then they're expanding
their business.

114
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,427
What if Sun Hong Triad
are still dealing in narcotics?

115
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:19,464
How's that?

116
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,982
Walter said these people were implanted
with the worm on purpose.

117
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:24,050
That seems to imply
that they're valuable, right?

118
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,804
Certain species of parasite have been
known to naturally secrete opiates.

119
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,888
If someone had figured out
how to harvest those...

120
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,507
You think those worms
are some kind of new street drug?

121
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,779
He's got a razor blade!

122
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:39,170
This is Broyles. We have a code blue
in interview three.

123
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,295
We need security and paramedics
immediately.

124
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,609
If only all parasitic worms

125
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,732
were full of narcotics.

126
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,939
Careful, careful!
Not too deep.

127
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,870
I got it, Walter.
Just... hold still.

128
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:04,439
Well, given the high cost
of transporting the creature,

129
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,739
it must be quite a high.

130
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,667
You are not smoking this thing.

131
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,797
Now that should do the trick.

132
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,883
Now with some luck, we'll find
the active ingredient.

133
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,549
Wait, wait, wait.

134
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,229
The initial feeling
is quite something.

135
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,690
This thing is feeding on you.

136
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,943
This is... This is... This is
rather pleasant.

137
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,997
I didn't see you there.

138
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,513
Where can I find Agent Dunham?

139
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,761
She's in the back with Peter, sir.

140
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,135
So the question is
if there is a black market

141
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,205
for this drug, then who's buying it?

142
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,113
Sir.

143
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,083
That's everything the bureau has
on the Sun Hong Triad.

144
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,148
There's also information
on the Triad's suspected leader.

145
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,107
He goes by the name of Jon Su.

146
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,066
His present whereabouts are unknown.

147
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,936
These are corporate bank documents.

148
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,702
Shell companies to shield
his criminal activity.

149
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,909
What about the boat carrying
Mai Lin's family?

150
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,504
- Any word?
- Nothing.

151
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:24,669
The coast guard has begun
boarding and searching

152
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,343
all vessels coming into new england.

153
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:29,331
200 ships by the count.
No small task.

154
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,124
More like a needle in a haystack.

155
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,680
So we have about 20 hours
before the worms come out.

156
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:37,255
There was a wire two weeks ago
from a bank here in Boston.

157
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:40,669
It looks like a private account
in Beacon Hill transferred

158
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,803
$500,000 paid into...

159
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,180
BeiJing Executive Construction.

160
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,773
Two weeks ago is about the same time
the traffickers left Kalun.

161
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,976
Sounds like someone's
financing those shipments.

162
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:03,122
So this is where the other end
of a Triad bank wire leads.

163
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:04,910
Not what I pictured either.

164
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:10,591
Hi.

165
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:12,749
Are your parents home?

166
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,215
Who are you?

167
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,961
We're the FBI.
Who are you?

168
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,422
I'm Matt.

169
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:20,173
Can I see, like, a badge?

170
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:27,180
Mom, some FBI people are here!

171
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:29,018
Come on in.

172
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,749
As my financial advisor
explained it to me,

173
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,731
there was money to be made
in BeiJing Construction projects.

174
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,726
I invested a half a million dollars
with this company.

175
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,363
Did you ever meet a man
named Jon Su?

176
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,532
He was the head
of the company you invested in.

177
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,783
No. Never.

178
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,433
Maybe your husband then.

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,371
He passed away
shortly after Matt was born.

180
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,414
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,468
Did I do something wrong?

182
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,627
We suspect Mr. Su
of running a smuggling ring,

183
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,926
trafficking Chinese nationals
into the US,

184
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,299
and using these
front corporations to fund it.

185
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:05,627
I had no idea.

186
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,953
I swear to both of you,

187
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:10,911
my attorney reviewed
all the documents

188
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,310
and he assured me it was
a sound investment.

189
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,229
These corporations look legitimate
from the outside.

190
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,734
May we have the name
and number of your attorney?

191
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,625
- We'll need to ask him a few questions.
- Of course.

192
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,154
I'm sure he'd be as surprised
by this as I am.

193
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,864
If I can do anything to help...

194
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,147
Thank you.

195
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,367
We appreciate it.

196
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,747
What were you doing in there,
checking for dust?

197
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,115
Not sure yet.

198
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:43,128
Okay, I want to stop by the hospital,
check on Mai Lin.

199
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:46,019
You drop me at the lab first?

200
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,649
Sure.

201
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,936
What do you think the connection is

202
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:52,433
between an excessive compulsive
germaphobe and our worms?

203
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,208
- Nice kicks.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,966
That's an excellent question.

205
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,523
I have a theory.

206
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,542
What happened to you?

207
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,745
Your father got bitten by that thing

208
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,809
and he refuses
to get it checked out.

209
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,657
What if you're infected
with one of those worms?

210
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,302
I've tested my blood
and liver function. I'm fine.

211
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:14,371
In fact, my white cell count
is through the roof,

212
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:17,174
I have several new antibodies
in my blood,

213
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,234
and even the gas I had is gone.

214
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,419
And you think it's the worm
that did all that to you?

215
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:23,131
The creature, Peter,

216
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,435
is not an illicit narcotic at all.

217
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,592
It's medicine.

218
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,948
Astrid, the picture.
Show Peter, please.

219
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,648
Ancylostoma duodenale.

220
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,974
An intestinal hookworm.
It's about ten millimeters long.

221
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,542
Chinese medicine.

222
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,139
Ancylostoma could be used

223
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,072
for the treatment of chronic asthma.

224
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,741
People are purposefully infected

225
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:47,360
and walk around
their entire lives with it.

226
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,110
What does that have
to do with our parasites?

227
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:54,153
Our parasites are a new species.

228
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:57,289
Bio-engineered from this hookworm.

229
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:01,251
- You mean somebody made these.
- Designed them to grow in humans.

230
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:05,718
In fact, I don't believe
that they could grow anywhere else.

231
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,221
I believe that it's
the parasite's lymph gland

232
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,902
that is the real prize.

233
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:15,156
It secretes a remarkable
immune-boosting enzyme.

234
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,385
Immune-boosting.

235
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,737
So you might take that
if you had, say,

236
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,396
a severe phobia of germs.

237
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,108
Or if you wanted to treat any number
of immune deficiency disorders.

238
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,863
- Going somewhere, Walter?
- I am.

239
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,824
The phone book lists
five herbalists in Chinatown,

240
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,354
three of which sell
our ancylostoma hookworm

241
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,002
for the treatment of asthma.

242
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,869
I am going to collect samples
for genetic comparison.

243
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,755
Why don't you give me those addresses?
I'll go check them out.

244
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:46,171
You don't believe I can do it.

245
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,505
Well, I can.

246
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,883
Don't you dare follow me.

247
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,930
Can I please borrow
some change for the bus fare?

248
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,506
Miss Lin, do you recognize these?

249
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,163
She said the man who put them
on the fishing boat had one.

250
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,537
- What does it mean?
- It's a gang tattoo.

251
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,959
We think that the gang

252
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,551
might be using people to smuggle
drugs into the country.

253
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,524
She said her husband
and her daughter...

254
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:38,949
I think I understand.

255
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,684
We will do everything that we can.

256
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,543
Where is everybody?

257
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,703
Walter's out self-actualizing again.

258
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,324
Astrid's keeping an eye on him.

259
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,569
What's this?

260
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,370
You remember at Elizabeth Jarvis' house
you asked me what I was looking at?

261
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,908
Did you see
all those hand sanitizers?

262
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,831
All the windows
were hermetically sealed.

263
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,502
- Hepa filters. Oxygen tanks.
- You saw oxygen tanks?

264
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:52,464
But I'm sure they're there
somewhere.

265
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,882
Okay, and if they were?

266
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,985
Walter says that these worms
boost the immune system, right?

267
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:59,155
If you're buying
hand sanitizer in bulk

268
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,023
and hermetically sealing
all your windows,

269
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,265
you're either Howard Hughes
or you're actually sick.

270
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,352
Let's go pick up Elizabeth Jarvis and
get a warrant to search her house.

271
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,353
Actually, I've got a better idea.

272
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,036
Bend your knees more.

273
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,986
What are you doing here?

274
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,531
We wanted to ask you a couple
questions about your mother.

275
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,991
She's not here right now.

276
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,411
And I know that I don't have
to answer any of your questions

277
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,097
without my mom or lawyer here.

278
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,578
Then you can just talk to me.

279
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,168
I'm not actually an FBI Agent.

280
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,337
Just a couple of guys
hanging out on the court.

281
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

282
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,050
I have to talk to a judge
about a warrant.

283
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:47,776
There you go.

284
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:49,604
I know you don't want to talk to us

285
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,895
'Cause you're just trying
to protect your mother, Matt.

286
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,373
She's your only family.

287
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,581
I understand that.
I've been there.

288
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:57,862
I doubt it.

289
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,283
I was raised by my mother too.

290
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,998
It's scary.

291
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:08,365
You're worried that if you lose her,

292
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,019
then you have no one.

293
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:15,211
But those people that your mother
gave money to, they're scary people.

294
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:18,968
We're investigating them
and that's not gonna stop.

295
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,971
They're gonna try
to cover their tracks.

296
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,849
I want to make sure that your mother
isn't one of those tracks.

297
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,310
You think that could happen?

298
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,801
I need you to tell me, Matt,

299
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,484
is your mom sick?

300
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:42,574
What is it? She has some sort
of immune deficiency disorder?

301
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:52,676
The treatments are for me.

302
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:28,075
Walter, what a...
what a coincidence.

303
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,469
It's not a coincidence at all.

304
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:33,625
You were following me.
Peter had you follow me.

305
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,733
No. I have a...
I have a...

306
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,688
friend that lives right down...

307
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,479
by the...

308
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:42,800
the Chinese restaurant.

309
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,182
We're worried about you.

310
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:52,419
Does it occur to you
that perhaps I want to be alone?

311
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,855
That perhaps I want to live
my life with a semblance

312
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,795
of dignity and self-respect?

313
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:01,196
If I want to go get
a hot dog, so be it.

314
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,876
I may go grocery shopping.

315
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,367
I may even join a gym.

316
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,705
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,685
Since you're here,

318
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,757
you may as well accompany me
to the next herbalist on my list.

319
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,011
But as a friend, not a supervisor.

320
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,480
Agreed, Walter.

321
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,470
I love Chinatown.

322
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,737
Matt Jarvis suffers from a rare
immune deficiency disorder.

323
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,317
His body doesn't produce enough white
blood cells to fight off infection.

324
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,027
Technically, he should be
living in a giant plastic baggie.

325
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:46,072
But we just shot hoops
with him this afternoon.

326
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,784
These parasites are being
harvested to treat his condition.

327
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,127
From what he says, they insert a
medicinal powder into his spleen.

328
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:54,914
Walter thinks the medicine's
made out of a gland inside the worm.

329
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,266
So Matt's usually treated
once a month.

330
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:59,088
His next surgery is due in two days,

331
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,629
right on schedule with when
the next boat's due to arrive.

332
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,173
- Does the surgeon have a name?
- Dr. Che.

333
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:07,412
Ancylostoma duodenale.
Hookworm.

334
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:09,497
Aren't they magnificent?

335
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,264
At this size maybe.

336
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,432
Quite right.

337
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,144
You haven't seen anything till you've
seen one of these four feet long.

338
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:18,885
What do I owe you?

339
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,274
That'll be $15, please.

340
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,592
- I got this.
- No, that's okay.

341
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,445
I have just enough money left.

342
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,324
$15.

343
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,826
Thank you.

344
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:33,173
Good day.

345
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,608
I'm going to enjoy this.

346
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,970
Provided, of course, the beans

347
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,389
have been properly soaked
to leech toxicity.

348
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,975
For the record, I wanted ice cream.

349
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,982
Look.

350
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:05,114
Lacquered cricket boxes.

351
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:08,196
You want omega-3?
I put in fish head.

352
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,686
No, I will pass.

353
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,067
Thank you.

354
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,570
Here you go.

355
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,338
Given what her kid said,
I want you to lean to Elizabeth Jarvis.

356
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,720
We're running out of time
before that boat arrives.

357
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,936
So how much rice candy
did Walter eat?

358
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,154
I lost him.

359
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,119
I turned my back for one second
and he wasn't there any more.

360
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:46,009
I've looked for him everywhere.

361
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,975
Did he know that you were
following him?

362
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,264
He did at first.
And he was fine with it.

363
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,824
But he lulled me into a false
sense of security.

364
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,369
Just so he could ditch you.
<i>You know how he likes to prove a point.</i>

365
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:00,346
He's got plenty of change for the bus.
He's got his travel kit.

366
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,458
All his emergency numbers.
He should be fine.

367
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,762
<i>He's got to learn how to cross
the street by himself sometime.</i>

368
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:10,522
I'm gonna head back to the lab
and see if he's there, okay?

369
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,758
- It's Walter, your father.
- <i>Wrong number.</i>

370
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,544
It's me, Walter, your father.

371
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:02,484
Excuse me?

372
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:14,099
I fear I may have dialed
the wrong number again.

373
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,833
My name is Walter...

374
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,824
The number five bus hasn't
stopped here for over two hours.

375
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,924
Not that it matters.

376
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,944
I used up all my bus fare
to dial seven

377
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,620
wrong numbers.

378
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:25,101
I can't remember Peter's number.

379
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,271
I know it's got...

380
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:30,153
three 5s, a 1,

381
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,032
a 0 and two 7s.

382
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:33,807
But for the life of me,

383
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:37,009
I can't remember
the correct sequence.

384
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,013
What happened?

385
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,464
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.

386
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,430
No. Don't. I'm okay, Peter.

387
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,343
I'm okay.
I don't need an ambulance.

388
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,137
Who did this to you?

389
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,016
I don't know.

390
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:05,331
It was...

391
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,852
- two big asian guys with tattoos.
- Triad.

392
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,146
I don't know how they knew
we had the worm.

393
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,856
They must've followed you
back from Chinatown.

394
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,942
It's Walter. He's down
in Chinatown. Apparently he's fine.

395
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:33,017
Astrid, you sure you're okay?

396
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,196
- I'm going down to pick him up.
- I'm going to talk to Elizabeth Jarvis.

397
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:38,671
- Let's stay in touch.
- You got it.

398
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:45,473
We know you're
withholding information.

399
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,641
I already told you everything.

400
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,853
Actually, your son
told us everything.

401
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,484
I can't help you, Agent Dunham.

402
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,832
I've got two dozen
Chinese nationals dead,

403
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:01,338
a federal Agent assaulted,
and another boat

404
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:03,732
with God knows how many people
about to die on it.

405
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,459
You don't understand.

406
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:07,413
This treatment...

407
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:12,092
- Matt won't live long without it.
- We rescued a Chinese woman.

408
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,168
Her daughter is on that other boat.

409
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,171
She's gonna die too.
Who's been treating your son?

410
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,539
My son.

411
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:53,561
Allow me to introduce you.

412
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,480
My hostess's name is Fey.

413
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,468
The numbers are in your pocket.

414
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,797
How many times have I told you that?
I put them there.

415
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,622
Don't you remember that?

416
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:16,937
No. No, I don't.

417
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,475
You... You just...

418
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,203
Are you okay?

419
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,255
Yes, I'm fine.

420
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,990
The noodles are delicious.

421
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,516
You really should try them, Peter.

422
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:06,614
I hope I didn't cause
Agent Farnsworth too much distress.

423
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,689
She had other things on her mind.

424
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,263
Wouldn't happen to remember
any of the addresses

425
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,498
of those herbalist shops
you visited, would you?

426
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,723
Certainly not, but...
that's why I held on to this.

427
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:22,032
Astrid only went with...
with me to the...

428
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,752
third one, Ming Che.

429
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:27,011
They had quite a selection
of hookworms.

430
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,199
Although I confess
I exaggerated a bit

431
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,680
when I told them
that ours was four foot long.

432
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,529
You told someone
we have a four foot worm?

433
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:37,061
It's not even two feet.

434
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,231
That's how they followed Astrid.
Ming Che on Ping-On street.

435
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,984
What do you mean?
Astrid was followed?

436
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:48,690
- Is Walter all right?
- He's fine. Where are you?

437
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:51,909
<i>The boat with Mai Lin's family
on it just docked. Elizabeth Jarvis</i>

438
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,298
gave us a phone number. We tracked
a few shore-to-ship calls off that.

439
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:57,873
We're just about
to commence the raid.

440
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,918
- I got another lead I'm tracking down.
- I'll call you after.

441
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,856
What do you mean
Astrid was followed?

442
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,981
Just get in the car, Walter.
I'll tell you later.

443
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,840
I want a search bow to stern. Clear
the lower decks. Find these people.

444
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:35,365
You three with me.

445
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,151
<i>Upper deck clear.</i>

446
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:49,713
<i>Main deck's clear.</i>

447
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,321
<i>Top deck's clear.</i>

448
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,839
<i>Copy.</i>

449
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,685
There are no trafficked people
on this ship.

450
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,053
But they were.

451
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:44,919
We're just too late.

452
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,498
Why are we stopping here?

453
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:01,465
Is this the place?

454
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,090
Yes, but I need
to get back to the lab.

455
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:06,585
I need to check on Agent Farnsworth.

456
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:10,996
She's all right, Walter.

457
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,313
We had the right vessel
but they were already gone.

458
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,515
I know. They're here. <i>I just saw
them get unloaded through the alley.</i>

459
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,690
- Where are you?
- We're at a Chinese herbalist

460
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:34,738
shop Ping-On street. Astrid was
followed back to the lab from here.

461
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,326
We're on our way.

462
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:44,209
I need you to stay here.
Olivia and Broyles are on their way.

463
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,853
This is not a good idea, son.

464
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:49,756
I'll be careful.

465
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:56,504
Stay in the car.

466
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:36,706
Goes to all the shows

467
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:41,003
Steps right in to the lions' den

468
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,539
And tell them all he knows

469
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,499
Puts his head in the lions' den

470
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:07,007
Someone must know you're here.

471
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:09,351
They coming soon?

472
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,790
Nobody else knows I'm here.

473
00:37:14,714 --> 00:37:17,664
- Somehow I don't believe you.
- That's a shame.

474
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:19,778
Most people find me
very trustworthy.

475
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:33,623
Open. Open.

476
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:36,956
Now, if you try to chew this,
it will kill you.

477
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,228
Swallow!

478
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,234
- Hands where I can see them!
- Gun!

479
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,822
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

480
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:08,219
Are you okay?

481
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,788
I am now.

482
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:30,757
Thought I lost you.

483
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,768
Don't worry about this place.

484
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:37,022
I'm gonna clean this up.

485
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:39,547
Peter said you were followed.

486
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:52,405
I'm so sorry.

487
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:55,948
I didn't know.

488
00:38:57,977 --> 00:38:59,477
It's not your fault.

489
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:17,187
What's the status
of the Chinese nationals?

490
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,349
Well, some are still in surgery.
The rest in the ICU.

491
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:21,974
Only time will tell.

492
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:25,828
The doctor says it's a good prognosis
for Mai Lin's daughter and husband.

493
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:27,853
What's gonna happen to them?

494
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:31,391
The state department has agreed
to grant them all political asylum.

495
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:33,857
With all those people
carrying Ming Che's medicine,

496
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,331
he must've been treating
other people like Matt Jarvis.

497
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,646
We turned up more
financial records at his shop

498
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:41,418
that trace back to six other
patients with immune deficiency.

499
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:44,453
- They're being questioned now.
- Did we find anything else in his shop

500
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:47,231
- that could lead us to Jon Su?
- What we found

501
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:48,927
is that there is no Jon Su.

502
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,348
He's an alias used as a front for
all of Ming Che's financial dealings.

503
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:55,069
Good work, you two.

504
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:57,352
There's something I need
to take care of.

505
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Scuse me.

506
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:43,114
What time is it, Walter?

507
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,710
I want so badly
to be independent again.

508
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:50,857
To live like a man, not a child.

509
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:53,583
Not to have my son

510
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:56,532
watching after me all the time.

511
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:00,834
Not that I don't appreciate
all that you do for me.

512
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:04,753
That's not the way
it's supposed to be.

513
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:06,463
Let me finish.

514
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:12,270
I've been out of the institution
for a year now.

515
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:16,149
And I've just begun my journey

516
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,024
back towards being whole.

517
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,410
But...

518
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,420
I fear there are still times
when I will get lost.

519
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,403
So I have

520
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,969
implanted a tracking device
in my neck.

521
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:34,756
You did what?

522
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:43,133
And here is the transponder

523
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:46,094
So you can find me.

524
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:54,294
I should let you get back to sleep.

525
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,405
Good night, Walter.

526
00:42:07,516 --> 00:42:08,966
Good night, my son.
