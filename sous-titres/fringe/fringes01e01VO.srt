I don't speak german. I'm

My friend,it's just an electrical storm.

I understand.

I kept finding myself staring at you.

19
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,120

Well,I think he does.

If he knew,you would be transferred.

The idea of somebody making a call whether

24
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,500
that's unacceptable to me.

Towers lost contact three hours in.

38
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,200
They thought it might have
been electrical interference.

39
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,310
They entered our airspace radio silent.

40
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,030
Navy then scrambles
two f-18s for escort.

41

No signs of life aboard the jet.

43
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,090
White house approved a cdc request for
the jet not to be opened until they arrive.

44
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,190
No signs of life? Who
was flying the plane?

45
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,210
Logan's one of the first airports
with the pearl autopilot system.

- Agent francis. Agent dunham.

52
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,990

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,120

Some sort of accident?

00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,620
Nothing you need to worry about,sir.

Oh,all right.

- we're on that too liaison.

Yeah,well,you didn't say
anything back,so I just let it go.

John.

137
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,790
you were very lucky today,agent dunham.

138
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,480
Your wounds could've easily
been much more severe.

139
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,500
Agent scott wasn't as fortunate.

140
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,570
While he survived the initial blast,agent scott
was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds.

141
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,450
Work that was done
in the labs you found.

142
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,590
He's not contagious,but
until we understand more,

143
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,150
it's better not to introduce
any additional contaminants.

144
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,990
We haven't been able to identify
the substance that's affecting him.

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,950
The cdc has sent in specialists,but...

146
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,610
well,they've never seen anything
like what's happening here.

147
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,430
We've put agent scott
in a drug-induced coma.

148
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,220
His body temperature has been lowered
significantly to try and slow the progress.

149
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,350
I'm sorry,agent dunham.

150
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,070
It's me.

151
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,740
Liaison.

152
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,780
I found a connection between the hamburg
flight and what's happened to agent scott.

153
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,900
His name's walter bishop.

154
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,720
He's a scientific
researcher from cambridge.

155
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,970
Born in '46,harvard educated.

156
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,820
Post grad at oxford and M.I.T.

157
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,180
Look at the experiments
he was doing in the '70s.

158
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,840
I believe dr. Bishop might have
information that might tell us

159
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,240
what happened aboard that plane
and save agent scott's life.

160
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,560
Says the guy's been at
st. Claire's for 17 years.

161
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,550
I saw that. An assistant
was killed in his lab.

162
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Rumors about dr. Bishop
using humans as guinea pigs.

163
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,820
He was charged with manslaughter,but
was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.

164
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,430
Why are you so sure
bishop's worth our time?

165
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,600
Why are you so sure he's not?

166
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,340
Listen,dunham,you and i
got off on the wrong foot--

167
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,980
if my past job performance as U.S.
Marine special investigator offends you--

168
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,830
well,yeah,it does.

169
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,100
A man who serves his country for 30 years
has a few drinks and a small lapse in judgment

170
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,780
- does not deserve five years.
- A small lapse in judgment that

171
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,020
will haunt three young women
for the rest of their lives.

172
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,280
But that's not tonight's business,is it?

173
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:56,590
Look,D.C.Has tasked me to make sure that our
reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach.

174
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,150
Now it says here,in 1991 the
glorious state of massachusetts

175
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,400
forbade dr. Bishop from having any visitors
with the exception of immediate family.

176
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,060
So from where I sit,barging into a
mental institution waving the patriot act,

177
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,110
which is what you'd need,

178
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,640
and demanding face time
with some old lab rat

179
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,460
who you think might be behind some of the most
terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine--

180
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,090
I'm coming to you with a solid lead,

181
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,880
- And your personal resentment is preventing
you-- - and you're wasting your breath and my time.

182
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,860
Do you understand "immediate family?"

183
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,140
You want to question dr. Bishop,you go find
his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.

184
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,930
Talk to bishop,uncover something
substantial,and I will have your back.

185
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,200
Until then,I am not so convinced.

186
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,830
Now can you handle that?

187
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,060
He does have a son.

188
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,370
Is his son local too?

189
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,720
Not exactly.

190
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,110
{\a6}<i>BAGHADAD IRAQ</i>

191
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,920
so this guy's walter bishop's son.

192
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,270
his name's peter bishop.

193
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,750
He's a high school dropout,I.Q.At
190,which is 50 points north of genius.

194
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,410
Misfit,nomad.

195
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,600
Hasn't kept a job
longer than two months.

196
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,920
He's been a wild land
fireman,cargo pilot,

197
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,030
and briefly a college
chemistry professor.

198
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,180
He falsified a degree from M.I.T.

199
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,810
And even managed to get a few papers
published before he was found out.

200
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,190
Sounds like a massive pain in the ass.

201
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,640
my resume is hardly traditional.

202
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,130
But around these parts,traditional
increasingly means irrelevant.

203
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,550
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure
and you can barely keep the lights on.

204
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,300
So you need someone to oversee construction
on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude

205
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,330
between your fields in
kirkuk and the port of ceyhan.

206
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,440
A job well outside the green zone,I
might add while I'm still alive to do so.

207
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,950
You'll need someone who has a handle
on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.

208
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,790
The heat exchange in oil mixture flows.

209
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,910
You'll also need someone who can
work with mixed integer programs

210
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,220
because you're gonna have to resize the pipes
as you start working across uneven terrain.

211
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,970
That is,if you want to keep
down construction costs.

212
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,520
I also speak farsi.

213
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,930
And 600,000 all in sounds fair.

214
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,280
Peter bishop.

215
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,250
Olivia dunham. I'm with the fbi.

216
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,990
Okay.

217
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,780
You've heard of flight 627?

218
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,400
The hamburg flight,of course.

219
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,500
You may be able to help us with that.

220
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,840
No,I think you got the wrong guy.

221
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,680
Your father is walter bishop.

222
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,850
You know,the last time somebody
asked me that it was an accusation.

223
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,960
Well,he's the man we're looking to
speak with,but due to his current status,

224
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,770
you're the only one who
can provide us access.

225
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,980
And what possible help
could that man be to you?

226
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,370
And what is it exactly that
you're expecting me to do?

227
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,690
Hop on a plane with you
back to massachusetts?

228
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,080
I just got here,honey.

229
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,340
I can have you on a return flight
here in four days,but first--

230
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,660
let me save you the time.

231
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,640
I'd rather stay here in iraq.

232
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,800
That's how much I want to see my father.

233
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,110
I'm going to beg you as
one human being to another.

234
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,790
Your father may be able to
save someone who's dying.

235
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,310
Someone I care about very much.

236
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,560
Sweetheart,we all care
about someone who's dying.

237
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,900
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

238
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,260
I know why you're here!

239
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,720
I have your file.

240
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,890
What file?

241
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,230
The one the fbi would say doesn't exist.

242
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,450
And it has everything.

243
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,920
Where you've been,what
you're running from.

244
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,360
And what you need while you're here.

245
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,340
So either you come with me,or I let
certain people know your whereabouts.

246
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,760
When do we leave?

247
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,100
did the doctors say anything else?

248
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,920
Yeah.

249
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,110
Thanks,charlie.

250
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,330
Let me ask you something.

251
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,290
My father,not my favorite.

252
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,440
He is without a doubt the
most self-absorbed,twisted,

253
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,170
abusive,brilliant,myopic
son of a bitch on the planet.

254
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,600
So he was a chemist.

255
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,490
That much I already know.

256
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,920
He worked out of a basement lab in harvard
doing research for a toothpaste company.

257
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,400
I also know that there was an
accident at the lab one night,

258
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,970
that my father was arrested,beginning the
first truly peaceful period in our home.

259
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,060
But here's the thing,olivia.

260
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,900
My gut tells me that your friend's
life,the one hanging in the balance,

261
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,960
not gonna be saved by
a tube of toothpaste.

262
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,520
He worked out of harvard,but
not on toothpaste.

263
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,460
He was part of a classified U.S.Army
experimental program called kelvin genetics.

264
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,400
They gave him the resources
to do whatever work he wanted,

265
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,110
which was primarily in an
area called fringe science.

266
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,310
When you say fringe
science,you mean pseudoscience.

267
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,260
I suppose.

268
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,410
Things like mind
control,teleportation,astral projection,

269
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,420
invisibility,genetic
mutation,reanimation,fertility--

270
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,560
whoa,excuse for a sec.

271
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,260
Reanimation? Really?

272
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,240
So you're telling me what?

273
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,190
My father was dr. Frankenstein?

274
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,490
{\a6}<i>ESSEXCOUNTY MASSACHUSETTS</i>

275
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,520
You know what?

276
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,430
Why don't you go on ahead.

277
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,250
Dr. Bishop,special
day. You have a visitor.

278
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,030
Hello.

279
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,950
I knew someone would come... eventually.

280
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,330
Dr. Bishop.

281
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,450
Dr. Bishop?

282
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,000
And you said this was--
when did this happen?

283
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,830
The incident on the plane
happened four days ago.

284
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,030
Agent scott was injured the next day.

285
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,220
The dermis already
indurated,translucent.

286
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,740
M-muscular tissue visible.

287
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,060
On scott,you mean,can
you see through skin?

288
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,010
Yes.

289
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,060
Oh,that's not good.

290
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,960
To see through the skin,it's--it's
tricky,it's advanced.

291
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,350
- Like that it's tricky.
- What's happening to him?

292
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,990
Can it be reversed?

293
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,910
What is it?

294
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,790
They... they have this horrible...

295
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,760
pudding here.

296
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,900
Butterscotch pudding on
mondays. It's dreadful.

297
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,170
It's thursday.

298
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,080
Oh,that's fantastic news.

299
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,240
It can be reversed.

300
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,010
What happened to your colleague.

301
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,500
Years ago I worked with
lab animals,and--and ...

302
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,910
some of them were
afflicted,but were saved.

303
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,950
So do you remember what to do?

304
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:29,470
This place,their- their
choice of therapies has c--c--

305
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,510
Dr. Bishop.

306
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,990
You came here today with my son.

307
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,660
I'm not allowed visitors,you
see,except immediate family.

308
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:55,240
And unless the order has been
lifted,then it's a simple if/then formula.

309
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,870
If you are here,then so is he.

310
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,000
I would... so much...

311
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,840
so very much like to see him.

312
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,900
So much.

313
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,500
He asked for you.

314
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,260
Thanks,sweetheart.

315
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,470
I really appreciate that.

316
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,690
Hey,I didn't tell him you were here.

317
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,370
And call me "sweetheart" one
more time. I'd really like that.

318
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,800
Hello,walter.

319
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,650
I thought you'd be fatter.

320
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,630
You thought I would be fatter.

321
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,730
Excellent first words,perfect.

322
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,410
No,as a boy,you were rounder.

323
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,920
Yes,I was until the
summer before high school.

324
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,530
Not that I'd expect
you to remember that.

325
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,600
May I see something?

326
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,700
What are you doing? Take
your hands off of me!

327
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,670
Pupils are good. They're
good. Thank goodness.

328
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,860
How advanced is your
colleague's condition?

329
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,490
Which--which is
something I-I-I--

330
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,060
I'm unable to deduce without
a firsthand examination.

331
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,840
I must see mr. Scott myself.

332
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,570
Which I am unable to do.

333
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,890
Well,under present law.

334
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,530
Unless--unless signed out by a legal
guardian who must be,once again,a relative.

335
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,010
What are you
asking me to--

336
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,060
no.Guardian? No,forget it.

337
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,840
- He'll do it.
- No,I will not.

338
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,160
One phone call. That's all it
takes. You want me to make it?

339
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,370
'Cause I got my phone in my pocket.

340
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,380
Now it's out of my pocket.

341
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,520
You wanted my father.

342
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,180
Now you've got my father.

343
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,760
Which falls into the category of
be careful what you wish for...

344
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,250
sweetheart.

345
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,530
every effort is being made to
understand what happened on flight 627...

346
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,990
dr. Bishop,I was curious.

347
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,340
Did anyone else ever
have access to your work?

348
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,960
Well,the assistants had bits and pieces.

349
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,780
And god,I suppose.

350
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,290
I supposed the only one that really
knew what I was doing was belly.

351
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,000
Who?

352
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,460
Belly,william bell. He
and I shared the lab.

353
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,070
William bell?

354
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,100
You shared your lab with the
founder of massive dynamics?

355
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,940
I'm sorry,I don't know what
that is,massive dynamics.

356
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,210
Oh,nothing really. Just
a tiny little company.

357
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,620
That's perfect.

358
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,950
One guys becomes one of the
wealthiest men on the planet.

359
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,260
The other guy becomes an
institutionalized psychopath.

360
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,590
What? What happened?

361
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,960
I just pissed myself.

362
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,790
- Excellent.
- Just a squirt.

363
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,190
{\a6}<i>MASSIVE DYNAMICM</i>

364
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,480
I just got your message. How's john?

365
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,510
Worse.

366
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,850
Cdc says the hamburg flight was
caused by a synthetic compound.

367
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,090
Which is like saying rain
is caused by a wet compound.

368
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,070
They've run some tests on john,but
haven't come back with anything.

369
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,040
What about bishop?

370
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,320
Left to right,insane and irritating.

371
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,040
And also my only hope.

372
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,910
Listen...

373
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,310
I need to question william bell.

374
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
Could you set that up for me?

375
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,510
William bell?

376
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,110
Massive dynamics william bell.

377
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,680
He and bishop used to share a lab.

378
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,160
You're kidding.

379
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,630
Dr. Bishop?

380
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,930
Is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale?

381
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,500
I haven't had some in
a long time. I miss it.

382
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,980
Can we please get some ginger ale
for the doctor,agent farnsworth.

383
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,310
Sure.

384
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,710
Whoa,stop right now! Stop!

385
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,800
Does this not concern you?

386
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,540
Let him go.

387
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,810
Petri dish.

388
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,680
Quick,please.

389
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,580
Good.

390
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,740
- I need to take this to my lab right away.
- Your what?

391
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,520
Kresge building basement,harvard.

392
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,690
We should leave.

393
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,720
I have my sample.

394
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,650
Your lab was shutdown after you left.

395
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,560
I'm sorry?

396
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,210
Wake up. It's gone.

397
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,870
No.

398
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
No,no,no.

399
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,270
No,no,no,no,no,no.

400
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,780
Walter,there is no lab.

401
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,790
- It's a perfect
working-- - no!

402
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,460
Damn you,damn you!

403
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,870
We need to get him back immediately.

404
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,810
Liaison.

405
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,730
- When did you get back?
- I need your help.

406
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,990
I want you to know I've successfully had
dr. Walter bishop released from st.Claire's,

407
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
and he requires the use
of his old laboratory.

408
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm sorry,what?

409
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,290
Kresge building. Harvard,basement.

410
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,380
The university's been using it
for storage for the past 17 years.

411
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,960
It would be nice to think
that your tenacity in this case

412
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,350
is a byproduct of a remarkable
and robust professionalism.

413
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,990
But I can't help but wonder

414
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,620
if there wasn't something going
on between you and agent scott.

415
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,990
Get the lab for bishop.

416
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,180
So much.

417
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,050
So much happened here.

418
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,290
And so much is about to.

419
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,210
{\a6}<i>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</i>

420
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,250
Dr. Bishop,I've ordered a
standard forensics work package.

421
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,420
Is there anything else you need?

422
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,740
Um,optical coherence
tomograph for flesh study.

423
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,050
2,000 pounds of silicon.

424
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,850
At least five anonymous blood
samples from volunteer donors.

425
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,870
Microorganism detector.

426
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,220
Nasa grade,of course.
There's still nasa,yes?

427
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,230
Yes.

428
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,840
Oh,she's still here!

429
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh,this tank was the best.

430
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,170
And a two-year-old
bos taurus.

431
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,420
A what?

432
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,320
A cow.

433
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,570
He wants a cow.

434
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,350
Purebred,not crossbred.
This is important.

435
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Mature weight,850 pounds.

436
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,040
Internal fat average of 2.37

437
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,140
Is he joking?

438
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,330
Genetically,humans and cows are
separated by only a couple lines of dna.

439
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,180
So it's an ethical test subject.

440
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,040
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?

441
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,470
No,actually.

442
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,460
I picked that up reading books.

443
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,960
You should try it sometime. It's fun.

444
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,270
Get him the cow.

445
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,270
Fantastic,thank you.

446
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,840
The only thing better
than a cow is a human.

447
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,290
Unless you need milk.
Then you really need a cow.

448
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,880
Coffee?

449
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,600
Thanks.

450
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,440
Tell me.

451
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,570
What else did that file say
about yours truly? How bad was it?

452
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,830
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

453
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,180
Why don't you go ahead and liberate
yourself,'cause I'm here now,

454
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,070
so I kind of feel like I
deserve the truth,don't you?

455
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,590
There was no file.

456
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,660
I needed you back here.

457
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,200
So that was what? You were bluffing?

458
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,340
I-I was desperate.

459
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,240
You know,I'm usually pretty
good at reading people.

460
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,480
That's sort of what I do.

461
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,030
Yeah,well,I could see you were
in trouble. Anyone could see that.

462
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,800
So I could've stayed.

463
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,910
I could've stayed in iraq.

464
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,900
You know,a car bomb went
off this morning in kirkuk.

465
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,410
You might just owe me a thank you.

466
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,540
Yeah,well,I owe a lot.

467
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,470
Tsk,yeah,I figured. MafiA.

468
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,650
A guy named big eddie.

469
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,540
You owe money to a guy
nicknamed big eddie?

470
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,620
No,I owe money to a guy named big eddie.

471
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,540
He had it legally changed.

472
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,860
And the thing is,I'm not even
a gambler. I mean,I never was.

473
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,790
It just-- a couple years
ago I went a bit crazy.

474
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,000
I thought you were a genius.
You must've had a system.

475
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,830
Of course there was a system.

476
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,300
The house was cheating.

477
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,510
But you try telling 'em that.

478
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,140
'72 during vietnam.

479
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:34,130
The D.O.D.'S biochem division had
us working on a leprotic contagion

480
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,760
for possible use against the vietcong.

481
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:43,170
It's possible that whatever affected that
plane may have been derived from that work.

482
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,250
What about john?

483
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,580
What's infecting him is merely a chemical
reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients,

484
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,260
not the finished contagion.

485
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,330
Which means we can
synthesize a counteragent.

486
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,890
- So you can help him.
- don't do that.

487
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,250
Don't give her false hope.

488
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,640
There's no false. It's
not false. It's real.

489
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,560
I could help, yes.

490
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,730
If I had a precise inventory of what was
in that storage facility when it detonated.

491
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,040
We don't have it.

492
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
It all went up, everything.

493
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,550
And the suspect who might
have those answers got away,

494
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,890
and john was the only
one who saw his face.

495
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,060
So how long does he have left?

496
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,410
Current rate of crystallization,
cellular degradation--

497
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,420
- how long?
- 24 hours.

498
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,070
His brain will no longer
be able to oxygenate itself.

499
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,240
I'm so sorry...

500
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,310
that I can't offer you a
less dangerous solution.

501
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,230
What do you mean?

502
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,260
Didn't I mention it?

503
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,520
Whatever you think you
said, you didn't say.

504
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,060
The synaptic transfer system.

505
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,340
The shared dream state.

506
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,070
What do you mean shared dream state?

507
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,520
The human brain generates a
quantifiable electric field.

508
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,960
I posited in 1976 that it is possible

509
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,490
to synchronize the fields
of two distinct minds

510
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,130
to allow the sharing of information
across the unconscious state.

511
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,470
Like a string between two tin cans.

512
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,610
You know what's great about that?

513
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,280
Is that it's completely insane.

514
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,230
You're saying I can
talk to john in a coma

515
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,120
and he can tell me what
the suspect looks like.

516
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,410
- It's not an exact science.
- It's not even science.

517
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,550
Have you done this before?

518
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,940
I have used this technique to extract
information from a corpse once.

519
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,880
You can do that if they haven't
been dead for longer than six hours.

520
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,260
Right, 'cause after six hours,
that's when they're really dead.

521
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,480
You could access his memories.

522
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,330
Assuming there's no brain damage.

523
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,480
Of course you'd have to
have an electromagnetic probe

524
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,320
placed in the base of your skull whilst
immersed without clothing in the old tank.

525
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,440
And you'd be heavily drugged.

526
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,170
What sort of drugs?

527
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:58,130
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin,
lysergic acid diethylamide.

528
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,680
That last one is
lsd, by the way--acid.

529
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,870
Take at least a few hours.

530
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,380
I'd need your help to synthesize
it if it's not too much trouble.

531
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,590
Yeah, sure, no problem.
That sounds like fun.

532
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,770
The man who was just released
from the mental institution,

533
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,730
he wants to give you a drug overdose,

534
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,820
then sick a metal rod into your head and
put you naked into a rusty tank of water.

535
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,930
No, I don't want to.

536
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,790
No, I'd rather not.
I'm just saying I can.

537
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,580
Okay, olivia, excuse me for sec.

538
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,770
Now you're obviously
under severe duress,

539
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,290
and you haven't slept since iraq,
and the man you care about might die,

540
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,550
but I'm telling you
that man will kill you.

541
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,660
You don't understand the procedure.

542
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,080
John would do it for me.

543
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,420
Set it up.

544
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,650
I'll get dhs authorization
to bring john here.

545
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,410
This is unbelievable. This
is insane! He is insane!

546
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,160
And you're insane for following him.

547
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,500
Excellent.

548
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,210
Let's make some lsd.

549
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,700
put him over here.

550
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,330
Salt'll make you float.

551
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,830
Charlie, did you get me
in to see william bell?

552
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,370
Massive dynamics isn't exactly
being forthcoming or courteous.

553
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,530
And apparently, william bell is out
of the country for the next two weeks.

554
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,430
What's this?

555
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,250
A sweet little memo from
their general counsel.

556
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,540
So bell doesn't want to talk?

557
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,360
Or he's just being the head
of a $50 billion corporation.

558
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,390
Oh, screw this.

559
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,620
I want to drive a tank through william
bell's office and find out what he knows.

560
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,510
I know you do, but I'm here
to tell you the bad news.

561
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,530
It's gonna be another 48 hours
till we get a court order.

562
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,340
You should probably
strip to your underwear.

563
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,490
Hello.

564
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,780
What the hell was that?

565
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,280
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.

566
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,190
I need you to get to bell.

567
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,290
If walter fails, bell could
be the only one to save us.

568
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,730
Livvy, what's happening here?

569
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,610
You've cleared all this with broyles?

570
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,560
Somewhat.

571
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,840
Somewhat doesn't sound good.

572
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,450
Is that a cow?

573
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,670
Yeah, that's gene.

574
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,500
Listen, charlie, I-I need you to
promise me you'll do whatever you can.

575
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,840
Of course. You know that.

576
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,960
Be careful.

577
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,120
My god.

578
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,140
now where was I?

579
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,650
Could you tilt your
head forward, please.

580
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,320
I still think that this is deeply
irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.

581
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,800
This is an anesthetic.

582
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,120
I feel normal working.

583
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,420
Yeah, 'cause bootlegging smack in the
basement is just the picture of normalcy.

584
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,650
I got you. I got you.

585
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,600
I hope your guy is worth it.

586
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,500
And this...

587
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,630
will rip open your consciousness.

588
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,340
Listen, in case, you
don't come back, I just...

589
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,670
wanted to say before we do this, how
much I appreciate what you've done.

590
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,850
There are so many things you'll
lose in a place like that.

591
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,900
You lose being trusted.

592
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,960
Strange how important
that is once it's gone.

593
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,620
If you want to watch,
you can come closer.

594
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,050
Do you work here?

595
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,640
Yeah, I'm astrid farnsworth,
assistant to agent dunham.

596
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,510
Who?

597
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,020
Oh, yes. I'm walter...

598
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,320
bishop, walter bishop.

599
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,280
Yes, thank you.

600
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,530
Don't mention it.

601
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,050
These are her brain rhythms.

602
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,250
More important than most people know
regarding cerebral regional interaction.

603
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,610
Critical.

604
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,890
And--and
these are his.

605
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:04,370
As the drugs take effect, the probes will
synchronize the electrical signals from both.

606
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,990
That's what the brain
is, an electrical router.

607
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,450
Should be able to be
interpreted by the other.

608
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,220
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.

609
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:19,260
Then when the rhythms are in synch, they
should be in the same place, so to speak.

610
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,300
So what do we do now?

611
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,000
Now we wait.

612
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,210
What was that?

613
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,220
Hello. Hello!

614
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:43,370
I think I'm here. I
think I'm here. I'm here.

615
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,970
John?

616
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,720
That's my uncle's kayak.

617
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,720
John? Is that you?

618
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,760
- olivia.
- John.

619
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,420
- What's happening?
- She's fine.

620
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,030
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

621
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,030
- You sure?
- Look.

622
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,910
I was just thinking about you.

623
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,860
What was that?

624
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,010
Oh, nothing.

625
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,520
John... you were hurt.

626
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,010
I don't remember.

627
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,570
Think.

628
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,890
The storage units.

629
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,670
I feel cold.

630
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,290
I need you to remember.

631
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,530
Remember what?

632
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,410
What you saw.

633
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,760
I need you to show me his face.

634
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,480
Why?

635
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,910
So I can save you.

636
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,490
Please try.

637
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,690
Try and remember.

638
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,440
Yes, this is right. This is right.

639
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,500
we got a runner in the
back. We need him alive.

640
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,730
I can't see his face.

641
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,370
Her leg!

642
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,840
Oh, I saw him!

643
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:05,260
I saw john get hurt. I was there.
I was there, I saw--I saw him.

644
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,130
What do you mean you saw him? Where?

645
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,850
I told you not to ask me that.

646
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,010
This is him. This is the suspect
we're looking for.He looks like this

647
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,810
send me the image. I'll
put it through the database.

648
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,600
Have you slept? You look like crap.

649
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,740
No primary matches for criminal record.

650
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:36,840
Well, cross-check all state driver license
files and send this image to all local hospitals.

651
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,000
Agent dunham, take a look at this.

652
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,050
Oh, my god. This is him.

653
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,860
He was a passenger on flight 627.

654
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,420
- I don't-- I don't
understand. - Wait, wait, wait.

655
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,830
He couldn't have been
at the storage place.

656
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,050
- Charlie, I saw him there.
- hold on, guys.

657
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,870
Morgan steig was passenger number 108.

658
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,730
His emergency contact, richard steig.

659
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,180
You're telling me he has a twin?

660
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,540
Yeah, no home address, only
a history of employment.

661
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,010
What?

662
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,800
Richard steig's last employer.

663
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,820
I was hoping to speak with william bell.

664
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,370
{\a6}<i>MASSIVE DYNAMIC NEW YORK</i>

665
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,410
I'm nina sharp, executive director.

666
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,020
I only have a few minutes.

667
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,390
our primary suspect is a former
employee of yours, richard steig,

668
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,520
who may have used research from your company
to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin.

669
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:37,280
We don't know why or for whom, but it appears
he was willing to sacrifice his own brother.

670
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:42,190
Whatever killed those people on that
plane got onboard through his insulin pen.

671
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,310
So do you want to talk to me?

672
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,110
Danielle...

673
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,560
please assemble everything we have on
richard steig for agent dunham here.

674
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,730
I remember richard steig.

675
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,650
He worked in our weapons
systems research lab.

676
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:11,390
He was caught three months ago trying to
leave the premises with classified information.

677
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,260
He was terminated immediately.

678
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,380
We referred his name to
the justice department.

679
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:18,350
We have done our due
diligence, agent dunham.

680
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,810
And if you choose to drag our company
and dr. Bell's name into this matter,

681
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,920
you will be hearing from our attorneys.

682
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,610
How long have you worked for dr. Bell?

683
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,490
16 years.

684
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,420
I owe massive dynamics my life,
and that is not an exaggeratioN.

685
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,850
I s a runner most of my life.

686
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,210
In the '97 boston marathon,
I felt strangely tired.

687
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,740
One day at the office, dr. Bell noticed my
discomfort and insisted I go for a cat scan.

688
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,060
Cancer.

689
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,630
Spread so severely I had to
have my arm amputated that week.

690
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,540
That first scanner that found my
cancer was built by this company.

691
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,990
The robotic assist tools there were used in
my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards...

692
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,770
were developed and manufactured
by massive dynamics.

693
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:13,350
And my replacement limb was
designed by bell himself.

694
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,040
Everything we have on richard steig.

695
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,970
Do you believe that steig
may be part of the pattern?

696
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,850
I'm sorry, part of the...

697
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,910
part of the pattern?

698
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,090
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.

699
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,070
Well, I'm cleared to know whatever
you're cleared to know, ms. Sharp.

700
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,860
Apparently not.

701
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,650
But suffice to say that we've reached
a point where science and technology

702
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,130
have advanced at such an
exponential rate for so long,

703
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,970
it may be way beyond our ability
to regulate and control them.

704
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,340
You should know what you're
getting into, agent dunham.

705
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,400
I would say this to my own daughter.

706
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,270
Be careful.

707
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,870
And good luck.

708
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,620
Keep the tree warm, sandy!
We're on our way to your house!

709
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,740
And this is a show for children?

710
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,810
Yeah, it's huge.

711
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,320
Surprisingly profound for
a narrative about a sponge.

712
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,710
Crazy house.

713
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,630
I just landed at logan.
I'm on my way to you.

714
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,570
I think we've located our suspect.

715
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,560
Hold on a second. You found the guy?

716
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,920
You found the guy from your dream.

717
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:36,990
I'm picking you both up.

718
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,490
I need your father
there to question him,

719
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,720
get whatever information he needs
so he can make the cure for john.

720
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,930
And I need you there too
in case your father's--

721
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,200
say no more. We'll meet you out front.

722
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,540
stay eyes on south side.

723
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,640
red, stand by.

724
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,400
rooftop, confirm your position.

725
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,390
{\a6}<i>S*** BOSTON</i>

726
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,860
Got one coming out.

727
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,150
This way, ma'am.

728
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:22,320
Clear! Clear! Clear!

729
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,010
In the back!

730
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,090
I'd like to... check
your blood pressure.

731
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,350
Why don't you check your own blood
pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.

732
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,370
Your skin tone suggests you might be
suffering from arterial hypertension.

733
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,220
Don't tell me what I'm suffering from.

734
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,700
And there are no visible
signs of hypertension.

735
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,400
When this over, please
don't send me back.

736
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,620
I don't want to go back.

737
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:22,610
Look,
walter--

738
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:28,130
this experience...You
woke me up again, and...

739
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,440
you can't put me back to sleep.

740
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:34,400
It was hardly my idea, any of it.

741
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:39,370
Whatever punishment you think I deserve,

742
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:43,730
I swear I have already endured it.

743
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,190
17 years. Please...

744
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,590
son.

745
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,990
What?

746
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,930
He's in the alley!

747
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,000
Can I get out of the car?

748
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,250
Stay right there, walter!

749
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,440
We've got some questions for you.

750
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,860
U.S.Code 1111.

751
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,590
The murder of 147 passengers.

752
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,230
U.S.Code 2332-A.

753
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,910
Use of weapons of mass destruction.

754
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,160
U.S.Code 2332-B.

755
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,490
An act of terrorism
transcending national borders.

756
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,440
U.S.Code 1132-A.

757
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,420
Attempted murder of a federal agent.

758
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,770
You want immunity.

759
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:52,390
I want a detailed account of all the synthetic
chemicals you had in that storage facility.

760
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,510
Write them down.

761
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,220
And then we can talk about an agreement.

762
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:07,630
I... have nothing... to say.

763
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,950
Walter, stay here.

764
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:53,850
Where
are you--

765
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,790
the compound affecting agent scott.

766
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,270
It's water soluble, right?

767
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,420
We might not know what it
is, but we know what it does.

768
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,650
So if I wanted to, I could extract the
contagious fluids from his body and...

769
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,310
that would allow me to slip
it to you whenever I wanted to.

770
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,710
In your food.

771
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,510
A cup of coffee.

772
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,650
The toilet.

773
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,600
Nobody would ever know how it happened.

774
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,340
The only problem is...

775
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:28,740
the woman who was just in here,
that's her friend who's dying.

776
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,780
So I just don't have that kind of time.

777
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,250
No!

778
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,680
Tell me the chemicals!

779
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:38,060
Hey, stop, stop! You
can't! You can't do that.

780
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,860
No, you can't do that.

781
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,420
I want the names of the chemicals.

782
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,620
I'm gonna count to one.

783
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,630
One!

784
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,880
The active toxin was a
magnesium based ethylene glycol.

785
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,430
No, I understand that, but
you're not listening to me.

786
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,020
Magnesium ethylene glycol
with an organophosphate trig--

787
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,460
walter, just stop for a second.

788
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,780
His blood won't be able to absorb
it before the side-effects kill him.

789
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,680
So you're saying what?

790
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:02,780
We synthesize a calcium
gluconate in a thiamine base?

791
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,710
Yes, exactly.

792
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,050
We can'T. We'd need more
of his blood. We have none.

793
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:06,810
That's
not true--

794
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,290
all agents are required to set up a
backup blood supply in case we're wounded.

795
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,400
autologous transfusion.
That's brilliant.

796
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,810
We can create the antidote and then just
dissolve it into scott's stored blood.

797
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,950
If we transfuse him intravenously,
his body won't be overwhelmed.

798
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,330
A+, boY. Well done. Let's begin.

799
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,660
So I got the lab.

800
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,930
Yeah, I know you did.

801
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,660
Thanks.

802
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,230
How's it goin' downstairs?

803
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:08,770
bishop says it'll be awhile,
but that it's looking auspicious.

804
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,580
That was his word.

805
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,250
What?

806
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,100
You've done some solid work here.

807
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:20,780
Locating bishop. Getting him out.
Finding a way to get him to work with you.

808
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,110
We're impressed.

809
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,670
Who's "we"?

810
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,990
What happened on that plane might be part of
something more dangerous than just simple terrorism.

811
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,630
Simple terrorism?

812
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,970
In the past nine months, there have been three dozen
authenticated incidents like the hamburg flight.

813
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,890
John thompson, normal kid,
went missing back in '98.

814
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,240
Reappeared last month halfway
around the world. Hadn't aged a day.

815
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,080
In the past few months, 46 other children
who went missing that same year turn up.

816
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,590
Same story.

817
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:00,620
Local fisherman off the coast of sri lanka reports
a low-flying plane emitting a high-pitch frequency

818
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,910
that blows out all their windows.

819
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,890
An hour later, same spot,

820
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:10,920
an 8.7 sub-surface earthquake creates
a tsunami that kills 83,000 people.

821
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,130
- So why are you
telling me-- - this man.

822
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:18,300
A patient in lisbon who woke up after
years in a coma began writing just numbers.

823
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:23,470
They turn out to be exact real-time coordinates
of our carrier battle groups in the pacific.

824
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,250
Intel that's classified
above top-secret.

825
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,870
So how is that even possible?

826
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:30,260
Come work for me, and I'll
get you the clearance--

827
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,710
oh, stop.

828
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,630
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.

829
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,550
You must not have heard me. I said stop.

830
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,280
They're calling these
events "the pattern."

831
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,220
As if someone out there is experimenting,
only the whole world is their lab.

832
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,540
You've seen it, now you know.

833
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,200
I don't wanna know. I have a job.

834
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,890
This is a more important job.

835
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,860
Anything, anybody you
need, you can have.

836
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,840
I like the job I've got.

837
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:52,300
And the man I do it with. Which you
seem to have deduced on your own.

838
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,170
Look around.

839
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,160
You see all these people
going about their lives.

840
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,060
No idea what's happening around
them, what they're in the middle of.

841
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:03,940
I just wanna go back to before.

842
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:09,900
Dunham. I don't think you can.

843
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,030
He's up. He's awake.

844
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,720
Olivia, olivia, he's
awake! He's conscious.

845
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,380
John?

846
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,720
John, can you hear me, baby? Baby?

847
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,310
I had a dream about you.

848
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:52,190
Uh, a change of clothes for agent scott.

849
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,850
His vitals are surprisingly strong.

850
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,090
So, um, how long does he have to stay?

851
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,980
Until the melanocytes in his skin have
regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week.

852
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,890
He owes you his life.

853
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,750
We owe each other.

854
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,910
What room is steig in?

855
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,300
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?

856
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,520
I gave you the names of all the
synthetics I used in the compound.

857
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,520
Don't worry, our
immunity agreement holds.

858
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,720
But there's still a whole lot
more we have to talk about.

859
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,630
Like, why you killed your own brother?

860
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,120
And who you're selling your work to?

861
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,890
Who says I was selling it?

862
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,260
I was threatened by a
guy from your office.

863
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,740
You think I'm lying?

864
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,080
I swear to god.

865
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,930
I can prove it.

866
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,230
- Where's the recording?
- I buried it.

867
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:34,270
Who is this?

868
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,780
we had an exchange agreement.

869
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,950
hmm, there have been other bidders.

870
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,940
Today, the airplane was a demonstration.

871
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,830
you've drawn unwarranted attention.

872
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,640
Something we can't afford
to be connected with.

873
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,810
I'll make this simple. You're
not selling to anyone else.

874
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,430
You do that, we will come after you.

875
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,430
I will come after you.

876
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,210
you're threatening me after seeing what
I'm willing to do to my own brother?

877
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,470
well, let me assure you, we'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

878
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,200
Well, let me assure you. We'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

879
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,490
Special agent scott.

880
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,470
Yes, sir, go right ahead.

881
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,200
charlie, I need two agents posted
outside agent scott's room now.

882
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,460
Check on steig.

883
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:49,750
I'm on it.

884
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,830
I'm five minutes away.

885
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,920
We need this place locked down!

886
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:13,810
This is dunham, agent I.D.52776 In pursuit
of blue suv heading south on fenway.

887
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,980
Need immediate assist.

888
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,640
Ask yourself why...

889
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:23,450
why broyles sent you
to the storage facility.

890
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:28,250
Why you?

891
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,210
Why? I don't understand.

892
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,190
Who are you working for?

893
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:40,150
John, tell me.

894
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,220
Tell me more, john.

895
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,840
I knew him just as long as you did.

896
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,130
I'm sorry.

897
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,920
Job isn't what it was ten years ago.

898
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,030
We're supposed to protect a world

899
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,700
where one breath of the wrong air can
incinerate you from the inside out.

900
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,440
I mean, how do we protect people

901
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:10,650
when corporations have higher
security clearances than we do?

902
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:15,780
When we're not fully briefed on half
the things that we're investigating?

903
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,910
You know, when the truth...

904
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:27,820
the truth is we're obsolete.

905
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,590
Take me back to the lab.

906
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,640
Can I talk to you please?

907
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:57,560
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.

908
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:02,120
Though I'm sure you're anxious to
get as far away from here as possible.

909
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:05,700
To iraq or afghanistan or
countless other out of reach places,

910
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:08,050
but I'm here to tell you that
your father needs to stay.

911
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,650
Which means that you need to too.

912
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,720
Are you okay?

913
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:18,570
No, I-I-I-I know that you have countless
reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you.

914
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:21,710
But, I mean, your father is a good man.

915
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,800
He's not the monster you think he is.

916
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,010
And you're good with him,
despite what you think.

917
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,460
And you're the only
one who speaks walter.

918
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,070
We take him back to st.
Claire's and it's all over.

919
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,980
Where's john?

920
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:35,240
I can talk to the agency and get
them to clear your gambling debts.

921
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,080
I can take care of my own debts,
okay? What just happened? Where's john?

922
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,460
I'm not gonna use false
threats with you anymore.

923
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:45,250
I don't need to.

924
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,580
The threats are real.

925
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:56,250
After you left, my father sat down and started
talking to me and he was remarkably lucid.

926
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,330
He told me about the work. That he and
william bell had done their experiments.

927
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:05,410
And that incident-- what happened
on the plane is just the beginning.

928
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:11,740
Which makes every part of me feel
like I gotta get the hell outta boston.

929
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,990
are we leaving?

930
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:21,350
Are we leaving?

931
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,350
How long has he been dead?

932
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,790
five hours.

933
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,320
Question him.
