<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,128
Surgeries that Newton performed.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,213
He was removing
transplanted brain tissue.

4
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:09,842
You nearly died when you were a boy.

5
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:13,611
Walternate found a cure for Peter.

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:15,431
Peter is dead.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,814
I'm talking about the other Peter.
The one on the other side.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,895
I'm not from here, am I?

9
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,731
- Son...
- I am not your son.

10
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,735
Peter checked himself out
of the hospital three hours ago.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,195
He's gone.

12
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,723
Drink that, avoid the radar,
you'll be in Oakland in no time.

13
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,551
That is for you, Raymond.
Your burger should be up in a minute.

14
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:04,021
So... Where was I?

15
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,809
You were in the middle of telling me
how you moved around a lot as a kid.

16
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,402
But I got to tell you, now
I'm hopelessly intrigued with these CDs.

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,405
I'm sort of known here by the regulars
for my playlists.

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,821
I base my tracks on people's aura.

19
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,535
How often do you think I'd have to
come here to be considered a regular?

20
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,204
I might be able to get you
on the list.

21
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:23,040
First, you have to tell me
where you're from.

22
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:25,524
Technically...

23
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:28,504
I'm from no place
you've ever heard of.

24
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,507
But let's just say Boston.

25
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,429
So how long are you here for?

26
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,391
I was just planning on the one night...
Passing through.

27
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:42,037
To?

28
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:44,952
I don't know yet.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,983
Peter from Boston.

30
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:50,943
I'll burn you one.

31
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:52,793
Really?

32
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:56,699
- What did I do right?
- It's a long road to "I don't know yet."

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,250
I want to make sure
you stay awake out there.

34
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,122
And I like your eyes.

35
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,196
So there's that.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,960
Where are you staying?

37
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,006
I'm staying
at the Drake's Bay Motel.

38
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,176
I'll drop it by after my shift.

39
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,004
Okay, I'll see you then.

40
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,722
I'll see you then.

41
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,809

happen to drop by here?

55

Hello?

56
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:04,786
Krista?

57
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:11,260
Hello?

58
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,575
Destination.

59
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,994
- <i>Please say a city name.</i>
- Portland.

00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,548
<i>Portland. Please proceed
to the highlighted route.</i>

61
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,441
That was obviously way too easy.

62

<i>Sorry. Please say the city name.</i>

66
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:10,160
How you doing?

67
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,288
I'm sheriff Mathis.
This is Deputy Ferguson.

68
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,374
Hi, there.
Peter Bishop.

69
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,482
Were you a customer here last night?

70
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:19,607
I was.

71
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,922
Do you remember your waitress?

72
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,240
Krista, sure.

73
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,385
- Why, did something happen to her?
- Do you have any identification on you?

74
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:30,897
Of course.

75
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:38,647
Krista told a coworker she was planning
to meet you after her shift last night.

76
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,692
You gonna tell me
what's going on here?

77
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,432
You first.

78
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:47,156
Yeah, we made plans.
But she never showed up.

79
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:50,868
She was gonna meet me at the Drake's Bay
but I just fell asleep in the lobby.

80
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,287
You can call the front desk,
ask the guy there.

81
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,425
Why don't you just
hang here a sec, okay?

82
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,188
Where are you goin'?

83
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,515
Who are you lookin' for?

84
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:25,945
No one.

85
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,366
Come on, you got to be kidding me.

86
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,786
Krista Manning went missing
last night.

87
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,195
And you talked to her.

88
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,660
You two spent some time.
I'd just like to hear about it.

89
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,212
I'd like to do that
at the station, okay?

90
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,338
Six feet, brown hair.

91
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,093
Officer, I wasn't staying
under the name Bishop.

92
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,553
I was registered
under the name Stewart.

93
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,308
He says he was staying
under the name Stewart.

94
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,352
Right, okay. Thanks, Tom.

95
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:02,272
Tom over at Drake's Bay confirms that he
was passed out in the lobby all night.

96
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:06,702
Why did you check into the motel
under an assumed name, sir?

97
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,910
<i>Sheriff?</i>

98
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:12,616
- This is Mathis. Go ahead.
- <i>Dogs have found a body...</i>

99
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,471
<i>The spillway off route 219
and mile marker 8.</i>

100
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,371
<i>White female, coroner's on his way.</i>

101
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,662
Oh, my god.

102
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,160
<i>Noyo search and rescue,
what's your 20?</i>

103
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,768
<i>ETA about 45.</i>

104
00:08:57,893 --> 00:08:59,892
<i>Confirm this is recovery,
not rescue.</i>

105
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,819
<i>That's right, Wes.
It's a bad one.</i>

106
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:04,898
<i>The coroner says the victim had
some sort of operation done to her.</i>

107
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,037
<i>A piece of her skull cut out.
Over.</i>

108
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:16,218
Sheriff, can you let me out
of the back of this car?

109
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:18,652
Please, I'm sorry,
But you're gonna have to be patient.

110
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,893
Hold on for one second.
I was listening to your radio.

111
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,187
They said that she had
a piece of her skull cut out.

112
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,606
Is she missing a part of her brain?

113
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,817
That that's a weird question,
but you need

114
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,695
to ask the coroner whether she's missing
a piece of her temporal lobe.

115
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,488
Please.

116
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,767
How the hell did you know that?

117
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,172
You're FBI?

118
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,688
What exactly is
a civilian consultant?

119
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:18,382
Sometimes people
with certain areas of expertise

120
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:21,078
can offer them to the bureau
on a consulting basis.

121
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,997
My area of expertise is...

122
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,165
weird.

123
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,376
- You mean difficult to explain?
- No, I mean

124
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,531
the strange, the inexplicable.

125
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:31,063
So...

126
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,326
Can you talk me through this again?

127
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,221
You knew that they took her...

128
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,927
- temporal lobe.
- Temporal lobe

129
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:41,419
because it's like a case
you worked on before?

130
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,976
Exactly. We were never able
to catch those responsible.

131
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,585
So that's why you're out here.

132
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,230
You're tracking them down?

133
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:50,731
No.

134
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,028
But I think that they
may be tracking me down.

135
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,781
- What'd they want with you?
- I'm not sure yet.

136
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,702
But I thought I saw one of them earlier
outside the crime scene.

137
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,952
His name is Newton.

138
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,746
And I think they called me
at the drake's bay motel.

139
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,094
There was no voice on the
other end of the line.

140
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:10,877
It was just static, and then
a series of strange noises and clicks.

141
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,673
I think they killed
Krista to find me.

142
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:17,009
By taking her brain?

143
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,554
I told her where I was staying.

144
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,682
- She's the only person who knew.
- Why wouldn't they just...

145
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:27,019
ask her where you were staying?
Or force her?

146
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,839
I mean, why cut out her brain?

147
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,982
It's possible that they needed details
about me she didn't know she had.

148
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,609
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

149
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,329
I know that this is complicated.

150
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:39,990
And I'm sorry that I can't give you all
the answers, but the case is classified.

151
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,889
It is possible, however,
that I could show you

152
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:46,913
what I mean.

153
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,292
Just give me a minute.

154
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:53,206
I'm gonna go make
a few calls, Peter.

155
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:54,728
Of course.

156
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,603
- Where are you?
- <i>I'll save you the trace.</i>

157
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm in Washington State.

158
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,940
<i>Look, I need a favor.</i>

159
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,902
You're about to get a call from
the Noyo County Sheriff's Department.

160
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:20,113
- They're checking up on my credentials.
- <i>Are you in trouble?</i>

161
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,574
In fact, just the opposite.

162
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,745
<i>I stumbled into an investigation,
and I offered them my services.</i>

163
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,356
We'll ask them to extend
you every courtesy.

164
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,664
<i>Thank you. Listen...</i>

165
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,418
I don't want you to tell Walter
where I am.

166
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,421
<i>In fact, I don't even want you
to tell him that we spoke.</i>

167
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,673
If you owe me anything,
you owe me that.

168
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:44,179
But, Bishop... if you change your mind,
I'll send someone to pick you up.

169
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,515
Thanks.

170
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:49,393
- <i>I got to go.</i>
- Take care of yourself.

171
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,646
Krista seemed like a sweet girl.
Did you know her?

172
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:57,901
She and my sister went to
school together.

173
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,655
<i>So explain this to me.</i>

174
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,965
The temporal lobe is
responsible for memory.

175
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,036
So think of the brain as the greatest
recording device ever created.

176
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,331
Every sight, sound, smell,
all recorded in perfect detail.

177
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,210
But imagine that there was a way
to get that data out of the brain.

178
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,379
<i>So what I said, what I was wearing,</i>

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,923
What time it was,
where I was staying...

180
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,489
<i>I know how it sounds.</i>

181
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:25,804
But believe me,
if you can imagine it, it's possible.

182
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,745
If that's true,

183
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,684
if they were trying to find you,

184
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,632
why didn't they just come
for you last night?

185
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:33,843
I don't know.

186
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,064
These are not your
ordinary bad guys.

187
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,399
The tissue is very pink.

188
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:40,932
It's not normally like that.

189
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,488
It only happens when our
bodies metabolize adrenaline.

190
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,092
Her adrenal's must have
spiked right before she died.

191
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:49,744
My God.

192
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,462
"Find the crack"?

193
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,295
That is the worst police
slogan I've ever heard.

194
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,549
It's not a slogan.

195
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:04,801
In the darkness,

196
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,342
there's always a crack.

197
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,681
It's how the light gets in.

198
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,310
Ferguson gave it to me...

199
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,629
on our first case together.

200
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,887
Nobody else thought
I could hack it, but...

201
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,038
It's an inside joke.

202
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,337
It looks expensive.

203
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,198
Yeah.

204
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,533
That's what he keeps telling me.

205
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,742
If that's an accurate account
of your statement, please sign it.

206
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,393
It is, very.

207
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,389
I'm gonna get a room
at the Northwest Passage.

208
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,353
I'll be staying under the name of...

209
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,405
Gene Cowan.

210
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,989
- If you need me, that's where I'm at.
- You don't want a police escort?

211
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,371
No, I'll be fine.

212
00:14:57,593 --> 00:15:01,200
You say that there are people out there
cutting people's brains out to find you,

213
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,735
- and you're smiling.
- Look, they may have found me.

214
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,990
But now that I know they're here
for sure, I found them too.

215
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:08,907
And now we're gonna catch 'em.

216
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:15,580
What?

217
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:20,001
- I don't know about this guy, Ann.
- He knew his way around there.

218
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,053
He's like a medical examiner.

219
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:24,532
He knew the brain,
biology, medications.

220
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,049
Doesn't mean he's legit.

221
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,548
You read your books about Ufos,
Roswell, whacked-out theories,

222
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:32,192
government conspiracies,
I think that you want to believe.

223
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,432
What makes you trust him?

224
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:35,985
I don't know.

225
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:39,104
I'm a good judge of character.

226
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:43,525
I'm the only one here who likes you.

227
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,495
Closed. What do you want?

228
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,499
If you open up,
I'll make it worth your while.

229
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,682
Mathis?

230
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,377
What do you want from me?

231
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,955
It's Mathis.

232
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,041
Who did you tell?

233
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,287
- What are you talking about?
- I just got one of those phone calls.

234
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,713
They know where I'm staying.

235
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,839
- <i>And I only told you.</i>
- I didn't...

236
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,174
Ask your partner!

237
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,189
That's what I'm calling about.

238
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,649
Ferguson's...

239
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,014
Ferguson's disappeared.

240
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,272
The last time you spoke with him?

241
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,940
About two hours.

242
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,487
He went back to the scene
where Kristawas found.

243
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,111
Felt we've missed something.

244
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:13,823
That means that he disappeared
30 min before I got the last phone call.

245
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,786
You think they used him to find you,

246
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,653
like they used Krista.

247
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,583
What is it that makes you special?

248
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,120
Why haven't they taken you?

249
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:27,765
I don't know.

250
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,250
I don't even know what it all means,

251
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,759
but I do know that these
people have the answers.

252
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:34,594
It's exactly why I must find them.

253
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,763
All right,
call your friends at the FBI.

254
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,472
- Let's get these guys!
- No.

255
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,642
The FBI has the expertise.

256
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,797
- They have the resources.
- If we call them,

257
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,354
they're gonna descend here,

258
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,467
and these people will disappear.

259
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:48,191
I am this close.

260
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,557
And I am going to get my answers.

261
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:56,741
You said you got calls at Drake's Bay
and Northwest Passage, right?

262
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,249
We pulled those phone records.
Those calls never happened.

263
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:13,895
These people can pull
memories out of brain tissue.

264
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,059
You think they can't make
calls disappear?

265
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,930
I can do that. People have been doing
that since the '70s.

266
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:23,852
I understand.

267
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,804
You don't want me to be right,

268
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:31,484
'cause if I'm right, that means
your partner is most likely dead.

269
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,973
With the exception of who you are,

270
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:40,410
I haven't been able to verify
anything you've said to me.

271
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:42,537
It's all either classified,

272
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,987
or it's incredible.
I'm calling the bureau.

273
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,071
Your partner did disappear.

274
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:50,969
And I did talk to Krista.

275
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:53,799
And I did get those phone calls.

276
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:08,605
What if he's alive?

277
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,265
What if he's out somewhere, thinking
I am doing everything in my power,

278
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,671
including calling the FBI,
to save him?

279
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,326
Then that is all the more reason
for us to find him ourselves.

280
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:23,010
If you make that phone call,

281
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,513
we never will.

282
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,182
Excuse me, please.

283
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:48,603
Thank you.

284
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,947
Toaster pastry.

285
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,983
"Corn starch,

286
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:56,236
"soy lecithin,

287
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,105
Potassium... Bromate."

288
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,702
Potassium bromate?

289
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,998
This supermarket
is trying to kill us!

290
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:12,377
You... Potassium bromate,
do you know what that is?

291
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,129
- Are you okay, sir?
- It is known

292
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,092
to induce renal cell tumors...
Mesotheliomas of the peritoneum!

293
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,719
- Can I call someone for you?
- Call someone?

294
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,389
You know what you're putting
into our bodies? Death!

295
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,292
Delicious,
strawberry-flavored death!

296
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,839
- Okay, I'm calling security.
- Yes!

297
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:56,492
They had no right to make me
wait at the police station.

298
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:57,896
It's the makers of those

299
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,495
toaster pastries
that should be in jail.

300
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,885
Let it go, Walter.

301
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,270
You're home now, and you're safe.

302
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,297
I wasn't expecting guests.

303
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,659
Why didn't you tell me
you needed help?

304
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,086
What am I going to do...

305
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,522
Call you every time
I run out of pudding pops?

306
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,582
- If you need them.
- I need

307
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,892
to learn to care for myself.

308
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,296
If Peter doesn't come back...

309
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,804
They'll send me back to
the hospital, won't they?

310
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,891
I won't let that happen.

311
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,558
Thank you.

312
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:57,748
I do...

313
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,495
I do need pudding pops.

314
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:06,616
We don't know if he made it,

315
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:09,619
but this is the last place
he said he was going.

316
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,654
Isn't it protocol for him to call in
once he gets here?

317
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,422
Well... Sometimes
he doesn't do that.

318
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,575
Dummy.

319
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,214
Bishop?

320
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:25,850
Bishop!

321
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:53,845
Mathis.

322
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,389
What did you see?

323
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,154
I saw Newton and one other guy.

324
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,905
You didn't see them too?
They came running right past you.

325
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:04,567
What's wrong?

326
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,230
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,836
Put down that gun.

328
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,825
Who are you?

329
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,486
Bishop... Lower... Your... Weapon.

330
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,335
In the morgue,
you dropped something.

331
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,833
Who gave it to you?

332
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,610
- What is wrong with you?
- Answer the question!

333
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,190
My pen?

334
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,094
It was a gift from Ferguson,
my partner.

335
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,354
Why is there blood on your jacket?

336
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,159
There is blood on my jacket

337
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,494
because there is blood on my wrist,

338
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,401
which I got when I fell, running.

339
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:54,472
Show me.

340
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,554
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,040
I needed to know
that your blood was still red.

342
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,991
What other color would it be?

343
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,644
So these shape-shifters, they...

344
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,413
make themselves look
like other people?

345
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,524
It's a technology
unlike anything you've seen before.

346
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:34,866
I want to level with you.

347
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:36,917
I...

348
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:40,872
believe in the unknown.

349
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,474
Yeah. "Find the crack".
I get it.

350
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,949
No, I mean...

351
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:47,811
I read books about...

352
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,999
Ufos and conspiracy theories.
But I do think...

353
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:57,326
I mean, I am wondering right now...

354
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,808
if you are not completely
off your rocker.

355
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,899
- They were there.
- I didn't see them...

356
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:04,260
or the dart they shot.

357
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:06,430
I know you didn't,
because they removed it.

358
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:08,029
I know how this must look...

359
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:11,095
from your point of view...
I mean, I was there once too. But...

360
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:13,990
You just did it.

361
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,658
- Did what?
- You just questioned your own sanity.

362
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:21,996
- I'm not questioning...
- When was the last time you slept?

363
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,581
I'm not hallucinating.

364
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:27,460
And I'm not paranoid.
And I'm not questioning my own sanity.

365
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,618
I was wondering why you
would listen to me.

366
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:34,390
You're desperate.

367
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:40,460
Ferguson is more than just
your partner, isn't he?

368
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:48,220
So there is something
between the two of you.

369
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,350
You said back at the
precinct that...

370
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:57,615
that I was trying to rationalize
that he was still alive.

371
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,077
You may be right.

372
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,878
I may be doing it right now.
He may be dead.

373
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,377
But I won't believe
it until I see his body.

374
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,844
I can't.

375
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:21,681
Mathis.

376
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,740
You want me to go look?

377
00:27:58,246 --> 00:28:01,841
Sheriff. The victim's a white female.
She has part of her skull missing.

378
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:12,732
I don't recognize this girl.

379
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,110
- You never seen her before?
- No, I've never seen her before.

380
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:17,815
Who is she?

381
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,198
I talked to Gwynn right
before her shift ended.

382
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:26,037
We'd talked about her coming over
last night to help me color my hair.

383
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:29,498
I figured she just got tired.

384
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,168
I should have called her.

385
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,650
You couldn't have known.

386
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,611
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,651
Did your sister ever hang
out at the hilltop cafe?

388
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:42,143
I don't think so.

389
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,059
What about the Mosser brothers
gas station out on route 202?

390
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,959
I filled up there
on the way into town.

391
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:49,829
Her pickup's a diesel, and
I don't think Mosser's carries diesel.

392
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:52,778
Fine, what about the drake's bay motel?
Would she ever go there for any reason?

393
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:54,982
- What's this about?
- It's just...

394
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,213
Part of our investigation.

395
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:00,738
If you could just write down
your address for us.

396
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:07,423
She is grieving,

397
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:10,021
and you are not getting anywhere.

398
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,658
The hadron super collider
is less complicated

399
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,326
than that infernal dishwater.

400
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:34,385
Next time, don't use
laundry detergent,

401
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,040
- and the dishwasher will work fine.
- Thank you, Astrid.

402
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:38,665
You're a federal agent.

403
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,667
I doubt, during
your years of training,

404
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:44,902
that you had dreams of babysitting
a helpless old man.

405
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:47,743
You are not that helpless.

406
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,454
A little disorganized, maybe.

407
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,802
Don't you usually keep
this in the bathtub?

408
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,174
I took this little car
from the zelazney building.

409
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:05,208
Objects from the other
universe like this

410
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:09,144
emit a glimmer,
a distinctive energy signature.

411
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,309
It may be possible
to detect that signature.

412
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,244
So?

413
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,017
So I need you to gather
all the objects from the other side

414
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:18,099
that we recovered
from the Zelazney building

415
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,137
and from Jacksonville
and bring them to the lab.

416
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:22,148
- Okay, why?
- To build a device to read

417
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:23,637
that energy signature!

418
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:26,171
Peter emits the same energy,
don't you see?

419
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:28,161
This is how we will find Peter.

420
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:34,915
I must have seen Gwynn somewhere,

421
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,452
or she had to have seen me.
I mean...

422
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:39,879
She has to have had
some value to them,

423
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,650
some knowledge that they needed.

424
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,619
We'll go to your motel
and get your things,

425
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:46,076
get you something to eat, and...

426
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:48,367
You can stay at my house tonight.

427
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,888
It's okay. I'll be fine.

428
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:54,664
You're my only connection
to finding Bill right now.

429
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,297
I want you safe.

430
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:01,277
What color was Gwynn's truck?

431
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,027
Tan brown.

432
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,796
Driver's side window is rolled down.

433
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,444
Glove compartment's open.

434
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:34,426
Okay, so this girl
pulls over her truck,

435
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:37,646
rolls down the window,
and then opens up the glove box.

436
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,115
- You tell me... why would she do that?
- She got pulled over by a cop.

437
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,531
Or someone pretending
to be a cop... or Bill.

438
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:46,133
- Pretending to be Bill?
- These shape-shifters,

439
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:48,886
they take on the appearance
of people in positions of authority.

440
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:55,519
- Where you going?
- I'm calling the FBI.

441
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,789
Why?

442
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:01,798
First, you said they
cut out his brain to find you.

443
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:04,505
Now you're telling me he may
have been shape-shifted?

444
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,006
Which is it, Peter?

445
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,842
Did I make a mistake
not calling the FBI?

446
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,834
I am very scared right now.

447
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:27,468
Wait, wai... wait.
Just hold on for one second.

448
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,143
Those people, when they were taken,
they must have been afraid, right?

449
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:32,462
And when they were killed,
they must have been terrified.

450
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:35,374
- So?
- So I know how to find them.

451
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,535
Do you know how airplanes
have blackboxes?

452
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,377
To record flight data, sure.

453
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:48,313
Yeah, well, human bodies
collect data as well.

454
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:51,957
Both Krista and Gwynn's muscle tissue
was flooded with adrenaline.

455
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:53,387
Yeah, I remember.

456
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:56,599
Well, the tissue would've
partially metabolized the adrenaline.

457
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,115
So we should be able to measure
the rate of absorption,

458
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,895
which will tell us
when the adrenaline was first produced.

459
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,397
What about Newton?

460
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,774
- How does that help us find him?
- Look...

461
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:10,029
Normally,
your adrenaline levels are flat.

462
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:13,056
Then you experience fear.

463
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:14,903
A spike in adrenaline.

464
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:17,472
Sometime later,
you experience more fear,

465
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:19,884
say, in the moments right
before you were killed...

466
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:21,707
another spike, two points of fear.

467
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,669
We already know where the girls were
abducted. So if we can just determine

468
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,213
how much time took place
between these two intervals...

469
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,705
Then we can figure out
where they were killed.

470
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,030
Exactly right.

471
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:36,347
There is one more thing.
We're gonna need a control sample.

472
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:39,475
Can you stick that
in the centrifuge?

473
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,389
It's that thing right over there.

474
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:48,817
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

475
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:50,819
I just needed to scare you.

476
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:03,832
I'm gonna need to take
a tissue sample from you.

477
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:09,213
How is Dr. Bishop doing?

478
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,758
Walter's trying to adjust
to a very difficult situation.

479
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:16,762
He's concerned about
being sent back to St. Claire's.

480
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,811
Will he be able to function
if Peter doesn't come back?

481
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,679
I'm sure that Peter will come back.

482
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:36,573
Do you know something?

483
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:43,134
Have you spoken to him?

484
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,684
Krista Manning's adrenaline
spikes were 42 minutes apart. So,

485
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,664
assuming that Newton drove
the speed limit, 60 miles an hour...

486
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:53,132
On these roads, that'd be a good way to
get killed. He would have stuck to 45.

487
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,359
All right, 45.

488
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,722
Okay, the center point
is where Krista was taken.

489
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,643
At 45 miles per hour,

490
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,604
The farthest they could have gone
would be 31 1/2 miles.

491
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,622
Gwynn, our second victim...

492
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:14,653
was taken much farther out of town,
almost on the other side of the county.

493
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,947
Her adrenaline spikes
are 57 minutes apart.

494
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:20,543
Again,
factoring 45 miles per hour...

495
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:24,113
That's it.

496
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,123
That's our kill zone.

497
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,543
You're assuming he killed them both
in the same place.

498
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,759
They were using complex equipment.
It's not easy to move an operating room.

499
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:35,581
Much simpler to just bring the victims
to a specified location...

500
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:37,146
Someplace out of the way.

501
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:38,921
Like an old dairy farm?

502
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,748
Just ask him something
only he would know.

503
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:02,826
Hello, there.

504
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,603
It's Craig, right?

505
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,662
I don't know if you remember, but,

506
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:10,667
I think you were in choir
with my sister up at St. Andrew's.

507
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,209
Actually, I was at Good Shepherd.

508
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:15,798
- Good memory, though.
- Good Shepherd, that's right.

509
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,426
- So what can I do for you?
- Your old dairy farm up the hill.

510
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,027
Could there be people up there?

511
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,748
- People?
- Yeah, you get up there often?

512
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,726
Not much, since we shut it down.

513
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,686
Why?

514
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,297
We got 12 outbuildings...
The milking parlors,

515
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:37,653
- the barn, and the holding stalls.
- Those are all good places to hide.

516
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,921
That's a lot of ground to cover.

517
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:43,638
I'll go call backup
to help with the search.

518
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,131
- Need any help with the search?
- I think it's best if you stay here.

519
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,802
- Let me get you the keys.
- Sure.

520
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,793
Who are you? Where's Newton?

521
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,787
Peter, stop!

522
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,061
I couldn't stop.

523
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,513
The girls...
I wanted to be close to them.

524
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:48,807
I just couldn't stop.

525
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:50,195
Where is he?

526
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,935
Where's Ferguson?

527
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:54,021
What did you do to him?

528
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:30,878
He's still breathing. Thank God.

529
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:34,445
It's just ink.
There's no incision here.

530
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,620
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.

531
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,733
Stay with me, baby.
I'm here.

532
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:41,478
I'm here now.

533
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:42,966
I'm here, Bill.

534
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:59,294
- I don't know what to say.
- You saved Bill's life,

535
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,005
and you tracked a killer.
What else is there to say?

536
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:11,390
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

537
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,764
Whatever your experiences are,

538
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,897
whatever you
can't or won't tell me about...

539
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:25,284
I think you're looking
for meaning in things that...

540
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,838
have no meaning.

541
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,783
I don't know who I am anymore.

542
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,050
When I was in college...

543
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:47,456
My family was killed, murdered.

544
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:51,895
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:56,328
Sometimes I still think...

546
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,503
one day I might catch
whoever did it.

547
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:05,003
I was alone for a long time.

548
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:08,833
But I found my place.

549
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,609
You will too.

550
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,813
Once we isolate the glimmer,
we can find Peter.

551
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,731
Is the spectrograph ready,
Agent Farnsworth?

552
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,412
- Walter, you put in the wrong numbers.
- No, no, I believe they're correct.

553
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:02,078
No, they're not.

554
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,630
But, then, you know
that already, don't you?

555
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:10,451
I thought you wanted to find Peter.

556
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:13,312
What if he won't forgive me, Astrid?

557
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:16,187
All I have now is hope...

558
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:19,142
Hope that he will come to understand
why I did the things I did.

559
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,017
What if I find him,
and he won't forgive me?

560
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:23,642
What do I have then?

561
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:30,351
I found Peter.

562
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,088
- Where?
- He's in Washington state.

563
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:35,021
I'm heading to the airport now.

564
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:36,952
Would you like
to come with me, Walter?

565
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:46,265
I'll need to pack a bag.

566
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:48,594
Mr. Secretary.

567
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:05,822
Hello, son.
