<i>Color and sound check,
Milton/Staller wedding.</i>

2
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:21,471
<i>Linda, Neal.</i>

3
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:22,803
<i>Hi, Mr. Staller.</i>

4
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,110
- <i>Glad you could make it.</i>
- <i>Good to see you.</i>

5
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,925
<i>Take it easy, Nana.
There's no hurry.</i>

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>You take it easy.
This my regular speed.</i>

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,277
- <i>Everyone decent in here?</i>
- <i>Come on in, Mrs. Staller.</i>

8
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,044
Look who I brought, Shelley.

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,469
This is how David can see you
in your dress before the wedding

10
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,087
without the bad luck.

11
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:50,196
<i>You look stunning.</i>

12
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:53,391
<i>Thank you so much for...</i>

13
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:54,834
<i>everything.</i>

14
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,764
<i>I'm so happy
you're joining the family.</i>

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,261
<i>David is lucky to have you.</i>

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,445
<i>I'm crying now.
Let's not film this part.</i>

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,229
<i>No, no. Turn it off, turn it off.</i>

18
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,625
- <i>It'll calm him down.</i>
- <i>I didn't think I'd be this nervous.</i>

19
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,085
<i>Happens to everyone, even me.</i>

20
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:22,156
<i>And look how I turned out.</i>

21
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:41,545
Lynn...

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,396
Who is that man?

23
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,568
I don't know.
Must be from Shelley's side.

24
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,577
<i>Just breathe, man.
No, where's your inhaler?</i>

25
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,229
- <i>Where is it?</i>
- <i>It's here.</i>

26
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,828
<i>Harry, just give us a few minutes?
Sorry.</i>

27
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,682
<i>You're all right.
Just a couple minutes.</i>

28
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,798
<i>He's okay. He's okay.</i>

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,322
It's okay, it's okay.

30
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:22,319
I can safely say David
is not going to run.

31
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,596
So just everybody hang tight.

32
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,521
He'll be fine. He's just had
a little bit of a reaction...

33
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:29,147
It can't be.

34
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,819
It can't be.

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,238
- It can't be true.
- What's wrong, Nana?

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,506
It can't be.

37
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,785
- It's him.
- Nana, what are you talking about?

38
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:42,411
It's him.

39
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,446
You! You!

40
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,821
Nana, what's wrong?
Nana, my God, what is it?

41
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,559
Oh, my God.

42
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,967
Someone call 911.

43
00:02:58,405 --> 00:02:59,284
Josh!

44
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,605
Sweetheart!

45
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,559
My God!

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

51
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,979
Agent Dunham.

52
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,738
- Detective.
- Burt Manning. We spoke on the phone.

53
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:38,226
- So has anyone touched anything?
- ME is inside.

54
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,572
We put them in a holding
pattern until you got here.

55
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,907
It's pretty bad.

56
00:03:42,393 --> 00:03:44,281
Do we have a final count
on the victims?

57
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,808
14... so far.

58
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,476
I quite like weddings.

59
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,439
Did I ever tell you
about when your mother and I,

60
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,527
- God rest her soul, got married?
- I think I missed that one.

61
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,632
And try to stop driving
with both feet.

62
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,492
She was so beautiful, Peter.

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,943
So beautiful in white.

64
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:08,925
I won't deny I was never happier.

65
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,852
I kept my tuxedo

66
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:17,235
in the hope that one day
I would have a son who would wear it.

67
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,541
You could wear it
on your wedding day.

68
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,810
Yeah, you know, Walter?

69
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,678
- Tuxedo styles change.
- Nonsense.

70
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:28,111
Purple never goes out of style.

71
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:31,252
And the day may come
sooner than you think.

72
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,270
Do you think she'll call me Dad?

73
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:37,054
Who?

74
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:38,665
Agent Dunham.

75
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,503
My guess would be no.

76
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:45,457
Don't look at me like that.
She's just what you need.

77
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,993
Someone who can see
right through you.

78
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:51,141
Agent Dunham,
don't you look lovely today?

79
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,236
- Doesn't she look lovely, Peter?
- You look lovely, Agent Dunham.

80
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,476
Dr. Walter Bishop.
How do you do?

81
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,014
Lose a bet?

82
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,561
It was either that
or flying lessons.

83
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,272
Swelling of the vitreous humor.

84
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,735
Petechial hemorrhaging.

85
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,530
Yeah, not to mention the blue skin.
It's definitely asphyxiation.

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,306
The airway's clear.

87
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,091
Yeah, same here.

88
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,179
No fluid in the lungs.

89
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:37,628
So all the victims that I've identified
so far are on the groom's side.

90
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,798
I mean, maybe they came in contact
with something before the wedding.

91
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,719
Anaphylactic shock.

92
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:46,079
Maybe they're all having an allergic
reaction to something they ate or drank.

93
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:49,357
That would be logical, if they were
all exposed at the same time.

94
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,641
I'll have the detectives reconstruct
where they all were.

95
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,089
We may find a connection.

96
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,820
She was a Holocaust survivor.

97
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,435
That's dreadful...

98
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,057
to survive a thing like that...

99
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,793
and finish up like this.

100
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,134
Walter, do you think this could be
a deliberate attack?

101
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't know yet.

102
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,560
All I know for certain is that

103
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:33,642
these 14 people suffocated
in a room full of air.

104
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:37,912
There's gotta be something
they all ate or drank.

105
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:39,748
There, maybe that.

106
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:45,571
It's hard to believe that a few hour ago
this was actually a happy place.

107
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,685
Oh, my God!

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,512
We need a medic on the second floor!

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,518
All right.

110
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,016
He's dropped his inhaler.
Grab it.

111
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,493
It's curious. All 15 victims.

112
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,746
- So they're all blood relatives, then.
- Yes.

113
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,978
All of the victims are direct
descendants of Eva Staller.

114
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,168
Holocaust survivor.

115
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,995
And anyone not related
to her survived,

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,591
along with one grandchild
who I think might be illegitimate.

117
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,662
Therefore, not a blood relative,

118
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,100
or I suspect
he would have perished too.

119
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,169
Astrid, can you come here, dear?

120
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,107
What color is this?

121
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,275
The blood?

122
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,027
- It's blue.
- Good.

123
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,611
Then I'm not imagining it.

124
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,767
Something has bonded
with the hemoglobin in the blood,

125
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,577
changing its color
and robbing the body of oxygen.

126
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,319
I believe these people literally

127
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,819
suffocated from the inside out.

128
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,942
No, that might...

129
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:32,737
be what killed him.

130
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,839
No, that kept him alive
longer than the others.

131
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,144
I suspect it temporarily
weakened the toxin.

132
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,344
That still leaves the how.

133
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,797
How was the toxin delivered?

134
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,528
Mrs. Staller, I understand that you were
in charge of the guest list?

135
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:53,355
Did you notice anyone who shouldn't
have been at the wedding?

136
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,118
Someone who wasn't invited.

137
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,677
No. Of course, I don't know
the bride's entire family.

138
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,122
Although, my mother-in-law,

139
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,284
she was very upset
with someone before...

140
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,511
A man I had never seen before.

141
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,578
I thought she was just
having a moment.

142
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:13,362
If we showed you the video,
you would be able to point him out?

143
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,842
I could try.

144
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,348
It's jasmine.

145
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,437
Shelley picked out the scent.

146
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,681
Represents happiness and love.

147
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,860
Do you mind giving me a moment?

148
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,028
Of course.

149
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,364
I'll help you with the video.

150
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,901
Thank you.

151
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,967
She said all the rest of the candles
in this place are jasmine, right?

152
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,284
Smell that.

153
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,333
This one's cinnamon.

154
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,922
And?

155
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,145
Patience, son.

156
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,801
Like when you were a little boy,

157
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,565
your mother used to say
you had ants in your pants.

158
00:09:58,004 --> 00:09:59,476
Put that in the spectrometer.

159
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:12,277
That's the man
that Mrs. Staller identified.

160
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,239
- Can you make it clearer?
- I can try.

161
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,243
- That's the best I can do.
- All right.

162
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,634
Upload it to the joint law
enforcement database

163
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,370
and maybe we'll get a hit.

164
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,021
- All right.
- Walter.

165
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,953
Come here.
Take a look at this.

166
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,469
That is interesting.
You were right.

167
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,012
This is our toxin.

168
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,682
Appears to be a variant of...
What is that?

169
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,546
Hydrogen cyanide?

170
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:47,940
The candle would suggest
that it was activated by heat,

171
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,213
and then dispersed into the air.

172
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:53,110
If it was in the air, how come it
only killed some of the guests?

173
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,090
Good question.

174
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,197
What?

175
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,890
Chemical weapons.

176
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,882
Death by asphyxiation.

177
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:14,047
The Nazis.
I knew this was familiar.

178
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,592
- The Nazis?
- The Nazis were scientific pioneers.

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,452
They attempted to advance
every branch of science...

180
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,140
Molecular bombs,
flying saucers, eternal youth.

181
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,166
Before DNA was even discovered,

182
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,179
Josef Mengele
wanted to create a weapon

183
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:31,517
capable of targeting
specific victims,

184
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:33,411
a weapon capable of...

185
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,654
of picking people out in a crowd,
just like what happened here.

186
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:42,487
It seems that science may have finally
caught up with Nazi ambition.

187
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,822
Mrs. Staller was a Holocaust survivor.
Do you think that's...

188
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:48,551
Relevant?
I don't know, Olivia.

189
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,389
Of course, I'm not saying
that this is the work of the Nazis.

190
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:55,288
Nor suddenly am I convinced

191
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,382
that this was just a murder.

192
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,009
A wedding...

193
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:00,969
is the perfect laboratory.

194
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,763
You have your target group,

195
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,009
the Stallers,

196
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,642
and you have your control group,
everyone else.

197
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,536
Are you saying that you think
this was a science experiment?

198
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:10,687
It's a theory.

199
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,231
And one that I think I can prove.

200
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,201
How?

201
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,944
A scientist always tries
to recreate his results.

202
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,154
If I'm right,

203
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,340
this will happen again.

204
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,759
One soy latte, one orange juice,
two yogurts.

205
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:26,710
Say thank you, Jordan.

206
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:27,818
Thank you.

207
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,811
I'd like a cup of tea, please.

208
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,712
And make sure the water is very hot.

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,369
Sure thing.
What kind of tea?

210
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:40,384
I don't know... You pick.
Whichever is your favorite.

211
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:43,946
And please...

212
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,688
Make sure the water is very hot.

213
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,631
So do you like her?
Mrs. Greenwalt?

214
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:55,498
Yeah, she's nice.

215
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:58,477
But she always makes us
take a nap after lunch.

216
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,196
Well, maybe you need time
to get your energy back.

217
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,311
I think Mrs. Greenwalt
is the one who's sleepy.

218
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,876
She's very smart, your daughter.

219
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:08,711
Yeah, she is.

220
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,703
Soon you'll be outsmarting
the teachers.

221
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:15,460
Well, we're already there. We're talking
about skipping her up a grade.

222
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,337
Don't be in too much of a hurry.

223
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,074
These days are precious.

224
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,806
Soon all you will have...

225
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,898
are pictures.

226
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,820
That smells good. Is that cinnamon?

227
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:35,542
Something like that.

228
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,558
Nine victims.

229
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,702
Suffocated just like
the wedding in Brookline.

230
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,074
Except unlike the Stallers, none of
these people were related to each other.

231
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,875
Might have to rework
that hypothesis, Walter.

232
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,400
Maybe this toxin isn't
transmitted genetically.

233
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,879
It's just a theory, Peter.

234
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,516
Any surveillance?

235
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,471
No cameras inside or on the street.

236
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,905
Could be why our suspect
chose this place.

237
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,024
No candles, I suppose.

238
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,400
Not a single one.

239
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,728
Is there any other way
that this toxin could be delivered?

240
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,421
Any number of ways, I would think.

241
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:28,924
Simply requires

242
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:32,037
a heat source to disperse it
into the air.

243
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,502
- What about a cup of tea?
- Yes, thank you.

244
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,643
Yes, that would work.

245
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:46,301
As long as the water was hot enough.

246
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:48,720
Cinnamon.

247
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,347
I want this cup dusted
for prints immediately.

248
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:53,691
Yes, sir.
Right away.

249
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,394
Peter, can you help me?

250
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,523
That man there,
what color are his eyes?

251
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,368
Brown.

252
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,207
I was right after all.

253
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,456
It is a targeted toxin.

254
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,543
They all have brown eyes.

255
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,504
That's the common genetic trait.

256
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:24,647
Check the survivors,
but I'm sure I'm right.

257
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,383
It's a good thing you weren't here
at the time, or you would be dead too.

258
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,595
So first it was a family.

259
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,973
Now it's people with brown eyes.
Why is he targeting these people?

260
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,142
You said you think
it's an experiment.

261
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,221
So what... He's just killing
these people to prove that he can?

262
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:40,146
Perhaps.

263
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,013
I'm going to drive us
back to the lab.

264
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,164
I think I have an idea.

265
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,800
Why don't I drive?

266
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,707
An idea about what?

267
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,370
I don't know yet.

268
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:57,683
Excuse me, officer.

269
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,182
That man over there.

270
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:00,665
He's named Bischoff.

271
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,003
You mean Dr. Bishop.

272
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,673
Dr. Bishop.

273
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:09,050
- Did you need something?
- No, I'm just trying to place him.

274
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,637
He looks just like his father.

275
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,635
Is that the teacup?

276
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,508
But they could only pull
a partial print,

277
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,666
so no good to run
through any databases.

278
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,905
That's unfortunate.

279
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,699
But you are just in time.

280
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,075
Just in time for what?

281
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,619
Show and tell, apparently.

282
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:41,467
This is a molecular model
of the toxin.

283
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:44,606
This blue portion,
that's the deadly part.

284
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,379
This red part...

285
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,646
that's the targeted group.

286
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,635
In the first instance,
the Staller family...

287
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,339
And in this instance,

288
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,309
people with brown eyes.

289
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:59,626
Because he can program the toxin
to target whatever group he wants.

290
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,224
Any group with common
physical characteristics

291
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:04,619
or genetic similarities, yes.

292
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:07,711
Tall people, short people,

293
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,686
fat people, skinny people,

294
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,238
black people, brown people,

295
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,657
or white people...

296
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:15,533
We get it.

297
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:18,787
Anyway,

298
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,667
whoever created this
was apparently proud of his work.

299
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:24,876
Although I don't know
why he should be,

300
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,091
apart from the genetic targeting,

301
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,309
the toxin itself
is quite rudimentary.

302
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:31,758
It's a blend of chromium trioxide

303
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,719
- and hydrogen cyanide.
- Chromium trioxide?

304
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,282
That's highly regulated. If this guy
was buying it in any quantity...

305
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,357
- Astrid, can you...
- Dig up any companies

306
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,120
that deal with chromium trioxide.

307
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,903
So, Walter, what were you saying
about him being proud of his work?

308
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:47,997
See this?

309
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,069
That's a carbon chain.
It's inert.

310
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,857
It's the signature of the creator.

311
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:58,893
Some chemists spell out
their initials in molecules.

312
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,578
Others create a symbol.

313
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:03,498
Are you saying that we may be able
to identify whoever made this?

314
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,291
Yes, but this could be anybody's.

315
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,714
Well, it looks like a stylized "S",

316
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,519
- or a snake.
- Actually...

317
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,203
looks more like a sea horse to me.

318
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,116
A sea horse. I suppose it could...

319
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:23,309
What is it?

320
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,441
<i>Die seepferdchen.</i>

321
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:27,814
The sea horse.

322
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,079
I know who created this toxin.

323
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,852
Wait, Walter...
What's going on?

324
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,117
They called him "the sea horse"
because he was a great swimmer.

325
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,741
Okay, good for him.
But who is he?

326
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:43,606
My father.

327
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,946
Dr. Robert Bishop.

328
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,045
Wait, wait, your father?

329
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,740
I told you these
were Nazi experiments.

330
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,477
My father was a scientific pioneer

331
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,554
at the University of Berlin.

332
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,107
Yes, I know, who came here in 1933,

333
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:04,726
which is long before
the Nazis ever took power.

334
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,129
It was 1943.

335
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,398
Given the nature of his work,
I fudged the date a little.

336
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,194
What are you telling me?

337
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,905
- That my grandfather was a Nazi?
- Technically, yes.

338
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:18,936
Actually...

339
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,213
he worked as a spy for the Allies,

340
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,441
sabotaging German research and...

341
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,874
and smuggling scientific
information to the Americans.

342
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:28,844
I...

343
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,268
I knew I recognized the experiment.

344
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:36,357
I must have seen the formula
in one of my father's books.

345
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:37,666
Put this there.

346
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,193
Are you saying your father helped
develop the formula for this toxin?

347
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,308
It would seem so.

348
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,105
But of course, at the time,
it was just theoretical.

349
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,396
DNA itself was theoretical.

350
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,063
That formula has to be here
somewhere.

351
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:55,277
These are all of
my father's favorite books,

352
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,987
first editions
of Goethe, Thomas Mann...

353
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,780
And you're sure that all those notes
were hidden inside of German novels?

354
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:05,703
It was the only way he could smuggle
them out of Germany when he left.

355
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,975
You're not gonna find
those books in there.

356
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,375
They will be here.

357
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:13,829
- These are all the books in my library.
- No, they won't.

358
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,215
They're not in there.

359
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,144
I sold those books.

360
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:25,938
All of them.
About ten years ago.

361
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,980
You sold them.

362
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:33,932
Why?

363
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:38,454
I needed money.

364
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:39,996
Money?

365
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,645
They were my books.

366
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,841
He left them to me.

367
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,121
He knew how dangerous they were.

368
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,663
The odds this has anything
to do with your father's work...

369
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,977
The very thing
that he was trying to stop,

370
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:56,796
- you put back into the world.
- We don't know that for sure.

371
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,824
Yes, we do!

372
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,037
Of course we do.

373
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,471
How else would whoever is doing this
have gotten hold of the formula?

374
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,091
And because I failed to protect it,

375
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,272
my father's work is killing people.

376
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,300
So the killer is using a toxin

377
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:59,060
based on a formula created
by Dr. Bishop's father?

378
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,653
<i>Just another skeleton
in the Bishop family closet.</i>

379
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,338
It's in a book I sold.

380
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:07,713
So the formula is very complex.

381
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,502
We believe that the killer must
have found it in one of the books.

382
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:12,038
If we can trace the books,

383
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,782
<i>then hopefully we can find him.</i>

384
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:15,792
Then do it.
Quickly.

385
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:20,965
We'll find those books.

386
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,842
Come on, Bishop!

387
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,694
You sold me those books,
like, ten years ago.

388
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:30,518
How am I supposed to know
where they are now?

389
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:33,648
Because, Markham, you're exactly
the kind of fastidious packrat

390
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:36,145
who keeps a handwritten log
of every book he's ever sold.

391
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,833
Such a way with words.

392
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,996
How is it that a beautiful lady like you
is stuck with this guy?

393
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:43,079
It's my job.

394
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:45,672
I got plenty of books
on how to rethink your career.

395
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,032
"What color is your parachute?"

396
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,514
- "Do what you are..."
- That's thoughtful of you.

397
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,346
I really need you to find out
who it was who bought those books.

398
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:56,054
Whoever did may be in the midst
of a killing spree.

399
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:57,792
Sounds serious.

400
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:00,169
Give me a minute,
I'll see what I can find.

401
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:05,655
What?

402
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:09,198
You didn't really sell Walter's books
for money, did you?

403
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,502
Walter's got heaps
of valuable stuff.

404
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,199
Why did you just sell his books?

405
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:19,402
It was a long time ago.

406
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,734
Walter was still in St. Claire,

407
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,239
so I wasn't exactly very fond
of him at the time.

408
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,699
Those books were amongst
his favorite possessions.

409
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,519
And no, to answer your question,

410
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,059
I'm not proud of it.

411
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,836
They were sold last year.

412
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,945
The name I got is Eric Franko.

413
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,882
Lives over in Kendall Square.

414
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:48,213
He struck me as a real weirdo.

415
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:50,316
Coming from you,
that's saying something.

416
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:51,621
I owe you one.

417
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:33,675
Doesn't look like he's here.

418
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,906
Well...

419
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,790
why don't we just
poke around for a bit?

420
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,221
Freeze! FBI!
Get down on your knees.

421
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,963
Don't shoot me.

422
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,895
Please don't shoot me.

423
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:25,315
I'm not a Nazi.

424
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,936
I'm an artist.

425
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,528
It's about the banality of evil,

426
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,666
like the Nuremberg trials

427
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,788
showing history's tyrants
as these...

428
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,623
regular schmucks.

429
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:37,800
That's deep.

430
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,263
Where are the books
you bought from Markham?

431
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:41,438
The German novels.

432
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,541
The ones with all
the creepy stuff inside.

433
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:46,355
The <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
meets the,...

434
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:48,754
The evil Nazi experiment?

435
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,526
Well, you're looking at one of them.

436
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:00,766
So what do those books
have to do with the FBI?

437
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:02,636
It's a long story.

438
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,812
So none of these have
ever been displayed.

439
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,998
You're the only person
who's ever seen them.

440
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:10,438
Sadly, the contemporary
art scene has yet to...

441
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,718
fully recognize
my particular contributions.

442
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:16,751
I'd like to get these books back...

443
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:20,031
or what's left. I'll pay you
whatever you had to pay for them.

444
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:20,995
Sure...

445
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,886
It's gonna take me a while
to dig them all...

446
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:24,916
But...

447
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,500
you should also know

448
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,701
the...

449
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:29,992
collage is for sale.

450
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,255
Or I could donate it.

451
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,787
Your grandfather
was a fan of modern art.

452
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:46,459
But I don't think
he would have appreciated this.

453
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:49,232
I'm sorry, Walter.

454
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:51,251
Apology not accepted.

455
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:05,867
Of course, this means the perpetrator
didn't get the formula from the books.

456
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,748
We don't see how he could have.

457
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,724
Then how on Earth
did he recreate the formula

458
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,703
using my father's signature,
no less?

459
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:15,879
No match on
the killer's DNA, Walter.

460
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,301
Great.
More bad news.

461
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:19,745
Wait, I don't understand.

462
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,806
His DNA?
Where did you get his DNA?

463
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,010
Dr. Bishop was able to get some
from the partial fingerprints...

464
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,990
From the skin cells in the oil.

465
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:29,780
That's pretty amazing.

466
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:31,565
Not my best work, I'm afraid.

467
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,894
The telomere degradation
suggested that the man

468
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,821
was over a hundred years old,

469
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,584
which is fascinating,
but not a likely possibility.

470
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,641
You said this toxin could be programmed
to target any genetic trait, right?

471
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,789
Could it be programmed
to target more than one?

472
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,447
Say, green eyes and
brown hair at the same time?

473
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,253
- Yes, I suppose it could.
- What are you thinking?

474
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,043
<i>Das herrenvolk.</i>

475
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:56,315
The master race.

476
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:57,851
The Nazis' ultimate goal.

477
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,261
The purification of the German
people and the white race.

478
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,221
So Nazi science for a Nazi agenda.

479
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,915
All of Hitler's dreams
in one little toxin.

480
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,416
What are you doing there?

481
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,559
I'm conducting a test...

482
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,340
<i>to monitor the dispersion rate</i>
<i>of my experiment.</i>

483
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:41,735
Please...

484
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:43,995
you can watch.

485
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,794
- What are you doing to those rats?
- Killing them.

486
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:22,218
Well, hopefully only the white ones.

487
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,012
I thought you were
trying to block the toxin.

488
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,243
I am.

489
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:29,357
But I have to replicate it before
I can figure out how to stop it.

490
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,847
Astrid couldn't find any companies

491
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,731
that purchased chromium trioxide
within the past six months. But...

492
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,546
our EPA contact suggested
we search for sodium chromate?

493
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,499
Of course.
It's a sister compound.

494
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:44,615
You treat it with sulphuric acid,
you get chromium trioxide.

495
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,614
Okay, well, here are
three local buyers.

496
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:50,162
- Do you recognize any of them?
- Those two...

497
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,928
pharmaceutical companies.

498
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,407
This one I've never heard of.

499
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,381
Shipping address
is 3340 Eastham Road.

500
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,592
Newton, Mass?
That's a residential address.

501
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,096
Sir?
It's Dunham.

502
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,173
I think we have a location.

503
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,589
Are we clear, Agent Doble?

504
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:08,885
The air is safe.

505
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,695
<i>We're good!
All clear!</i>

506
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,650
Makes your lab look downright homey.

507
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,267
<i>Schwarzes haut,</i>

508
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,833
<i>braunes haut,</i>

509
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,379
<i>grune augen...</i>

510
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,423
Genetic traits.

511
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,990
Eye color,

512
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,308
hair color, skin tone...
It's the works.

513
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,568
Creating the master race
by process of elimination.

514
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:55,723
Guys?

515
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,590
I think I found something.

516
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,148
Looks like he was making
some kind of ID.

517
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,781
Walter, this is your sweater.

518
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,174
Get him out of here!
We need some help downstairs!

519
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:35,346
- We need that oxygen, now!
- Oxygen...

520
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,476
Breathe...
Just breathe, Walter.

521
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:42,645
Breathe. Breathe.

522
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,244
Walter, how are you feeling?

523
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,879
You got me out just in time.

524
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:10,211
I'd like my sweater back.

525
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:12,391
We'll work on that, Walter.

526
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,371
Why did he go after you?

527
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,763
I don't know.

528
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:20,557
Perhaps he knew my father
betrayed the Nazis.

529
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,144
Were you able to get
that photo to Broyles?

530
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:26,204
He's sending it out wide.

531
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:29,244
I also found this.

532
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,303
I know that logo.

533
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,334
I have to check
the contents of the box.

534
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,460
Of course.

535
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,643
All right, go ahead.

536
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:26,123
It's the annual World Tolerance
Conference at the Boston Center

537
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,368
<i>for Performing Arts.</i>

538
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:30,419
- Do you know who he's targeting?
- <i>No, with that spectrum of genetic</i>

539
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,354
markers, the target group
could be anybody.

540
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,084
- We need to evacuate the building.
<i>- I'll call the head of security.</i>

541
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,677
But there are any number of foreign
dignitaries, so we follow protocol.

542
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,940
- <i>That'll take time.</i>
- We may not have it.

543
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,387
There are many difficulties,

544
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:35,330
but we must continue
to confront discrimination

545
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:37,945
and uphold the rights
of the oppressed.

546
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,507
<i>The theme of this year's conference,</i>

547
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,782
<i>"Individual and Cultural Rights,"</i>

548
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:44,534
<i>was not chosen lightly.</i>

549
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,155
<i>This organization</i>
<i>has a proud tradition</i>

550
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,039
<i>of upholding both human rights</i>

551
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:51,060
<i>and cultural diversity.</i>

552
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:53,709
<i>Yet these goals, at times,</i>
<i>may appear difficult.</i>

553
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,644
<i>Together, we are committed</i>

554
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,709
<i>to the promotion of tolerance.</i>

555
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:08,088
Whenever you're ready, I'll...

556
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,522
take you home.

557
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,816
I want you to take me

558
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,007
to the Performing Arts center.

559
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,299
I can stop this.

560
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,367
We're looking for the man,
or the mechanism.

561
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,187
It's gonna be something hot.
A candle, a coffee urn...

562
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,462
So...

563
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:32,411
now, remember,
he could be anywhere...

564
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,853
on the floor,

565
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:35,961
on the balconies...

566
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,347
Anywhere.

567
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:46,565
Peter, there's a candle
on every table.

568
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,313
I know.
They've been burning for so long.

569
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:52,454
There's no victims. He must be using
something more potent.

570
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:58,947
Walter, the conference is this way.

571
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:00,620
No, Astrid.

572
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,666
We need to take the higher ground.

573
00:38:05,773 --> 00:38:07,710
<i>We are on the north west corner.</i>

574
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,744
- <i>I got nothing.</i>
- Nothing here, either.

575
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,109
Keep circulating.

576
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,308
<i>...a difference of values,</i>

577
00:38:13,522 --> 00:38:14,666
<i>of religions,</i>

578
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:16,585
and of lifestyles.

579
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,639
<i>We must take great care,</i>

580
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:22,437
<i>lest our advocacy become
its own form of oppression,</i>

581
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:24,301
<i>One that unjustifiably</i>

582
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,887
- <i>takes sides.</i>
- <i>Olivia, I'm in the bar.</i>

583
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,007
It could be anything back here.

584
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,221
Candles, coffee pots...

585
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:33,930
It's a disaster.

586
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:37,564
Hold on a second.

587
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:45,789
Let's hold off on those
for one second.

588
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:52,313
I think I got it.

589
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:56,747
We are united by a common...

590
00:38:58,742 --> 00:38:59,962
Where's the victim?

591
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,115
FBI. Everybody, move!
Please. Make room! Make room.

592
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,134
I said move! Get outta my way!
I need a paramedic!

593
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,773
Bischoff!

594
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:17,663
Traitor!

595
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,193
Dr. Bishop.

596
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,134
Yes, Agent Broyles?

597
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:47,303
- What you did tonight...
- Was...

598
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:51,191
to use the killer's DNA
to target him

599
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:53,769
and only him using his own toxin.

600
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,937
If you plan to press charges,

601
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,205
then so be it.

602
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,545
But I don't regret what I did.

603
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,524
Good night, Dr. Bishop.

604
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,469
That man...

605
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,693
He corrupted my father's work.

606
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:36,323
- I understand.
- No, no, it was more than that.

607
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,889
You see,

608
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:44,660
family is very important to me.

609
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,572
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

610
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,812
- What's this?
- It's a present.

611
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,641
Your father's work.
I had Franko give me everything

612
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,209
that wasn't totally destroyed.

613
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:45,327
Oh, look, Peter.

614
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:46,737
It's your grandfather.

615
00:41:56,777 --> 00:41:57,987
Robert Bischoff?

616
00:41:58,487 --> 00:41:59,870
That was his name.

617
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,935
He changed it
when he came over here.

618
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,873
Your mother always said

619
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:07,274
that you shared his noble brow.

620
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:10,444
It's a pity you never
got to know him.

621
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:14,126
You two would have gotten
along very well, I think.

622
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,066
You know, there is still one thing
that doesn't make any sense.

623
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:29,303
If the formula for the toxin didn't
come from your father's notes,

624
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:30,755
how did this guy get it?

625
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:38,771
Perhaps there are some mysteries
that are destined to remain unsolved.

626
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:43,268
Thank you for bringing these back.
