1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:03,044
- <i>Previously on Fringe.</i>
- A series of events has occured.

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,129
These events appear to be
scientific in nature.

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,965
- It's being referred to as the Pattern.
- He worked out of Harvard,

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,935
in an area called Fringe Science.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,345
You're telling me my father
was Dr. Frankenstein.

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,328
You were in an accident.

7
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:16,980
You were missing from your car
for at least an hour

8
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,148
before you came crashing back
through the windshield.

9
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,596
What if there's a part of my brain
that's trying to protect me?

10
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,295
- What's this?
- Sam Weiss.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,281
The man who helped
put me back together.

12
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:27,860
Have the headaches started yet?

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,445
They will.

14
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:31,314


15
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,681
None of that vanilla hazelnut crap.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,044
Normal coffee, all right?

17
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:46,940
I already called it in.

18
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,109
- Yes, Colonel?
- <i>It's time.</i>

19
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,688
<i>Get to Suburban Station.</i>

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,658
<i>He'll be wearing a black trench coat
and carrying a black briefcase.</i>

21
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,256
<i>Where are you, Gillespie?</i>

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,018
<i>Seriously, for the last time,
where are...</i>

23
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,878
Set the briefcase down now.

24
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,212
What's this about?

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,300
What did I do?

26
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,697
You give me the briefcase now.

27
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,430
- What's the problem?
- I got it under control.

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,774
Give me the case.

29
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,895
Stop! You can't do that!

30
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:24,896
You can't take that!

31
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:31,824
Officer, what's the matter?

32
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,871

36
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>Bon épisode...</i>

37
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,657
The rabbit goes around the tree
then through the hole.

38
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,567
I know how to tie my shoes.

39
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,361
Knowing how isn't the issue.
You suffered some wicked head trauma.

40
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:20,302
Don't think about your hands,
don't think about the laces.

41
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,326
Your shoes will get tied just fine.

42
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,037
Just by magic.

43
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,189
But that would be pretty cool.

44
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:31,893
What exactly did you do
for Nina Sharp?

45
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,758
I taught her
how to eat French fries.

46
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:41,720
Pick one up, dip it in the ketchup,
stick it in your mouth, repeat.

47
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,683
Simple enough, unless you've got
a cybernetic prosthetic arm.

48
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,893
Nina was a mess.

49
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,350
See, I prefer

50
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,668
the bunny ears method
to the one loop wrap.

51
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:57,151
But it does require
more coordination.

52
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:00,664
- You'll get there.
- Don't take this the wrong way, but...

53
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:03,033
- I can't waste my time.
- Are you sleeping at night?

54
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:07,672
You've got circles
around your eyes, pale skin...

55
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:12,245
You don't get more than two
or three hours at a stretch, do you?

56
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,464
Lingering pain from the accident?

57
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:21,844
In my leg and my shoulder.

58
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,930
And you say the headaches
haven't started yet?

59
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,410
Let me know when they do.

60
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,688
You can take the shoes off now,
we're done.

61
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,190
That's it?

62
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,401
Unless you want me to mop up
the men's room. I'm closing now.

63
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:44,389
Come back tomorrow, agent Dunham.
We've got work to do.

64
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,864
How about this one?

65
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,067
"Two bedroom, two bath loft
in Oak Square.

66
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:59,115
Cook's kitchen, hardwood floors,
and a breakfast nook."

67
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:00,677
Does it face the east?

68
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,997
Riverview, so it faces north.

69
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:05,383
Then it won't do.

70
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,222
I need the morning sun.

71
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:11,026
Fine, how about this?

72
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,388
"Three bedroom duplex
in Allston, facing east."

73
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,190
All the morning sun
a waking scientist could want.

74
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,788
I never liked Allston.

75
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,913
Arlington either, for that matter.

76
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,113
I'm perfectly happy
with our present accommodations.

77
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,724
Well, I'm not, Walter.
I need my own bedroom.

78
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:29,392
- I woke up this morning
- to him singing an aria from <i>Pagliacci.</i>

79
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:31,956
Your father has a wonderful voice.

80
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,082
Not when he's doing jumping jacks.
And did I mention he was naked?

81
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:37,670
A good morning
sets the tone for the day.

82
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,103
Come take a look at this.

83
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:43,676
I've been running a filter for atypical
FBI case reports. I just got a hit.

84
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,301
Some sort of bomb
went off in Philadelphia.

85
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,047
Single explosive device.
11 dead, 28 wounded.

86
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,016
This last part
is what caught my eye.

87
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:56,673
They can't find any explosive residue
at the scene.

88
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,651
How's a bomb go off without leaving
any trace of it afterwards?

89
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:02,770
Shall I get my coat, Peter?

90
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,978
I'll call Dunham.

91
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,764
Agent Farnsworth,
get my portable chemistry set.

92
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:13,229
This means bodies.

93
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,209
The bomb guys don't know what to make
of it. Given the nature of the wounds,

94
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,810
you'd expect an explosive device filled
with nails or steel ball bearings.

95
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,111
- But it wasn't.
- No. In fact...

96
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:24,883
there's no forensic markers at all.

97
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,902
- So what about eye witnesses?
- I've got half a dozen eye witnesses,

98
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,824
but nobody who saw anything helpful.

99
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,984
It's weird. This place has
major anti-terrorism security.

100
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:38,719
EMP disabling devices at every entrance,
explosive materials sensors...

101
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:41,483
We checked,
and not a single sensor is tripped.

102
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,528
So what did
the surveillance cameras show?

103
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,989
Nothing,
nothing but magnetic static.

104
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,783
It seems that whatever happened
in here wiped the images.

105
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,694
- Would you mind if we see those tapes?
- I'll see what I can do.

106
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,248
Let me guess, you got a friend?

107
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:57,960
Maybe I do.

108
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,728
Excuse me, sir?
Do you have a badge?

109
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,998
No, I don't have a badge. Do you?

110
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:04,256
I got it.

111
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,301
What's going on?

112
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:11,459
This rather unpleasant young woman
is interfering with my work.

113
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,514
Is he with you?

114
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,483
Yeah, but don't hold that
against me.

115
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:15,600
We're FBI.

116
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,269
Go ahead.

117
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
So? What is it?

118
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,667
Shrapnel, I believe, from the bomb.

119
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,276
Some sort of crystal.

120
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:28,444
Hard as a diamond.

121
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,285
Salty. Silica, I guess.

122
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,402
Well, I'll need to examine
the rest of the bodies, if...

123
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,324
If that's all right with you, miss.

124
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,334
Thank you.

125
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,011
I spoke with
our counter-terrorism analysts.

126
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,770
No one stepped forward
to claim responsibility.

127
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:23,271
And there's been no increase
in chatter from our usual suspects.

128
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,212
I found this wedged in a bench.

129
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,771
It's a badge.
Philly PD, officer Gillespie.

130
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,967
Were there any police among the wounded
taken to the hospital?

131
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:32,781
So, where'd he go?

132
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,587
I was wrong.

133
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,934
The crystal...

134
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,930
I think it's not geologic in origin,
after all.

135
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,446
In fact, I'm certain it's organic.

136
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:46,608
Is that...

137
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:48,142
an ear?

138
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:51,981
Well, I think Walter might have just
found officer Gillespie.

139
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,075


140
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:03,101
This looks like fungiform papillae.

141
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,420
Taste buds.

142
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:07,700
Tongue.

143
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:13,385
Walter, as much as I am enjoying
this anatomy lesson,

144
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,742
what exactly are we doing here?

145
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,745
Well, that's obvious, my dear.

146
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,956
We're searching for clues.

147
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:23,337
Scientific evidence to reveal

148
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,259
what type of device
this man was wearing

149
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:29,902
which caused him to harden,
then shatter.

150
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,909
I understand Peter's looking for
a new place for you guys to live.

151
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:46,083
It occurs to me, that I've never
asked you where you live.

152
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,023
Where I live?

153
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:49,502
Diaphragm.

154
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,152
Well...

155
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:53,479
most of the time I live here.

156
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,178
But my apartment is in Sommerville.

157
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,934
You should go for a walk sometime...

158
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,004
explore the neighborhood.

159
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,648
The other day, I...

160
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,068
turned the wrong way in the street,

161
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,681
and discovered that Busby's...

162
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:11,068
has the world's best apple fritters.

163
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,036
You see,

164
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,577
I have everything I need
where we live now.

165
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,993
I know what you mean, Walter.

166
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,686
I'm a creature of habit, too.

167
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,663
Of course,

168
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,097
you never would've found
Busby's apple fritters

169
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,421
if you hadn't gone
the wrong way down a street.

170
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,820
You really should try them,
they're quite delicious.

171
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,222
Brain.

172
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:37,896
Okay, that's it.
That's the best I can do.

173
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,197
That must be Gillespie.

174
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,525
But I don't see a bomb.

175
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,861
Then it cuts out.

176
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,704
You know, I told her
you were a genius, Joe.

177
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,018
Don't prove me wrong.

178
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,193
Then you're gonna need
a smarter genius.

179
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,738
Do you have any idea
how something like this could happen?

180
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,559
The static? No.
Maybe radio wave interference.

181
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,620
Certain high frequencies
can tweak electronic signals.

182
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,997
Look at the time code.

183
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,748
That's about 20 seconds
before the bomb went off.

184
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:11,795
So why do we lose picture
before the explosion?

185
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,558
How's it going, Walter?
Any theories?

186
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:18,898
Several.

187
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,596
Peter, do you remember
that jigsaw puzzle

188
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,434
we put together when you were a kid?

189
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,190
The jigsaw? No.

190
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:30,150
As I recall, her name was Melissa...

191
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,588
something.

192
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:33,874
500 pieces.

193
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,447
Yes, I do remember.
Melissa was a playmate.

194
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,990
Miss July, right?
Putting together a jigsaw

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,867
of a nude centerfold was
Walter's idea of how to explain...

196
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:46,645
What was it? Human reproduction
to his ten-year-old son.

197
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,931
So what does any of that have to do

198
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,005
- with the bomb in Philadelphia?
- Patience, son.

199
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,308
Meet Officer Gillespie.

200
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,663
Fantastic.

201
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,793
So apart from the obvious,

202
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,434
anything out of the ordinary?

203
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,633
Needle marks between the toes.

204
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,203
It was some form of transformative
serum, I would think.

205
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:15,910
I can't say what yet.

206
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,338
From his tissues,
it appears to cause

207
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:20,624
a chemical reaction
on the cellular level

208
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,990
that both solidifies the water
in his cells

209
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,870
and emitted massive energy,
which shattered the body.

210
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,669
What are you saying, Walter?
You think he did this to himself?

211
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,883
On purpose?

212
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:34,454
Well, I stopped counting
at 47 needle marks.

213
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:37,130
I can't imagine it was an accident.

214
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,324
When you think about it...

215
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:42,719
wearing a bomb
is rather unimaginative.

216
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,441
This way, there's no need to smuggle
in an explosive device, because...

217
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,141
Officer Gillespie was the bomb.

218
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,882
Fascinating, yes?

219
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,481
We were planning to start a family.

220
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,998
I can't believe
he's not coming home.

221
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,938
Dan always came home.

222
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,958
After every shift on the job,
two tours in Iraq,

223
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,587
he always came home.

224
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:11,252
No one would tell me what happened.

225
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:15,836
Just that it was...
some kind of bomb.

226
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,503
We're still investigating.

227
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,572
I'm so sorry.

228
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,591
Where was he stationed?

229
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,902
In Ramadi.

230
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:26,721
Did you serve?

231
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,237
No, a civilian contractor,
based out of Baghdad.

232
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:31,979
But from what I remember,
there was heavy fighting in Ramadi.

233
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,812
Was he on any medication,

234
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,547
or under any sort of medical care?

235
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,942
No, Dan was healthy.

236
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:42,612
And I don't understand, what does
this have to do with the explosion?

237
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,225
You all right, Dunham?

238
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,672
Excuse me, do you have
a bathroom that I could use?

239
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,201
Yeah, it's down the hall.

240
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,904
Dunham, you all right?

241
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:13,819
Mrs. Gillespie, can you tell me
what these are?

242
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:16,993
I don't know.

243
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,768
I've never seen them before.

244
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,742
Dan Gillespie doesn't fit
the profile of a suicide bomber.

245
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:27,801
Well, how do you explain this stuff?

246
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,280
'Cause I'm assuming it's more
than likely that this is exactly

247
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:33,400
what Walter was talking about.
What turned him into a bomb.

248
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,573
Yeah, well, I can't yet.

249
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,086
But I mean, what makes
someone blow themselves up?

250
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,157
Typically, they're either
waging a war,

251
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,287
or making a statement.

252
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,716
Dan Gillespie was
a decorated cop and soldier, just...

253
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,610
getting himself back together.

254
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,577
- It doesn't make sense.
- Is there anything else on your mind?

255
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:55,639
Like what?

256
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,239
The headache.

257
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,807
Didn't the doctor
say that would happen?

258
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,345
They said they might.

259
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,491
That it was totally normal.

260
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,884
We should get that back to Walter.

261
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:11,533
Maybe he can figure out
where those vials came from.

262
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,085


263
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,165
Let me help you with that.

264
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:36,704
Colonel.

265
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,426
We need to talk,

266
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:39,943
captain Burgess.

267
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,812
I'm calling you
back to active status.

268
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,742
You're going to DC on Friday.

269
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:49,067
Hotel reservations, plane tickets,
all-self-explanatory.

270
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:52,534
Now that phone,
keep it with you at all times.

271
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,363
Check in with the hotel,

272
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,741
wait for me to call you
with further instructions.

273
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,994
Do you have a cover story
prepared for your family?

274
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,034
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,915
I'll say I'm visiting my sister.
She lives in Georgetown.

276
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,973
Have you been taking the serum?

277
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,616
- Yes, sir.
- Good, because from this moment on,

278
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,941
Tin Man parameters are in effect.

279
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,901
So, how'd you know?

280
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,207
The headaches started.

281
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,432
Well, it's about time.

282
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:40,434
Can you just cut the Yoda crap
and tell me what's happening to me?

283
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,272
The short version...

284
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,146
The headaches mean
you've finally sparked the battery.

285
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,177
You've been experiencing...

286
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:55,058
an acute nominal aphasia,
Agent Dunham.

287
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,216
It's common with head trauma.

288
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,596
Parts of your brain
are still asleep.

289
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,682
But once they wake up,
all that memory will get flushed out.

290
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,669
When?

291
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:06,478
When?
When will I get my memory back?

292
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,444
You know, everywhere you go

293
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,792
the scoring apparatuses
have changed.

294
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,156
Computers, no fun.

295
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,964
Here, we do things old school,

296
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:23,036
with a dull pencil and
all your third grade math skills.

297
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,661
You know, this is ridiculous.
I'm not bowling, I can't even walk

298
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,178
without this damn cane.

299
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,148
You're not bowling.
I've got a kid's league coming in here,

300
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,463
you're gonna keep score.

301
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,425
How is that gonna help my memory?

302
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,423
I mean, how is that
gonna help me at all?

303
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,118
Well, for starters,

304
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,097
it might teach you some patience.

305
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:46,684
Is that food I smell?

306
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,025
Bless you!

307
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,902
While examining Officer Gillespie,
I've discovered something else.

308
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,120
Given the amount of serum
that we found in his tissue,

309
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:01,511
and the rate at which
it would've metabolized,

310
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:03,778
I suspect that
he would've had to inject it

311
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,370
every day for a very long time.

312
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,605
Well, how long?

313
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,547
At least a year, I would think.

314
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,427
A year?

315
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,505
That would mean Gillespie
started injecting

316
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,421
while he was still
on his tour in Iraq.

317
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,581
Did his army personnel file
come through yet?

318
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,566
I haven't seen it.
Let me check though.

319
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:21,498
Interestingly...

320
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,253
When the serum is
first introduced or injected,

321
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:26,928
it's fairly harmless.

322
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:30,397
But then something else occurs,
a secondary reaction.

323
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:33,057
Some sort of trigger

324
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,943
causes these bombs to blast apart.

325
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,463
The triggers...

326
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,673
If you are going to eat
that cheeseburger in here,

327
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,023
could you at least
be a little discreet?

328
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,717
Fine.
This trigger,

329
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,690
could it be a radio wave?

330
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,998
There was some sort of interference
on the security tapes

331
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:09,684
inside the train station.
Most likely caused by radio waves.

332
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,401
Yes. I suppose so.

333
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,566
I've got Gillespie's military file.

334
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,257
What's cyanogen chloride?

335
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:19,819
It's a chemical weapon.

336
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:26,207
His whole unit was
exposed to cyanogen.

337
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,037
According to this file,
Gillespie should've died in Iraq.

338
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:33,833
Four words that should
never show up in a sentence.

339
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,610
"Classified experimental
military project."

340
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:39,354
How much you wanna bet that
Tin Man has everything to do

341
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,590
with those injections
that Gillespie was taking?

342
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,010
It says here
that Project Tin Man was shut down.

343
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,828
Shortly after Dan Gillespie
returned home.

344
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:49,244
And all the names of
the U.S. military personnel

345
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,796
associated with the project
were redacted from the record.

346
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:55,304
But it still lists Malik Yusef,
Abbas Khalef, and Howard Ziad

347
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,983
as Iraqi doctors
who worked on the program.

348
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,952
- Where are they?
- Presumably still in the country.

349
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,779
CENTCOM has agreed to look for them,

350
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,538
but it may take a few weeks
to track anything down.

351
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:07,263
I may be able to help.

352
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,286
But I'm gonna need
a few things first.

353
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:13,523
I need to go back to Iraq.

354
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,334
I know somebody who can
help us find those doctors.

355
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,978
Seems a long way to go for a maybe.

356
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:22,503
W have to assume that Gillespie
was not a solitary event.

357
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,995
There may be others
out there like him, walking bombs.

358
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,680
- We don't have two weeks to wait.
- What is it you need?

359
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,493
Private air transportation,
$20,000 in cash,

360
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,268
and a passport without
my real name on it.

361
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,142
I'm still on
a couple of watch lists.

362
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:40,617
Then you're gonna need
a federal agent with you as well.

363
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:47,187
I'm reluctant to send you,
Agent Dunham.

364
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,868
With that said, we need
to keep this trip between us.

365
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
You look after each other.

366
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,671
You ready for this?

367
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:06,931
Baghdad, here we come.

368
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,822


369
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,751
Maybe I should wait outside.

370
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,042
Then what would I do?

371
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,798
You're the one with the gun.

372
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,203
Assalam waleikum.

373
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:08,071


374
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,204


375
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,575


376
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:21,084


377
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,074


378
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,848
In that case, we speak English.

379
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,560
I need your help, Ahmed.

380
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,772
A US military program named Tin Man.

381
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,690
It's operating out of a hospital
in Samarra.

382
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,162
I need to find
one of the Iraqi doctors

383
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,320
who was working in that program.

384
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,782
I can pay you, of course.

385
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:55,320
When I heard you had been killed,

386
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,445
I knew this could not be true.

387
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,909
Because a person like you
is good at one thing.

388
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,294
More than anything else,
a person like you

389
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,338
is good at looking out for yourself.

390
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:12,067
Now you are here...

391
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:14,571
asking for my help?

392
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,391
Yes, I am.

393
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,109
Maybe someone else
will want your money.

394
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:22,895
I don't.

395
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,818
A lot of innocent lives
may be on the line.

396
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:32,991
I see.

397
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:36,409
And this is something
you care about now?

398
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:38,353
Yes, I do.

399
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,005
I may be able to save them...

400
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,625
with your help.

401
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:58,181
What are the names of these doctors?

402
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,153
Have some tea.

403
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:17,068
I will see what I can do.

404
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,159
You gonna tell me
what that was about?

405
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:39,577
What did I tell you
about experimenting with fruit?

406
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,898
I just cleaned
this lab up yesterday.

407
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,273
Relax, my dear.

408
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,927
Just injecting a very small amount
of the serum into the watermelon.

409
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,111
Just to crystallize it.

410
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,564
The serum we found
at Gillespie's house told us

411
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:55,884
how he became a bomb. But...

412
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:57,810
the question remains,

413
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,214
what triggered it?

414
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:03,814
So you're using radio waves
like Peter suggested?

415
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,834
Radio waves would also explain

416
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,350
the eyewitness reports
of flashing lights at the train station

417
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,196
before the officer exploded.

418
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:17,124
Quite ingenious, really.

419
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,778
The same principal
applied to proximity fuses,

420
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,548
and World War II arial bombs...

421
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:28,347
In fact,

422
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,300
my uncle Henry was killed by one
in the battle of the Guadalcanal.

423
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,371
This is it!

424
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,200
- Quickly, what's the frequency?
- 331.6 megahertz.

425
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:44,370
What happened?

426
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,880
It stopped.

427
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,375
I'm not sure.

428
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,146
It works.

429
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,969
No more fruit, Walter.

430
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,033
Ready for something
a little harder than tea?

431
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:05,958
Sure.

432
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:10,893


433
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,360
Red Russian?

434
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,449
- Mint tea and vodka.
- Well, it sounds weird and awful.

435
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,022
Actually, it's worse.

436
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,042
- You'll get used to it.
- How long were you here?

437
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,580
Which time?

438
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,699
I had to leave a couple of times.

439
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:38,215
Seems like you made
a name for yourself.

440
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,760
I've been known
to leave an impression.

441
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:46,140
To all that's weird.

442
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,544
Doctor Malik Yusef...

443
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,632



444
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:26,555
{\We understand you worked


445
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:31,547


446
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,722


447
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,096


448
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,902
They consider me a traitor.

449
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,794
We were hoping
to ask you some questions

450
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,991
about a program that you worked on.

451
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,035
A program called Tin Man?

452
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,331
I do not know anything about this.

453
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,435



454
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,058
The program didn't work,
it was too dangerous.

455
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,597
The soldiers had been exposed
to a synthetic neurotoxin,

456
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:14,296
a nerve agent
developed under Saddam.

457
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:15,354
Cyanogen?

458
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,715
We had been trying to find
a way to neutralize it

459
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,527
to counteract the affects.

460
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,487
And that's what they called Tin Man?

461
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:25,428
We had developed a...

462
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:26,991
a treatment.

463
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,059
Daily injections of a serum.

464
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,520
We treated over 200 soldiers.

465
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,664
Only a few of them survived.

466
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,001
We know of one, Daniel Gillespie.

467
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,111
Daniel, kind man.

468
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,671
Over the course of the program,
there were three others.

469
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:47,373
- Do you remember their names?
- Of course, I saved their lives.

470
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,527
There was Joan Klump,
Ross Cavanaugh, and...

471
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:52,135
Diane Burgess.

472
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,465
Okay, Diane, you're all set.
Suitcase is at the front door.

473
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,690
You sure you don't want me
to drive you to the airport?

474
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,276
But it was too dangerous.

475
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,726
The serum had
an unintentional byproduct.

476
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:09,630
We had discovered that after it

477
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,505
built up in human tissue,

478
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,663
It reacted in a very unexpected way.

479
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,332
It turned people into bombs.

480
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,310
How did you know that?

481
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,007
Doctor Yusef, how many other people
knew about this?

482
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,557
Five doctors,
a dozen U.S. officers, and...

483
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:31,472
whoever they reported to, I suppose.

484
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,138
Someone is triggering these people
to explode. It could be anyone.

485
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,752
There was a man, a colonel.

486
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:41,398
When the program was shut down,
he argued it should be continued.

487
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,816
Do you remember his name?

488
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,543
Gordon...

489
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:47,432
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

490
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,330
A word of warning...

491
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:55,352
Gordon is a vicious man.

492
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:57,843
He has no regard for human life.

493
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:02,753


494
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,256
You all have briefing packets,
so I'll just point out the highlights.

495
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,133
Information has come to this agency

496
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,730
that a bomb may be detonated
today somewhere in this city.

497
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,972
But in this instance,
that bomb is a human being.

498
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,495
Three of the four known operatives of
Project Tin Man have been accounted for.

499
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,993
Daniel Gillespie, you're all
familiar with. Two others

500
00:32:19,118 --> 00:32:22,022
have been taken into protective
custody. Which leaves Diane Burgess.

501
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,526
We believe Captain Burgess traveled
to DC this morning, under an alias.

502
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,968
Though we do not have any intelligence
on her potential target.

503
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:32,100
A bolo has been issued to all metro
and state police in the area.

504
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:35,277
All potential high-value targets
are under close surveillance.

505
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:38,747
Agent Dunham and I will coordinate
Captain Burgess' apprehension.

506
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,026
Based on our investigation,

507
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,558
it's likely there
is a second suspect

508
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:46,533
controlling detonation
from a remote location.

509
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,842
We believe it's this man,
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

510
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,304
The Pentagon lost contact
with Colonel Gordon six months ago.

511
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,854
He's off the grid.

512
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,766
Officially designated
a rogue operative.

513
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,019
Now based on Dr. Bishop's analysis,

514
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,898
the explosion is triggered
by a specific VHF frequency.

515
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,359
Now if we can locate Captain Burgess
in time to get within range,

516
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,446
we may be able to jam the signal
and prevent her detonation.

517
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,495
On that point, we suspect
that Diane Burgess

518
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,243
is unaware she is being used
in a suicide bombing.

519
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,524
Which means that she is also
a potential victim here.

520
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,807
We're gonna do
everything that we can

521
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,373
to get her back to her family alive.

522
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:28,035
Diane Burgess has just been located.
She's in a D.C. metro cab.

523
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,974
Dispatchers say she's headed
to the Federal Center Metro Station.

524
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,255
We have time to set up
before she arrives.

525
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,962
Our objectives are as follows:

526
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:37,332
To prevent the detonation
of Captain Diane Burgess

527
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:39,639
and to apprehend
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

528
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:43,342
This is Broyles, go ahead.

529
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:46,136
<i>Video surveillance and
3-D triangulation model online.</i>

530
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,641
Stand by,
we'll wait for Diane Burgess.

531
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:58,238
Snipers ready.

532
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,414
Target sited, arriving at
Federal Center Station, south portal.

533
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,761
The phone's encrypted, sir.
We can't tap into it.

534
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:24,057
<i>There's no sign of the colonel
outside of the station.</i>

535
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:26,132
Copy that, keep an eye on it.

536
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,731
Where are we on that signal?

537
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,943
Attempting to acquire
signal 331.6 megahertz.

538
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,526
Excuse me, Agent Broyles...

539
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,236
Is there an EMP detection device
in this station?

540
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:42,191
All capitol transportation hubs
had them installed after 9/11.

541
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,081
- What's the problem?
- No problem.

542
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:48,191
It's just that the security device

543
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:51,918
would scramble all types
of radio wave triggers.

544
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,097
- That sounds to me like a good thing.
- Frequency acquired.

545
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:56,593
Jamming. Ready.

546
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,561
Prepare to jam the signal.

547
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,928
- Stand by to apprehend target.
- I'm thinking that if the colonel

548
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:05,519
wants Ms. Burgess inside the building.
Then in order to trigger the explosion,

549
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,203
he must be inside as well.

550
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:10,773
Which means we should
be able to triangulate his position.

551
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,746
But in order to do that, we would have
to leave the frequency open.

552
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:14,892
We can't jam it.

553
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,574
This could be our only chance
to find Gordon and apprehend him.

554
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,992
<i>Target's about to enter the station.</i>

555
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:25,413
<i>Do we move, sir?</i>

556
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:28,542
I said stand by.

557
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:31,792
How long from when he activates
the signal until she detonates?

558
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:33,756
30 seconds, at best.

559
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,270
That should give us long enough
to be able to locate him.

560
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,393
All units hold position.

561
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,215
<i>Let the target
get into the building.</i>

562
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:42,774
Go.

563
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,494
<i>Your contact will be wearing
a black trench coat.</i>

564
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,241
<i>I have a briefcase for you.</i>

565
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,188
<i>Accept the briefcase</i>

566
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:05,539
<i>and proceed by taxi
back to your hotel.</i>

567
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,699
- Is that it, sir?
- <i>That's it, Captain.</i>

568
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,124
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

569
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,125
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

570
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:21,150
<i>Diane Burgess should be standing
near the northwest side of the terminal.</i>

571
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:23,918
<i>We're still waiting for Gordon
to activate the VHF signal.</i>

572
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:32,188
I got her.
She's by the front entrance.

573
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,526
Keep an eye on her.

574
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,311
Do we have anything from Gordon yet?

575
00:36:35,436 --> 00:36:37,183
The signal hasn't
been activated yet, sir.

576
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:48,080
She's on the move.

577
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,665
<i>Still no sign of Gordon.</i>

578
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,793
That's it. That's the VHF signal.

579
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,587
- She'll detonate in 30 seconds.
- Agent, tell me where Gordon is.

580
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:00,951
Something's wrong. Sir, the signal's
scrambling our equipment.

581
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:02,928
- I can't get a lock on Gordon.
- Smart.

582
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,942
<i>The signal is scrambling
our equipment.</i>

583
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,683
I think you have something for me.

584
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,018
One Mississippi...

585
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,227
Two Mississippi...

586
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:12,646
30 seconds.

587
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,107
I don't know
what you're talking about.

588
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,274
We've got her speaking to a man
with a briefcase.

589
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,945
<i>It is not Gordon.
Can you get a lock on the signal?</i>

590
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,164
- We can't get a lock.
- Then jam that signal.

591
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:25,268
<i>We're jamming the signal, I'm not
risking these lives to get Gordon.</i>

592
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,951
Sir, it's not working.

593
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,643
The signal's too strong
for our equipment. I'm locked out.

594
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,130
We have a problem.

595
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,417
<i>Attempts to jam the signal have failed.
She's going to detonate.</i>

596
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,662


597
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:38,464
We have a problem.
The signal cannot be jammed.

598
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,116
<i>I repeat, the signal...</i>

599
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,368
<i>Peter, I think we lost radio contact.
We need to find Gordon.</i>.

600
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:44,428
Copy that.

601
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,057
<i>The trigger's been activated,
we don't have much time.</i>

602
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,024
I don't know who you are.

603
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:52,822
My God!

604
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:01,986
I spotted Gordon.
I'm taking him out.

605
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,424
Twenty-four Mississippi.

606
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,051
Twenty-five Mississippi.

607
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,483
Twenty-six Mississippi.

608
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:41,947
We're back online.
The signal has stopped.

609
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,229
All agents, move in.

610
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:40,288
What's this?

611
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:41,413
An apartment.

612
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,484
Two bedroom, semi-detached.

613
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,696
Furnished housing for professors.

614
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,571
It's a nice neighborhood.

615
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,236
Down the block from
where Belly used to live.

616
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:57,321
I'll call Broyles,

617
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:59,062
see if we can lease it.

618
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,082
Okay, seven and a quarter inches.

619
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:12,561
Why "hmm"?

620
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:15,287
I think your hand just seems
smaller to me.

621
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:17,146
Okay, we're good.

622
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:19,291
We're good, what does that mean?

623
00:40:20,027 --> 00:40:22,160
It means that's all for tonight.
Go home.

624
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:25,130
I just got here.

625
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,175
I know, but I'm tired.
It's been a long day.

626
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,695
You look like you could
use some sleep yourself.

627
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:35,672
Come back tomorrow. By then I'll have
found you the perfect bowling ball.

628
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,563
You listen to me you son of a bitch.

629
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,676
I am not here to bowl,
or to try on shoes,

630
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,579
or to have you play games
with my head.

631
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,357
I am here because I was told
that you could fix me.

632
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:03,101
Take care, agent Dunham.

633
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:14,144
Meanwhile, we go
through our lives unaware.

634
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:15,994
The enemy is among us

635
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:18,345
and nobody's doing
anything about it.

636
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,093
We don't have any idea
the end is coming.

637
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,523
So we had to take matters
into our own hands.

638
00:41:25,604 --> 00:41:27,604
We had to send them a message.

639
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,279
What was in the briefcase?

640
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:37,898
They told you I was crazy,
didn't they?

641
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,577
The Pentagon.

642
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,792
They said I'd had
a psychiatric break.

643
00:41:44,954 --> 00:41:47,260
I told them what I'm telling you.

644
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:49,064
That they are here.

645
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,927
Collecting data.

646
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:53,340
Making observations.

647
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:58,430
That's what's in the briefcase.

648
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:01,506
They've been planning for war.

649
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:06,581
And they've been passing
the information via courier

650
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,575
right under our noses.

651
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:18,075
Who are "they"?

652
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:21,006
We don't know who they are.

653
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:24,515
But I can tell you what they want.

654
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,351
They want to exterminate us.

655
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,200
So they're studying us...

656
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:33,884
Our culture, our technology,
our science...

657
00:42:34,397 --> 00:42:37,136
and they plan to use it against us.

658
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:39,697
One way or another.

659
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,142
We'll find out who they are.

660
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:45,209
But by then,

661
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:48,019
I suppose it won't really matter.

662
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:51,280
Because whatever is in those cases

663
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:53,650
is going to destroy us all.

664
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,067
À la semaine prochaine !
