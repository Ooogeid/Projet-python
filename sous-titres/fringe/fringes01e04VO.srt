1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,330
Previously on Fringe

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,400
Olivia Dunham FBI

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,510
They call him an event of pattern, as someone out there experiments

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,800
the whole world as their lab

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,240
Anybody you meet could have... 

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,830
- His name is Dr. Walter Bishop.  - My father.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,540
He worked out of Harvard, 

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,290
He was part of a classified U.S. army experimental program

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,650
which was primarily in an area called Fringe Science.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,420
You are telling me My father was Dr. Frankenstein

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,000
So much happened here. And so much is about to.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,500
Can I get you some coffee?

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,760
Roast beef sandwich on a roll.

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,100
Meat raw as possible.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,830
Room temperature water.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,200
- No ice.  - Gotcha.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,430
- Do you have jalapenos?  - I think he does.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,600
11 of those, please.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,600
On the side.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,430
11. You got it.

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,200
What is that?

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,260
That language, is that, like, Korean or something?

23
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,330
No.

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,060
Good. I had Asian studies at CUNY.

25
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,130
Thought I really missed something.

26
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,330
What is that? What is that?

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
What the hell is that?

29
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,730
- Help!  - Watch out!

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,300
Move. Move now! Right now.

31
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,430
Move, move, it's gonna hit us!

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,430
Watch out! It's coming...

33
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,260
150 grams

34
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,360
of sucrose,

35
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,400
maintained at 70 degrees Fahrenheit

36
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,100
for 120 hours.

37
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
30 milliliters at 80 degrees...

38
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,760
What formula are you rattling off

39
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,860
at 3:00 in the morning?

40
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460
The formula for root beer.

41
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,630
Root beer.

42
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,160
That's what's so important

43
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,230
you couldn't stop yourself from broadcasting.

44
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,360
I haven't had it for ages.

45
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,000
I... I thought I might make some in the lab tomorrow.

46
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,330
Where are you going?

47
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,260
It occurs to me it might be easier

48
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,560
to sleep in the tub.

49
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,830
A root beer float. Delicious.

50
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,960
Next time, would you please drain the tub?

51
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,830
Oh, yes. Indeed.

52
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,260
I know how to get there.

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
I need you to slow down.

54
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,360
Her office is right up here.

55
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,730
I've been there before.

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Sir, you don't have clearance to walk here unescorted.

57
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,800
- Peter.  - We need to talk.

58
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,330
Is that okay with you?

59
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,730
Do I have clearance to talk to her?

60
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
It's okay. I got it.

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,330
Come with me.

62
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Where is your father?

63
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,100
Walter is at the hotel.

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,430
But don't worry, your agents are standing guard.

65
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,560
not that it matters, because the man is unconscious.

66
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,200
He was awake till 5:00 in the morning,

67
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,730
reciting the chemical compositions

68
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,930
of his favorite beverages to me.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,530
That was right after he finished lecturing me

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
on how I'd squandered my above-average intellect

71
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,100
and my substantial education,

72
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,860
or while he was standing there naked, because he preferred the breeze

73
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,300
I can't spend another moment under the same roof as that man.

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,830
well, your living arrangements are temporary.

75
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,260
We're finding you an apartment so that...

76
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,500
Olivia, don't bother.

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,130
I wanted to help. I felt bad.

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,730
I still feel bad about what happened to you.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,500
But the truth is, you don't need me here.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,960
- That isn't the truth.  - It is.

81
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,600
Things are happening here.

82
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,430
Strange things that need investigating,

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,360
that connect somehow to the insane work

84
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,800
that Walter was doing way back when,

85
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,160
but he's the one with the answers.

86
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,900
you need him. I'm just a babysitter.

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,760
Peter, you decipher what he says.

88
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,700
Things that other people can't even follow.

89
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
No, not any more.

90
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,100
Anybody can do that.

91
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,330
There's nothing special about me.

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,600
You're his son.

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,800
That's not the only thing.

94
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,230
I don't do well staying in one place.

95
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
You know that.

96
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,030
This isn't the job for me.

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,730
If you leave, so does he.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,160
Really?

99
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,530
You're telling me that if the federal government wants

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
to get Walter Bishop out of a mental institution,

101
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,860
they can't do that without the consent of his son?

102
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,600
It's your father.

103
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,800
He's made it very clear that if you leave,

104
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,760
he won't cooperate with our investigations.

105
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't believe it.

106
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,830
He would rather go back to St. Claire's

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,200
than work here without you.

108
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,960
He said that more than once.

109
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,100
Was he wearing clothes at the time?

110
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,960
- Good morning.  - Hello.

111
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,160
Hello.

112
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,360
Morning.

113
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,800
Yesterday, there was an explosion

114
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,230
at a construction site in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

115
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,530
A crane collapsed.

116
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,360
Left three dead, two dozen injured.

117
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,860
The public was told that it was a gas main explosion,

118
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,200
which, technically, is the truth.

119
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,330
It's what caused the explosion I want you to see.

120
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,730
we had it transported here late last night.

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,360
we've got NSA

122
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,600
and CDC gathering data.

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,860
But Dr. Bishop,

124
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,000
I wanted you to see this as soon as possible.

125
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,830
What is it?

126
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,360
It's why you're here.

127
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,600
We don't know.

128
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
It just fell from the sky?

129
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,030
It came from underground.

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,530
The thing blasted through an unused subway tunnel

131
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,530
into a gas main.

132
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,700
Underground.

133
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
Came to rest right on the surface.

134
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,200
As if someone had carefully placed it there.

135
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,460
Solid iridium.

136
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,530
We think so, yes.

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,630
Subsonic vibrations?

138
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
At two megahertz, and then again at four.

139
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,000
This thing is vibrating?

140
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,160
Dr. Bishop, do you have an idea what this may be?

141
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,960
An idea, yes.

142
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you feel like sharing?

143
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,960
No. It's too early.

144
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,700
This isn't the first time one of these has shown up.

145
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,260
1987.

146
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,660
At Quantico.

147
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,130
Colonel Jacobson was in charge of the investigation.

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,460
Henry Jacobson?

149
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,300
Spoke to him myself this morning.

150
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,860
He's expecting a visit.

151
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,630
Said he's looking forward to seeing you again.

152
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,900
What do you wanna do?

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,130
What kind of man would take off on you

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,060
the minute a can of magic space soup arrives?

155
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,260
Who says it came from space?

156
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,330
- It's a joke, Walter.  - Oh.

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Thank you for staying.

158
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,460
This is the last one, Olivia.

159
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,230
Then I'm gone.

160
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,400
We need to get this back to the lab.

161
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,700
We can't risk transferring this

162
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,130
to the university.

163
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,500
We'd rather you stay...

164
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,930
If you require my perspicacity such as it exists,

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
then there are certain fundamental requirements,

166
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,600
not the least of which is access to my equipment,

167
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
my lab...

168
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,700
Well, well, well.

169
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,230
I was hoping I'd have an excuse to see you again.

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,960
It's good to see you.

171
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
Oh.

172
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,630
It's been more than a year

173
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,730
since she died.

174
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,730
It's still difficult.

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
I suppose it always will be.

176
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,300
Jessica took care of the house.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,700
Hell, she took care of everything.

178
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,830
I apologize for what has to be horrible coffee.

179
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,930
No, it's delicious.

180
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,300
I... I know you lost someone too.

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,300
My condolences.

182
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
It's not easy losing a partner.

183
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,230
I know agent Scott and you were close.

184
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,560
What can you tell me about Quantico?

185
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,830
1987?

186
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,830
Master sergeant Stuart Malick.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,260
He was at his post at the marine base

188
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,760
on the night of June 22.

189
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,130
His job was to watch the motion sensors,

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,530
perimeter security,

191
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
to ensure that there was no breach at the base.

192
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,700
Except on that night, the sensors went nuts.

193
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,200
What we found was this.

194
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,960
Metallic cylinder, 24 inches tall,

195
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,130
12 inches in diameter.

196
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
He assumed it fell from the sky.

197
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,800
That perhaps it was a piece of a satellite.

198
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,330
Except it wasn't.

199
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,260
Stranger still, although it seemed to be

200
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,430
a solid piece of hard metal,

201
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,830
it was vibrating.

202
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,030
At two megahertz.

203
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,430
Then again at four.

204
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,560
There's another?

205
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,800
Where is this one?

206
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,900
Still at Quantico?

207
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,730
I was called in to investigate.

208
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,230
We determined it was transmitting something.

209
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,930
A signal that we couldn't decode.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,700
48 hours after we found it,

211
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
there was an explosion unlike anything I'd ever seen.

212
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,000
It went through the floor

213
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,160
to the basement below.

214
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,630
It exploded down.

215
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,230
And was gone.

216
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,530
I'll give you my files, whatever you need.

217
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,160
But this was a weird one, Olivia.

218
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,230
And if it's happening again,

219
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,230
as a friend,

220
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,700
I'd ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can.

221
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,430
And what exactly is this?

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,860
In time, my dear.

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,900
Hello, sir, can I help you?

224
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,600
Code red, code red.

225
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,860
We have a breach in sector eight.

226
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
You.

227
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,960
Where is it?

228
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,300
Agent Dunham.

229
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,300
Hello?

230
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Hello?

231
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,500
Olivia.

232
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,430
Hello?

233
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,430
Olivia.

234
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,730
John?

235
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,830
Dispatch.

236
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,000
This is agent Dunham.

237
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,600
7-18-6-22-7-9.

238
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,500
I need a call traced from my cell.

239
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,130
It just came in.

240
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,830
Please hold.

241
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,700
We have no record of any calls in the last three hours.

242
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,730
Oh.

243
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,330
Okay. Thank you.

245
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,700
The precision with which this object was constructed

246
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,060
is inspiring.

247
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,900
Down to the molecular bonds.

248
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,900
I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository

249
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,530
is not the pinnacle of human achievement.

250
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,730
What is it? 

251
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,260
Let me ask you a question.

252
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,360
If I tried reverse psychology,

253
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,700
like, if I just said to you right now,

254
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,460
"Walter, don't tell me what that is,"

255
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,600
Would that work?

256
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,700
Many years ago, I worked on project thor.

257
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,860
The department of defense wanted a subterranean torpedo,

258
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,400
a missile which could, in theory,

259
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,360
be shot from anywhere in the world

260
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,160
through the earth's core and hit its target on the other side.

261
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,260
I know for a fact that that is ridiculous.

262
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,660
Open your mind, son,

263
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,000
or someone may open it for you.

264
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,330
Even that doesn't make any sense.

265
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,860
The cylinder could be any number of things,

266
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,430
none of which I am prepared to discuss.

267
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Great, well, I am glad I stuck around for this.

268
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,230
I don't believe it.

269
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,460
what?

270
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,900
Look.

271
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
It's one of the photos from Jacobson's file.

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Him. remember?

273
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,130
The bald guy.

274
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
No, who is he?

275
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,130
That's the point.

276
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,960
Olivia, you're starting to sound like Walter.

277
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,800
There are many things I'm not good at,

278
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,760
too many, but one thing I can do,

279
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,930
that I've always been able to do,

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
that game, concentration.

281
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,560
Memory connecting things.

282
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,160
putting them together.

283
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,600
See.

284
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,330
Two weeks ago at the hospital.

285
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,560
That's him.

286
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,500
No way.

287
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,530
Can I help you?

288
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,300
Still photograph from the crime scene at Quantico, 1987.

289
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,400
Look.

290
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,630
He was there. Look at this.

291
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,330
Less than two weeks ago at the hospital in Quincy.

292
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,330
It's the same guy.

293
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,430
And he looks the same.

294
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
And he was there with us.

295
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,000
What?

296
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,330
Come with me.

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,360
Excuse us, please.

298
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,630
It took us a year to spot him.

299
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,400
You did it in three weeks.

300
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,560
Who the hell is this guy?

301
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,330
That is one excellent question.

302
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,330
You've run him through every database?

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
- Of course.  - And there's nothing on him

304
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,730
- Nothing at all?  - No positive Id.

305
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,700
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes,

306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,160
all of which relate to the pattern.

307
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,500
How?

308
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,030
Why? What is he doing?

309
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,160
What it looks like he's doing.

310
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,030
He's watching.

311
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,700
Observing.

312
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,700
which is why we refer to him as the observer.

313
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,860
But what he wants and why he's there,

314
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,230
We don't know.

315
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,660
And he was there the other day

316
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,200
in new york at the construction site

317
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
This is Broyles.

318
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
When did it happen?

319
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,630
Okay, turn it on.

320
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,100
What is that?

321
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
It's called sound.

322
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,430
I know that, thank you. what's the point?

323
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,930
I need to compare the numbers, confirm my suspicions.

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,930
Compare them to what?

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Suspicions of what?

326
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,100
Astrid Farnsworth.

327
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,300
I'll explain later.

328
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,760
No, I want you to explain right now.

329
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,360
I want to know what the hell this tin can is.

330
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,000
Peter?

331
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
It's Olivia.

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,930
Hello?

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,230
There's been an attack, Peter.

334
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,730
The team at the warehouse is dead.

335
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,100
- What?  - Who did it?

336
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,100
I don't know, but we're moving that thing to a secure facility.

337
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm on my way.

338
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,230
Got it.

339
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,160
Walter, whatever the hell that thing is,

340
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,330
you should have never brought it here.

341
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,430
Why do you say this?

342
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,460
Has someone come for it?

343
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,560
Why would you ask that?

344
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,360
- Have they?  - Yes.

345
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,200
Then we need to keep this safe.

346
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,000
We need something... something very important.

347
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,960
- What?  - Aluminum foil.

348
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,630
- why?  - Trust me.

349
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,030
- No, thank you.  - Damn it!

350
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,900
Must you always be such a smart ass?

351
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,230
I need the aluminum foil right now

352
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,460
to shield the frequencies of the cylinder.

353
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,300
Your life depends on it.

354
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,130
All our lives depend on it.

355
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,860
Go now.

356
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,660
I'm gonna go get you your aluminum foil,

357
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,960
and then when I get back, you're gonna tell me

358
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,960
what the hell it is you think that thing does.

359
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,360
While you're out,

360
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,930
if you see a chance to get me a root beer float, that would be wonderful.

361
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,430
I'll see what I can do.

362
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,760
Would you be a lamb and get me that syringe?

363
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,160
Sure.

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,760
Thank you.

365
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,230
Hey! I got the tin foil!

366
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,300
Astrid!

367
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,730
Astrid! are you okay?

368
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,060
Astrid, look at me, Astrid.

369
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,160
Hey, focus, focus for a second.

370
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,400
Where is Walter?

371
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,260
Someone came to you.

372
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,500
Think about her.

373
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,500
I know you were there.

374
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,630
The last time.

375
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,830
And she's come to you now.

376
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,230
Think about that woman.

377
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,930
Don't play with me.

378
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,430
Now you tell me now,

379
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,030
or I'll do that again.

380
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,800
Think.

381
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,100
See? That was easy.

382
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,800
Bless you.

383
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,460
Hmm.

384
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,160
I haven't had a root beer float

385
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,860
in 17 years.

386
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,130
And? How is it?

387
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,330
Heavenly.

388
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,460
And earthly at the same time.

389
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,260
Quite the connoisseur.

390
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,030
Do you want some?

391
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,600
No, thank you.

392
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,160
I wouldn't taste much anyway.

393
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,330
17 years.

394
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
That's a long time to go without something you love.

395
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,760
Where I've been, you lose track of time.

396
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,860
So much now to make up for.

397
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,900
Thank you for hiding the beacon. 

398
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,900
I can't touch it myself.

399
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,830
I know you have questions. 

400
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,200
Soon you'll have answers. 

401
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Of course.

402
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,500
Dr. Walter Bishop,

403
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm forwarding his photo right now. I want surveillance posted

404
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,360
outside his last known residence.

405
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,400
This is getting annoying.

406
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,600
Please do not stand there and tell me

407
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,960
that you have no idea where your father...

408
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,960
You're assuming I have any understanding of how

409
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,160
that man's addled brain works.

410
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,200
You gave us the impression that you could handle him.

411
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,200
Hey, let's get something straight.

412
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I didn't promise you anything.

413
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,700
I warned you from the word go.

414
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,730
Agent Dunham.

415
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Thank god. Where?

416
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,160
We'll be right there. 

417
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,460
Walter just got picked up, walking the median of I-95.

418
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,030
If it's possible,

419
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,830
I would very much like my own clothes back.

420
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,460
Let me explain how this works to you, Walter.

421
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,300
You can't inject a federal officer with sedatives,

422
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,330
steal government property,

423
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,760
and then escape from protective custody,

424
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,060
and then ask to be not treated like a criminal.

425
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,800
Have you never taken anything that didn't belong to you

426
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,100
because you knew it was the right thing to do?

427
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,960
This isn't about me.

428
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,860
Maybe it is, Peter.

429
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,530
You took the cylinder. 

430
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,860
Do you remember that?

431
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,300
Yes, of course.

432
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,400
What would you like to know about it?

433
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,960
- Where is it?  - I can't tell you that.

434
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,500
But I can tell you that someone is coming

435
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,930
to seek the cylinder.

436
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,060
Thus, I had to hide it.

437
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,600
And I don't recall where or from whom.

438
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,930
We need you to remember.

439
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,060
It may be dangerous,

440
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,900
and we need to help keep people safe.

441
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Tell me what it is.

442
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,860
If I... if I attempted to explain it,

443
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,430
you... you might think me mad.

444
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't worry. There's no chance of that happening.

445
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,930
I believe there are only

446
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,130
another four hours in which I must keep the cylinder

447
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,630
from those who are trying to get it,

448
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,800
a theory I have discussed

449
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,500
with my friend, who agrees with me.

450
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,630
Your friend? 

451
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,400
Um, he's a tall fellow, right?

452
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,730
Pink, big fuzzy ears.

453
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,700
No, he's a man.

454
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,660
Quite nice.

455
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,830
Albeit extremely bald.

456
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
No eyebrows either.

457
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,200
It's disturbing, but you get accustomed to it.

458
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,630
You talked to him.

459
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,730
Do you really think it's a good idea to feed

460
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,760
into his delusions at this point?

461
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,960
Walter, who is he?

462
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,430
Where can we find him?

463
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,160
Oh, you won't be able to find him.

464
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,430
Oh, of course not, 'Cause he's in the seventh dimension.

465
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,300
He's shy.

466
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,930
Though he wouldn't be any use to you.

467
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
He just observes.

468
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Walter, you haven't

469
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,860
talked to this man.

470
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,460
you've seen him in Olivia's photographs,

471
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,860
so cut out the gibberish

472
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,500
and just tell us where the cylinder is.

473
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,860
Must you always be so small-minded?

474
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,030
Damn it, don't be like her.

475
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,160
Like your mother.

476
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,630
Questioning my judgment.

477
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,430
I am not a child.

478
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,930
I will not be babied.

479
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,260
Thank you for that.

480
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,160
That's exactly what I needed.

481
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,630
Guilt relieved.

482
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,000
Olivia, I am very sorry,

483
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,400
But I think you'll understand why I don't want

484
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,700
to hang around any longer.

485
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,800
I upset him, didn't I?

486
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,960
Where are we?

487
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,960
I couldn't tell you.

488
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,300
Walter's hiding something.

489
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,700
He's being as cryptic as ever.

490
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,960
He says he had to keep the cylinder safe.

491
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,660
That someone is looking for it.

492
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,830
Welcome to the joys of Walter Bishop.

493
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,230
Where did he take it?

494
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,700
You'll have to ask walter. he won't tell me.

495
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,000
Apparently, he had a meeting with a man

496
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,930
Matching the description of our friend.

497
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,960
The bald guy.

498
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,030
Well, I know a lot of bald guys.

499
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,030
The observer.

500
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,230
Are you saying walter's saying he knows him?

501
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,140
I'm saying he's not cooperating.

502
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,340
I'm saying I'm confused.

503
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,790
Hey, man.

504
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,680
Thanks for calling back so fast.

505
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,050
Look, don't start with me right now, ok?

506
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, guss what? I'm calling this time to ask for a favor too.

507
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,400
No, I need some walk.

508
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,120
Well, I don't really care. So I'm gonna put some money in my pocket.

509
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,750
Anywhere but Boston.

510
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,090
Ok.

511
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,550
Agent Dunham,

512
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,080
Agent Fosoul is on the phone.

513
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,580
I don't know, about an hour ago.

514
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,580
When he left, he was pretty upset with Walter.

515
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,240
Maybe he just finally left.

516
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,420
No, there was a struggle here.

517
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,400
I'll take care of it. Thanks, Alstrit.

518
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,120
Call Harvard campus security.

519
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,100
There's a closed-circuit camera outside countway library

520
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,360
Aimed at the kresge building. 

521
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,730
I need footage going back two hours.

522
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,330
You don't work for big Eddie, do you?

523
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,430
Look, I think you got the wrong guy.

524
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What I'm saying is...

525
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,830
Whatever it is you want, I don't think

526
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm gonna be able to give it to you.

527
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,530
No, no!

528
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,230
Aah!

529
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,130
You have something I need.

530
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Tell me where it is.

531
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,430
I have no idea what you're talking about.

532
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,730
I'm going to ask you some questions.

533
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
Please answer honestly.

534
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,800
What's the most pain you've ever felt in your life?

535
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,560
This was taken outside your lab.

536
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,030
Have you ever seen this man before?

537
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,430
I don't believe so, no.

538
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,230
Something's happened, yes?

539
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,630
Something unfortunate. what is it?

540
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
I believe this man may have abducted Peter.

541
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,460
that's not... no.

542
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,760
Peter will lead him to it.

543
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,130
To what? The cylinder?

544
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,230
- Yes.  - How?

545
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,930
Did you tell him where you put it?

546
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,830
No, of course not.

547
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,560
I don't need to.

548
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,200
You and your colleagues had the cylinder last.

549
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,200
Where is it now?

550
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,400
I have no idea.

551
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,800
And even if I did,

552
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,760
You're the last person I would tell.

553
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,500
But you just did tell me.

554
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,200
your father hid it.

555
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,430
But you don't know where?

556
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
And yes, to answer your question,

557
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,860
When this is over, I just might kill you.

558
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,630
It depends on a few things.

559
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
When was the last time your father kissed you?

560
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,400
I think that's your lamest question yet.

561
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,900
Think about your father.

562
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,400
Good.

563
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,530
Now think about a time

564
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,060
Before he was sent away to the institution.

565
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,160
A happy time, A time when you still believed

566
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,300
That your father loved you.

567
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,830
Beside his car in your old house,

568
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,500
Does your father have any other hiding places?

569
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,060
answer the question.

570
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,460
Does your father ha...

571
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,230
thank you.

572
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,600
You just told me where the cylinder is.

573
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,360
Come with me.

574
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,460
Shame you never met him.

575
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,300
Come on.

576
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,030
Dig.

577
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,660
Careful.

578
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,230
Hey, Olivia.

579
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Over here.

580
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,730
Are you okay?

581
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,830
Yeah. He went that way. go.

582
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,560
He's got a gun.

583
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,060
Departure on schedule.

584
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,100
Who the hell are you?

585
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,900
What is the cylinder?

586
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,800
You know what it is, don't you?

587
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,160
Why is it here?

588
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,500
Why now?

589
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,500
Who are you?

590
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,000
Apples, bananas, rhinoceros.

591
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,260
I want to hold your hand.

592
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,360
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

593
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,330
Do you really know my father?

594
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,500
Did you talk to him this afternoon?

595
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Are you his friend?

596
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,900
Peter.

597
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,630
- Is he all right?  - He's fine.

598
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,530
He has a mild concussion, but he's gonna be fine.

599
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,200
Thank you. That's wonderful news.

600
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,000
Come on. I'm gonna take you back to your hotel.

601
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,260
If you don't mind,

602
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,660
There's something I'd like to do first.

603
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,160
What I did to you was very untrustworthy of me.

604
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,130
I never intended to harm you.

605
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,630
I was simply doing what was necessary

606
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,500
to protect us all.

607
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,260
If it would help you feel a sense of retribution,

608
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,700
I would tell you to inject me too.

609
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,730
But I'd most likely enjoy it.

610
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,000
Hi, Peter Bishop, he was brought in about an hour ago.

611
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,430
Excuse me.

612
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,430
Hi.

613
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,800
Are you okay?

614
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,630
Yeah.

615
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
I'm fine.

616
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,430
So did we recover the cylinder?

617
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,830
We dug out the hole, but there's no sign of it.

618
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,160
As soon as the sun comes up,

619
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,700
We'll bring in an excavator,

620
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,430
But somehow, I don't have an expectation we'll find it.

621
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,930
So it just disappeared.

622
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,600
We i.d.'d the shooter.

623
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,260
John Mosley.

624
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,600
Wanted for a double homicide in seattle last month.

625
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,800
A few drug-related felonies before that.

626
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,030
Seattle.

627
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,830
Came a long way to try and get that thing.

628
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,730
Another in a long line of questions.

629
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,700
I should get back.

630
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
As you can imagine, there are

631
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,000
Some interagency fires to quash.

632
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,130
Nsa considered that device their personal property.

633
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,600
They're looking for an explanation.

634
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,360
So I'll see you tomorrow?

635
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,430
Yeah.

636
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,300
Hi.

637
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,700
You ready to get out of here?

638
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,160
Something happened out there tonight, Olivia.

639
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,630
The pattern that Broyles refers to,

640
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,760
I always thought it was nonsense.

641
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,030
Inexplicable things happen every single day.

642
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,630
It does not mean that there's any deeper significance.

643
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,330
I know this is gonna sound insane.

644
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,830
Yeah, I know it sounds insane,

645
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,130
But that man out there in the woods,

646
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
he knew me.

647
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,800
and I don't know how, but he was inside my head.

648
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,100
He knew what I was going to say before I said it.

649
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,100
The man I shot?

650
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,500
No, the other guy, the bald guy.

651
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,330
From your photos. Mr. no brows?

652
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
Peter, I didn't see anyone.

653
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,730
You know me well enough now to know that these are

654
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,430
the last words I would ever expect to to be saying,

655
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,530
but what if Walter is right?

656
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,760
what if this is just the beginning?

657
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,830
Listen, you took a pretty bad blow to the head.

658
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,960
You think I did this to myself?

659
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,160
No, I just...

660
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,730
I was wrong to... to demand that you stay here.

661
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,860
Walter is not your responsibility.

662
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,300
As you've always said,

663
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,130
this was just supposed to be temporary.

664
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,130
You have your life.

665
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,460
Olivia, did you hear what I just said?

666
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,360
I mean, I'm a fairly open-minded guy,

667
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,860
but there are things happening here

668
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,460
that I can't even begin to explain.

669
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,030
And I am not going anywhere until I can.

670
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,830
In that case, you might want this.

671
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,030
Your credentials have been approved.

672
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,460
Civilian consultant

673
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,430
to the department of homeland security.

674
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,900
Does this mean I don't need an escort

675
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,460
to come into the federal building anymore?

676
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
Yeah.

677
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,560
Will it get me out of speeding tickets?

678
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,900
Maybe.

679
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,260
So let me tell you about my day, Walter.

680
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,600
I was abducted, tortured,

681
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,830
had two wires shoved up my nose

682
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,630
that were connected to a machine I've never seen before.

683
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,430
But maybe the strangest part of the day

684
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,530
is that somehow, without talking,

685
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,530
I was able to answer a question

686
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,660
that I didn't have the answer to.

687
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,930
Where I buried the capsule?

688
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,200
How did I know that, Walter?

689
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,300
I didn't know that.

690
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,900
You know it, son, because I know it.

691
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,360
No, I didn't know because you didn't tell me.

692
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,130
I didn't have to.

693
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,800
You must adjust the way you consider communications,

694
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,060
ideas.

695
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,560
Ideas can be absorbed through osmosis.

696
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,260
through proximity.

697
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,400
Do you remember the night

698
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,460
of the accident when you were young?

699
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,630
- I was driving...  - of course, I remember.

700
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,730
Your mother was at home.

701
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,430
of course, I remember. Thanksgiving dinner.

702
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,230
She was anxious for us to get there,

703
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,800
join everyone.

704
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,300
When the car went off the road,

705
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,760
the ice was so thick that it held the vehicle

706
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,730
for what must have been two minutes.

707
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,760
What does this have to do with what happened today?

708
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,660
I regained consciousness,

709
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,600
I saw your body...

710
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,160
contorted horribly,

711
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,730
and I reached for you.

712
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,760
But the ice broke.

713
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,530
And we sank into that dark water.

714
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,330
And then you swam to shore and saved us both.

715
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,330
I know.

716
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,830
No.

717
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,800
I was unable to control my limbs

718
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,260
in that icy water.

719
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,260
It wouldn't respond.

720
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:38,660
I was incapable of saving you.

721
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,530
Or myself.

722
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,760
we were dead, Peter, you and I.

723
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,200
until someone grabbed me.

724
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,000
And we were going up.

725
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,100
We were saved, both of us,

726
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,630
by a man that I had never met.

727
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,030
A man that shouldn't have been there at all.

728
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,130
He pulled us to the shore.

729
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,600
I remembered that he was bald,

730
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,460
that he had no eyebrows.

731
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,860
And as he set us down in the snow,

732
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,260
I recalled his stare,

733
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,330
standing there in his suit soaking wet,

734
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,900
seemingly indifferent to the cold.

735
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,900
It was as if he knew my thoughts before I did.

736
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,000
As if he were inside my head.

737
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,830
without speaking, he made it clear

738
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,100
that he would need me one day.

739
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,230
A return favor, so to speak.

740
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,330
And this is it.

741
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,360
Today, what happened with the capsule,

742
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,600
I'm not sure how I knew

743
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,400
about the vibrations, the composition.

744
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,300
But then when I tested it myself,

745
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,930
heard the vibrations, felt them,

746
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,730
It was as if an envelope had been opened

747
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,400
and I could finally read my instructions.

748
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,960
Instantly, I knew I had to protect the capsule.

749
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,460
For him.

750
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,530
Who they are, what they want...

751
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,900
as a man of science, I share your frustration

752
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,600
in not having these answers.

753
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:32,060
But what I know is that you are sitting here now...

754
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,200
my son...

755
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,830
alive.

756
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,530
I know you must think me insane.

757
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,700
not nearly as much as you might think.

758
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


759
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
