1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,381
Yeah, I can hear her crying.

2
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,510
Try that little rock-twist thing I do.
That usually soothes her.

3
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:14,532
It worked?

4
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,405
Look at that.

5
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:19,909
Sweetheart, I have to go.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,772
Give here a kiss for me, would you?

7
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,128
Okay, bye.

8
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:32,806
Hey there.

9
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:34,534
Where you headed?

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,554
What you doing out here
all by yourself?

11
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,124
What about your parents?
Do they know you're out here?

12
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:45,656
No, sir.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,380
What's your name, son?

14
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:49,611
Teddy.

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,887
Why don't you hop in, teddy?

16
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:08,025
So you were running away?

17
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,990
Well, I took off a few times
when I was your age.

18
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:17,213
But I bet there's people out there
worried, looking for you.

19
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,105
And you know what?

20
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:23,218
It doesn't matter what happened.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,657
I'm sure as soon as they see you...

22
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,933
Oh, my god!

23
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,646
If I wasn't looking at him myself,
I wouldn't believe we caught one.

24
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,625
I always thought they were nut jobs.

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,471
The people who told those stories.

26
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:45,398
Seeing is believing.

27
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,627
- Where'd he pick him up?
- Just off of 940.

28
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,887
A quarter mile
down the road from Edina.

29
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,189
Teddy, I'm gonna take your picture.

30
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,470
Can you put your juice down
and sit up for me?

31
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,131
I think we should call
the papers, Johnny.

32
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:13,674
He's just a kid.

33
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,884
He's one of them.

34
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:17,427
I don't care how old he is,
people have a right to know.

35
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,772
We're not calling anyone until this
thing goes through proper channels.

36
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:24,477
How much you want to bet somebody
in the proper channels leaks it to...

37
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:36,972
I'm sorry.

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

43
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,083
Walter, come on. Let's go.

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,316
Why do I have to go in there?

45
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,518
Because we're out of milk.

46
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,146
And because you haven't left
the house in over a week,

47
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,876
And you can't just stay inside
watching old movies all the time.

48
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,493
Look at all those people, Peter.

49
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,162
What if I get lost again?

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,054
What if he's in there?

51
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,844
He's not in there.

52
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,713
And I promise you

53
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,798
I will never let you
get kidnapped again.

54
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:45,433
I'm learning
to appreciate cowardice.

55
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,470
The lion had a point.

56
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,979
- The lion?
- The cowardly lion.

57
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,440
But again, that was just a movie.

58
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,859
And there's no flying monkeys
inside the grocery store.

59
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,199
Can you be ready to go
in half an hour?

60
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,453
- Why? What's up?
- Three dead cops and a missing kid.

61
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,582
- Doesn't sound like our kind of case.
- Wait till you hear about the kid.

62
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,234
John Pekarsky was the senior trooper
on duty last night.

63
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,518
He uploaded his report to the state
police database sometime after 9:00.

64
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,316
According to the coroner,

65
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,265
Pekarsky and the other two troopers
on duty were dead within the hour.

66
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,490
And the kid?

67
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,103
He was gone.

68
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,105
I think whoever did this
was coming for him.

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,523
Any kind of trail.

70
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,028
We haven't found a single print
or shell casing.

71
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,320
And they took
the surveillance hard drive.

72
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,030
But there was a picture of the kid?

73
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,342
Pekarsky uploaded it
along with his report.

74
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,122
I saw a boy
who looked like this once.

75
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,394
He was young, like this child,

76
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:59,356
And he played the banjo, I think.
It was a haunting melody.

77
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,725
- You saw it too.
- Yes, I did.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,666
It's a movie, Walter.

79
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,938
It's called deliverance.
We saw it together.

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,943
Probably not the same boy.

81
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:20,861
According to his report,

82
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,532
This kid looked completely normal
when Pekarsky picked him up.

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,785
Agent Broyles, we found something
you might want to take a look at.

84
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:32,794
We found it in their files.
There are 30 or 40 reports in there.

85
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,205
Strange stories
about these deformed people.

86
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,671
Some of these are 30 years old.

87
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:42,522
"I saw him change in front of me.
Suddenly he was hideous."

88
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:44,594
Like trooper Pekarsky reported.

89
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,462
"Misshapen and deformed.

90
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:48,973
It looked like a cousin of bigfoot."

91
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,691
That's clearly wrong.

92
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:54,372
This boy bears no resemblance
at all to a sasquatch.

93
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,355
Or a yeti, for that matter.

94
00:05:57,151 --> 00:06:00,067
Well, you don't believe
in those creatures?

95
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,511
Why shouldn't I?

96
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:06,223
Just because no one has documented
flying monkeys or talking lions yet

97
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,939
hardly means they don't exist.

98
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:09,952
Agent Frug,

99
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,913
my father's a bit of a shock-doc.
Don't let him alarm you.

100
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,453
All of these reports were dismissed.

101
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,946
Thee was no cooperation
and no hard evidence.

102
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:21,255
But the vast majority of them
occurred in the same area.

103
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:22,924
Just outside Edina.

104
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,551
That's where the boy was picked up,
walking out of Edina.

105
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,511
I guess that's
where we start looking.

106
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,153
Whatever these things are,

107
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,645
it seems like they've managed
to hide themselves for a while.

108
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,938
And from the looks of things, they'll do
just about anything to keep it that way.

109
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:47,936
Keep it in mind.

110
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,157
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,743
I don't think this is a good idea.

112
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,149
It's okay, we're just gonna ask
a couple of questions.

113
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:29,837
There may be werewolves
in these hills.

114
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,534
Werewolves?

115
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,130
That trooper reported that the boy
changed in front of his eyes.

116
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,069
So yes,

117
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,596
I believe we may be looking
for some kind of therianthrope.

118
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,046
It's greek. Refers to a creature
that has a metamorphic ability

119
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,505
to shift between
being a man an a beast.

120
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,086
- It's mythological, of course.
- I saw one once

121
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,229
when I was a young man
studying in London.

122
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:54,414
I was under the influence
of a fairly potent blend of hashish...

123
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,267
Guys, hang on a second.

124
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:00,143
Do you hear that?
That buzz?

125
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:10,448
<i>Hard artichokes rarely keep</i>

126
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,658
<i>norwegian elephants</i>

127
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,201
<i>singapore sleep.</i>

128
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,377
What are you singing?

129
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,189
I have no idea.

130
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:22,895
It just popped into my head.
It must be that buzzing.

131
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,320
I can't stop it.

132
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,800
Sheriff Velchik. Hi.

133
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,937
Thank you for meeting us
on such short notice.

134
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:32,887
Of course.

135
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:36,057
I couldn't help but notice that you've
gotten acquainted with the Edina hum.

136
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,224
What is that?

137
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,852
Military base,
about five miles down the road.

138
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,147
They have big turbine generators
that get pretty loud from time to time.

139
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,982
Well, that's one mystery solved.

140
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,594
Why don't we have some coffee.
Maybe I can help you with the other.

141
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,655
So I take it you've heard
about what happened last night

142
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,766
to the three troopers in Jonestown.

143
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:57,203
I understand
that the perpetrators took a kid.

144
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:06,786
My god.

145
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,759
You've never seen
anything like that before?

146
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,870
I've never seen a photograph of...

147
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,108
one of them.

148
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,314
Then you have heard the stories?

149
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,102
Of course. Telling those stories is
a bit of a local pastime.

150
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,062
You hear 'em all over the state.

151
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,168
Well, sheriff, this boy was picked up
just outside of your town.

152
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:29,552
And the state police have 30 or 40

153
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,529
unconfirmed eyewitness reports.

154
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:34,654
We get our fair share of sightings,

155
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,619
but I've never been able
to confirm them.

156
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,654
Nothing like this.

157
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,306
We'd like to see those reports.

158
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,242
Of course. Anything I can do.

159
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,510
What is it?

160
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:55,928
It's nothing.

161
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,137
Joseph?

162
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:02,476
Federal agents came into the diner.

163
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,397
They had a photograph of Teddy.

164
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,901
And they're asking questions
about the killings.

165
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,694
I told you that wasn't the answer!

166
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,237
What choice did we have?

167
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,197
Well, what are we gonna do?

168
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:18,590
I don't know yet.

169
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,989
We didn't get anything
from the autopsies.

170
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,412
Looks like the troopers were killed
with 12-gauge shotgun blasts.

171
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:39,789
But there's probably a shotgun in every
house in this part of the state.

172
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,254
<i>You make a good point.</i>

173
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,541
You went through
all the sheriff's reports?

174
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,051
They've had similar sightings,
but nothing conclusive.

175
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:49,325
Though sheriff Velchik did mention
a military base down the road.

176
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,166
You floating another government
conspiracy theory, Mr bishop?

177
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,779
You know me, I never miss a chance
for a good conspiracy theory.

178
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,853
Okay, I'll look into it.

179
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,745
God, how far away is the hotel?
I'm exhausted.

180
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,139
I don't know. It's only supposed
to be a couple more miles.

181
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,875
Though somebody's already decided
to call it a night.

182
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,401
Well, he's had a big day.

183
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,683
You got him out of the house,
he's working a case.

184
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,719
I understand why he's scared. But...

185
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,015
it just doesn't seem like he's able
to snap out of it this time.

186
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:26,913
It reminds me of how he was when
we first got him out of St Claire's.

187
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:30,137
I'm worried that he's starting
to go backwards.

188
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:34,162
I think he's starting to appear
no less normal than the rest of us.

189
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,471
I ran into a guy
from high school this morning.

190
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,706
You should have seen the look in his
eyes when I told him what I did.

191
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:45,108
Like chicks with guns turned him on?

192
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:47,170
More like I was a freak.

193
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,099
Like I had suddenly
grown a third eye.

194
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,030
You ever get the feeling that...

195
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,592
doing this job just makes you
less and less normal?

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,074
Absolutely.

197
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,090
- Are we there yet, Peter?
- Walter, get down!

198
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,585
You know, it's generally
pretty quiet in this area.

199
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,697
Not much in the way of dead cops
and feds being run off the road.

200
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,241
- But you think you shot it?
- Maybe. I don't know.

201
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,535
But it was able to drive off.

202
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:52,915
We'll be right there.

203
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:56,960
One of our agents found apickup truck
on the road about a mile from here.

204
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,129
Back towards Edina.

205
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,680
Is that the vehicle?

206
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,932
I don't know.
It was heading straight for us.

207
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,873
Do we have a preliminary?

208
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,814
No plates, no registration.

209
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,334
- We have a forensic team on the way.
- We should have them run

210
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,076
the truck's vin number,
see if you can track down an owner.

211
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,619
What? What is it?

212
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,877
The large blue.

213
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,373
Isn't she magnificent!

214
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,549
I've never seen one this big
on this continent.

215
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,343
Look, Olivia.

216
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,680
I know a certain lepidopterist
who will be simply thrilled.

217
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,048
I have to get my kit from the car.

218
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,107
Peter, look.

219
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,364
It's blood.

220
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,915
<i>Agent Frug, over here.
We got something.</i>

221
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,881
Careful, Peter.

222
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,815
You said you shot
at the creature, right?

223
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,532
You sure you saw
what you think you saw?

224
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,420
What happened here is simple.

225
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,650
My son shot a beast.

226
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,818
We found a man.

227
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,543
Obviously the creature transformed
in the interim.

228
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,433
Peter, do you realize
the significance of this?

229
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:52,768
We may have found a creature
with metamorphic ability.

230
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,259
<i>Hard artichokes rarely keep</i>

231
00:15:58,631 --> 00:15:59,987
<i>norwegian elephants</i>

233
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:12,308
There was no ID On the guy
so we're gonna run some prints.

234
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,111
You had no choice.

235
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,720
First time I killed someone,
the guy was a trained killer.

236
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:28,719
If I hadn't pulled the trigger,
I'd be dead.

237
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,881
I still didn't sleep that night.

238
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:35,264
Or the next.

239
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,935
I'm just saying
the first time's rough.

240
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,897
Take the ramp down to the left.

241
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,085
You're good.
Just follow the mooing.

242
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,306
Everyone okay there?

243
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,999
More or less. Thanks.

244
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,850
I got a call from
our military liaison.

245
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,588
There's something to the rumors
Of military testing at edina.

246
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,956
<i>Turns out the army was there
in the late '70s</i>

247
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,934
<i>conducting a series
of classified experiments.</i>

248
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,805
Anything to do
with metamorphic ability?

249
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,120
Not that I can tell.

250
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,848
The pentagon files have been
almost entirely redacted.

251
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:39,879
<i>I put a call into the DoD,</i>

252
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,061
<i>but in the meantime
I'm faxing what we have.</i>

253
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:43,651
Right down here.

254
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,400
Just put it right here.
Perfect.

255
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,900
Thanks, fellas.

256
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,742
Agent Farnsworth,
help me with my kit.

257
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,080
I have to get to work, but there's
a wonderful specimen in there

258
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,982
for my favorite fan
of four-winged fauna.

259
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:04,959
I think you'll be quite tickled.

260
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,130
Peter, look at this.

261
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:11,582
The military experiment
they did in Edina

262
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,519
was called "project Elephant."

263
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:14,844
Walter's song.

264
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,490
Were you involved
in any military testing in Edina?

265
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,020
Not that I recall.

266
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,856
I'm sure I'd remember something
as exciting as human metamorphosis.

267
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,073
Another one that won't unzip.

268
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,998
It's very sweet of you to remember
how much I love butterflies,

269
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,118
but you forgot
how much I hate moths.

270
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,878
What have you done to it?

271
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,537
Excuse me?

272
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:53,757
You saw it, Peter.

273
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,150
It... it was an astounding creature!

274
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,964
Nothing like this.
It's wing is deformed.

275
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,459
Walter, if that's
your idea of a joke,

276
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:06,228
it's really not very funny.

277
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,655
Oh, my...

278
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,079
You'll want to add some
wild thyme to the jar, dear.

279
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:26,791
It's possible we could get
the moth to transform back.

280
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:30,253
It really was the most
beautiful butterfly.

281
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,129
I'll believe that when I see it.

282
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,413
I understand what you're saying

283
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,739
About the moth and the man
transforming in the same way,

284
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:39,003
but I just don't understand
how that could be possible.

285
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,884
It's likely that both
developed the ability

286
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,017
in response to the same
experimental stimulus.

287
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,396
- Slide.
- You mean the military testing.

288
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,233
Exactly.

289
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:53,489
Well,...

290
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,362
why would the military
be testing a butterfly?

291
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,501
A butterfly has two stages of life.

292
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:03,411
It's one of the few creatures
with a demonstrated ability

293
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,080
to abruptly change
its body structure.

294
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:09,959
That makes it a wonderful
alpha test subject.

295
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,283
That's odd.

296
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:18,718
What?

297
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:23,333
There's no sign
of histolysis or histogenesis.

298
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,017
Nothing to suggest
a metamorphic ability.

299
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:31,846
I just don't understand how he can
possibly have transformed himself.

300
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,317
So we didn't get a match
on the fingerprints,

301
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,606
but we did get a hit
with the truck's vin number.

302
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:38,223
It was registered to Joe Falls.

303
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:41,324
But the address was old. The house
had been torn down years ago.

304
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:42,742
But he was from Edina?

305
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:51,676
Joe Falls?

306
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,753
He worked at the mill.

307
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,005
Still does odd jobs now and then.

308
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:59,459
You think that that thing
that tried to run you off the road

309
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:02,165
- you think that could be him?
- It's possible.

310
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,057
There was no photograph on his file,
so we haven't been able to make

311
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:07,618
a positive ID.

312
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:11,060
Do you have any idea where
he's been living recently?

313
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,982
The last I heard,

314
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,901
he'd moved to the outskirts of town.
But I couldn't say where.

315
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:20,237
I mean, I'm happy
to ask around for you.

316
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,813
We'd also like to have
a look at the town records.

317
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,409
See if we can find a last
known address or a photo

318
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:27,370
- So that we can ID.
- Sure.

319
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,455
I'll take you over to town hall.

320
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,758
Did you finish the analysis
on the blood sample from the moth?

321
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:33,751
Yes, I did.

322
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,579
It had some sort
of genetic disorder.

323
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:41,204
Germline mutation.
Just as I thought.

324
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:44,428
This man has
the exact same disorder.

325
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,848
Is that what you think
let's them... Transform?

326
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,710
No, the mutation is what
makes them deformed.

327
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:53,255
I have no idea what
makes them transform.

328
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,494
It's curious.

329
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:02,821
I have this strange feeling

330
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,324
That I've seen this mutation before.

331
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,914
Please, not that song again.
It's giving me a headache.

332

I think that's where I've
seen this mutation before.

338
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,147
Maybe I did work on project elephant,
like agent Dunham said.

339
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,704
So why did I put them into a song?

340
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:46,664
Wait a second.

341
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:50,218

00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,976
The song is a mnemonic, yes?

348
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:15,096
You must have done
it on purpose, Walter.

349
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,294
So what's at the law school library?

350
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:24,428
Come along, Astrid.

351
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:25,988
Let's find out.

352
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:31,017
There's nothing in the housing
records on a Joe Falls.

353
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,371
There's nothing
in the tax records either.

354
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,335
In fact,
the whole "F" section is gone.

355
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,168
Anyone whose last
name starts with "F."

356
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,335
You can't just walk in
and check these records out.

357
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:40,920
No, but you can steal them.

358
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,922
Let's check the federal records

359
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,970
if you lived here,
you must be on the census.

360
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,141
This is it.

361
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:49,638
I remembered.

362
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,279
What happened to you in Edina?

363
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,854
You're like a different person
since you got back.

364
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:00,728
I've always found

365
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,780
work to be restorative.

366
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:07,093
When Peter was sick,

367
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,216
it was the only thing
that kept me going.

368
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,399
Amazing how it heals the soul.

369
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,668
Look.

370
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,729
<i>Devil Dogs</i>. I loved these.

371
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:29,124
We can get you a fresh one.

372
00:24:58,218 --> 00:24:59,568
They're deformed.

373
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,751
Just like that man in the lab.

374
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:08,744
I understand now.

375
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,754
There's nothing on Joe Falls in 1990.
Anything in 2000?

376
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,337
Anything in there on the
current population of Edina?

377
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,762
Nineteen... hundred and forty three.

378
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,765
It was on the sign.

379
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,890
Why?

380
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:30,685
I don't know, there's just something
strange about these census numbers.

381
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,579
Between the years of 1990 and 2000,

382
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,868
17 people died, 47 people were born.

383
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:38,788
That's the only change
in the population.

384
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,961
Some of your tax files are missing.

385
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:48,965
All of the section "f."

386
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,589
<i>Including Falls.</i>

387
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,941
I may know who's responsible.

388
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,597
The local tax collector said that Falls
had moved Out to the edge of town.

389
00:25:57,044 --> 00:26:00,144
<i>He's living in a trailer
with his wife and his son.</i>

390
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:03,604
- How old is the boy?
- He said he was seven or eight.

391
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:07,368
I've got an address
if you want to meet me.

392
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:08,793
That'd be great.

393
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:10,937
Thanks.

394
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,863
We'll see you there.

395
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,213
They don't know anything.

396
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,470
Nothing to worry about.

397
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,307
- It's going to be fine.
- You're wrong, Paul.

398
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:41,392
They found out.

399
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:44,103
Rose, I know you have a
special interest in this,

400
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,907
but they don't know anything.

401
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:50,067
They have a photograph.
They have proof.

402
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:52,361
Others have come before.

403
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:55,093
I'm gonna take care of this.

404
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,407
I'll make it all go away.

405
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:09,211
So the man and the moth

406
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,047
didn't transform at all.

407
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,066
This is something else entirely.

408
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,810
In the late '70s, the army became

409
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:23,235
obsessed with finding
a new way to camouflage soldiers.

410
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,104
They started experimenting
with electromagnetic pulses.

411
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,912
As their camouflage?

412
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:33,163
The eye converts
electromagnetic energy

413
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:36,435
into something the brain can
understand. That's how vision works.

414
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,022
The army thought
that if they could generate

415
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:41,576
a massive electromagnetic pulse,

416
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,901
then they could effectively
scramble the optic nerve.

417
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,650
And at the right frequency,
make the soldiers

418
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,653
invisible to the naked eye.

419
00:27:49,778 --> 00:27:51,712
And you consulted on this project?

420
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,142
Briefly.

421
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,215
It was after
I left that they realized

422
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,971
that prolonged exposure to the pulse
has a horrible side effect.

423
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,890
An incurable genetic disorder.

424
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:05,385
This...

425
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,076
moth and...

426
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,594
and that deformed man...

427
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:13,401
are the victims, or the children
of the victims of that experiment.

428
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,903
So how does that explain
their ability

429
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,781
- to change, Walter?
- Here, stop... Stop here.

430
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:27,895
Come. Come.

431
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,520
Leave the lights on.

432
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:32,837
What are you doing?

433
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,062
What do you see?

434
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:55,957
I see the moth.

435
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,042
Come here, please.

436
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,250
Now what do you see?

437
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:21,162
A friend of mine once wrote that

438
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,793
sufficiently advanced technology

439
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:27,433
is indistinguishable from magic.

440
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:29,185
How is it doing that?

441
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,353
It isn't.

442
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:34,276
The man and the moth
don't change at all.

443
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:36,709
What changes

444
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,371
is our perception of them.

445
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,121
Slow down.

446
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,461
You're saying that this
electromagnetic pulse

447
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,588
allows us to see these deformed
people as if they were normal?

448
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,656
Somebody must have perfected

449
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,897
the military's camouflage technology

450
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:03,594
to hide the deformities

451
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,680
that the first tests created.

452
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,391
So then so long as we stay
within the range of the pulse...

453
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,601
<i>Then these poor souls</i>

454
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,369
appear totally normal.

455
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,063
<i>So that's the Edina hum.</i>

456
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,898
That's the sound
that the pulse makes.

457
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,900
Yes, I believe so.

458
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:21,339
Do you know who could have
perfected this technology?

459
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,594
It would be extremely difficult.

460
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:27,410
Apart from Cobb, no one else
would have the expertise.

461
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,204
- Cobb? Who's Cobb?
- <i>Edward Cobb</i>

462
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,570
was the scientist
who dreamed up Project Elephant.

463
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:36,836
He would be the only one
with the imagination and the know-how.

464
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,880
Listen, I want you and Astrid
to head back home.

465
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:43,175
- But, given my knowledge...
- <i>Walter, listen to me.</i>

466
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,174
Somebody obviously has a lot invested
in keeping this thing a secret.

467
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,710
They've killed three people already
they tried to kill us.

468
00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:51,385
I don't want to have
to worry about you.

469
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:53,551
That's very sweet of you, son.

470
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,395
<i>I'll see you back at home.</i>

471
00:30:57,593 --> 00:30:59,043
What did Peter say?

472
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,632
He wants us to head into town
to try and find the source

473
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:05,707
of the electromagnetic pulse.

474
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,411
There's been too much bloodshed already.
It's just making things worse.

475
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:18,753
You got your boy back.

476
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:21,297
Would you rather
we'd let them keep him?

477
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,091
You're killing innocent people.
It's time to give this up.

478
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,709
- There are real consequences.
- Sure.

479
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,270
There are real stakes here.

480
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:32,016
That's why you gotta let me do my job
and keep this town safe.

481
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,352
And you think that killing
those federal officers

482
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,896
- is the best way to put a stop to this?
- It did the last time.

483
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,843
That federal marshal a few years ago.
No one came looking for him, did they?

484
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:44,028
We've all got jobs to do, Rose.

485
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,697
Stick to the machine.
That's your job.

486
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,463
What kind of device
are we looking for?

487
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,761
Any number of things
could transmit the pulse.

488
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,748
A large capacitor bank.

489
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:12,932
Some form of compression generator.

490
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,452
What about a satellite dish?

491
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,228
They have them all over town.

492
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,413
Those are for television, dear.

493
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,026
Given how little there is
to do here,

494
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,937
I imagine they watch a lot of it.

495
00:32:27,254 --> 00:32:29,620
What we're looking for
is something that could

496
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:33,496
relay the discharge from
the microwave conversion

497
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,271
of large energy pulses.

498
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:38,332
What about a... a big antenna?

499
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,127
Yes, yes, that would do, I suppose.

500
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:43,536
Something like that?

501
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:57,902
Well done, Astrid.

502
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,745
Are you sure we should just

503
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,770
knock on the door like this?

504
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:15,973
That was Edward's daughter.

505
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:18,706
He used to carry her around
the lab on his shoulders.

506
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:21,348
Hello.

507
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,438
Is your mother home?

508
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,297
Your mother is Rose?

509
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:33,372
And your grandfather,
his name was Edward Cobb?

510
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:34,597
Who are you?

511
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,656
I'm Walter Bishop.

512
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,480
Your grandfather
was a friend of mine.

513
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:41,255
May we come in?

514
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,526
Look, look.

515
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:54,367
That's Edward Cobb.

516
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,327
And that's Rose.

517
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,122
Do you have more recent
pictures of your mother?

518
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:02,375
We don't own a camera.

519
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:03,896
No, of course.

520
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,545
Cameras have no optic nerve.

521
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,250
The photos would only
show their deformities.

522
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:12,760
You have to go. I'm not supposed
to have strangers in the house.

523
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,554
Quite right. But
may I use your bathroom?

524
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:18,349
You know my mother
will be home soon.

525
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:20,911
- You should go.
- We will. First,

526
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:23,187
I'll go, and then we'll go.

527
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,971
But where's the bathroom?

528
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:29,610
Down the hall,
second door on the left.

529
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:30,778
Thank you.

530
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,706
Is that <i>Operation</i>?

531
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:44,776
I loved this game.

532
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:49,128
Joe Falls is in his 30s,
so he's too young

533
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,632
to be one of the soldiers
they tested in that experiment.

534
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,294
Yeah, it would have had
to have been his father.

535
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,483
I guess folks with that kind of
deformity don't tend to leave home.

536
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,604
You still stuck on that census data?

537
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,273
There's just something
weird about these numbers

538
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:09,910
I went back 30 years,
and it looks like the only time

539
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:12,361
the population goes down
is when somebody dies.

540
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,614
What about when people move?

541
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,325
No, that's just it. They don't.

542
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,578
Nobody ever leaves this town.

543
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,057
Are you saying
that you think they're...

544
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,166
That everyone in Edina
is one of them?

545
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:32,924
Get down!

546
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,008
We'll take cover in the barn!

547
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:33,845
My turn.

548
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:37,886
I'm going for the wishbone.

549
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,163
Easy! Easy!

550
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,682
It's just me.

551
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,210
Drop the gun.

552
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,085
I said drop the gun.

553
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,426
Go home, Rose.

554
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,485
The original pulse
deformed the whole town.

555
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:01,405
My father couldn't live
with himself afterwards.

556
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,867
He couldn't leave
all those people like that.

557
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:10,832
According to our files, your father
resigned from his commission in 1979.

558
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:15,617
He came back to Edina
and worked tirelessly on his machine

559
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,399
until he perfected it.

560
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:20,633
Then he offered
the inhabitants a choice.

561
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,650
A choice?

562
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,578
Live as you are, deformed,
but free to roam the world or,

563
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:28,915
confine yourself to Edina,

564
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,312
where the pulse will allow you
to hide in broad daylight.

565
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:35,703
And the people voted to stay.

566
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:37,108
They realized

567
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,293
the pulse would allow them to look
beyond the horror of their deformities

568
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,753
and see each other
for who they really were.

569
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:47,108
They chose the only normal
life they could have.

570
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,609
And your father?

571
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,372
He chose to stay among you.

572
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:54,083
He chose because of you,
didn't he, Rose?

573
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,462
Last time I saw you,
you were a little girl.

574
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,766
A perfectly healthy

575
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,910
little girl.

576
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:09,158
My mother and I, we lived in Edina.

577
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:12,768
We were part of the experiment.

578
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,979
Your father experimented on you?

579
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:20,067
The army never told him they were
expanding the scope of the test.

580
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:28,290
I remember your father fondly.

581
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:31,429
He believed

582
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,665
that invisibility would save lives.

583
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,482
And he finally solved the problem.

584
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:44,586
My father tried to create
a good life for me here...

585
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,019
for all of us and...

586
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:48,685
he succeeded.

587
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,364
You can't make this public,
Agent Broyles.

588
00:40:25,786 --> 00:40:28,552
We need to let them
keep their secret.

589
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,930
Dr. Bishop, three state
troopers were killed.

590
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:34,179
And those responsible
were brought to justice.

591
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,983
But the rest of these people...

592
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:39,893
You have no idea
what will happen to them.

593
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,406
They will have no choice
but to study these people.

594
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:46,531
To examine them, to test them,
to humiliate them.

595
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,664
Dr. Bishop,
did you find the machine?

596
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,224
The one that transforms them?

597
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:01,649
Please.

598
00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:08,092
These people
have been harmed enough.

599
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,116
We simply can't...

600
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:14,557
I don't think
you're understanding me.

601
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,926
If you didn't find the machine,

602
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:21,715
there's nothing to report.

603
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,149
Thank you.

604
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,043
Remarkable...

605
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:01,978
How Rose was willing to expose
her secret to right a wrong.

606
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,983
How very brave of her.

607
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:10,036
You did something brave too.

608
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,908
The way you spoke up for those people.
You didn't have to do that, Walter.

609
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,749
I'm proud of you.

610
00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:26,963
I'm glad you choose
to see me the way you do.

611
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,859
Very glad indeed.
