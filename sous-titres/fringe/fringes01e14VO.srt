1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,360
Mr. Jones.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,200
Mr. Kohl.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,000
I have the appeal request

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,230
All prepared and ready to go.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,230
It cause without saying that the
gerenal government not big fans of yours.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,230
You  did after all
steal state's secret.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,960
I think that the best
we can hope for is life.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,030
Hmm?

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,960
All I need is your signature.

10
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,860
Hey.

11
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,060
Mornin'.

12
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,060
Is your father about?

13
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,300
Right here.

14
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,960
Why don't you ask
him what he's doing?

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
I would rather not.

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Listen,do you remember that
prisoner Jones I went to see...

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,730
- In Germany,right? 
- He escaped.

18
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,500
Good for him. How?

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Uh,nobody knows. It makes no sense.

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,400
The German authorities
came to see me last night.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,330
How come when nobody knows
and it doesn't make sense,

22
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,430
They come to us?

23
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,160
Well,what we do know is that Jones

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
Was working with Mitchel Loeb.

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,400
I remember Loeb.

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
That's the guy who
stole my invention.

27
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,100
Yeah,I'm gonna go
and talk to him now.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,860
But can you describe to
me again what you made?

29
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,230
What Loeb was stealing.

30
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,700
And why don't you tell
her the truth this time.

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,600
He kind of sugar-coated
it last time around.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,960
You did? Why?

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,200
Is it something that could
have helped Jones escape?

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
It was a transportation device.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,660
I called it Dizray.

36
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,200
Coined based on the premise

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,030
Disintegration,reintegration.

38
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,100
Dis-re,Dizray.

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you saying that you created...

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,530
A teleportation system,yeah.

41
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,660
Except for this one's meant
to travel through time.

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,200
How's that?

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,260
Assuming someone could solve
the considerable problems.

44
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,000
Coming through,arriving

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,430
Would require weeks of decompression

46
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,900
In a barometric tank.

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,960
And if you survived that,based
on what would happen next,

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,700
You'd likely wish you hadn't.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,200
So you're saying
that Jones,in theory,

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,860
Could have zapped
himself out of prison.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,130
Uh...

52
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,900
Yes.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,160
Disintegration is reached.
Decompression is completed.

54
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,160
Welcome back,Sir

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,230
Cup of tea,please.

56
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,000
Of course.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,900
Firstly,I'd like to thank you

58
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,260
For the work you've done
for bringing me here.

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,000
I understand there
have been sacrifices.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,400
I am grateful to them

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,060
As I am to you.

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,730
Everything is in order then?

63
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,560
Yes,sir. The list is complete.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,900
We've got a lab set
to your specifications.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,200
And the sealant?

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,300
All parts.

67
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,560
Good.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Hey,you know,it's not
a library here,you know.

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
And I don't make loans.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,760
Ah,75 cents,my friend.

71
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,860
'Cause it's old news now,

72
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,230
Given the old internet and all that.

73
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,400
You must be an old traditionalist

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,460
Like myself,right?

75
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,430
Hey,hey,hey,I like these.

76
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,560
You don't see the
two dollar very often.

77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,300
Thanks!

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,930
I'll keep it.

79
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,430
Okay,so,Tommie... You were right.

80
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,900
Yeah,you see that? Grace Kelly?

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,330
She was good.

82
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,600
But Jimmy Stewart was better.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,930
I'm creatin' cinephiles
one reader at a time.

84
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,300
Now,listen,I want you
to check out a movie

85
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,730
Called,uh,Charade.

86
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,600
- Ever seen it? 
- Never heard of it.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,230
Oh. Oh,god.

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,430
Oh!

89
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,060
Oh,uh...

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
There's something in my eyes.

91
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
You okay?

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I...

93
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,860
Ohh...

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Oh,god.

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,300
Tommie,you okay?

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,330
Oh,my eyes!

97
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,100
Oh,my god! Aah!

98
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh,Tommie!

99
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,860
Tommie! Aah!

100
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,960
Someone!

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Ohh!

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh,Tommie!

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Somebody call an ambulance!

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
Anything new?

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,000
We might be on something.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Uh,nothing local on Jones.

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,300
But,uh... we found
some financial records

108
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,760
For Salman Kohl,Jones's attorney.

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
The man found dead in Jones' cell?

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
He kept a slush fund
that he maintained

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Under an assumed name.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,700
Could be a mistress.

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,530
Or something less salacious.

114
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,730
More interesting.

115
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,630
Let me know if you
find something useful.

116
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
I know about David Robert Jones.

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
I know that you helped him escape.

118
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,930
And that you kidnapped
me on that same night.

119
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,260
You know where Jones is.

120
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,430
You're not someone I...
Really wanna work with.

121
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,430
Your transfer order.

122
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,860
To Wallens Ridge state prison.

123
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,700
You know what that
place is like,Mitchell.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
You know what they're
gonna do to you,

125
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,300
What it's gonna be
like that first night?

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,560
The second?

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,460
Doesn't matter if
you find Jones or not.

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,860
He's just a part of the army.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,330
What was written will come to pass.

130
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,260
And nothing you do can stop that.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
Nothing.

132
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,030
Agent Dunham.

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,030
It's me. Get the bissagenous
in the Boston general

134
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,860
Name's Thomas Avery.

135
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,200
Runs a news stand downtown.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,830
His only prior physical conditions

137
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,500
Were high cholesterol
and a weak bladder.

138
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,760
According to witnesses,

139
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,260
... the whole thing happened
in less than two minutes.

140
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,300
Ceramides.

141
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,360
They act as a signaling
molecule in skin.

142
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,330
They control how the cells
grow and differentiate.

143
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,000
Two thoughts come to mind.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,300
The first,that this affliction...

145
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,000
... might have been
caused by a mutation,

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,760
... changing these lipids
to recognize and seal...

147
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,230
... any and all orifices.

148
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,930
Did they check his anus and penis?

149
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,460
You think we could get the
answer to that question...

150
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,500
... without me in the room?

151
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,760
What was the other thought?

152
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,660
Sorry?

153
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,360
You said two thoughts came to mind.

154
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Ah,yes.

155
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,360
The other was...

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,500
... coffee cake.

157
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,230
Tiny pebbles of cinnamon sugar.

158
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,200
Once again,my father.

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,960
You know what this is.

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,260
You think Jones?

161
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,900
Help me with this.

162
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,300
You talked to Loeb.

163
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,230
Did he give anything?

164
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,160
Maybe,but nothing that
relates to this,exactly.

165
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,260
Well,I'm not convinced
this is Jones' work.

166
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,630
And what interest would he
have in a newsstand operator?

167
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,560
That's what we're going to find out.

168
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,630
Peter...

169
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,030
You got a sec?

170
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,630
When I saw Loeb,he said something.

171
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,060
That Jones was only doing
what had been written.

172
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,530
Meaning what? Written where?

173
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,230
I didn't know,but...

174
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,530
... we've never known what
Jones' group ZTF stood for.

175
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe it's not the name
of their organization.

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,960
What if it's the name of their Bible?

177
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,300
Interesting.

178
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,530
So I called a contact at
the German authorities...

179
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,460
And asked him to search
any known document...

180
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,630
... with those initials.

181
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,200
Did he or she find anything?

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,830
Yes,he did.

183
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,200
Z.F.T. Z.F.T.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,430
Scroll down.

185
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,360
Destruction by
advancement of technology.

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,860
It's a self-published
anonymous manuscript.

187
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,060
On their records
only because it was...

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,960
... recovered as evidence
in a police raid...

189
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,260
... in an unrelated case.

190
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,500
They sending it to us?

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,830
They would be if it
hadn't been destroyed...

192
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,330
... ten years ago.

193
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,200
So... I was hoping
that you might have...

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,300
... one of your...

195
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,530
... weird connections.

196
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,000
Weird connections?

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,660
They're always a little weird.

198
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,000
Well,you're always a little weird.

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,530
What do you think? Come on.

200
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,360
I think I got a weird connection.

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,830
Is he contagious?

202
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,300
If he were contagious,

203
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,360
We'd have several more
orificeless bodies by now.

204
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,200
Scalpel,please,and an empty IV bag.

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,700
Empty IV bag? What
exactly are we doing here?

206
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,330
The obvious.

207
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,600
Searching for evidence.

208
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,560
Any scientific clue to
reveal what caused this...

209
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,160
Hear no evil,speak no evil,

210
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,400
... see no evil malady.

211
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,830
The gas trapped within his body...

212
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,560
... may yield important information.

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,330
Worth the study.

214
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,330
Oh,dear God,that is putrid.

215
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,360
On a separate topic,do
you like coffee cake?

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,760
Hey,take a look at this.

217
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,700
I,uh,I know someone at the SEC

218
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,230
I had her send over a
list of every business

219
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,930
That Jones's lawyer has
incorporated for his clients...

220
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,230
... over the last three years.

221
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,960
Figure maybe one of more of them...

222
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,830
... are used to funnel
cash to the Z.F.T.

223
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,700
This is all protected by
lawyer-client privilege.

224
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,060
How did you get her to break that?

225
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,800
We,uh... Dated in college.

226
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,330
And she dumped me,bad,

227
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,830
... so I told her she owed me one.

228
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,200
I... I narrowed down the
list to U.S. Addresses only.

229
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
Good work.

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,900
It's no first folio.

231
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,500
Some tanning,pretty
badly shelf-cocked.

232
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,700
I can give you 40 for it.

233
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,060
Okay.

234
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,500
You don't wanna make that deal.

235
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,400
First edition,THE LAND OF LAUGHS?

236
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,700
No matter what condition it's in,

237
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,060
... it's worth at least twice that.

238
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,860
Ahem.

239
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,830
Thanks.

240
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,760
Have a great day.

241
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,560
Was that really necessary?

242
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,830
Ah,you know me,Markam.

243
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,830
Friend of the people.

244
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,300
What about me?

245
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,660
Aren't I people?

246
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,060
People who shower.

247
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,330
Huh. Who's this friend?

248
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,830
Olivia Dunham.

249
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,130
$5.00 I can name at least
one item on your night stand,

250
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,260
Olivia Dunham.

251
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,800
Don't tell me...

252
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,660
You're gonna like
this. I'm never wrong.

253
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a gift.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,130
Okay,Toni Morrison
novel,something by Obama,

255
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,730
And/or the current
issue of Bon Appetit.

256
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,060
Uh,I'm reading advanced
forensic science...

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,100
... by Annemann.

258
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,630
I keep it next to my gun.

259
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,160
I like this one.

260
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,030
This one's just a
friend,and we need a favor.

261
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
An anonymous,self-published
manuscript.

262
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,560
Uh,destruction by
advancement of technology.

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Sounds sexy and very challenging.

264
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,730
Peter says you're good.

265
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,960
Well,he also says that
you're just a friend,so...

266
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,100
The book,Markam.

267
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,260
We need it.

268
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,630
Today,right?

269
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,900
Right.

270
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,160
Impress me.

271
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,800
Nothing interests me
less than impressing you.

272
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,660
Think I might have something.

273
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,960
Warehouse building in Austin,

274
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,660
leased to Jones' attorney.

275
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,200
Power was cut off for months,

276
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,500
two weeks ago was turned back on.

277
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
The day Jones escaped from prison.

278
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
Could be a safe house.

279
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,230
This is Broyles.

280
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,700
I need a search warrant authorized.

281
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,960
- Sir... 
- Yeah,a warehouse...

282
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,130
Sir,this can't wait.

283
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,100
- What is it? 
- There's a man downstairs

284
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,400
says his name is David Robert Jones.

285
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Everybody down!

286
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't move!

287
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,530
Jones!

288
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,530
Freeze!

289
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,200
I will speak only with
agent Olivia Dunham.

290
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,760
And he just turned himself in.

291
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,900
Two hours ago.

292
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Said he's only speak to agent Dunham.

293
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,500
Hasn't said a word since...

294
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,530
Anything else?

295
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,960
Anything on how he
escaped from prison?

296
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,600
No information.

297
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,460
Just another question. A key.

298
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,000
What key?

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,630
It was found on him when
he turned himself in.

300
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,660
There are no markings on it.

301
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,700
Forensics is doing their thing.

302
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,760
He wanted us to find it.

303
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,330
He wants to talk to
me. Let me in there.

304
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,330
Jones doesn't get
to dictate the terms

305
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,760
of his captivity.

306
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,960
He wouldn't be a captive if
it wasn't under his terms.

307
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,160
The only reason Jones is here
is because he wants to be.

308
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,930
Well,that may be the
case,but the United States

309
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,430
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

310
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,130
That's exactly the kind of
arrogance he's expecting.

311
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,460
What did you say?

312
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,530
The man was clever
enough tostar trek himself

313
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,530
out of a maximum
security German prison.

314
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,530
Elude Interpol,arrive in Boston,

315
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,760
and get himself apprehended.

316
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,230
Simply because he liked the idea.

317
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,160
He's expecting us to
reject his request.

318
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,200
And your choice is what?

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Give Jones what he wants

320
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,260
to demonstrate that we
can be anti-dogmatic?

321
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,430
I don't think that's
what you're saying,

322
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,800
is it,agent Dunham?

323
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,660
Since he arrived in town,an
innocent man was killed

324
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,060
in a shocking and gruesome way.

325
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,230
We don't know that was Jones.

326
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,160
It was Jones,and he has more planned.

327
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,560
And you know that how?

328
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,760
I don't know how to justify a hunch.

329
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,960
Sanford,I don't see any harm...

330
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,130
This isn't a gentleman's
club,Ms. Dunham.

331
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,700
Mr. Jones doesn't just get to choose

332
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
the pretty one.

333
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,200
You wanna get him to talk?

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,130
Join the raid on that
warehouse in Austin.

335
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,300
See what you find.

336
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,660
- How is that... 
- Relevant?

337
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,600
Well,because right now,he's
just an escaped prisoner.

338
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,960
But if he's playing games,as you say,

339
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,230
I doubt he's here to help us.

340
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,830
So show me some hard evidence

341
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,660
that connects him to
that incident downtown.

342
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,430
Agent Dunham.

343
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,060
I got it... the ZFT book.

344
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,500
Stop it. Already?

345
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,260
Markam found some guy who
collects scientific ephemera.

346
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,560
He had a copy in his basement.

347
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,060
The thing was never published.

348
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,530
It was never even
proofed,but check this out.

349
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,930
"the advances of science,"

350
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,530
"which are supposed to expand"

351
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,030
"our knowledge of the universe,"

352
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,430
"will,if not carefully controlled,"

353
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,660
"destroy the world as we know it."

354
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,030
So it's light reading?

355
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,430
Wait,it gets better.

356
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,500
"our technological hubris"

357
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,760
"has brought us not to
the brink of catastrophe,"

358
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,700
"but to the actuality of it."

359
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,730
"but what form will this
inevitable deconstruction"

360
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,100
"of reality take?"

361
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,600
"the answer,to use a
term generally understood"

362
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
"but the specifics of
which you cannot imagine"

363
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
"and which this document
will attempt to describe"

364
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,130
"is warfare."

365
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,060
Well,keep reading.

366
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,900
Will do. Where you headed?

367
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,430
We're going to raid a building

368
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,000
that we think may be a safe house.

369
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,260
Alpha team clear.

370
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,560
Bravo clear.

371
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
What is this?

372
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
It is me.

373
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,500
He was here.

374
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,200
I want everything bagged and tagged!

375
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
Move fast!

376
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,330
I'd like to ask you some questions.

377
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,130
Oh,I believe I made myself clear.

378
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,200
There is another I wish to speak to.

379
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,330
I'm afraid agent Dunham

380
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,700
is preoccupied.

381
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
So lucky you.

382
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,130
You get me.

383
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,700
Well,you don't look well.

384
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,600
Which is why I was hoping
to speak with agent Dunham

385
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,230
as soon as possible.

386
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,830
I prefer to avoid any additional,

387
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,930
unnecessary deaths.

388
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
When agent dunham comes to see me,

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,360
I'll require the following items.

390
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,300
A standard walkie-talkie
with removable crystals,

391
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,330
a metallic ballpoint pen,and
an eyeglass repair kit.

392
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,160
An analog wristwatch.

393
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,030
Your watch would do.

394
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
You sure you don't
need anything else?

395
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,300
Quite sure,yes.

396
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,330
Anything?

397
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Nothing.

398
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,860
All right,let's lock
it up and get back.

399
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,600
What the hell?

400
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,700
I need a med kit! Now!

401
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,430
Quick,help me hold him.

402
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,700
He's suffocating.
I need to trach him.

403
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,660
Oh,come on,come on.

404
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,130
Okay,breathe.

405
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,060
Okay... he's breathing.

406
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,360
No,no,no,no,no!

407
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,800
Uhh! Ah,God.

408
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,600
Where are we?

409
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,400
We've got audio. Visual
coming up right now.

410
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,130
Move in closer on this.

412
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,160
I want to record every twitch.

413
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,030
Oh,finally a welcome face.

414
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,160
A colleague of mine just died.

415
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,060
He was 27 years old.

416
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,000
He was due to get married next month.

417
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes,I tried to prevent that.

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,300
Your agent Harris
needed some convincing.

419
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,060
Here I am.

420
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,000
Have you brought the
items I requested?

421
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,900
This will only take a moment.

422
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,630
Pull in tighter on this,on the hands.

423
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,960
What the hell is he doing?

424
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,600
That's a $1,000 watch.

425
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,060
Whoa!

426
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,500
What's happening in there?

427
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't know.

428
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,330
Now I've... managed
to get us some privacy.

429
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,400
It's just you and me now.

430
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,700
But we haven't much time.

431
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,500
You were responsible for
what happened to Thomas Avery.

432
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,160
Simply the stage setter.

433
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,260
An example that doesn't
need to be followed.

434
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,030
Well,that implies that you're
planning something else.

435
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,930
Something far worse,yes.

436
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,230
What is it?

437
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,360
First... I need your services.

438
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,700
What the hell do you want?

439
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,700
I need you to pass a test.

440
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,260
Get them out of there.

441
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
That device he's made

442
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,530
Is blocking our
surveillance equipment.

443
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,800
He can't hurt us,Sanford.

444
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,830
He's just trying to
show you who's in charge.

445
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,660
When I turned myself in,

446
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,560
There was a key in my
pocket,as I'm sure you're aware.

447
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,260
Take the key,which I
assume is in forensics.

448
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,800
Go to Salem,the amusement
park on Policy Street.

449
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
I've left something there for you.

450
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,860
You need medical attention.

451
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,930
All the assistance...

452
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,560
In this world... Could
not cure me,Ms. Dunham.

453
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,360
It seems...

454
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,300
That when one is dematerialized

455
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,460
On a molecular level
and then reassembled,

456
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,900
There are certain
unadvertised side effects.

457
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,400
But who knows?

458
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,760
Perhaps this task I have for you

459
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,060
Could lead to something
that might help me.

460
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,600
Tell me about the
attack you're planning.

461
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,830
I wouldn't call it that. I'd
call it an insurance policy.

462
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,430
I don't care what you call it.

463
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,100
Even as we speak,a white cargo van

464
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,800
Is transporting an explosive device

465
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,600
Capable of killing
several hundred people

466
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,630
In the manner of the newspaper-salesman
and your diseased FBI colleague.

467
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,400
When is it set to go off?

468
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,860
16 hours from now.

469
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,730
Before anything,you are
going to disable that...

470
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,430
No,you are.

471
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,460
But first,there's
the matter of the key.

472
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,330
That's enough. I want
you out of this room.

473
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,600
Don't worry,Ms. Dunham.

474
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,760
If I wanted to harm you,I would have.

475
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,460
Long ago.

476
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,130
Apologies about the watch.

477
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,230
Jones is planting a device somewhere

478
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,630
Capable of killing more
people in the same way

479
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,030
That guy from the news stand died.

480
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,800
He won't say where or when.

481
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,260
But we need every white van

482
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,730
Rented within the last 48 hours

483
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,800
Tracked down.

484
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,460
In the meantime,I
need two hours alone.

485
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,500
Why? Where are you going?

486
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,930
To get a massage.

487
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,860
I'll tell you when I get back.

488
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,630
Hey,it's me. Where are we at?

489
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,760
We know how the folks
are ending up faceless.

490
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,330
It's a powdered toxin. It's
absorbed through the skin.

491
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,860
It triggers a hyperactivity

492
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,730
In the protein responsible
for scar tissue.

493
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,130
You want any more detail than that?

494
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,860
Uh,not really.

495
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,500
Did you hear that
Jones turned himself in?

496
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,660
Yeah,I did. You get anything?

497
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,160
Yeah,that he's crazy.

498
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,860
And he's planning on using
that toxin again,and soon.

499
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,700
How's Walter coming
with the antidote?

500
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,730
He's working on it.

501
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,260
He says,and I quote,

502
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,160
"It'll be ready when it's
ready and not a moment before."

503
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,860
Great,anything more in the manuscript

504
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
That might suggest
what Jones' end game is?

505
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,160
Well,it reads like a happy combo

506
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Between an anti-science manifesto

507
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,360
And a call to arms.

508
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,300
Call to arms against whom?

509
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,760
Exactly.

510
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
I'll call you back when
I get to the good part.

511
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,630
Yeah,please do.

512
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,730
Maybe it'll help us figure out

513
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,230
Where this next attack is gonna be.

514
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,000
- I'll be back as soon as I get the package Jones left me. 
- OK.

515
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,260
- Was that Olivia? 
- Yeah.

516
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,760
Where's the manuscript?

517
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
Is she bringing coffee cake?

518
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
No,she's not getting food.

519
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,130
Have you seen the manuscript
that I was reading earlier?

520
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,700
It's... fascinating,isn't it?

521
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,030
I was just reading it whilst
sitting on the crapper.

522
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,000
Please,no more information than that.

523
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,060
Can I have it back?

524
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,760
I must read you one excerpt.

525
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Great,well,grab the blanket.

526
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
It's nap time.

527
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,830
We think we understand reality,

528
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,160
but our universe is only one of many.

529
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,500
The unknown truth is
that the way to travel

530
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,460
between them has
already been discovered

531
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,460
by beings much like us,

532
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,700
but whose history is
slightly ahead of our own.

533
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,060
The negative effects
of such visitation

534
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,660
will be irreversible both
to our world and to theirs.

535
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,560
It will begin with a series of unnatural
occurrences,difficult to notice at first...

536
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,860
but growing,not unlike a cancer,

537
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,230
until a simple fact

538
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,900
becomes undeniable.

539
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,360
Only one world will survive.

540
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,030
And it will either be us or them.

541
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,130
Miss Dunham,I know how this appears.

542
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,760
That I've sent you quite a distance

543
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,530
to pick up a child's board game.

544
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,630
But what I've hidden
here is not a game at all.

545
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,660
You're holding an evaluation system,

546
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,060
a series of tests
designed to cultivate

547
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,430
specific,innate skills present
in particular individuals.

548
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,400
Do the first test only.

549
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,860
Complete it successfully,and
come back to see me.

550
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,400
Do this,and no one else will die.

551
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,030
I got the instructions.

552
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,000
So Jones is threatening
to kill hundreds of people

553
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,030
unless I take a test.

554
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,000
No,unless you pass a test.

555
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Fine. What is my passing a test have to
do with Jones killing innocent people?

556
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,130
In a word,insanity.

557
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,900
You can't pose rational questions

558
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,100
when you're dealing
with a guy like Jones.

559
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,230
Indeed.

560
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:30,260
And whatever Mr.
Jones' true goal may be,

561
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,160
we only have eight hours
left until his next attack.

562
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,560
Test one... of ten,by the way.

563
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,260
Turn switch on.

564
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,760
The recruit sits no more
than 24 inches from the device

565
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,060
but cannot touch the light board.

566
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,000
Recruit focuses on light board.

567
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,330
The object of the test
is to systematically

568
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,960
shut down the lights so that
ultimately none are flashing.

569
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,200
How?

570
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,130
Using all your magic powers,I guess.

571
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,160
Curious.

572
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,400
The instructions
refer to the recruit.

573
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,660
The author of the manuscript...
uses the same term.

574
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,730
Many warriors of the
inevitable confrontation

575
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,730
are among us now.

576
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,130
But before they can
be considered soldiers,

577
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,160
they must be regarded as recruits.

578
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,130
And the expectation must be

579
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,460
that they shall be unwilling.

580
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,730
So I'm supposed to just

581
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,930
turn these lights off
by looking at them.

582
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,330
Well,it wouldn't be much of a test

583
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,200
if we could just
take out the battery.

584
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,260
Fine.

585
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,900
Dunham.

586
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,200
We just got a hit.

587
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,660
Steady Car Rentals in New Haven

588
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,060
leased a white van
yesterday morning...

589
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,530
thought you gonna love
this,to one Olivia Dunham.

590
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,860
- No. 
- Oh,yeah,he's messing with you,Liv.

591
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,460
Got local police scouring the area.

592
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,500
So far,no luck.

593
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,130
Thanks,Charlie.

594
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,330
This is just a stupid mind game.

595
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,930
Where are you going?

596
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,860
To end it.

597
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,930
I will not let him
use that device again.

598
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,360
If you're gonna meet with Jones,

599
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,000
I want full surveillance this time.

600
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,660
Sir,the last time you got your way,

601
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,100
we lost a good agent.

602
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,260
Do you really want to
get in the way again?

603
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,330
We have less than seven hours

604
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,230
before something truly
horrific will happen.

605
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,730
Something that I'm trying to stop.

606
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,000
For some reason,Jones
is out to get me.

607
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,760
So sir,would you please
let me handle this?

608
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,130
- I got your test kit. 
- You didn't bring it?

609
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,760
No,I didn't need to,'cause this is...

610
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,060
Your reluctance is to be expected.

611
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,400
I know what you're doing,Mr. Jones.

612
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm trying to get you
to pass test number one.

613
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,060
I know about the manuscript.

614
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,730
The manifesto,Z.F.T.

615
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,200
I know that you believe that
there's some kind of war coming.

616
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,460
You read it?

617
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,030
And that you're recruiting warriors.

618
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,330
That's the word you used,isn't it?

619
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,060
You don't believe you're worthy?

620
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,130
I believe that
everybody,maybe even you,

621
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,760
is entitled to their
own belief system.

622
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,960
But somehow,you got
me into your head.

623
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Somehow.

624
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,530
Yes.

625
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,330
You're among those
treated with cortexiphan.

626
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,030
It's why we had you taken.
We needed confirmation.

627
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,860
Something which
requires a spinal tap.

628
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,300
The next step,had you not escaped,

629
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,160
was to convince you of this.

630
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,760
I have never been
treated with cortexiphan.

631
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,300
I haven't even heard of it.

632
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,460
You wouldn't have.

633
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,130
Well,I don't believe you,Mr. Jones.

634
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,760
What I believe is that you've
created some ridiculous scenario

635
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,430
where people's lives rely
on me attempting and failing

636
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,200
what is obviously an impossible task.

637
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,700
The task is hardly impossible!

638
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,060
I will not let these people die

639
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,300
because of some stupid
game that you're playing.

640
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,560
This is no game!

641
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,730
You need to cooperate,Mr. Jones.

642
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,500
No,Ms. Dunham!

643
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,200
It is you who needs to cooperate!

644
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,000
Mr. Jones?

645
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Pulse is slowing down
to 50 beats per minute.

646
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,530
Get him up there.

647
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,700
Astrid,set up the EKG!

648
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,900
Is this the patient?

649
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,130
Walter,put the cow away,would you?

650
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,100
What is this place?

651
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
It's a freak show.

652
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,260
Thanks for your help.

653
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,360
Thank you.

654
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,400
What's happening?

655
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
You understand,this man
teleported through space.

656
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,260
His molecules disintegrating
and reintegrating.

657
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,400
The very implications of it...

658
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,600
We need a video camera.
We should record this.

659
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,530
Walter,this man is our only chance

660
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,630
To stop a device that could
kill a lot of innocent people.

661
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,200
I need you to stabilize him.

662
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Of course. Okay.

663
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,430
Point taken.

664
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,400
I'll do a thorough exam.

665
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,060
Meanwhile,get me
50ccs of saline,please.

666
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,760
Hey,Astrid,do you mind?

667
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,700
Sure.

668
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,930
No,of course they did.

669
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,200
Why am I not surprised?

670
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,500
Thanks,Charlie.

671
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Anything?

672
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,300
Yeah. That drug cortexiphan.

673
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,560
It's a drug patented but
not approved by the FDA.

674
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
Patented to whom?

675
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,660
Massive Dynamic.

676
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,100
Why am I not surprised?

677
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,260
That's what I just said.

678
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,600
Jones? Jones?

679
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,060
Walter's replenishing
his fluids right now.

680
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,200
But he's still gonna have
to give him a full exam

681
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
Before we even know if
we can wake him back up.

682
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,530
Look,I'm gonna go find out what I can

683
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,530
About cortexiphan,but
in the meantime,

684
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,760
He's actually expecting
me to be able to do it.

685
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,830
To do what?

686
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,660
Test number one. The flashing lights.

687
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,360
Jones won't cooperate
unless I pass the test.

688
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,260
You think we can trick him?

689
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,130
What are you asking me to do?

690
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,330
You want me to open up the light box?

691
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,200
You could see what you could do.

692
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,330
thank you so much for seeing
me at such short notice.

693
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:28,830
As I said,I am always
available to you,Olivia.

694
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,230
What can I do?

695
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,830
- I need information on a drug called cortexiphan. 
- Let me check.

696
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,730
Is everything all right?

697
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,430
My hand,it's been acting up.

698
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,100
I need to have it looked at.

699
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,230
Oh,yes,I recall this.

700
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,660
Cortexiphan.

701
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,530
It was part of a clinical trial

702
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,000
Of a drug that dr.
Bell created in '81.

703
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What is it? If you don't mind.

704
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,930
Dr. Bell theorized that
the human mind at birth

705
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,660
Is infinitely capable,

706
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,560
And that every force it encounters...

707
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,960
Social,physical,intellectual...

708
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,030
Is the beginning of the
process he referred to

709
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,430
As limitation,

710
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,330
A diminishing of that potential.

711
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,760
And cortexiphan?

712
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
It was meant to limit that limitation

713
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,260
To prevent the natural shrinking

714
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,030
Of that brain power.

715
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,530
- To prevent,not undo? 
- Meaning...

716
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,360
That the drug was
administered to children?

717
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,530
Yes.

718
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,630
The drugs were
extensively animal tested.

719
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,630
They were harmless to the
children who received them.

720
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,260
Unfortunately,they
were also unsuccessful.

721
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,160
So dr. Bell abandoned his
research on cortexiphan

722
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,800
In 1983.

723
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,430
Were their trials?

724
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,830
Dr. Bell conducted the trials himself

725
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,300
At Ohio State
University,wooster campus.

726
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,760
Nowhere else?

727
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,630
No.

728
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,830
Why? If you don't mind me asking

729
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,530
Nothing.

730
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,100
That's good to know.

731
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,430
No matter what Jones believes,I
was never given that drug.

732
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,960
William Bell conducted
his trials in ohio.

733
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,200
In 1981,I was three,living
in Jacksonville,Florida.

734
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,260
My dad was stationed
at the naval base there.

735
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,260
That's good.

736
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,200
In other news,

737
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,460
Walter thinks he's gonna be
able to revive Jones soon.

738
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,200
And I was able to
reprogram the light box.

739
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,900
- We should be able to fake Jones out. 
- I knew you can do it. See you soon.

740
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,460
If there's cardiac
arrest,we'll need nitroglycerin.

741
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,030
Peter,prepare...

742
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,800
Mr. Jones,we have two hours

743
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,860
Before your planned attack hits.

744
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,200
And I think I've
passed test number one.

745
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,000
Dr. Bishop...

746
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,330
Without your extraordinary work,

747
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,500
I wouldn't have the pleasure
of making your acquaintance.

748
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,900
I locked the teleporter
away for a reason.

749
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,460
One of which you
are now experiencing.

750
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,100
nevertheless...

751
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,660
It is an honor.

752
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,460
Jones,I pass the test...

753
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,000
You tell us everything we need

754
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,330
In order to stop whatever
it is you're planning.

755
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,960
That was always the deal.

756
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,300
Well done,Ms. Dunham.

757
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,560
Thank you.

758
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,960
Your turn.

759
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,130
Indeed.

760
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,130
923 church street.

761
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,130
The 47th floor.

762
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,160
You better hurry.

763
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,400
This is agent dunham.
I need immediate evac.

764
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,900
923 church street.

765
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,960
There's a device on the 47th floor.

766
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,260
Nicely done.

767
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,200
Good performance.

768
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,260
I need these streets cleared now!

769
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,730
Anyone within a four-block
radius has to move!

770
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,660
Go! Double-time!

771
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,630
Hey,where are we?

772
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,800
Building's about 70% clear.

773
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,060
We lucked out.

774
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,430
They're undergoing renovation,

775
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,230
So not all the floors are occupied.

776
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,560
So the device...

777
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,000
This one's a real mess.

778
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,430
Bomb squad said they can't
move it or diffuse it.

779
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,800
Why?

780
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,660
Because they've never seen
wiring like this before.

781
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,260
Oh,my god.

782
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,200
It's rigged here for a reason:

783
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,260
To blow out the windows.

784
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,000
Four blocks ain't gonna cut it.

785
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Not even close.

786
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
I'm on it.

787
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,060
Contact the weather service.

788
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,260
We need to map the fallout
pattern,and get... up to speed.

789
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,230
Agent Farnsworth.

790
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,760
Hey,it's me.

791
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,430
That son of a bitch
knew what we were doing.

792
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,430
What?

793
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,960
He knew that we were faking him out.

794
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,100
Is he still conscious?

795
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,460
Barely.

796
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,900
Put him on.

797
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,160
It's Olivia.

798
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,000
Hello,you.

799
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,630
I can't do this.

800
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,960
I remain confident that you can.

801
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,560
Look,you know what I did
before,it wasn't real.

802
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,330
Yes... I know,Ms. Dunham.

803
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,530
Before they can be
considered soldiers,

804
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,030
they must be regarded as recruits,

805
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,700
and the expectation must be
that they shall be unwilling.

806
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,400
Mr. Jones,I am willing. I
am willing,but I am not able.

807
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Olivia,we gotta go.

808
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
There's only one way

809
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,830
to disable that device.

810
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,160
You know what that is.

811
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,500
Okay.

812
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,730
You think that I'm valuable.

813
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,030
Valuable enough to
kidnap,to try and train.

814
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,200
You are a rare commodity,true.

815
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,630
Okay...

816
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,900
if you don't deactivate
this device,I'm gonna die,

817
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,160
which means that your
rare commodity is gone.

818
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,730
But I have one thing,Ms. Dunham,

819
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,060
that you do not.

820
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,630
I have faith in you.

821
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,700
There is no red wire,no blue.

822
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,060
Only black.

823
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,260
Cut any one of them,and
the device blows.

824
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,500
Try and remove it,and
the device blows.

825
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,000
If those lights are flashing
when the timer reaches zero,

826
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,930
the device blows.

827
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,060
There is only one way out.

828
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,430
And it's you.

829
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,030
Okay,we need to get
these people out of here.

830
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,100
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa!

831
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,200
Where are you going?

832
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,600
Olivia,we gotta go.

833
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,730
What did Jones say?

834
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,960
Olivia...

835
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,730
I need to do this.
There is no other way.

836
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,960
If you stay here,you
are going to die.

837
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,900
I'm not doing this with you,Olivia.

838
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,200
You are out of your mind.

839
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,330
You did it.

840
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,330
What was that? How did you do that?

841
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't know.

842
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,130
I don't know.

843
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:06,300
Farnsworth.

844
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,560
Yes,sir.

845
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,860
Thank you. We... we will.

846
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,260
Wait... Wait,wait,wait.

847
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,130
She did it,didn't she?

848
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,600
It seems she did.

849
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,030
My girl.

850
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,900
You okay?

851
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,760
I didn't do anything...

852
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,330
with those lights,they...
He planned it.

853
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,630
Jones,it was all just a mind game.

854
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,360
How did he plan it? Plan what?

855
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,830
They were programmed to turn
off when the countdown ended.

856
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,100
Maybe,but... He couldn't have known

857
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,430
when you were gonna arrive.

858
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,600
He couldn't have known
the timing on that.

859
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,100
Well,that's what he did.

860
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,000
Look,I'm the last person to
subscribe to this kind of stuff,

861
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,330
but you were in the zone
out there tonight,Olivia.

862
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,630
The way you stared
down that light box

863
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,700
was like nothing
I've ever seen before.

864
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,930
It wasn't me.

865
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,900
Fine,then,let me
play devil's advocate.

866
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,060
Why did Jones choose you at all?

867
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,230
Because of your father.

868
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,960
He wanted to meet your father.

869
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
He wanted to meet the man

870
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,300
who designed the device

871
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,100
that let him escape from prison.

872
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,660
And you think that's
what all this was about?

873
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,600
Okay... fine.

874
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,500
Look,all I know is
I didn't die tonight.

875
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,400
So I'm pretty much willing
to accept any explanation

876
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,500
you wanna give.

877
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
You wanna go get a drink? Or five?

878
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,030
I've seen you with a whisky bottle.

879
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,730
Jones was just transferred
to Boston general,so...

880
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,530
I have a few questions for him.

881
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,260
It's my last chance.

882
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,160
Yeah.

883
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,430
So in all the excitement of today,

884
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,400
I forgot to say something.

885
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,660
I haven't overlooked the fact

886
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,930
that you actually created
a teleportation machine.

887
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,030
Well...

888
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,000
I suppose I did.

889
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,830
Which,despite the fact
that using it kills you,

890
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:07,500
is... pretty damn cool.

891
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,930
Kills you?

892
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,200
It does something unthinkable,but...

893
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,160
it doesn't kill you.

894
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,900
Hello.

895
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,530
Agent Dunham? Nina Sharp.

896
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,500
Hand's back to normal.

897
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,230
Well,good for you.

898
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,660
I was curious about
that question you asked.

899
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,830
Whether there were other places

900
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,160
where cortexiphan was tested.

901
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,500
Yes?

902
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,200
There was,it turns out,

903
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,560
a second clinical trial.

904
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,530
Though much smaller
