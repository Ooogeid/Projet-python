00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:03,127
<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:07,048
I crossed into another universe
and took a son that wasn't mine.

3
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:10,903
Not a day has passed
without me feeling the burden

4
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:11,982
of that act.

5
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:14,221
Peter deserves to know the truth
about who he is.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,099
You saved his life.
I am sure that he will understand.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,949
You didn't just open up a hole
to the other side.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,396
- You brought me back.
- Son, this...

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,357
I am not your son.

10
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,194
Peter checked himself out
of the hospital three hours ago.

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,619
He's gone.

12
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:30,535
I've decided that we need
to get organized.

13
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,174
You've been smoking marijuana.

14
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,720
I'd hardly classify
what I've just smoked as marijuana.

15
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:37,638
It's a hybrid

16
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,436
of chronic supernova
and afghani kush.

17
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,493
I call it Brown Betty.

18
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,429
I know how you're feeling.

19
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:02,744
It's important to take
control of one's life.

20
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:06,459
Peter is going to come back.

21
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,195
He just needs some time.

22
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:12,310
But he will come back.

23
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,188
Is there news?
Have you found him?

24
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,646
I'm sorry, Walter.

25
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,690
I have some leads that I would like
to follow up, but I have to...

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,910
You have to what?

27
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,573
What can be more important
than finding Peter?

28
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,572
Aunt Liv. The snack machine stole
the dollar you gave me.

29
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:40,926
- Hi, Astrid. Hi, uncle Walter.
- Hi, Ella.

30
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,701
You know what? We have some snacks
back there in the fridge.

31
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,753
- You can go help yourself.
- Thanks.

32
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:49,995
Who's that?

33
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:54,173
- It smells funny in here.
- Rachel's daughter.

34
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,883
Rachel's Olivia's sister.

35
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,734
Rachel had to go to Chicago
for the weekend, so...

36
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,596
she asked
if I could look after Ella.

37
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,061
I was wondering
if maybe you could watch her...

38
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:06,418
I couldn't possibly
look after anyone else.

39
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:09,629
- I'm well into phase one.
- I think she's talking about me.

40
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,691
Walter just smoked something
called "Brown Betty."

41
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:15,694
- Hi, cow.
- Be careful, Stella.

42
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,556
Gene, Gene, no licking.
No licking.

43
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:22,152
You should only have
to watch her for a few hours.

44
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:26,038
Don't worry, Olivia. I will be here.
We would love to have her.

45
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,042
You're killing him.
You're not supposed to touch the sides.

46
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,177
What kind of doctor are you?

47
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,689
You're not even trying.

48
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,517
His heart.

49
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,009
All you've done is eat all my snacks
and talk about weird stuff.

50
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:40,803
And everything makes you laugh.

51
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,682
I know!
Why don't you tell me a story?

52
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:48,310
- I'm not very good at stories.
- Didn't you used to tell stories?

53
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,524
I'm sure Mrs. Bishop did, but...

54
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,143
No, I never told Peter stories.

55
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,688
I was always...

56
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,491
too busy with my work.

57
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:07,496
What about your parents, uncle Walter?
Didn't they tell you stories?

58
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,139
My mother...

59
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,667
loved Chandler

60
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:17,464
and another writer
called Dashiell Hammett.

61
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,305
She loved detective stories.

62
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,638
And musicals!
She adored musicals!

63
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:29,268
She often would dress me up
to play parts in plays at school.

64
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,109
I was roughed up
quite a lot as a child.

65
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:36,233
Walter, I think that Ella would
really enjoy a story.

66
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:38,387
Once upon a time.

67
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,363
Well, all right. Are you ready?

68
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,602
Once upon a time...

69
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,626
there was an accomplished detective.

70
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,865
Except that she had
decided to retire,

71
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,549
pack it in,

72
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,706
because there was one mystery
she could not solve.

73
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:05,867
What was that?

74
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:08,508
How to mend a broken heart.

75
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,124
My name is Rachel.
I'm sorry to just show up like this,

76
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:22,321
but I have left you several messages,
and I'd like to hire you.

77
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,437
My boyfriend, he's gone missing.

78
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:27,670
As you can see, I'm kinda busy.

79
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,626
He got in over his head
to a gambler.

80
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:32,915
A guy named Big Eddie. I'm afraid
something bad may have happened to him.

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,958
Drown him?

82
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,223
I'm sorry, what?

83
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,083
No, thank you.

84
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,648
You know, most times
when someone comes in here

85
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,226
worried that their sweetheart's
gone missing, or worse...

86
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,169
By the time they find out
what I usually find out,

87
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,766
they wind up wishing
he really were dead.

88
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:52,977
What do you usually find out?

89
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:54,853
Rachel, is it?

90
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,751
Do yourself a favor.

91
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,636
Go home.

92
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,466
He wouldn't do
what you're suggesting.

93
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:05,688
We met only a few weeks ago, but...

94
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:07,908
it was love at first sight.

95
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,619
You probably don't believe
something like that exists.

96
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:16,503
But I assure you it does.

97
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:21,807
<i>Something happens
and I'm head over heels</i>

98
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:26,927
<i>I never find out
till I'm head over heels</i>

99
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:31,642
<i>Something happens
and I'm head over heels</i>

100
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,905
<i>Don't take my heart,
don't break my heart</i>

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,829
<i>Don't, don't,
don't throw it away</i>

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,860
What those school kids
must've done to you.

103
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,337
Maybe you should teach me algebra.

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,230
You see, the...

105
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:53,246
the medication
that uncle Walter is on,

106
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,642
causes his posterior

107
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,141
and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles

108
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:01,670
to contract his larynx's.

109
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,134
Anyway, what was I saying?

110
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
True love.

111
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,818
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

112
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,981
On the telephone two days ago.

113
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,632
Okay, and what's his name?

114
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,077
Wait a minute. That's wrong.

115
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,910
- My mom doesn't love Peter.
- Of course not.

116
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,526
It's just a story.

117
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,212
But,

118
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,491
as with all good stories,

119
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,877
things aren't always as they seem.

120
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,253
So where were we?

121
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,919
She just took the case.

122
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,381
Yes, how could she not?

123
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,871
What Rachel didn't know

124
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:54,306
is that detective Olivia
once believed in love.

125
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,389
Especially great love.

126
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:00,288
And, if for no other reason,
she took this case

127
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,266
to see if such a love
really existed.

128
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,010
Now, this is where things
might get a bit frightening.

129
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,712
I'm not sure you'd want me to go on.

130
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,574
Does it have to do with Peter?

131
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:14,275
Maybe.

132
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,212
It just might.

133
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:20,688
You see, just as Olivia

134
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,751
was gathering the facts from Rachel,

135
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,893
far on the other side of town,

136
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,410
a young man had gone into hiding

137
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,148
because he had in his possession

138
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,165
a very special item.

139
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,201
What kind of item?

140
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,500
As it happens...

141
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:42,930
A heart.

142
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:47,508
But a heart unlike anything
the world had ever seen.

143

Now...

149
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,890
The measure of a good detective

150
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:26,496
is where she gets
her information from.

151
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,350
Is he here?

152
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:46,293
Detective Dunham knew
some high people in low places.

153
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,358
<i>And you just can't
escape from the sound</i>

154
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,259
<i>Don't worry too much,
it'll happen to you</i>

155
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:02,944
<i>We were children once
playing with toys</i>

156
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:11,740
Hello, lieutenant Broyles.

157
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,749
Good to see you.

158
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,658
What?
You're not gonna say hello?

159
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,269
I didn't know
if you actually meant hello

160
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,002
or if you were just
stringing me along.

161
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,593
You're good at that.

162
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,625
I need a favor.

163
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,585
Must be a good one.

164
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,080
Not as good a favor
as pretending six years ago

165
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,786
I didn't see a cop on the beat

166
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,911
plant evidence to get a promotion.

167
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,220
But yeah, it's important.

168
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,475
What is it?

169
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,269
Missing person.

170
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,641
Never seen him.

171
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,159
What about this?

172
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,111
Does it mean anything to you?

173
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:59,074
That guy's sweetheart found it
in her apartment the night he vanished.

174
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,253
It's a company logo.
Massive Dynamic.

175
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,966
Ever heard of them?

176
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,152
- No. What do they do?
- Question is, what don't they do?

177
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,081
<i>Indeed, what don't they do?</i>

178
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,049
<i>Olivia did her homework</i>

179
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:24,013
<i>and soon found out some
of the things they did do.</i>

180
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,108
<i>Like what?</i>

181
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,520
<i>Massive Dynamic made its money
at any cost.</i>

182
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,668
<i>A vile firm
that never missed an opportunity</i>

183
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,547
<i>to exploit the little guy.</i>

184
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:36,135
<i>Profiteering off the creativity
of others.</i>

185
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,107
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you so much for seeing me.

186
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:45,078
Detective Broyles
called on your behalf.

187
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,674
He said you were looking for someone?
I may be able to provide information?

188
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,677
His name is Peter Bishop.

189
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:57,003
I'm investigating his disappearance
on behalf of his fiancee.

190
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,897
She believes he may be in trouble.

191
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:00,726
That wouldn't surprise me.

192
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,976
Whatever trouble he's in,
I'm sure he deserves much worse.

193
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,952
Peter Bishop is a con man
with many talents and many identities,

194
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:09,227
all of them suspect.

195
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,814
Small cons
to large scale industrial espionage,

196
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,273
with only one person's interests
at heart...

197
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,318
his own.

198
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,491
I see.

199
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,139
But I can tell you one thing.

200
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,366
If he's pretending
to love this woman,

201
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,284
he must be using her somehow.

202
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,788
For her sake and yours,
I hope he stays missing.

203
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,581
He's dangerous.

204
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,188
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:35,415
My attention is required
on another matter.

206
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,411
Of course.

207
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,507
Thank you so much for your time.

208
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,583
You should proceed with caution.

209
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,313
I meant it when I said
that Peter Bishop is dangerous.

210
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:02,558
It's me.

211
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:05,491
There has been a development.

212
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,313
<i>Hello, this is Rachel.
Please leave a message.</i>

213
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,299
This is Olivia Dunham.

214
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,916
I need to talk to you.
It's about Peter Bishop.

215
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,522
Could you give me a call
as soon as you get this?

216
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:22,455
<i>Help me, miss Dunham!</i>

217
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,264
That's not how it goes.
She can't be dead.

218
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:10,445
Why not?

219
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,961
Probably because it's her mother.

220
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,275
No, that's not it.

221
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,713
Because that's not how stories work.

222
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,520
She's in love, true love.

223
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,009
She can't die.

224
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,278
But as I have said,

225
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,531
in this story,
things are not as they seem.

226
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,162
She was an actress.

227
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,577
Her real name wasn't even Rachel,
it was Kelsey.

228
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:34,513
Don't ask me what to make of it,
we're in the dark.

229
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,439
But whoever did this was good.

230
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,749
Didn't leave fingerprints.

231
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,335
We can't even identify
what type of weapon he used.

232
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,299
But one thing we both know,
Dunham...

233
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,134
death seems to follow you around.

234
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:50,167
What you sayin' there, chief?

235
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,053
I'm saying I want you
as far away as possible.

236
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,602
Just when my interest is piqued?

237
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:58,029
Keep nosing around,
and you and your interest

238
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,277
can spend some time
as a guest of the state.

239
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,857
It's three hot meals and a bed.

240
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,321
It's tempting. But...

241
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,664
I think I'll pass.

242
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,148
I'm serious, Dunham.

243
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,180
Time to leave things
to the big boys.

244
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,570
Okay, you win.

245
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,976
<i>Directory assistance?</i>

246
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:48,065
Yes, operator,
I would like an address, please.

247
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,902
<i>Go ahead, hon. What's the name?</i>

248
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:53,034
For Dr. Walter Bishop.

249
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,536
It's you.

250
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,287
Kind of.

251
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,939
Slightly less handsome
than your uncle Walter,

252
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,375
but equally brilliant.

253
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,169
A taker, a dreamer.

254
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,334
And Olivia would soon discover

255
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,258
that he was the one
that got her mixed up in all this.

256
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,305
So you're saying that you hired her
to hire me to find Peter Bishop?

257
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,948
- That's right.
- Why didn't you come to me yourself?

258
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,478
Your reputation precedes you,
miss Dunham.

259
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,296
You aren't the best,
but you're selective.

260
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,568
You only take cases
where someone has lost

261
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,153
their heart to love.

262
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,530
So I used her to get your attention.

263
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,574
I never meant for her to be harmed.

264
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,286
Well, you've got my attention now,
Dr. Bishop.

265
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,389
Now who the hell is Peter Bishop,
and why are you looking for him?

266
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,508
He was my lab assistant.

267
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,334
You got the same name.
You related?

268
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,163
Just coincidental,

269
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,881
Although I did grow
to love Peter as a son.

270
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,256
But apparently,

271
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,718
he was far more dangerous
than I feared.

272
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,054
He stole something from me.

273
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:55,482
My most...

274
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,241
important invention.

275
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,814
I have spent my life making things

276
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,149
that bring joy and happiness,

277
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:09,225
to make the world a better place.

278
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:15,533
Bubble gum was one of my first.

279
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:19,560
Flannel pajamas.

280
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,470
Rainbows.

281
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:25,353
And my latest project,
singing corpses.

282
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,628
Two, three, four...

283
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,400
<i>Who can take a sunrise</i>

284
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,298
<i>Who can take a sunrise</i>

285
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,722
<i>Sprinkle it with dew</i>

286
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,051
<i>Sprinkle it with dew</i>

287
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,829
<i>Cover it with chocolate
And a miracle or two</i>

288
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,445
<i>The candy man</i>

289
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,533
<i>The candy man can
'cause he mixes it with love</i>

290
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:44,553
<i>And makes the world taste good</i>

291
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,817
Why not bring a little life
to the dead, I say.

292
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,209
Their harmonies are still a bit off.

293
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,894
What's this?

294
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,286
That's a hug, of course.

295
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,122
He invented hugs?

296
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,210
Yes, my dear.

297
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:05,900
He invented everything
that is wonderful in the world.

298
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,509
Teddy bears,
and chocolate bars, and...

299
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,881
And something
even more remarkable than that.

300
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,476
A heart.

301
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,666
A glass heart.

302
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,563
What makes it so special?

303
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,465
Put simply, it's a power source.

304
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,309
But it's capable
of many wondrous things.

305
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,900
And until quite recently...

306
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:29,885
I was kept alive by this...

307
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,624
glass heart.

308
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,154
I had a bad heart,

309
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,054
And so I invented the glass heart.

310
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,871
And then a few nights ago,

311
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:40,658
someone slipped into my room

312
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,807
And stole it while I was asleep.

313
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,834
I've done what I can
with these batteries.

314
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:49,711
It's kept me stable, but...

315
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,547
if I don't get my heart back,
I'll die.

316
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,016
You think Peter Bishop
stole your heart?

317
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,051
They disappeared at the same time.

318
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,922
This heart is priceless.

319
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,224
Who knows what somebody
would pay for it.

320
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:06,644
I have so much good left to do.

321
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:10,156
If I die, I'll never get
to finish any of them.

322
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,315
All of my ideas...

323
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:18,072
they will all die with me.

324
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,701
She's gonna help him, right?

325
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,903
Of course.

326
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,399
But first, she needed
to rehire her assistant,

327
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,502
Esther Ficklesworth.

328
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:37,400
I have plenty of experience
with all kinds of people.

329
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:39,986
I'm sure that would come in handy,
right?

330
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:44,346
I mean, mental patients
probably need tons of patience.

331
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,021
And love too.
They probably need love, right?

332
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:55,390
<i>I really need this job</i>

333
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:59,340
<i>Please God, I need this job</i>

334
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:05,396
<i>I've got to get this job</i>

335
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,816
I'm sorry, excuse me.

336
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:12,987
It's my old boss now.

337
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,587
Can you give me just a second?

338
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,881
She only calls when it's important.

339
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,507
Or when she gets lost.

340
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,510
What do you want?

341
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,277
New case. I need you.

342
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:23,972
<i>You sent me packing this morning,</i>

343
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,309
and you owe me six months' back-pay.

344
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,519
What makes you think I'm gonna drop
everything just because you call?

345
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,213
Because it's important.

346
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:34,148
And because that's just
the kind of girl you are.

347
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,859
Drop what you're investigating.

348
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,292
Who the hell are you?

349
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,912
I'm the man who doesn't let
his feelings get him into trouble.

350
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:02,494
Don't stick your heart out
where it doesn't belong.

351
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,157
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

352
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,992
Oh, no.
It feels great, actually.

353
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,765
Please, keep doing it.

354
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,624
I can't believe you got sucked back
into business over true love.

355
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:35,048
You know that's your problem,
isn't it?

356
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:38,766
You're always looking for something
that doesn't even exist.

357
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,204
It is not true.

358
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,844
I'm not looking for someone
who's gonna give his heart to the world.

359
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,947
Maybe somewhere in the universe
there's gotta be a guy

360
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,308
who will keep me warm when I'm cold,

361
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,245
feed me when I'm hungry,

362
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,877
and maybe, on occasion,
take me dancing.

363
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,736
That's odd.

364
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:03,639
It looks like it's healing.

365
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,392
What kind of weapon
did you say he used?

366
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,954
Nothing that I'd ever seen before.
It was, like, some kind of...

367
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,254
laser.

368
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,888
This is the same kind of wound
that killed Rachel.

369
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,587
So the man who attacked me
is the same man who took her heart.

370
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:21,573
Draw it.

371
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:23,341
Draw what?

372
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:24,740
The weapon.

373
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:26,780
I have an idea.

374
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:31,368
The patent on this device
was taken out last year.

375
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,644
Pretty cool little device,
if I recall.

376
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,174
Was patented by this whiz-bang
tech company out of Manhattan.

377
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:42,735
Boy, I wish I could work
somewhere like that.

378
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,260
Big outfit,

379
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:46,866
all kinds of spy stuff.

380
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,451
They go by the name of...

381
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,269
Massive Dynamic.

382
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,747
You can't go in there!

383
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,918
A few hours ago,
a man attacked me with that,

384
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,838
and told me to forget I'd ever heard
the name Peter Bishop.

385
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,721
Now I can call the feds
or you can tell me the truth.

386
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:06,233
You choose, lady.

387
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,472
Bring me the file
on the quantum laser.

388
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,044
The device was developed here
in our biomedical research lab.

389
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:18,938
It was designed as a surgical tool.

390
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,926
Several months ago,
one of our prototypes was stolen.

391
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,276
But tell me...

392
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:26,237
this man who attacked you,
was he bald,

393
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,474
with an odd cadence to his voice?

394
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:30,408
Who is he?

395
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,339
Not he, they.

396
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:34,620
We call them the Watchers.

397
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,526
These people are dangerous

398
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,583
and they don't make idle threats.

399
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,937
You should know what
you're getting into, miss Dunham.

400
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,006
She was lying.

401
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:45,936
Who?

402
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:49,980
- She was lying, wasn't she?
- What makes you think that?

403
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:52,305
I don't know,
I just don't trust her.

404
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,268
Smart girl.

405
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,476
You're getting ahead
of the narrative, but...

406
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,506
you're thinking
along the right lines.

407
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,899
Because detective Olivia
didn't trust her either. Now...

408
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,469
- Hello?
- <i>It's me. You got anything?</i>

409
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,097
<i>Nina Sharp's company,
Massive Dynamic,</i>

410
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,974
the founder and CEO
is a guy named William Bell.

411
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,680
- <i>You ever heard of him?</i>
- No. Should I have?

412
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:43,397
<i>Well, it seems he's a sort of
Scientific Christopher Columbus.</i>

413
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,318
He's always searching for what's right
on the edge of our imagination.

414
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,324
But here is the interesting part.

415
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:52,156
In the past few years,
no one has seen him.

416
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,530
No press conferences,
no public appearances.

417
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:58,162
It's like he just disappeared
off the face of the earth.

418
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,606
Okay, so what's that got to do
with Peter Bishop?

419
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,245
<i>I don't know.</i>

420
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,237
<i>But that's weird, right?</i>

421
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,170
Listen, I gotta go.

422
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:08,881
Be careful.

423
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,566
Okay, ma.

424
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,858
I have news.
Is it safe to talk?

425
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,443
<i>Of course, no one can hear us.</i>

426
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,883
<i>- What is it?</i>
- I found it.

427
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,290
<i>The glass heart?</i>

428
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,741
You were right.
Peter Bishop has it.

429
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:38,472
<i>So where is he?
Where's the boy?</i>

430
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:41,802
We don't know yet.
But we'll find him.

431
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,379
<i>That's fabulous news.</i>

432
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:46,919
<i>Well done, Nina.
I knew you could do it.</i>

433
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:50,006
William,
I've been going out of my mind.

434
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:52,474
<i>By utilizing the heart's power,</i>

435
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,451
<i>we'll be able to create
a stable door between universes.</i>

436
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:58,380
And after all this time,
We can finally be together again.

437
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:00,141
<i>I know, my love. </i>

438
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:20,661
Excuse me.

439
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,216
She is awake.

440
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,960
I see.

441
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,005
I suppose I should feel
sorry for you.

442
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:33,966
None of these should've been
your concerns.

443
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,761
The truth is I did everything
I could to protect you.

444
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,997
I warned you to stay away from this,
but you didn't listen.

445
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:42,318
Now you've given me no choice.

446
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,829
So you're gonna send me
somewhere far away,

447
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:48,314
where I won't be able to tell anybody
what you wanna do with that glass heart?

448
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:50,239
Not quite.

449
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,970
Go ahead, Mr. Gemini.

450
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,536
Help me!

451
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:07,226
I heard you were looking for me.

452
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:13,334
- Feeling better?
- Do you mean is a hot shower

453
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,480
better than drowning
in a pine coffin?

454
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:16,879
Much. Thank you.

455
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,509
I take it you don't live here.

456
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,316
No, but nobody else does either.

457
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,429
Seemed like a pretty good place
to hide out.

458
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:27,765
But this is yours.

459
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:30,743
What is it?

460
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,264
You hungry?

461
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,254
So how'd you know I was drowning?

462
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:40,486
Coffee?

463
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:42,812
One sugar. Thanks.

464
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:46,352
Well, like I told you before,
I heard somebody was looking for me.

465
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:49,906
A cop named Olivia Dunham.
So I was following you.

466
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,000
Someone's been giving you
false information,

467
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,999
because I'm not a cop,
I'm a private detective.

468
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,790
I see.

469
00:29:58,136 --> 00:29:59,088
You like jazz?

470
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,926
Miles, Duke, Louis, John Coltrane...

471
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,429
You can tell a lot about a person
from the music they listen to.

472
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,838
And whether or not they dance.

473
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,894
Well, jazz...
not so much.

474
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,344
But dancing?

475
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,058
Sure.

476
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,037
Well, I guess we're opposites.

477
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:22,601
I hate to dance.

478
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:25,990
I'd take you, though.

479
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,884
You would?

480
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,496
Why's that?

481
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,350
I don't know,
seems like it'd be fun.

482
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,209
You look like a good dancer.

483
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,871
You know, all this is very nice,
and I'm grateful that you saved my life,

484
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:50,264
but I know who you are,
and I know what you did.

485
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,475
Wanna know
why I was looking for you?

486
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:54,894
Dr. Walter Bishop hired me.

487
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,812
I know you took his glass heart.

488
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:01,917
Is that what he told you?

489
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,450
That I stole his heart?

490
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:08,902
What else did Walter Bishop
tell you?

491
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,245
That without his heart he would die.

492
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,747
And that all the good he does
for this world would die with him.

493
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,958
Well, I guess I'm not the only one
who's been given false information.

494
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,502
You saying that's not true?

495
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:21,183
Come with me.

496
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,513
147 pins.

497
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,544
Each one represents a child
injured by Walter Bishop.

498
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:35,392
Injured how?

499
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,478
Walter's invented
a great many things.

500
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:39,982
Wondrous things.
That much is true.

501
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,981
But what he didn't tell you

502
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:43,996
is where his ideas come from.

503
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,362
Elephants, rainbows,
licorice sticks...

504
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:49,414
They come
from the dreams of children.

505
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:53,262
He steals children's dreams

506
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,996
And he replaces them
with nightmares.

507
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,999
That's what this is,
a pattern of destruction.

508
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,467
Of damaged kids,

509
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,920
shattered innocence.

510
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:06,732
Who else knows about this?

511
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:08,314
Nobody.

512
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,138
I worked for him for years,
and I didn't even know.

513
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:15,957
Why I was willing to die
so that he could live.

514
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,508
It's your heart.

515
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,404
I was born with it.

516
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,857
And I was willing
to give it to Walter,

517
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,081
'cause of all the good he's done.

518
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,511
Because of all the good he could do.

519
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,815
I thought that his life
was so much more valuable than mine.

520
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,860
At least until I learned the truth.

521
00:32:50,154 --> 00:32:53,279
Walter Bishop isn't responsible
for all the goodness in the world.

522
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,682
But he is responsible
for so much evil.

523
00:33:05,102 --> 00:33:05,816
Hell.

524
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,694
- What is it?
- They found us.

525
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,155
Run!

526
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,506
I knew you were a good dancer.

527
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,375
You really cut a rug out there.

528
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:15,302
You're not so bad yourself.

529
00:34:22,497 --> 00:34:24,247
I need your help, Olivia.

530
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:27,645
I'm dying.

531
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,126
I got them.

532
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:43,456
So what do I do?

533
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:46,482
Well...

534
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:49,628
You ever play that game <i>Operation</i>?

535
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,381
It's just like that,
except in reverse.

536
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,470
You gotta put those batteries
into my chest.

537
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:58,988
But whatever you do,

538
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,848
don't touch the nerve endings.

539
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,267
And what if I do?

540
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,227
Don't.

541
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,263
You're gonna be fine.

542
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,361
Just go slow,

543
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,397
And take them one at a time.

544
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,299
So what made you
wanna be a detective?

545
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,118
I don't know.

546
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:44,578
I guess that
I just always knew what it was.

547
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,252
I was meant to do.

548
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,890
And what's that?

549
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,264
To care for people.

550
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:55,402
Then who cares for you?

551
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,436
I did it.

552
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,139
There's one more.

553
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,883
Must be nice to know who you are.

554
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:20,991
To know your place in the world.

555
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:24,611
So what about you?

556
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,959
I thought I did.

557
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,878
I thought I knew who I was.

558
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,119
But I was wrong.

559
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,250
Done.

560
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,550
Please, Peter.

561
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,926
<i>For once in my life</i>

562
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,012
<i>I have someone who needs me</i>

563
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:04,847
<i>Someone I've needed so long</i>

564
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:10,464
<i>For once unafraid</i>

565
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:14,815
<i>I can go where life leads me</i>

566
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,244
<i>And somehow I know</i>

567
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:21,071
<i>I'll be strong</i>

568
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,701
<i>For once in my life</i>

569
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:30,776
<i>I won't let sorrow hurt me</i>

570
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:36,461
<i>Not like it's hurt me before</i>

571
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:41,841
<i>For once I have something</i>

572
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,784
<i>I know won't desert me</i>

573
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,403
<i>I'm not alone anymore</i>

574
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,990
You did it.

575
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,167
You be careful.

576
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:26,094
These batteries aren't gonna last long.
We have to get my heart back.

577
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:28,764
Those men who attacked us,
they work for Nina Sharp.

578
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,224
But Nina Sharp isn't the one
who's got your heart.

579
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:33,395
Then who does?

580
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,858
Put it down, Dr. Bishop.

581
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:43,925
How did you know it was me?

582
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:47,051
The device,
the one that came through the wall,

583
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,490
I knew that I had seen it
someplace before.

584
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:56,520
You brought Nina Sharp's Watchers
to your side, didn't you?

585
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,479
I never meant to hurt anyone.

586
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:18,818
I never...

587
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,566
I can change, you'll see.

588
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:24,569
I can make up
for all the harm I've done.

589
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,363
Peter, please.

590
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:29,225
<i>Who can take the sunrise</i>

591
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,284
<i>Sprinkle it with dew</i>

592
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,587
<i>The candy man can</i>

593
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:42,702
Peter, please.

594
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:48,635
It's too late, Walter.

595
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,106
There's some things you can't undo.

596
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,849
<i>The candy man can</i>

597
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,680
<i>'Cause he mixes it with love</i>

598
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:11,652
<i>And makes the world taste good</i>

599
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:14,286
Are you kidding?

600
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,121
That's not a proper ending.

601
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:17,622
Don't you know?

602
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:20,444
All good stories start
with "Once upon a time",

603
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:23,128
and they end
with "Happily ever after".

604
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,006
You don't know how to tell stories,
uncle Walter.

605
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,425
I'll tell you how the story ends.

606
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,138
Peter, please. I can change.

607
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:35,891
I can fix the damage I've done.

608
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,518
Please, give me another chance.

609
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:46,693
And Peter looked inside
Walter's eyes

610
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,861
And realized there was still
goodness inside him.

611
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:53,705
So Peter took his special heart,

612
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,676
and with all his might,
he split it in two.

613
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:02,080
And the heart was so magical
that it still worked.

614
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:33,486
And together, they made goodness,

615
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,561
and lived happily ever after.

616
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:38,187
The end.

617
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,295
- We had so much fun.
- Did you?

618
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,714
- That's great.
- We played games kind of badly.

619
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,301
- Then uncle Walter told me a story.
- I'm sorry, Walter. No luck.

620
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,011
His ending wasn't very good.

621
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:58,056
It was sad.
But I fixed it for him.

622
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,170
Didn't I, uncle Walter?

623
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:03,254
Yes, my dear, you were right.

624
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:06,191
Yours was a proper ending.

625
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:11,464
Yours was
a much better ending, indeed.

626
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,721
The boy has not returned.

627
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,533
And I do not believe Dr. Bishop
remembers my warning.

628
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,335
Yes, I am concerned too.
