 than I expected.

170
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,057
Oh, God, or more.

171
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,543
 What's interesting?

172
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:06,975
Mom?

173
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,149
Are you sure it was s yoga 
 what we did lose weight?

174
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,858
So-Is that all this time I thought

175
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:27,323
you were taking classes 
 yoga, have you been here?

176
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,576
I thought not let me do that, you know, 
 so feel the violence.

177
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,984
Not that you were 
 Cambodia bombing.

178
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:38,456
Do I love boxing? No. 
 But it is a sport.

179
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,546
S but no more lies,

180
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,491
or arm pairs.

181
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,985
All I did was show Ginny 
 Biography and a picture of Clint

182
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,988
Web site gym, 
  then leap like a cat

183
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,468
and said that if no salÃas 
 Ã © l with, she will.

184
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:51,925
And degustaciÃ   wine?

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,807
That was in large part to Trevor.

186
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,620
Does not work at a station of radio.

187
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:58,921
It is my tutor. Besides working in s 
 bar that you like, Tres Equis.

188
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:02,188
As I can see that 
 make things work between You and Clint.

189
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,877
Dear, Clint is a man 
 great, really.

190
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:10,135
But we have fundamental disagreements.

191
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,771
Is a Republican, and what have you?

192
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,337
It's like someone says,

193
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:16,520
"Aha, you are the best portions of pizza ,

194
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,202
© but sneezes on her. "

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,235
No matter what is so perfect 
 if you are covered by a sneeze.

196
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,736
Marshall, Do you let a minute?

197
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,086
What happened ?

198
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,125
Abama suponÃa we are a 
 found at degustaciÃ up of wines.

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,501
Novato.

200
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,076
Look, you are Rocky, I'm Mickey.

201
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,363
- I want to catch the hen. 
 - What?

202
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:41,271
Con-a-more, NIA ± o. SÃ © exactly 
 what I'm doing.

203
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:44,144
I suppose that if I used the 
 entrance me Marshall

204
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,525
for wine degustaciÃ , 
 we hubiÃ © ramos found.

205
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,512
Perde will by all this.

206
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,635
Apparently, my son is 
 Metiches a secret.

207
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,081
Sometimes it gets a bit ...

208
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,559
 Too excited?

209
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,060
- It is one of his best qualities. 
 - True.

210
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,025
Marshall is a guy in-ble.

211
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,165
SÃ © that whatever you do, 
 comes from a good place.

212
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,984
Wanted to say what 
 s the same for most people.

213
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:15,551
So, What are we going to do 
 n  degustaciÃ with this wine?

214
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:25,017
So that, Clint, Marshall told me to 
 das classes Boxing Free

215
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,488
for children from poor areas.

216
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,502
I told you exactly that.

217
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:33,033
Think what will life 
 Clint without these guys:

218
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:36,658
Drogas, armas... pelea de perros?

219
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:37,375
Too.

220
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,445
Well, that was a good spectator! Ass.

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,959
- Although you do is admirable. 
 - No deal.

222
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:47,272
Sabes, producimos un pequeño segmento
de "Héroes de la comunidad"

223
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,945
No station in the PSB for the job.

224
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,998
Your work in the gym would be 
 a very good piece.

225
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:54,381
I'm very flattered, but the 
 I really do not have the rite methods.

226
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,667
 At least he'll think s?

227
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,600
Do not leave me n entrar.

228
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,140
Apparently, I am not enough 
 great wine to spit in a bucket.

229
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,720
Well, must go home-owners alike.

230
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:11,669
 And to prove the missing Chateau 2005 
 de Chinon Les Coulaine Picasso?

231
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:13,990
I will never forgive you.

232
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,238
Go to mob and drink.

233
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,370
Wait here with the © ny ± o.

234
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,371
I come from a long, distinguished line -

235
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:24,590
de entusiastas de cerveza de una lata.

236
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,496
You know, even I was interested in wine

237
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:29,097
Pela-when I saw the film "Sideways"

238
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,651
and all that thinking was pruning 
 "God Mao, please! llense comfortable."

239
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,516
And then I had my first cup

240
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,606
the Russian River Valley Barbera

241
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:41,163
© and found myself using 
 the word "mellow."

242
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,397
CAA is a field-day.

243
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,643
Why the hell is still moving?

244
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,555
I will go on the other side.

245
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:57,445
Trevor, What you doing?

246
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,351
-  "Mirone is a word? 
 - No.

247
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,836
Well, then I'm not doing that.

248
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,286
Hello. I'm Liv. 
 I am the mother of Claire.

249
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,871
Is Claire's mother? 
  Really?

250
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,565
- You must have many stories. 
 - Trevor.

251
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,624
If you do not mind me say,

252
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,730
his daughter is beautiful increased substantially,

253
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:17,194
- But it really is a bother. 
 - I see you know very well.

254
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,209
As the palm of your smart 
 sexy and critical hand.

255
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:22,062
I think you found a good, Claire.

256
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,748
Not Found ©. Not me-o.

257
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,802
Never me 
 none of their boyfriends.

258
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:26,807
Not my boyfriend.

259
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,485
Estamos distanciados.

260
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,442
- Are not alienated. 
 - En serio? What you gonna do then?

261
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,300
Well, I can always get 
 a room, my dear.

262
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:34,602
It's fine with us, Mom!.

263
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:38,085
- I know Trevor's work. 
 - Oh, I see.

264
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,988
- Your secrets are safe with me. 
 - Thanks.

265
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,452
No, no n º ning secret. 
 It FICCI .

266
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:46,927
Es tan lindo ver que finalmente
tienes química con alguien.

267
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:51,314
- No what-mica. 
 - See you down, Claire,

268
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,974
and if they end up in the apartment,

269
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,317
just leave it a socks-n at the door.

270
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,418
It is not my fault that we have what-mica.

271
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:07,545
I'm surprised you've agreed to 
 go out with me first.

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,147
Not the kind of person who 
 is a blind date.

273
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:13,554
Well, I have a bit of the 
 effect of wine,

274
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,084
© so that will be honest.

275
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,457
I made this computer dating thing

276
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,092
makes a lot simo-time

277
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,461
 And when you saw full 
 questionnaire

278
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,057
ba naming physically 
 all qualities

279
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,330
the person s who are looking for?

280
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,568
Well, when you describe Ginny-a,

281
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:31,553
was like going ticking 
 all my answers.

282
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,943
Except for the part of Republican.

283
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:39,200
Surprisingly, the policy 
  I never pass through the mind.

284
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:40,276
That is surprising.

285
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:43,458
Insurance had ceased 
 to one of ours.

286
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:45,819
Definitely. A role, 
 all the right answers

287
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:49,462
was immediately terminated 
 with the word "Republican."

288
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,708
AÃ º n, here are s-,

289
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:56,987
and I am thinking of 
 all the right answers.

290
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,564
I can not believe that you 
 want to join, Trevor.

291
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,824
 She chose a time

292
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,044
in a folder full of donors.

293
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,077
Wait, Are you telling me that you are s 
 coupled to Hallie

294
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,112
with the parent donor 
 sperm of her son?

295
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,864
Lo sÃ ©. Is a breeze.

296
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,014
Sometimes I feel that I am the 
 ero dating companions of destiny.

297
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:19,204
Trevor, you gotta see this.

298
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,770
Hey, in case you wonder,

299
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,705
the sound beam going from one side 
 to the other by the last hours

300
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,723
- Is indeed disturbing. 
 - So, is as animal feed.

301
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,073
 Can you try to sit 
 into a block of more rmol

302
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,000
- And put your hand in mind  
 - Marshal said that his mother and Clint

303
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,230
have been watching every night 
 for two weeks.

304
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,686
- Everything is great. 
 - So skilled is the problem?

305
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,107
The account has not moved. 
 It has been well for weeks.

306
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:59,488
- No account Hallie-Clint. 
 - Wait.

307
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,163
Only ... I think I can solve it for you.

308
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,780
 How about just ...

309
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,359
The account will not move until the 
 gods decide that it is true love.

310
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,975
 You know that I am not 
 answer for that?

311
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,367
Four l do not understand is the problem.

312
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:20,061
So, Marshall said that 
 the policy ever arose .

313
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,196
 You have to know 
 friends and family of the other?

314
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,115
I think not.

315
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,903
That may-be. 
 AÃ º n remain in the cocoon.

316
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:31,187
To be a partner 
 have to live in the real world.

317
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,390
<i> So if I were not in 
 the gym, dÃ de shall?

318
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,887
Not <i> sÃ ©. This gym 
 is a house for me.

319
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:51,713
Okay, you are right. 
 We got it.

320
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,359
- Thanks. 
 - Thanks, James.

321
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,399
- Something you need more s, Damelo. 
 - Okay.

322
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:58,163
- How do you feel loved? 
 - Por n whom, James?

323
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,771
I cut-throat 
 if you look at askance.

324
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,155
That is true, white.

325
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,276
He said that he let you stay

326
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,955
- When his father came out of imprisonment . 
 - SÃ  were a couple of weeks.

327
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,365
 Are you ready to go! S something for dinner?

328
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,743
Yes, we have to Tres Equis passes.

329
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:13,406
 Marshall sent me a message. 
 Leave  geometrÃa Hence his book.

330
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:15,838
Is should be concerned if my son 
 passes the time in a bar?

331
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,054
Hello.

332
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,818
Hallie! Clint! 
 What can I serve you?

333
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,905
In fact we go to find the book 
 mathematical characteristics of my son at the bar,

334
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:30,112
but I guess it is pretty quiet 
 here to do homework, no?

335
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,334
They are pretty quiet tonight. 
 Fiesta private.

336
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,934
 Are you sure you do not want to drink?

337
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:36,056
No.

338
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,793
s take something for your cumpleaÃ ± os?

339
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,812
Not until my cumpleaÃ ± os 
 within six weeks.

340
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:42,824
 This is Inca way.

341
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,572
What is it?

342
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:53,694
Sorpresa!

343
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,201
God-or more.

344
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:57,580
These are all people I know,

345
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,022
and some people who do not.

346
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,984
 So you do not know my neighbor Phil,

347
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,809
my companions ero bedroom 
 the university,

348
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,059
or my brothers?

349
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,338
 So what you think? 
 Surprised?

350
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:13,918
Yes, I think our 
 brother tena no reason

351
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,496
You are extremely great 
 to be liberal.

352
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,181
And if you start to drink coffee soy s

353
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:20,263
and drive a car that works 
 CÃ scara with eggs and garbage,

354
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,697
maybe have a problem.

355
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:27,561
- You seem a very intelligent. 
 - Thanks.

356
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:31,188
- How can you be a Republican? 
 - I think what he means is that

357
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:34,535
people who are educated 
 about certain topics,

358
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,110
others end up being  crater.

359
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,859
Tra tion history, the 
 truth. Was  other crater.

360
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:42,189
Then in a car accident, 
 I had a head injury.

361
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,558
Since then I've been thinking 
 in a small government

362
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,878
and strong military.

363
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,510
I was kidding, sign pray. 
 º lpenme Disc.

364
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:52,975
 Can I ask you borrowed for a minute?

365
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,197
Of course.

366
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,906
- This is a disaster. 
 - Okay.

367
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,640
Seriously, that is, were you raised  
 in a different home

368
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,657
your siblings? 
 How are you so different?

369
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,955
- I am not so different. 
 - The downfall as a compliment.

370
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,055
Is Insulting my brothers is a compliment?

371
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,278
Mira, lo siento, sÃ-?

372
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:12,343
- I was nervous. 
 - Well, it's part of its charm.

373
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:14,436
- Prego º ntal to their former wives. 
 - But honestly

374
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,324
Is Almost six years after s 
 de "No Mission Accomplished"?

375
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:20,932
How can we continue to believe that 
 Iraq war was good idea?

376
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:21,622
Not sÃ ©.

377
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,994
Why was a good idea?

378
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,305
You know, yes, mistakes were made --

379
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,166
 Really believe that?

380
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,738
I think there are bad people out

381
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,226
and have to handle that.

382
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:37,802
 So we need to bombard all 
 those who do things we do not like?

383
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,613
Well, you can not reason with a madman.

384
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,866
- You have to take the fight. 
 - True, I forgot ©.

385
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,086
Diplomacy, the bulwark of 
 the Western civilization ,

386
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,235
nia ± as is.

387
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,193
Yes, I'm not sure 
 what is a good idea.

388
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:54,710
Tena-by that was done.

389
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,622
We need to remove them from the cocoon.

390
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,064
We're taking 
 the real world to them.

391
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,898
Yes, well, maybe it is 
 too real world.

392
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,558
Hallie <i> ? Marshall College 
 lÃ-nea in 2.

393
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,257
Hallie Butler.

394
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,026
What was what?

395
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:22,313
What possessed you to  
 hitting another kid?

396
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:24,669
I get tired of that goal © 
 me all day.

397
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:28,161
- One guy can not get much. 
 - We went through this.

398
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:30,244
Try to speak to the teacher or flames.

399
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,257
 Talking does not work, and I have to say

400
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,517
how Clint was 
 s much more rewarding.

401
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:35,091
Is Clint?

402
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,577
He said that if that kid 
 bothering to safety,

403
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,757
put your ass on the floor. 
 That's what I did.

404
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,834
 Did you tell my son that 
 hit another kid?

405
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:56,077
 Chico? The guy who got  
 Marshal to have beards.

406
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,161
Was willing to accept the boxing

407
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,929
but attacking another 
 kid is not acceptable.

408
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:02,747
It was getting into with Marshal.

409
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,531
Tena-to learn to defend themselves.

410
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:08,208
- It's not your decision n. I am the mother. 
 - Perhaps you are the mother

411
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:10,114
but never were a boy 15 years.

412
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,321
Sorry, but "calling the teacher" no 
 solves this particular problem.

413
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,453
 So you know better than me what is 
 better for Marshall that his mother?

414
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,874
In this case, yes.

415
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,120
Violence as a solution n.

416
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:23,864
QuÃ © republican of you.

417
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,309
Perhaps we should act as  other crater

418
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,167
to kill will give milk and cookies,

419
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,881
talk about their feelings.

420
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,560
- We have finished. 
 -  You think?

421
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:34,094
Come on. Ended up here.

422
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:43,777
- Come on, Marshall. 
 - You have to consider another option n.

423
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,915
Do Tell Mom that Clint es mi papa?

424
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,196
TÃ º I want to be 
 clean breast of the pond!

425
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,197
- In the middle of the floor? 
 - Do not you understand?

426
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,093
That thing they care 
 s most passionately

427
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:59,326
that the Polish policy is not the wine, my friend.

428
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,684
Eres tÃ º.

429
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,260
Marshall! Come on.

430
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,680
Hey.

431
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:17,622
Hi, Marshall.

432
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:20,458
How was your day-to?

433
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:23,964
 A little recreation 
 task with popcorn?

434
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,488
 The guy has it already?

435
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:33,587
Only a couple of hours to complete

436
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,497
Marat will the war 
 24 hours of silence.

437
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:36,281
 Can you do it?

438
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:40,532
 Ladies and gentlemen, is a record 
 the boy in the kitchen from hell!

439
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,436
 Two cups?

440
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,463
Okay, I understand.

441
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,733
Are you mad at me because s 
 no te dejo box.

442
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,712
You know, maybe you should consider 
 be passive aggressive

443
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,235
instead of hitting a 
 that kid at school.

444
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,727
You are very good at it too n.

445
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:08,487
Marshall, go.

446
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,605
Let's talk about this,-sÃ?

447
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,825
Only you say something.

448
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:18,557
 Anything?

449
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,030
I think Dick Cheney is a bad blow.

450
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,224
Mr. Roberts, we have already exceeded that.

451
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,748
You're broke. It is not invisible.

452
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,023
Now he feels sÃ © 
 that people ignore

453
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,863

454
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,414
Dr. McCrae, his mother are here.

455
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:42,809

Well, here are s-.

Apparently, owners of bars os 
 giving good advice, it is not true.

459
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,330
Felix told me to pull tena 
 Hallie to Clint and his cocoon.

460
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,032
A total disaster. I need your help.

461
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,163
Liv, What happens?

462
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:06,873
- What did Claire 
 - I went to the apartment of my lover.

463
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,766
Your apartment is, mamma!, 
 And it's your ex-love --

464
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,979
Do not habÃamos agreed 
 to use the term "boyfriend"?

465
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,158
- DÃ © jala talk, Claire. 
 - Thank you, Trevor.

466
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,422

467
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,869
ready to tell Hector,

468
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,450
but our love was not dark,

469
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,230
- We must move forward. 
 - Why? The guy sounds perfect.

470
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,252
- Trevor. 
 - It's a drug addict, Trevor.

471
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:31,523
- Well, OK, that's different. 
 - It's a drug addict,

472
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:32,756
I am drugs.

473
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:35,637
If this is a goal! Fora, 
 I am going back to "play."

that may never finish his masterpiece

476
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:44,206
because you can not take 
 the hands of his muse.

477
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,426
That is not going to say,

478
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,020
Not at all.

479
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:51,990

 Diane Sawyer never took the rose

595

 if you can continue to see Marshall?

596
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,252
Yes.

597
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,021

598

 another chance.

599
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,159
We will break the heart-amos n 
 a Marshall

600
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:35,562
if we tried and it does not work.

601
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:39,099
You know, I try to instill this 
 attitude in kids

603
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:44,905
Nothing worth having 
 been easy.

604
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,775
Marshall came to my gym 
 22 kilos overweight.

605
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,647

 soaked in sweat

Clint Wilson <i> is more that s 
 a simple coach.

680
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,623
Clint <i> is the white knight 
 our family.

681
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,333
<i> I am a single mother,

00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,923

<i> I can not imagine my life without Ã © l.

AÃ º n n are working on Ã © l.

689
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,629
I think it hastened a little production,

690
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:44,360
but I think that is what you can 
 call a "Tribute to Love."

691
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,022
I will look for Hallie.

692
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:49,151
Your account are paid.

693
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,623
Sorry, but where I come from,

694
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,734
men do not let the 
 women buy them drinks.

695
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,619
 Come the years 50? 
 You look good.

696
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,683
Thank you. All my Bible about 
 fighting and carrying weapons

keeps me young.

698
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,477
While at my age working long hours

699
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:16,594
I pay less than a man 
 who does the same job.

700
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,033
You're all I ever 
 wanted in a man,

701
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,005
and not a thing.

702
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:29,216
Prego four ntame º nt me that thing.

I have been lifting the Ã nimo.

Perhaps you do not know this,

728
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,138
but I am a ball of sunshine.

729
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:03,164

Well, not to worry-as tena.

He was about to go talk 
 Ã © l with myself.

733
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:12,895
Lo sÃ ©, but was in the neighborhood

734
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,896
and I thought that I look at it.

735
00:39:15,362 --> 00:39:18,168
Well, How was I?

736
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:21,102
He feels things very deeply.

737
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,561
Was ... destroyed.

738
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:28,492
And it is obvious that n still loves you.

739
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:35,487
But I had not said anything that 
 I would like more tÃ º s that you are happy.

740
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:37,414
 You see, Claire?

741
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:38,955
That is love.

742
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,681
Claire is slow, but

743
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,114
understands it.

744
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:46,386
Know what is love.

745
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:49,391
I have never been so sure of that 
 until this very moment.

Stop. You can wait that long.

Derek wants to be 
 me to drink.

753
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,477
No matter, verdad? 
 We know it today in Whole Foods.

754
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:22,509
It's like a young Julia Raa º l.

755
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,376
In this darkness, 
 you have to feel those eyes

756
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:28,310
as if you had seen in another life.

757
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,737
It was an instant connection n nea.

758
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,906
Maybe come back with Ã © l for dessert.

this is the truth for her.

762
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,107
In other words, is as well.

763
