<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

2
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:09,580
Why didn't he just tell me
he was changing?

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,604
He didn't want anyone to know.

4
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,746
And I promised him no one would.

http://projet-sg.net

10
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:53,925
What's up?

11
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,274
I'm probably the last guy
you expected to hear from, huh?

12
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:03,237
Not the last,
but definitely down there.

13
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:06,939
Look, I know you quit
the force and everything,

14
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,918
but damned if this one doesn't have
your name written all over it.

15
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:13,860
Since when did you start appreciating
my take on crime scenes?

16
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,387
The minute we rolled away
from this one.

17
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,305
A suicide

18
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,223
two nights ago
in the river district.

19
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,820
Referred to homicide
so we could vet the wife's claim

20
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:26,397
that her husband shot himself
in the chest.

21
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,117
The chest...

22
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,683
Men tend to shoot themselves
in the head.

23
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,424
- Women usually favor the chest.
- So I'm told.

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,279
Any other reason to think
this isn't a suicide?

25
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,738
Crime lab's still processing.

26
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,551
Neighbors heard shouting.

27
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:42,030
No sign of break-in.

28
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:45,100
The wife and 17-year-old son
are the only ones that were inside.

29
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,333
She's claiming
the husband snapped.

30
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,525
Kid's not saying anything at all.

31
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,870
Well, that makes sense.
He's traumatized.

32
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,020
The shrink that took over
when you left,

33
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,320
Dr. Mehtar,

34
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,802
he's calling the boy
a high-functioning autistic.

35
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,888
- Some kind of syndrome or something.
- Asperger's.

36
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,306
That's the one.

37
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:05,448
Okay, so you've got a troubled teen

38
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,686
and the possible suicide
of his father.

39
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,511
Not getting why you called me.

40
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:14,002
I thought maybe you could
make some sense of this.

41
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,189
The kid draw this?

42
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:22,732
He was drawing it when the shooting
happened, according to the mother.

43
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:24,840
Does these in less
than a minute, I'm told.

44
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:27,379
And he draws them without looking.

45
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:31,502
- That's quite the savant.
- Yeah. Here, check out the rest.

46
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:33,835
Look at that.

47
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:43,211
- So, what does that tell you?
- Kid's insides are twisted in knots.

48
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,212
He draws these from life.

49
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:52,064
That's a joke.

50
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,720
That's just a joke...

51
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,278
Look, I just figured you were the guy
who loves all these oddball cases, so...

52
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,502
Yeah, these are brilliant.

53
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,499
I mean, they're disturbing,
but they're brilliant.

54
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:06,704
Yeah, we found hundreds more of them
rolled up on butcher paper in a closet.

55
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,956
When can I talk to him?

56
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,209
I already got a friendly judge
to steer you the psych evaluation.

57
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,907
One catch.
You've only got 48 hours.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,663
So these are obviously his demons,

59
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,875
nightmares brought to life.

60
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm reminded of Hieronymous Bosch.
His paintings were rife with abnormals.

61
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,856
Was Bosch a friend of yours?

62
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,318
High school sweetheart or something?

63
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,611
There is such a thing as
"before my time."

64
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,696
Really?

65
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,323
Cheeky monkey.

66
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:45,701
Okay, check this out. Here's one I found
particularly interesting.

67
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,369
Oh, it's the Sanctuary.

68
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,456
His draftsmanship is uncanny.

69
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,207
Photographic in its fidelity.

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,418
Yeah, he must have used
computer imaging for this.

71
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,629
Cavanaugh said the boy
was home-schooled,

72
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,270
apparently, the father wouldn't
allow him access to the computer.

73
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,175
Okay, so he copied a photo, then.

74
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:04,769
The mother said
he flew over old city once

75
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:07,130
on the only airplane trip
he ever took in his life.

76
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,404
10 years ago.

77
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:10,935
Exactly 10.
How did you know?

78
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:14,146
That's when we did
the renovation work on the north tower.

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,399
Okay, but the part about not needing
to see the page, how does that work?

80
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,414
Well, if the anecdotal
evidence is true,

81
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,654
then the boy must bypass
the role of ordinary sight.

82
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:24,464
There's not much doubt
about his being a savant.

83
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:25,905
He may well be more.

84
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,652
Now, the police are obviously
more interested in how the father died

85
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:31,330
- than in the boy's abnormality.
- Understandably.

86
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,374
I've been given a pipeline
to the case file.

87
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,310
We can get their forensics
in realtime.

88
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,760
What about the family?

89
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:39,998
Cavanaugh's made arrangements
for the boy and his mother to visit us,

90
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,812
and I was hoping maybe
you'd have time to be part of that?

91
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,287
Wouldn't miss it.

92
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:45,766
Okay, cool.

93
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,025
Food.

94
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,369
<i>He's my father, isn't he?</i>

95
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:03,310
They always did call you a heartbreaker
from the time I had you in a stroller.

96
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:06,175
Come on, those were old geezers
playing checkers in the park.

97
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,679
You didn't say anything
on the flight back from Rome.

98
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,778
In fact, you haven't spoken to me
since we got back.

99
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,517
Yeah, well, what's there to say?

100
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,205
Maybe that you're angry?
Feeling betrayed...

101
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,637
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- I'm trying to get words out.

102
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,930
Mom, I understand
what your motives were.

103
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:24,943
There were no good choices.
I don't fault you.

104
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,100
I wouldn't blame you if you did.

105
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,615
Okay, well, you were worried
about my feelings, right?

106
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,960
I put you in harm's way with every swing
of the pendulum, but the truth is,

107
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,749
I can't bear to see you hurt.

108
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:44,088
What really hurt wasn't the news.
It was that it didn't come from you.

109
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:51,951
Our sympathies for your loss,
Mrs. Meyers.

110
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,076
Thank you.

111
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,564
My son will be along.

112
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,794
He found something to draw
in the garden.

113
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,816
He's not quite ready
to talk to strangers.

114
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:07,986
You have to understand Edward,
he's...

115
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,174
He's a very...

116
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,783
- special boy.
- We've seen his art.

117
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,369
We understand how special he is.

118
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,220
He's done that since
he first picked up a crayon.

119
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,834
His subjects haven't
always been so dark.

120
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,471
He drew this
of Robbie and me

121
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,310
when he was only eight.

122
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,093
Robbie's your other son?

123
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,180
He ran away when he was 14.

124
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,022
The file said that...

126
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,500
Robbie got into trouble
for starting fires?

127
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,230
Oh, no, no, he'd stopped all that,

128
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:48,678
but Glen, he...

129
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:51,624
drove him away.

130
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:01,942
Was your husband...

131
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,009
abusive to all of you?

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,629
My...

133
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,943
husband was a good man.

134
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,477
He had his problems,
but he loved us.

135
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:17,181
Feeling love and inflicting pain
aren't mutually exclusive.

136
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,363
When you're a mother,

137
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:23,020
protecting your children,
that's all that matters.

138
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,288
Can you tell us what happened
the night that Glen died?

139
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,446
I woke up to the shouting.

140
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,073
You don't think I see it, huh?

141
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:36,783
Laughing at your old man?

142
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,495
- You look at me when I talk to you!
- <i>He'd been drinking.</i>

143
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,961
I said look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

144
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,459
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it. Stop it...

145
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,570
Put the gun down.

146
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:51,089
<i>I was afraid the gun
would go off accidentally, and then...</i>

147
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,261
<i>Just like that,
he turned the gun on himself.</i>

148
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,228
<i>I called 911, but it was too late.</i>

149
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,337
I realize now that...

150
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:06,685
Glen would never have hurt Edward,
or anyone else.

151
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:09,191
This wasn't the first time
that he'd tried to take his life.

152
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,159
It was...

153
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,928
Just so you know,
the evaluation with Edward,

154
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:14,780
it may take a few sessions.

155
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,730
I'm at wit's end, honestly.

156
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,605
I have to deal with
the funeral arrangements,

157
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:24,790
and Edward, he's...

158
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,939
scared to sleep in the room
where it all happened. I...

159
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,753
You're welcome
to leave him in our care.

160
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:42,987
How's it going?

161
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:47,813
My name's Will.

162
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,650
I think your artwork
is pretty awesome.

163
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,729
I've always admired
people who could draw.

164
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,322
I could never get much past
stick figures myself.

165
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,830
Dr. Magnus and Dr. Zimmerman...

166
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,565
They're gonna take care of you
for a couple of days.

167
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,690
No, no, no.

168
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,951
Just give me time to do everything
that I have to do.

169
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:14,964
It's okay.

170
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,375
It's okay.

171
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,385
It's okay.

172
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:19,575
Come here.

173
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,156
It's gonna be okay.

174
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,343
Any luck with Henry?

175
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,283
He still won't come out of his room.

176
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,522
This has been
the rudest of awakenings.

177
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:43,922
I worry...

178
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,415
that he will...

179
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,290
keep spiraling down.

180
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,664
We can provide every support,

181
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,503
but only Henry can come to terms
with what he's becoming.

182
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:43,886
Nice to see you.

183
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,330
I know I've been MIA.
I'm sorry about that.

184
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:49,080
I more than understand.

185
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,441
It's not like you didn't warn me
this day was coming.

186
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:54,788
Doesn't make it any easier,
though, does it?

187
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:00,300
I've been catching up on some research
that's long overdue on my...

188
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,425
bad self.

189
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,640
I never wanted to know any of this.

190
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,529
Just figured if I ignored it,
it'd just go away.

191
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:14,000
Kind of like having some disease,
but being all about denying it.

192
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,878
- This isn't a disease, Henry.
- I can't sleep,

193
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:21,091
and smells are out of control.
Food tastes terrible.

194
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,637
We both need to figure out
this phenomen.

195
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:25,955
You weren't there.

196
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:29,057
You weren't there,
and you didn't see it!

197
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,935
If anything had happened,
I wouldn't have forgiven myself.

198
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,814
Something did happen to me,

199
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,690
and all I know is
I can't control it.

200
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,110
- Not as yet, no, but...
- Look, Doc,

201
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,491
I have spent my adult life
working with abnormals,

202
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,836
learning to accept them,
even appreciate them,

203
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:47,659
but now I am one...

204
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,816
and I'm terrified.

205
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:55,534
I often wonder

206
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,796
what would have become of you
if I'd left you on the Moors...

207
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:03,497
to be raised by your kind.

208
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,222
At least that way
I wouldn't miss being human.

209
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,174
Oh, Henry...

210
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,200
I saw your light was on.

211
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,415
Am I disturbing you?

212
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,084
Mind if I come in?

213
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,403
Where do these come from?

214
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:07,894
- These creatures?
- From here.

215
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,750
Does it help to draw them?

216
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,356
Make it less scary?

217
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,261
There were pictures of Robbie, too.

218
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:27,919
Your brother.

219
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:31,239
You must miss him a lot.

220
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,345
When you drew that picture
that night,

221
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,945
of the monster holding the gun?

222
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,442
Did you see what happened?

223
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,590
- How your father died?
- I can't think.

224
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,540
Maybe we can talk again
when you're not so tired.

225
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,415
Good...

226
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,595
night.

227
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,340
Don't worry, Edward,

228
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:23,064
this machine simply measures
your eye movements while you draw.

229
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,073
- What do you want me to draw?
- Anything from memory.

230
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,050
Is there something
you'd like to suggest?

231
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:37,695
- Doesn't matter.
- All right.

232
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,082
Have you ever been to Chinatown?

233
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,998
When most people see,

234
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,959
their focus shifts
from one area of interest to another.

235
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,743
When we remember, we interpolate,
we fill in the blanks.

236
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:30,924
Which is why eyewitness testimony
is so notoriously unreliable.

237
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,092
Exactly.

238
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:36,054
His visual apparatus, on the other hand,
acts more like an image scanner,

239
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,890
rapidly moving in parallel sweeps,
and then archiving.

240
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,342
So he really is a living computer.

241
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,103
This rendering

242
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,480
took less than a minute
from start to finish.

243
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,568
The detail is extraordinary.

244
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,463
With respect,
this is what's extraordinary.

245
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,533
I asked Edward to concentrate
on one portion of the scene,

246
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:58,034
this area here,

247
00:17:58,465 --> 00:17:59,555
and then...

248
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
a zoom

249
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:02,072
on the zoom...

250
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:03,707
In this case,

251
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,215
a face,

252
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:07,370
just barely visible in the shadows,

253
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,420
becomes this.

254
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:11,190
Okay, so, I'm not sure I get this.

255
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,990
Edward's got this "Where's Waldo" thing
going on with abnormals?

256
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,678
And that's assuming
there wasn't an abnormal in the doorway.

257
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,930
Perhaps he sees the monster
that lurks beneath.

258
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:22,510
So, what are you saying?
He detects the abnormals amongst us?

259
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,103
Or simply the true personas
of damaged people.

260
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,939
So an abusive father
becomes a monster.

261
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,245
Exactly.

262
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,655
You don't have to turn it off.

263
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,364
I've seen it.

264
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,520
Is this where
some of them come from?

265
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,702
The monsters?

266
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,103
I draw what I see.

267
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,516
- You know, I see them, too.
- Really?

268
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,686
We actually have
a lot in common, you and I.

269
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,265
Details jump out at me,

270
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,442
things that go right
by other people.

271
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,589
Like right now, I can

272
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,325
see signs that you're afraid
to tell me what you know.

273
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:32,198
That drawing from the other night...

274
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,415
The creature...

275
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,206
That was your father.

276
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,134
He wasn't always like that.

277
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:40,858
He could be nice.

278
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,639
He wasn't nice that night.

279
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,436
- He pointed the gun at you.
- To scare me. He'd never hurt me.

280
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:55,318
- You're seeing it.
- You don't know what I'm seeing.

281
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,794
And of course not.

282
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,989
Your thoughts are yours. Mine are mine.
You only share them if you want to.

283
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,497
How did he die?

284
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,582
Was it Robbie?
Did he come back?

285
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:14,045
- Then why are you thinking about him...
- You said they were my thoughts.

286
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:17,210
How did your father die?
Did Robbie shoot your father?

287
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:20,177
<i>Hey! You look at me
when I talk to you!</i>

288
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,928
<i>I said look at me!</i>

289
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,140
I thought I was going to die.

290
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:34,953
I grabbed the gun.

291
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,159
I didn't mean to kill him.

292
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,591
We've been able to verify that your body
has entered a new metamorphic phase.

293
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:03,553
All we know about proteans tells us they
continue to evolve over their lifetimes.

294
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,987
There may be powers or abilities

295
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:08,290
that you gain
that we can't even hope to fathom.

296
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,990
Imagine a caterpillar
arresting its metamorphosis

297
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,490
before it becomes a butterfly.

298
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:16,001
You really think it was a butterfly
that brought down that snake creature?

299
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,318
I can't account for myself
when I'm that thing.

300
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,098
I mean, what if I hurt one of you?

301
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,609
I can't let that happen.

302
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,784
So you either chain me
up in the Shoe

303
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,702
or you tell me
how I can stop all this.

304
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,958
I need to know what my choices are.

305
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,960
There is a surgical remedy,
but it's not without its risks.

306
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:44,761
It involves excising portions of both
the pituitary and pineal glands.

307
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,279
If it'll keep me human, bring it on.

308
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:50,350
I want you to think about this
long and hard.

309
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:51,745
Okay.

310
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,195
Done.

311
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,565
It could well impact
who you are, how you think.

312
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,592
Is it some kind of
lobotomy or something?

313
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:03,570
No, certainly not,
but could it blunt your intelligence,

314
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,362
alter your personality?

315
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,395
We just don't know.

316
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,723
Promise me you'll think about it.

317
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,155
The more I look at the evidence,

318
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,582
the less I believe both Ruth's
and Edward's accounts.

319
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,277
- You think they were covering for him?
- Just a sec.

320
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,625
Hey, nice work.

321
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,075
The stain on her robe was a dead match
for the gun oil on the weapon.

322
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,611
She obviously wiped it down.

323
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:09,220
<i>I'm getting heat to book her
just on that.</i>

324
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,514
Hold off, okay?
I need a little more time.

325
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:13,933
- Come on, talk to me.
- <i>I saw some things</i>

326
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,377
in the crime-scene photos
I'd like to check out on-site.

327
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:19,430
I thought we were going to keep
the investigation side of this discrete.

328
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,204
You came to me, remember?

329
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:22,884
You should know,

330
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,382
Ms. Meyers tried to take possession
of her husband's body.

331
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:28,364
- <i>Had a quick cremation all planned.</i>
- The M.E. didn't release it?

332
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:31,110
Of course not, but it doesn't do
much for the trust factor.

333
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,536
<i>See, this just doesn't feel right.</i>
Well, I need to see the apartment.

334
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,600
I'll call the wife,
let her know you're coming.

335
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:37,825
Okay, thanks.

336
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:54,655
Please...

337
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:58,955
<i>Please! Please!</i>

338
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:00,445
<i>Dad?</i>

339
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,434
<i>Dad!</i>

340
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,194
<i>Let me out!</i>

341
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,517
Oh, God...

342
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,675
Oh my... God.

343
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:21,352
- Who did you keep down there?
- It's not what you think.

344
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:23,312
What about Robbie?

345
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,648
He got the brunt of it, didn't he?

346
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,011
What did Glen call it, discipline?

347
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:31,649
In my experience,
it's often a cover for cruelty.

348
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,230
He threatened you, didn't he?

349
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:42,342
He said...
He said he'd take the boys,

350
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,554
take Robbie and Edward,

351
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:48,654
if I ever tried to leave him.

352
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,175
The file said that you didn't report
Robbie as missing for almost five days.

353
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:55,000
Glen didn't want
to go to the police,

354
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,865
in case Robbie showed up.

355
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:02,335
Then you'll appreciate how important
it is, that I report any new evidence.

356
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:04,896
But you...

357
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,670
I wasn't entirely comfortable
with you making it sound

358
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:18,075
as if the Sanctuary
were an arm of law enforcement.

359
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,281
I had to push her
to get at what she was hiding.

360
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:23,108
The unraveling of
who killed this man

361
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:26,584
and why may well yield a treasure-trove
of information about this abnormality,

362
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:28,315
but make no mistake,

363
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:30,588
I will not help
compound an injustice.

364
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:34,385
So, what are you saying? That we...
Withhold evidence from the authorities?

365
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,740
If it's in service of preserving
an extraordinary life like Edward's

366
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:40,415
or the mother who tried
to protect those sons?

367
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,401
You'd better know that I would.

368
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:46,925
Then I guess one of us
is going to be uncomfortable.

369
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:50,570
Either way, it's down to us
to sort out what really happened,

370
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:53,604
- and that means finding Robbie.
- I've been thinking,

371
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:57,009
Edward has a pixel-perfect record
of his father's death.

372
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:58,510
He says he doesn't remember.

373
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,784
He was able to retrieve
one image from that night.

374
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:03,265
His father pointing the gun.

375
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,680
You recall I was talking about
the interpolation of data

376
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:07,760
to make our memories complete.

377
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:11,570
If we could get Edward to render
key moments surrounding the fatal shot,

378
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:14,228
Henry could program the computer
to fill in the missing frames.

379
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:15,990
So we'd have a movie of the crime?

380
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:18,511
Or as near as you can reconstruct
from a person's memories.

381
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:22,355
There's just one problem.

382
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,269
Edward doesn't want to remember.

383
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,415
Let's get him down here.
There's no harm in trying.

384
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:06,438
I've made up my mind.

385
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,435
I saw the way that kid looked at me,

386
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,074
and if he can see it, then
it's not far from surfacing again.

387
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:14,567
- I want this thing gone.
- Despite the risks we've talked about?

388
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,695
That would be correct.

389
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,574
Very well.
I'll schedule the surgery.

390
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,745
I think about what you want to do
and it scares me.

391
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,546
You get a look at that thing inside me,
it'll scare you even more.

392
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,091
- I don't want to lose the Henry I know.
- I'm not real thrilled about it either,

393
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:41,265
but no matter what I do,
I'm gonna wind up different.

394
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,012
But, maybe the abnormal different
isn't as bad as you think it might be.

395
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:46,790
Come on, Ashley,
you're not talking to an amateur here.

396
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:50,019
We've both seen the ugly side
of the abnormal world up close.

397
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,057
We've also seen its wonder.

398
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,175
Its beauty.

399
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,550
You said your father
aimed the shotgun at you,

400
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,743
and that you pulled it away
and shot him.

401
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:07,995
Can you show us that?

402
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,556
Edward, this is a right hand.

403
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,525
Why is it on the left side
of the image?

404
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,347
This isn't your hand, is it?

405
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,853
This right hand has a scar on it.
Yours doesn't.

406
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,647
- I'm guessing this was Robbie.
- No!

407
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,487
It's all right, Edward.

408
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,901
Was Robbie your father
was threatening?

409
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:23,380
Your mom and dad issued
a full description of Robbie

410
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,365
when he went missing. This scar was
one of the distinguishing Marks.

411
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,457
If he was the occupant
of that little room under the floor,

412
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,495
- he'd have enough reason for payback...
- I told you it was me!

413
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:36,374
Now, they're this close to charging
your mother for tampering with evidence,

414
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,664
and that charge could turn
to murder like that, unless we can...

415
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,010
It's okay.

416
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,955
- You got him?
- Yeah.

417
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:25,083
- What's his condition?
- Still guarded.

418
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,050
He suffered a grand mal seizure.

419
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:30,402
There's still a threat
of subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

420
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm sorry. If I hadn't have pushed him
so hard, none of this would've happened.

421
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,201
No neurologic deficits
have surfaced,

422
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,438
but clearly now,
we have to err on the side of caution.

423
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,315
- What the hell did we see?
- The dark side to his power.

424
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,776
It's like his eyes were shooting out
heat bursts.

425
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:48,321
That would explain the scorch marks
on the walls of that chamber.

426
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,250
What about the marks on Ruth?

427
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:54,050
<i>I can't imagine that Edward
would have inflicted those,</i>

428
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:56,954
- at least not intentionally.
- And if it was the husband?

429
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,375
Maybe they weren't
cigarette burns at all.

430
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:02,785
The M.E.'s file said there was evidence
the father suffered seizures as well.

431
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,006
If the father was an abnormal,
he probably passed it on to Edward.

432
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:09,895
The father's abnormality
was the burning eyes power.

433
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,135
What if he could sense
when it was coming on?

434
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,056
And had himself locked away
to protect his loved ones, yes.

435
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,980
Glen Meyers may have built
that chamber for himself.

436
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,052
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

437
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,660
Listen, I know I pushed you

438
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:45,602
to places in your head
that you weren't ready to go,

439
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,397
- and I'm sorry if...
- You don't...

440
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,509
have to apologize.

441
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,019
Is there anything I can get you?

442
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:56,431
My sketch pad.

443
00:32:57,465 --> 00:33:00,643
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- My mom didn't do it.

444
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,692
I can show them.

445
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,195
So obviously,
you don't agree with my decision.

446
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,080
Not for me to pass judgment.

447
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,484
What would you do?

448
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:28,305
I'm not the one trying
to purge his abnormal nature.

449
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:32,608
- But if you could.
- Deny who I am?

450
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,845
Why?

451
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:36,847
I'm not ashamed.

452
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:40,768
I'm not suggesting
you should be, but...

453
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:43,985
But...

454
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,285
what?

455
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:49,075
I've spent a lifetime
more or less human.

456
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,233
You have yet to discover your gift.

457
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:54,522
You think turning into that
mongrelized human is a gift?

458
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:01,517
Okay, that thing between my teeth?
That's my foot.

459
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:08,366
You only see the curse in it.

460
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,113
Every gift comes with one.

461
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,704
What's your curse?

462
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:24,445
Now...

463
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:28,009
You are on this journey with me.

464
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:32,650
It's something you'll discover.

465
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,792
Difference between you and me is,
you can control your power.

466
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,161
And in time,

467
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:42,410
so will you.

468
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:48,794
Now, get to work.

469
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,080
Now, if you feel the slightest bit
uncomfortable, or you want to quit,

470
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,714
just let me know, okay?

471
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:09,188
I think I'm pretty much
ready to go here, boss.

472
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:12,140
Understand that the computer tries
to maintain the laws of both physics

473
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,560
and psychology
when filling in the blanks.

474
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,088
It's not without its flaws.

475
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,966
It's not safe.
It's not safe out there.

476
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,750
No, that's what he wants you
to believe, but...

477
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,265
You get away from him, Robbie.

478
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:08,022
You're not taking him away!

479
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:15,982
<i>There's nothing out there</i>
but shame and hate.

480
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,650
I know. I've seen it!

481
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,156
<i>It's different for me and Ed!</i>
He deserves a life!

482
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,673
You get the hell
out of here, Robbie!

483
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,461
<i>I never want you to experience</i>

484
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,614
the pain that I did.
I'm so...

485
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:42,217
- Dad...
- Sorry.

486
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:45,304
Dad! Dad, please, stop!

487
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,392
We still can't see
whose finger's on the trigger.

488
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,710
- Robbie's body's blocking it.
- Just wait.

489
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,607
There. The reflection in the mirror
captured it all.

490
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,109
<i>- Let go!</i>
- Let go of the gun, dad!

491
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,055
Stop it!

492
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:02,293
Stop it!

493
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,288
- Robbie lets go of the gun, and...
- <i>Get back.</i>

494
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,790
Dad...
Let go of the gun!

495
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:16,376
Stop it, please! Dad!

496
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:25,741
The father didn't have to
pull the trigger.

497
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,931
He ignited the charge
directly with his eyes.

498
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:39,735
Hey, watch the car.

499
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,373
You watch it!

500
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:48,100
- Bring the evidence?
- Missing persons, Robbie Meyers.

501
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,865
Unsolved. Right there.

502
00:38:55,385 --> 00:38:58,160
- Look, I know you want answers...
- Yeah, tell me about it.

503
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,719
What's the matter?

504
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,972
The case, our case,

505
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:05,888
was pulled. Erased. Eradicated.

506
00:39:06,395 --> 00:39:09,526
Everything. The files, crime lab,
ballistics, everything.

507
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,631
The coroner had to surrender
the husband's body

508
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:15,213
to a caravan of black four-by-fours.

509
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:17,275
Sent by whom?

510
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:20,773
Whatever's happening here
is way above my pay grade.

511
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,345
Someone,

512
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:23,800
someone powerful,

513
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:27,283
finds Edward's family
very, very important.

514
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,786
What? Too paranoid?

515
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:36,053
Welcome to my world.

516
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,680
For all we know, Robbie could be
blaming himself for his father's death.

517
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:46,382
We've got to try and find him.

518
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,343
He could be hiding out of pure fear.

519
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,671
You know, I understand that.

520
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,849
Magnus says you're...
going through with the surgery.

521
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:03,235
Listen, if I start growing man boobs,
I'm depending on you to tell me.

522
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:05,446
Who knows, you might look good.

523
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,700
This belonged to the boy, right?

524
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:14,530
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

525
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:17,387
Just wondering.

526
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:25,270
Your mother should be here
in a couple of hours.

527
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:26,723
What about Robbie?

528
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:29,360
We're making
every effort to find him.

529
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:33,055
Why were you so afraid to tell us
what, in the end, you showed us?

530
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,455
Mom always said

531
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:37,981
it would be the end of us all
if the world ever knew about him.

532
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:39,728
You don't have to fear that now.

533
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:47,159
- Dr. Magnus, it's Henry.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

534
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,687
I'm very close to Robbie Meyers.

535
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:03,019
Henry said Robbie's been living
down here all this time.

536
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,400
I told you he'd be coming, didn't I?

537
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,885
I've missed you so bad.

538
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,545
It's okay.

539
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,910
We can both go home now.
Mom's waiting.

540
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:56,970
This is yours?

541
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:17,155
Come in.

542
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:24,330
You haven't forgotten
about today, have you?

543
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:25,923
Oh, I didn't forget.

544
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:28,822
I just kind of changed my mind.

545
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,062
You don't want to go through
with the operation?

546
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,133
No, I don't.

547
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:38,286
May I ask why?

548
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,560
I'm not sure
if there is any one reason.

549
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,652
I thought about Edward, Robbie,

550
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:47,514
what I might contribute
if I gave the powers a chance.

551
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,914
I guess I thought
about some butterflies.

552
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:58,325
I can't believe I just said that.

553
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,840
Neither can I.

554
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,839
Doesn't sound like you.

555
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:04,800
I guess you can say
I'm a changed man.
