1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,466
I said, are you sure this is it?

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:05,989
Keep your voice down!

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,650
We're trying to remain undetected.
That does require a modicum of silence.

4
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:11,690
Modicum. Right.

5
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:13,973
Why are we hiding?

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,613
We're on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,396
And it's a crypt, not the Pentagon.

8
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,685
A crypt potentially containing
an elixir

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,267
capable of prolonging life
for centuries.

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,987
Such secrets
are rarely left ungarded.

11
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:28,184
- Yeah, but why can't we just...
- Look.

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,964
Keepers of the Dead.
Best to be avoided if at all possible.

13
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:48,876
Right.

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,650
I got "I'm going in" and "go around"
but what was that wiggly one you did?

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,069
"Either we work together or we die."

16
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,347
Let's go.

17
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,861
Okay.

18
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,677
Take the other side.
Draw them away if you can.

19
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:29,050
- You're kidding, right?
- Go quickly, before they...

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,543
Okay, I know this was not
on the brochure!

21
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:07,041
This is why we don't work with Sylvio.
His intel is hopeless!

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,562
Go to the crypt!
Go!

23
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,839
I'm going in!

24
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,265
Will...

25
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,743
This might be my first crypt,

26
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,078
but aren't they supposed
to hold dead people?

27
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:51,943
The Projet-SG Team

28
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,695
presents:

29
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,906
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 03
Fata Morgana (v. 1.00)

30
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:01,411
Timing by: Golgi,
Kujathemas, Salomon.

31
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,597
http://projet-sg.net

32
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:24,517
Are you sure?

33
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,020
I mean, I could go with you,
or maybe you could take...

34
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,521
Take the Big Guy?
Mom, come on, it's just a clean-up job,

35
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,249
not a major operation.

36
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,177
I'll be fine on my own.

37
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,986
A humanoid chameleon living under
the city is hardly a clean-up job.

38
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:41,710
- It's more of a...
- Problem. Yeah. Our kind of problem.

39
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,537
One we should have taken care
of before we went to Scotland.

40
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:47,374
I can handle it.
You got your hands full here.

41
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,161
- Do you have everything you need?
- Uh, yeah.

42
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,851
Henry wants me to field-test
some new stuff.

43
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,981
And... if the gear fails,

44
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,742
I'll just use
the patented Magnus charm.

45
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,448
Right.

46
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:02,762
Well...

47
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,697
I just wanted to connect.

48
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:07,554
- You know, we rarely get the chance.
- Mom...

49
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,226
All righty, then.

50
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:13,793
One nasty chameleon subterranean
menace going down.

51
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:15,532
- Ashley?
- Yeah?

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,629
Be careful.

53
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:19,981
Always, mom.

54
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,081
See you.

55
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,851
Three not-so-dead women
found in coffins.

56
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,104
Just another day at the office.

57
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,040
All three are comatose.

58
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,651
Fortunately, brain functions
and vital organs seem to be intact.

59
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,496
So they're normal?

60
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,024
Near as I can tell.

61
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,487
The scans aren't detecting
any physical anomalies,

62
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,520
but they can only tell us so much.

63
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,192
I'm administering a
time-released stimulant.

64
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,133
It should bring them back slowly,

65
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,659
with as little physical
trauma as possible.

66
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,242
What about emotional trauma?

67
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,716
That's more your department,
I should think.

68
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:13,744
Until they awaken, we have to rely
on more traditional forensic methods.

69
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,503
Now,

70
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,895
this fella.

71
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,602
Fond memories.

72
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,505
These creatures detected
our presence early

73
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,321
and possessed unnatural
speed and strength.

74
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,588
Definitely not normal.

75
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,020
Not as you would define it, no.

76
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,894
I was about to gather
some fluid samples.

77
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,532
Care to assist?

78
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,619
I'd love to, but...

79
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:52,549
I'd better get back to my office
and get the whole

80
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,726
head-shrinking operation
up and running.

81
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:55,973
As you wish.

82
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,827
No!

83
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,515
<i>It's nice to see
you're finally awake.</i>

84
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,415
<i>I'm Dr. Zimmerman.</i>

85
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:49,659
<i>Will.</i>

86
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,301
Can you understand
anything I'm saying?

87
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,064
Hey, it's okay.

88
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,048
It's okay. You're okay.

89
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,486
You're in a safe place.

90
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:09,803
Okay, okay.

91
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,836
You're in a safe place.
Just relax.

92
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:25,513
I...

93
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:30,054
am Danu.

94
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,880
So you can talk.

95
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,921
My sisters,

96
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,724
Tatha and Caird...
Are they...?

97
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,068
They're fine. Your sisters are fine.
You just woke up first.

98
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,413
You're in a medical facility.

99
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,238
We brought you here
after we found you in a... dark place.

100
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:01,650
Do you have any idea
how you ended up there?

101
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:05,867
Creatures...

102
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,724
They came to our village.

103
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:13,882
They weren't human.

104
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,861
Yeah, sounds familiar.

105
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,071
They...

106
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,821
took us with them, and then...

107
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:26,671
I woke up here.

108
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:28,849
Your village.

109
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,221
Is there anyone there, your friends
or family that we can contact?

110
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,494
- Let them know you're all right?
- I'm sorry, I just...

111
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,496
I can't remember.

112
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:38,921
Well, it's okay.

113
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,272
You just take your time.

114
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,896
This place, it's like...

115
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:53,946
Nothing I've...

116
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:55,806
ever seen before.

117
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:58,861
There's...

118
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,480
There is light,
but I see no candles.

119
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,691
There's warmth...

120
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,620
but there's no fire, no sunlight.

121
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,627
Danu, before you
and your sisters were taken,

122
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,385
how much do you remember?

123
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:19,621
Last mass...

124
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:24,001
We were mourning
the loss of our priest to the miasmas.

125
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,046
- The miasmas?
- It's a sickness that has cursed

126
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,798
many villages surrounding
us in recent months.

127
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,011
There is no cure.

128
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,587
So you remember the miasmas.

129
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:39,267
Anything else?

130
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:46,213
Why can't I remember?

131
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:50,069
Just give it time.

132
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,076
These creatures exhibit
a terrifying propensity for violence.

133
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:00,417
Physiology appears human
in base form,

134
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,819
though significant anomalies
to the face and torso

135
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,554
indicate the possibility of mutation
at a base genetic level.

136
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,756
Okay, you need to...

137
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,555
You need to put a sock on the door
or something before you do that.

138
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,022
He's breathtaking, isn't he?

139
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,358
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

140
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,531
How are our guests doing?

141
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:26,621
Confused.

142
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,057
At least the one who's awake is.

143
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:32,382
She mentioned a disease
that was killing people in her village,

144
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:34,052
called the "miasmas"?

145
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:37,366
Which translates from the greek
meaning "poisoned air".

146
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,070
Plague, actually.

147
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,733
The bubonic plague, specifically.

148
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,907
However, the last reported
serious outbreak

149
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,543
was in Scotland in... 880 AD.

150
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,212
- Meaning?
- She's crazy.

151
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,089
Is that your professional opinion?

152
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,831
I know there's a lot of things that
are outside the realm of our knowledge,

153
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,633
but logically,
if she were from 880 AD,

154
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,158
she wouldn't speak English
the way we do.

155
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm guessing
that linguistics and grammar

156
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,062
have evolved somewhat since then.

157
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,695
Some would say "devolved".

158
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,166
Whatever. The point is
that we wouldn't understand her.

159
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:13,819
Which makes her a very sweet,
very delusional woman.

160
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:14,979
Possibly.

161
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,116
If you have a theory,
please, share it with the class.

162
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:22,413
The liquid we found the three of them in
bears similar chemical properties

163
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,664
to suspended animation formulae
used by southern voodoo cults.

164
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:31,837
The human body cannot
survive intact for 1,200 years.

165
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:34,732
I don't care what kind of magic
bath products you use.

166
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:35,925
And I agree.

167
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,694
So...

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,471
These women are either far more
than they appear, or...

169
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,140
to use your incredibly
clever vernacular...

170
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,441
Crazy.

171
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,394
The question we should be asking

172
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:51,138
is why the Keepers were so anxious
to stop us from getting into that crypt.

173
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,072
What is it about these women
that they don't want us to know?

174
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,228
<i>We've got evidence of two women
and a man out here,</i>

175
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:34,824
<i>and a hell of a lot
of 45 mm cartridges.</i>

176
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,785
Round up the Keepers.

177
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,864
Mobilize Alpha team
for a priority one retrieval.

178
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,496
Whoever took our property
is going to pay.

179
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,015
Piece of cake.

180
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,610
Why is nothing familiar to us?

181
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,816
I seem myself in the mirror,

182
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,372
and I recognize my face.

183
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,545
I know Tatha and Danu,

184
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:05,168
but the person I thought I was...

185
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:08,423
You're telling me there is no village.
No sickness.

186
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,829
The little I can remember is false.

187
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:13,927
How can we all not feel
completely lost?

188
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,127
Danu has told us that you insist
there were no magics involved,

189
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:20,256
that what we suffer
is simply a malady.

190
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,527
It's more of an emotional shield.

191
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,344
We found you in a crypt
surrounded by monsters.

192
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:29,028
It's normal for the human psyche
to put itself in a safe mode.

193
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:31,698
We want to accept
your diagnosis, Doctor,

194
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,076
and we're grateful for all
that you've done. It's just...

195
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:36,139
You're still not buying it.

196
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:40,275
The clinical term is
schizoaffective disorder.

197
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,363
It's a delusional state stemming
from acute post-traumatic stress.

198
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:47,783
We're suffering from the same disorder.
How is that possible?

199
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,792
Delusional behavior occurring
virally in groups is rare,

200
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:54,415
but it's not undocumented,
particularly amongst siblings.

201
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:59,003
Look,
let me put it this way.

202
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:03,521
There is no logical or physical way
that your memories can be real.

203
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,573
And the sooner you accept that,

204
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:09,137
the sooner we can continue
to make progress.

205
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,590
Excellent timing.
I'm starved.

206
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,760
They are beautiful.

207
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,541
They truly are.
I've never seen anything like them.

208
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,111
They are frightened.

209
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:33,884
Oh, yes.

210
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,855
Well, quite confusing, I'd imagine.

211
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,317
Waking up here, no memories.
Believing you're from the middle ages.

212
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:41,437
Are they?

213
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:46,188
Well, there's the rub.
I can't quite rule the possibility out.

214
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:49,637
When Will entered the crypt, he said
he set off some sort of mechanism

215
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,438
that drained the coffins
of a green-hued liquid,

216
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,481
which, thankfully,
I was able to preserve.

217
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,942
You think this kept them alive?

218
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,064
I don't know for certain,
but it does contain several key elements

219
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:03,233
that could induce a form
of cryogenic stasis in humans.

220
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,819
- If they are not abnormals...
- I know.

221
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,571
Why guard them so ferociously?

222
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,492
I want you to concentrate
on the sound of my voice.

223
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,242
I'm gonna count backwards
from five...

224
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:15,379
four...

225
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:16,511
three...

226
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:17,643
two...

227
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:18,788
one.

228
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,666
Danu, can you hear me?

229
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,164
Yes.

230
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:27,883
I want you to go back

231
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,698
to the last thing you remember
before you woke up here.

232
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,809
The creatures.

233
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,165
They're too strong.

234
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,398
We can't escape...

235
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,318
Why are they doing this?
We've done nothing wrong!

236
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:51,156
They're making us drink something...

237
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,652
Darkness.

238
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,292
I want you to go back further.

239
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:02,310
Find a memory of something that happened
before the creatures took you.

240
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:07,805
Moonlight.

241
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,032
I'm in a field.

242
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
It's cold.

243
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:17,944
I can sense the dead,

244
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,030
their souls extinguished.

245
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,886
Only we remain.

246
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,275
What do you make of these?

247
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,785
I found them on the right-hand index
finger of each of the three women.

248
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,840
Have you searched the database?

249
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,692
Not yet. It's on my "to do" list.

250
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,664
But such distinctive markings

251
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:45,878
generally indicate a connection
to a larger collective or group.

252
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,089
If they belong
to a society of some sort...

253
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:52,301
Then someone will definitely
have noticed that they're missing.

254
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:00,529
Are they pissed at being locked up,
or are we getting close?

255
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,379
Oh, they're here all right.

256
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,024
We're bringing them home.

257
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:21,941
Am I happy?

258
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:23,385
Well...

259
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,387
I'd definitely say that I'm more
stimulated here than in my old job.

260
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,423
<i>Wherever "here" is.</i>

261
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,498
You won't even tell me
where you're working.

262
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:35,651
<i>I told you,</i>

263
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,557
<i>the people who run this clinic
are totally into privacy.</i>

264
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,795
<i>I'm bound by all these confidentiality
agreements they made me sign.</i>

265
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,976
At least tell me the kind
of work you're doing.

266
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,185
I mean, is it more forensics?
Or clinical?

267
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,565
Or research-based?

268
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,412
It's... You know,
it's a little bit of everything,

269
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,045
Really.
You know, cutting-edge stuff.

270
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,581
Hold that elevator!

271
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,635
What's up, new guy?

272
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,622
I wanna eat your face.

273
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,033
<i>What?
Who's that?</i>

274
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:09,253
It's a patient.

275
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,508
- Patients.
- <i>No, this is great, Will.</i>

276
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:17,496
I don't know where you're working,
or what kind of work you're doing,

277
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,914
aside from "everything."

278
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,932
You're never at your apartment.
It's like you just dropped off the map.

279
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:25,561
Well, I'm just putting
in a lot of hours at the clinic,

280
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,771
trying to get up to speed.
You know how it is.

281
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,819
Anyway, I just, I wanted to call

282
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:35,445
and make sure you were okay.

283
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,394
Whatever it is you are doing...

284
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,159
You sound good.

285
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,784
Well, thanks.

286
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,200
I mean, it's no picnic, believe me,

287
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
but...

288
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,087
you know, half the time I wonder
if I made the right decision,

289
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,254
but...

290
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,151
I am sleeping better.

291
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,555
Ironically.

292
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,806
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

293
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:04,990
What?

294
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:08,228
- No, Meg, come on.
- <i>Forget it. It's none of my business.</i>

295
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:10,731
Look, I appreciate the call.

296
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:14,193
- Good luck with your new job.
- No, wait.

297
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,483
Crap.

298
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,254
Women.
Can't live with 'em...

299
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,127
But you can eat them.

300
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,201
All good, Mom.

301
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:38,734
The city is now minus one ugly,
poodle-eating chameleon guy.

302
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:40,055
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

303
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,637
No, not a scratch.

304
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:44,914
I'll redo your bandages
when you get home.

305
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,309
But before you do,
I need you to look into something.

306
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:51,021
<i>We found these rings
on the three women from the crypt.</i>

307
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,267
Pretty.

308
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:58,987
<i>I've traced it back to an ancient cult
known as Cabalis Nocturnum,</i>

309
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:01,865
a secret society
founded in roughly 700 AD

310
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,728
I'm still collating data,

311
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:06,773
but from what I can tell, they were
collectors of ancient beings of power.

312
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,634
<i>Well, they had crappy taste in bling,
that's for sure.</i>

313
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:12,180
I have reason to believe that
this cabal might still be operating,

314
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,127
and I need to know
if they are a threat.

315
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,282
<i>See what Squid has to
say about the markings,</i>

316
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,966
- <i>then I want you home.</i>
- You got a bad feeling?

317
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,009
Off the charts.

318
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,109
Okay, I'm on it.
Love you.

319
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:24,429
<i>Love you too.</i>

320
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,194
What's the matter?
You can't sleep?

321
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,756
I know Dr. Magnus asked
we stay in our quarters,

322
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:39,995
but the views from your windows...

323
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,113
They are so captivating,

324
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,116
I could not resist.

325
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:50,111
What do you feel
when you look out there?

326
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:51,376
I am...

327
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:53,402
curious.

328
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,337
And afraid.

329
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,384
Afraid of what?

330
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,185
When I sleep at night,

331
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,875
all I see are dead faces...

332
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,025
Haunting me.

333
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,506
Asking me why.

334
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,540
You want us to remember who we are.

335
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:34,791
Well, perhaps there is a good reason
that we forgot.

336
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,768
I saw your light was on.
You mind if I...

337
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,687
No, of course.
You're up late.

338
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,634
So are you.

339
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,740
You keeping watch over the ranch?

340
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,432
I rarely sleep
unless my patients do too.

341
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,575
How is Danu?

342
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,427
She's feeling a lot
of irrational fear,

343
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,796
low self-esteem, raw emotion.

344
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:17,252
I've seen it in kidnapping victims
held for long periods of time.

345
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,674
They tend to forget they have value

346
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:22,456
and just start seeing
themselves as property.

347
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,941
That assessment may be far more accurate
than you realize.

348
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:29,094
- How do you mean?
- Have you ever heard of the Morrigan?

349
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,222
The Morrigan?

350
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:33,123
But, then again,
I haven't been able to memorize

351
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,624
that monster manual you gave me yet.

352
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,500
They're part of an ancient legend
dating back to medieval times

353
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,906
Three women with supernatural powers
whose sole purpose

354
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:44,152
was to destroy men.

355
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,740
So I see we're back to the
1,200-year-old bath products theory.

356
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:54,243
The Morrigan first appeared
during the reign of King Arthur.

357
00:24:54,363 --> 00:24:58,317
Now, according to myth,
when they appeared on the battlefield,

358
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,974
Arthur's enemies
simply began dropping dead.

359
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:02,867
Their souls drained of life.

360
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:05,414
Entire armies were
wiped out en masse.

361
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,801
Do you honestly believe
that they're witches?

362
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:09,378
From the middle ages?

363
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,654
What history
would have defined as a witch

364
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:13,803
could have simply been someone
with abnormal powers.

365
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:16,893
Yeah, but they don't have any.
You said so when you checked them out.

366
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,812
None that we've yet detected.

367
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,693
Each of them was wearing
one of these.

368
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:28,807
Now, this is the mark
of an ancient cabal of collectors

369
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,741
who sought and exploited abnormals
for their own personal gain

370
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:35,727
and apparently guarded
their possessions fiercely.

371
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:40,162
So, why would this cabal
hold the sisters prisoner

372
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:42,759
if they don't have any powers?

373
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,297
Another reason why I'm not sleeping.

374
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,344
They're not nightmares.

375
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,527
That field...

376
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,266
All the dead...

377
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,272
We were actually there that night.

378
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:01,705
It's more than that.

379
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:07,691
We were the reason.

380
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,480
Easy, Steve. Easy.

381
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,871
Ladies...

382
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:04,125
I'm pretty sure we have rules
about... floating and stuff.

383
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:12,459
What say you just come down
and we talk about this?

384
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:28,827
That's quite enough of that.

385
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,836
I had everything under control.

386
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,329
You know how when stuff blows up
and I say "This is gonna cost you,"

387
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:43,958
and you say,
"Henry, stop being so dramatic"?

388
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,627
This is gonna cost you.

389
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:47,949
What was affected?

390
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,723
Well, the central lab, mostly.

391
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,842
Diagnostics, MRI systems are gonzo.

392
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:56,420
And I think our Internet is down.

393
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,378
What about security protocols?

394
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:01,110
Well, redundancies kicked in,
so nothing mean and ugly got free,

395
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,299
which is good,

396
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,869
but our perimeter alarm systems
are totally fried,

397
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:06,222
which is bad.

398
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,349
Focus on external defenses.
Leave the lab for later.

399
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,675
Why, are we expecting more trouble?

400
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:14,589
Yeah, no, that was a stupid question.
I'm outside.

401
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,867
Witches from the middle ages.

402
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,029
Okay, I'm almost there,

403
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:27,116
but assuming their physical forms
could somehow be preserved...

404
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:30,337
Again, how is it possible
that they can speak like us?

405
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,679
I'm assuming that each of them
is a teleaesthetic,

406
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,175
enabling them to quickly learn
our vernacular of english.

407
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,154
Psychic powers, mind reading.

408
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:43,850
Well, now we know
what this cabal wanted them for.

409
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:46,165
Yeah, for all the good it's done us.

410
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:47,376
Hold still.

411
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:50,607
- You didn't know what they could do.
- I should have,

412
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,067
the moment I connected them
with the cabal.

413
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:55,862
Performed more invasive scans,
psychotropic drug therapy...

414
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:59,058
You're running a medical facility,
not Guantanamo Bay.

415
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:02,265
- Cut yourself some slack.
- You don't understand.

416
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,790
Assuming the cabal are after them
And we'd be fools not to.

417
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,979
The amount of kinetic energy
that they released

418
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:09,849
could hardly go unnoticed.

419
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:13,380
We're all in imminent danger.
They cannot remain here.

420
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:18,418
And what does that mean?

421
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:22,139
It means that if the legend
of the Morrigan is even slightly true,

422
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:25,225
they could wipe out hundreds,
even thousands of lives,

423
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:26,633
given the chance.

424
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,887
We're not talking
about a bunch of velociraptors here.

425
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,382
Before their memories came back,
they were calm, rational women.

426
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:36,486
And even when they did let loose
with their powers, they didn't kill me.

427
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:41,366
They just...
melted my brain a little bit.

428
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,160
- And destroyed half my facility.
- They've been held prisoner

429
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,617
for hundreds of years.

430
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:47,678
They had a right to be pissed.

431
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,083
It doesn't mean
we can't reason with them.

432
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:54,728
All three will remain
under sedation,

433
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:57,253
- at least for the time being.
- How long is that?

434
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,235
Forever?

435
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:04,478
Are we different than the cabal
who imprisoned them in the first place?

436
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,468
Dr. Magnus was right.

437
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,735
We should never have been woken up.

438
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:29,247
You can't stay asleep forever, Danu.

439
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:31,875
You deserve to be free.

440
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,578
Our purpose is not to be free.

441
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:38,587
Our purpose is to bring death
to the enemies of the cabal.

442
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:41,149
And you think we're the enemy?

443
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,928
You took us from our home,

444
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,342
away from our protectors.

445
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,540
You were held prisoner in a crypt.

446
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,478
What kind of a home is that?

447
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:55,693
If our masters deem it so,
then it is so.

448
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,824
No.

449
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:00,350
That's what they want you to think.

450
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:05,135
They want you to believe that they're
your protectors, but they're not.

451
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,869
They're using your powers
for their own good.

452
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:11,122
They gave us life,
they gave us our powers.

453
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:16,319
Who says you weren't born
with these gifts,

454
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:20,419
that this cabal simply found you
and forced you to kill for them?

455
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:30,615
You asked me how you could all suffer
from the same disorder,

456
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:35,090
this dissociation between
what's real and imagined.

457
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:39,192
It's because somebody planted
those thoughts in your heads.

458
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,355
And the sooner you realize
those thoughts aren't real,

459
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:44,856
then you'll remember
who you truly are.

460
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,825
- A thousand men...
- Danu?

461
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:53,420
A thousand men marched on Badon Hill
that morning.

462
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,589
All were dead before nightfall,

463
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:02,715
all without the touch
of either sword or spear.

464
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,262
And now that we are free,

465
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:06,761
more will die.

466
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,832
That is our purpose, Will.

467
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:11,445
Until now,

468
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:14,356
because you didn't think
you had a choice.

469
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,271
But you do.

470
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:22,289
How can we ever be free

471
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,717
after all that we've done?

472
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:50,640
Squid!

473
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:52,972
Did you bring 'em?

474
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:56,546
Yep. Yummy snacks.
Get 'em while they're... alive.

475
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,612
It's about time.

476
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,437
All right.

477
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:07,922
You said you have information
on the cabal for me.

478
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,613
You and your mother...

479
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:15,101
You really don't like to attract normal,
run-of-the-mill enemies, do you?

480
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:18,698
Now, searching the cabal really
stirred up the people in my network,

481
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,543
got 'em buzzing like insects.

482
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:22,420
People in your network are insects.

483
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,840
- That's real nice, Ash.
- What did you find out?

484
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,032
That they've been playing
the same capture and study game

485
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:32,513
for a hell of a lot more years
than your mother and you.

486
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,767
You'd be surprised.
Go on.

487
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,270
Intel has it their mandate...

488
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,017
Was to capture creatures
with strange powers, I know.

489
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:44,651
We got three of their assets on ice.
What are they up to now?

490
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,235
Everything.

491
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:48,590
Come again?

492
00:33:48,918 --> 00:33:52,182
The cabal supposedly died out
in the 19th century,

493
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,463
but they didn't.

494
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:57,580
They just went underground.
They started infiltrating businesses,

495
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:01,465
medical and scientific
research companies,

496
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:03,625
banks, biotech firms...

497
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,049
military think tanks.
All under their control.

498
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:11,336
- Holy crap.
- Yeah, I mean, these guys are

499
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:14,505
one James Bond film away
from global domination.

500
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:18,601
- So stealing their property...
- No, no, no. Would not go over well.

501
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,758
Word has it they're on the move

502
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,815
with upright bloodhounds
with big teeth and claws.

503
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,648
Keepers...
How many?

504
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,607
Enough to create a real mess.

505
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:30,286
I mean, whatever it is
you took from them,

506
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:33,006
they're coming to take it back.

507
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:38,377
- You mind?
- No, no. Bon appetit.

508
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:41,249
- Go ahead, go crazy, go nuts.
- Oh, thank you.

509
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,976
Well, that is not good.

510
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:07,078
They're conscious, they are a threat.
They're here, they are a threat.

511
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:10,516
Danu's psychological state
is so fragile right now,

512
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:14,154
any more trauma, any more amnesia,
she may never be this self-aware again.

513
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,571
I can get through to her.
I just... need more time.

514
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:19,315
- We don't have time in abundance, Will.
- Listen to me.

515
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:22,769
She has been brainwashed
to think this cabal is all-powerful.

516
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,218
I mean, come on!

517
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:27,920
We've got trouble incoming.
I'll be home as soon as I can,

518
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,464
<i>but it's a much bigger...</i>

519
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:33,062
Mom?

520
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:34,920
Mom!

521
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:37,682
Dammit.

522
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:48,330
Come in, Magnus.

523
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,638
So, nasty creatures with bad dental work
have reached the outer perimeters.

524
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:53,920
I'd recommend a level-5
internal lockdown.

525
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,459
Magnus...

526
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:04,940
- That works.
- We need to get the Morrigan out.

527
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,233
- Agreed. Any ideas?
- Near the Shoe.

528
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:09,829
There's an escape tunnel
with an exit leading to the river.

529
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:13,533
And a safe house just outside the city.
There's a map programmed into this.

530
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,725
Take this.

531
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,214
- What are you gonna do?
- You wanted time?

532
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:19,123
I'm going to buy you some.

533
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,945
- Where have you been?
- We need weapons.

534
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,279
We need Ashley.

535
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:10,729
Crap.

536
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:18,670
Danu, we're getting you outta here.

537
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,773
- They've come for us.
- Doesn't mean you have to go with them.

538
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:24,203
They'll never stop looking for us.
We must go with them.

539
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:27,330
Do you really believe
that you deserve to live in a crypt?

540
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,933
Because if you do, I won't stop you.

541
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,461
You would free us?

542
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:34,208
Yes.

543
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,090
We have to go right now.

544
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,561
I want you to stay
and defend the habitats at all costs.

545
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:46,124
If we fall,
initiate level-9 lockdown protocol

546
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:47,952
and seal yourself inside.

547
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:49,819
Please.
Do as I say.

548
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:08,201
Where are we going?

549
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:09,936
Away from here.

550
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:21,885
Go, go, go!

551
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:24,273
Take this. It's a map.
Follow the purple line.

552
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:25,765
- Will, I...
- Go!

553
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,521
Mom, I'm home!

554
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:37,373
Good. Grab what weapons you can
and meet us in the catacombs.

555
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,070
Will's headed to the river gate.

556
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,626
The Keepers are following.
We'll make our stand there.

557
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:42,598
Henry?

558
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,241
- <i>Hello.</i>
- You heard the plan?

559
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,855
Weapons, catacombs, check.
I'll see you in five.

560
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,683
Damn it.

561
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:56,383
Drop it.

562
00:38:58,584 --> 00:38:59,759
Come on.

563
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,782
Keep 'em coming.

564
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,325
These aren't mine.

565
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:12,251
Just put 'em on the ground.

566
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:40,206
- Shoot 'em!
- I can't!

567
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:53,526
That never gets old.

568
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,754
You left the safety on.

569
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:59,960
You know,
I'm gonna play to my strengths. You...

570
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:02,435
- You shoot people.
- Okay.

571
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:04,155
Follow me.

572
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:08,115
Mom!
Are you okay?

573
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:10,217
- I'm fine. Did you get them out?
- I think.

574
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:12,568
If they can read Google maps,
they should be on their way.

575
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:14,755
- Where the hell is Henry?
- Here.

576
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,637
This is a private medical facility.
You are trespassing on my property.

577
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,046
Trespassing?

578
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,056
You have stolen what is ours.

579
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:33,213
The Morrigan belong to us.

580
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:36,395
Hand them over now
or we tear this place apart.

581
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:38,564
I don't know
what you're talking about.

582
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:43,527
My Keepers are keyed to find them,
no matter where they go.

583
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:46,197
Your Keepers are dead
all over my house.

584
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:50,743
Do you have any more?

585
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,056
Last chance.

586
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,537
No more games.

587
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:59,777
It'll get messy,
but just say the word.

588
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:02,182
Take their weapons.

589
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,587
Stop.

590
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,657
There will be no more killing.

591
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:12,487
We will go quietly.

592
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,642
We ask that you leave
these people unharmed.

593
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:18,687
You don't make demands.
You do as we say.

594
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:22,108
They did not take us out of greed,
but out of charity.

595
00:41:22,387 --> 00:41:24,465
We ask you leave them unharmed.

596
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,157
It seems that a taste of freedom
has changed their demeanor.

597
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,560
We take back what's ours,

598
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,287
you and I have no problem.

599
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:37,698
These women are under my protection.

600
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:41,279
They're not leaving with you
or anyone else, for that matter.

601
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,462
Then we have a problem.

602
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:48,258
Danu.

603
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:51,448
Please, stay with us.
We can protect all of you.

604
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,238
If we stay,

605
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:56,190
none of you will ever know peace.

606
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,102
You have shown us a path,

607
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:00,313
a truth we have never seen before.

608
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,186
And we are grateful,
for all that you have done.

609
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:05,372
No.

610
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:07,153
No, you can't go, not now.

611
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:09,073
Our freedom must be earned.

612
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,808
In our own way.

613
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,201
We know who we are now.

614
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,619
Put them in separate trucks.

615
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:34,029
I'd be careful what you do next.

616
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:36,640
The people I work for
aren't the forgiving type.

617
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:38,131
Neither am I.

618
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:41,151
Tell them this is far from over.

619
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:44,258
Now, get off my property.

620
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:54,857
You think we've lost them?

621
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:56,115
You tell me.

622
00:42:57,905 --> 00:42:59,494
I think I need more time.

623
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:02,374
I think you've done more good
than you realize.

624
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:04,957
We gave them the choice to be free.

625
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,417
What they do next is up to them.
