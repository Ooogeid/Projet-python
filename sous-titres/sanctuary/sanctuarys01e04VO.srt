1
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:19,576
Get 'em up!

2
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,048
Do it!

3
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,036
On the ground!

4
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,479
On the ground!

5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,807
Please don't shoot.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,479
Take what you want.

7
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,096
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:41,024
He hit the alarm, the silent.

9
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,718
Let's get out of here.

10
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:21,334
Stop! Police.

11
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:23,222
Don't move.

12
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,089
Do not move or we gonna to shoot you.

13
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:18,481
Come out with your hands up!

14
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,179
He's gone.

15
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:48,671
The Team Projet-SG

16
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:50,006
presents:

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,301
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 04
Folding Man (v. 1.00)

18
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:58,014
Timing by: Kujathemas,
nitrogenc, Salomon.

19
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,408
http://projet-sg.net

20
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,748
I did say 9:00, didn't I?

21
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,588
Sorry I'm late.
Bagel run...

22
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:34,217
assorted savory, poppyseed for
the Big Guy, and two kinds of schmear.

23
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:37,610
What?

24
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:40,469
Okay, don't tell me
that you wanted raisin.

25
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,925
There's an interesting case
I'd like you to see. Henry?

26
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,490
Security footage from a pawnshop robbery
last night near the campanile.

27
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,568
How the heck did you get into
the precinct lan?

28
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,436
I'd like to take credit for that,
but I got the password from the boss.

29
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:55,936
And you got in? How?

30
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,241
Now, where would a girl be
without her secrets?

31
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,286
That's... not an answer.

32
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:02,263
I know.

33
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:07,369
You'll see the owner shift his weight.
That's the foot-operated silent alarm.

34
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,092
Henry, can you go back for a sec?

35
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,680
Yeah, right there.
Now, zoom in.

36
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:25,920
Check that out.

37
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:29,272
He's scooping up all of the gold jewelry
and leaving everything else,

38
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:31,274
including the diamonds.

39
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,479
- Okay, that's just wrong.
- Interesting.

40
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,903
Fast forward, if you would.

41
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,473
Now, they react to the siren
and become frantic.

42
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:44,120
And this gunman fatally
shoots the owner in the back.

43
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,136
Brutal.

44
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,507
 They split up,
and one is pursued down an alleyway.

45
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,898
There's the dashboard camera
from the cruiser.

46
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,293
And into a coal chute basement.

47
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,970
Okay, I'm still not getting
why this ends up on our radar.

48
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,130
- Just wait.
- The officers enter the basement

49
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,519
just moments after the gunman did,
and once inside,

50
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,512
they report that there's no sign of him.

51
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,973
- So, what, he just disappeared?
- According to the police,

52
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,809
there was absolutely no way
this man could have possibly exited.

53
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:10,921
It's all in the police report.
Quite the enigma.

54
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,819
Have I taken your mind off bagels?

55
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,656
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Knock yourself out.

56
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:26,879
No tape.

57
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,908
No seal.

58
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,222
Crime lab finished their sweep
this morning.

59
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,393
Concrete floor.
No windows...

60
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,423
This doorway was bricked over
decades ago.

61
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,968
And if he didn't leave
the way he came in...

62
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,600
Oh, please don't tell me
we have another teleporter.

63
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,729
Not likely,

64
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:46,552
but I'm not ready to rule
anything out quite yet.

65
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,017
What about this?

66
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,084
- That?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,898
Yeah, sure, if he morphed
into a boa constrictor.

68
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:55,582
No, Will's right,

69
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,454
if only as a potential place
that the robber hid his booty.

70
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,225
I never saw a man
with that small a booty.

71
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,682
We did bring Henry's camera?

72
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,411
Yeah, we did.
It's in the van.

73
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,660
That's a nice toy.

74
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:15,267
A "toy" like this helped discover
several secrets of the Great Pyramids.

75
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:18,437
All right.

76
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,394
Go slow.

77
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,113
Switch on the UV.

78
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,584
UV is up.

79
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:56,184
So how does a fingerprint get that deep
into the middle of a 10-inch pipe?

80
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:59,256
Well, it doesn't, unless a person
squeezed in that far.

81
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,580
Yeah, but you saw the size of that guy.

82
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,801
Well, I've seen stranger things.

83
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,012
Okay, seriously,
why are you staring at me?

84
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:09,390
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
we were looking at a folding man.

85
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,291
- A folding man?
- Urban legend.

86
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,051
Crops up in city after city.

87
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,688
Supposedly, a man who's
capable of collapsing his skeleton

88
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,356
to fit through narrow spaces.

89
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:19,484
The legend falls
short of a feat like this.

90
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:22,278
But it is possible that we're
looking at some sort of super-folder.

91
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay. Help me out here.

92
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,714
You're familiar
with a newborn's fontanelles?

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,327
Yeah, the soft spot on the top of
a baby's head, sure.

94
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:32,121
Nature created it so the child
could fit through the birth canal.

95
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,458
Yeah, but for a newborn, the head
is the widest part of the anatomy.

96
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,461
And, what, you're talking
about in an adult? It's impossible.

97
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:40,458
Will,

98
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:41,900
look around you.

99
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,385
10 days ago, you would have said
all of this was impossible.

100
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,012
- Henry, could you run the print?
- I'm on it.

101
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,902
These urban myths we're talking about

102
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,430
go back a lot further
than contemporary sightings.

103
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:57,188
But they're all part of what,
the same phenomenon?

104
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,137
No, no, there's quite a range.

105
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,380
Flexpeople...

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,497
Whole tribes with genetic defects
in collagen synthesis.

107
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:07,058
There's a sect of shinto monks
that are said to bow without bending.

108
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,409
Then you've got your turn-of-the-century
sideshow contortionists...

109
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:11,946
The human corkscrew,

110
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,346
Henry Athol the boneless wonder,

111
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,334
and not the least,
my personal favorite, Elastic Ed.

112
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,213
But no one's ever been able
to fully document these folding men?

113
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,507
If they even exist,
they must be quite elusive.

114
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,553
You know, there was this case
that I worked on

115
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,904
at the Agency
that never got solved but had a

116
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,932
very similar set of circumstances.

117
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,725
Austin, Texas, 2005.

118
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,061
How do you know about Austin?

119
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,939
Are you serious? She knows when
you switched from boxers to briefs, man.

120
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,367
What's the similarity?

121
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:45,098
Three bank employees
gunned down in cold blood,

122
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,900
and the robbers run into a vault
with the cops on their heels,

123
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,400
and apparently "disappear".

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,043
According to Will's report,
the only possible means of escape

125
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:54,043
was a nine-inch-square
ventilation shaft,

126
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,165
a scenario that didn't win
you many points, if memory serves.

127
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,491
No,

128
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:00,105
but it gets weirder.

129
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:03,306
The only thing
that was stolen in that robbery

130
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,797
was half a million dollars...

131
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,219
in gold.

132
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,911
Do you think it's possible that

133
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:12,263
Austin and our folding man
are somehow connected?

134
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,451
At the very least
it's a working theory.

135
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,204
Henry?

136
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,311
Got a rock-solid match
on the fingerprint.

137
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,718
Belongs to a career lowlife
named Malcolm Dawkins.

138
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,904
- Is there a last known address?
- Nothing recent.

139
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,781
Lago Vista, Texas,
about four years ago.

140
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,944
Lago Vista,
that's right outside of Austin.

141
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:30,536
Maybe I can have the bank robbery case
file from my old partner at the Agency.

142
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:42,693
Will.

143
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,822
Tell me the rumors aren't true.

144
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,132
What rumors?

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,654
Working in-house
for an internet gazillionaire,

146
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,440
fired for insubordination,

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,473
consultant for some sort of area 51
freakazoids? Take your pick.

148
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,662
Can't a man just

149
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:59,227
run away and join the circus
without being second-guessed?

150
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,187
I can't believe you want me
to bail you out.

151
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,523
How many times did I have
to pull you out of the fire?

152
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:04,880
I kind of lost count.

153
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,957
Is that it?

154
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,446
Case files, bloodwork,
everything from Austin federal.

155
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:13,309
You're a good man, Jake,
I don't care what anyone says.

156
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,795
I'll be gutted like a mackerel if they
find out I brought this stuff to you.

157
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,201
- I just wanna take a second look.
- Out of the blue?

158
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,311
Come on, Will.

159
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,393
Just call it a hunch?

160
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:31,175
If it bears any fruit,
you'll be the first to know, I swear.

161
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,397
You've got 72 hours.

162
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,185
You compromise that evidence in any way,
I'll swear you held a gun to my head.

163
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:44,157
That was my backup plan.

164
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,279
Looks like your cold case file may
have given us our first positive lead.

165
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:58,153
I analyzed trace blood
from that bank vault.

166
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:59,831
It didn't match any of the victims.

167
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,872
Means it must have come
from the robbers.

168
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,833
You have a DNA match?
We could never find.

169
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:06,168
Nor did I, at least
not to an individual who left it,

170
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,337
but we did find someone
right here in old city

171
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:11,382
whose DNA matches 16 alles
out of the 20 that we looked at.

172
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,551
That many genetic markers
has got to be a relative.

173
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,511
Probably the Austin thief's father.

174
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:18,681
He's a 71-year-old
by the name of Oliver Braithwaite.

175
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:22,018
His DNA was in the system
from a suspect sweep a few years back.

176
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:24,687
- Do you have an address?
- He's a drifter, from what we can tell.

177
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:27,985
Hangs out in my favorite part of town,
the old Bryant Street corridor.

178
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:39,660
Excuse me, I'm looking for a man,
Oliver Braithwaite.

179
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,738
Good evening, ladies.

180
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,584
I was wondering if you knew of
a man named Oliver Braithwaite,

181
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,192
an older gentleman...

182
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:50,557
Thank you.

183
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,582
Thank you.

184
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,015
Any luck?

185
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,305
Did you find anything?

186
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, yeah, I got a great recipe
for a rubbing alcohol martini.

187
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,360
They know the name.
They just seem afraid to talk.

188
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:17,574
Stay close.

189
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:48,938
I believe you're looking for me?

190
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,239
Oliver Braithwaite?

191
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,535
- Are you the police?
- No, absolutely not.

192
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,495
You really have no business
being here.

193
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,955
My name is Magnus,

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,833
- Dr. Helen Magnus.
- The Sanctuary?

195
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:13,490
It's all right.

196
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,327
Leave us.

197
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,393
I heard about the Sanctuary
ever since I was a boy. A good place,

198
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,987
where people like ours
are treated like human beings.

199
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:32,231
- But you're not...
- We're better than human.

200
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,692
- We have the gift.
- The gift of folding.

201
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:37,653
My days of folding are long gone.

202
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:40,114
We'd like to talk about your son.

203
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:41,963
Aaron?

204
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:46,620
You know where he is?

205
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,915
- He's missing?
- He's taken up with a mad man.

206
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:53,043
- I can't contact him anymore.
- We're talking about a folder?

207
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,546
They call him Nomad.

208
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,038
He's taken the best of our youth,

209
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:01,051
ripped them from their homes,
turned them against their families.

210
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,082
Aaron was...
going to study medicine.

211
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,140
What's this Nomad's agenda?

212
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,457
Well, he may be crazy, but...

213
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,999
he's also a criminal genius.

214
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,773
He gets folders hooked on
this addictive drug of his.

215
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:19,737
He's got some hotshot drug chemist
to make it locally.

216
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,746
If I could... find out where...

217
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,620
I'd kill him myself.

218
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,713
We want to stop this Nomad too.

219
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,957
Maybe we can help each other.

220
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:39,342
I just...
want my boy back, that's all.

221
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,232
We'll do everything we can.
I promise you.

222
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:50,534
So, who would know about
this high level of trafficking?

223
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,645
What about our high-flying friend,
Mr. Jones?

224
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:53,771
Worth a try.

225
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,775
- You trust an addict as an informant?
- Of course not. He's a crime boss.

226
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,296
Controls most of the city's
drug traffic.

227
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,069
I like your office.

228
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,355
Can't beat the view.

229
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:25,352
And you know I prefer
our conversations private.

230
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,098
'course, you're taking your life
in your hands coming up here.

231
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,306
Well, I could say the same
about you,

232
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:34,603
considering your line of work.

233
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,594
So now Miss Thang
is working for the cops?

234
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,877
You know me better than that.

235
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,750
What can you tell me
about folding men?

236
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,449
The only folding men I'm interested in
are dead presidents.

237
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,565
I'm looking for a fugitive folder
by the name of Malcolm Dawkins.

238
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,044
The folding men are like
their own little tribe.

239
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,542
They don't come to me or anyone else
for their needs.

240
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,836
Your crime network caters
to abnormals?

241
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,964
Drug distribution,
prostitution, gambling...

242
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:04,592
- Am I missing something?
- You left out my charity work.

243
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,523
Right.

244
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:11,916
Mr. Jones, the only one with resources
to find a folder on the lam is you.

245
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,514
I'm not the only one
who's well connected,

246
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,480
which brings me to the reason
I agreed to see you.

247
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:22,318
- Not that I don't enjoy your company...
- Save the flattery.

248
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,221
My street troops have been getting
signals in the past week

249
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,656
that someone is about to make
a very big move,

250
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,295
as early as friday evening.

251
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:30,868
Nomad, right?

252
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:34,191
What he does with his own criminal
enterprises is really not my concern.

253
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:37,333
- What is your concern?
- That he's making his move on me.

254
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,920
It's how he's planning
to consolidate his power.

255
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,546
I'm thinking we can do each other
a solid...

256
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,393
I tell you where Malcolm is,

257
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:47,711
you get a lead on Nomad
and take care of my problem.

258
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,054
More than fair.

259
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,475
Our good friend Malcolm's been spotted
near the old cannery.

260
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,866
My men went to capture him,
but he's...

261
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,147
slippery.

262
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,711
Thanks, Mr. Jones.

263
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,308
- If this works out, I owe you.
- I'll hold you to that.

264
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:08,581
Watch your step, Sista Girl.

265
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,001
Yup. You too.

266
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,261
There he is.
Get him.

267
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:39,937
I've got him!

268
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:44,010
Malcolm!

269
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,158
I've sedated him.

270
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,938
He'll be out for at least
a couple of hours.

271
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,924
You know, you pass him on the street,
you have no idea what he's capable of.

272
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,402
You could say that
about almost anyone.

273
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:33,741
Well, here's a reminder
that he's not like anyone.

274
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,243
- The gaps in the bone...
- Hinges.

275
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,403
Crumple zones, if you will.

276
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,457
Now, watch.
I'll trigger a localized reflex.

277
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,425
- Incredible.
- Efficiency of form, but at what price?

278
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,684
I'd better see about
transferring this guy to a cell.

279
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,091
One without vents.

280
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,352
Did his blood tell us
what he's addicted to?

281
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,291
Are you strapped in?

282
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,100
I have been since I got here.

283
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm guessing it's not
your everyday heroin?

284
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,524
I'm guessing it's gold.

285
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,402
TPG... Tertiary Phosphene Gold.
How did you know?

286
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:16,993
I didn't. I just figured it had
to explain their obsession with it.

287
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:20,454
So folding men steal gold and turn it
into their own form of crack?

288
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:22,278
Gold's unreactive to most chemicals,

289
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,952
but it will bond
to certain organic compounds.

290
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:28,462
Now, this one's part of a whole new wave
of metallotherapeutic pharmaceuticals.

291
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,923
- So it's a medicine?
- For normals, yes.

292
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,861
But for folding men, at least based on
what I've seen of Malcolm's DNA,

293
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,844
it creates
a virtually instant craving.

294
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:39,350
It likely dulls the pain of folding,
acting like a sort of beta blocker.

295
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,509
Without it, the pain
would be beyond excruciating.

296
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,810
If Jones is right,

297
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,565
two nights from now,
Nomad floods the market with this,

298
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,848
cheap, powerful TPG.

299
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:49,950
It turns the whole society
of folding men

300
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,027
into his private criminal army.

301
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:54,334
If this quantity of designer drug
is being made locally,

302
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,376
it'll leave a trail...
We'll look for that.

303
00:19:56,592 --> 00:19:58,450
Meantime, find out what you can
from Malcolm.

304
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:03,318
- What about the police?
- What about them?

305
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:07,856
Well, I mean, this guy's an accessory
to murder, maybe more...

306
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,711
And what would you
have us tell them?

307
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:12,965
That their man's addicted to gold
and that he slithers like a python?

308
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,635
That's a good point.

309
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,675
Where am I?

310
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,545
You're safe.

311
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,570
Who says?

312
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,049
I'm Dr. Zimmerman.

313
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:57,593
Will.

314
00:20:57,837 --> 00:20:59,136
What is this place?

315
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:00,929
We call it the Sanctuary.

316
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:02,083
Am I...

317
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,435
- the only one here?
- Only abnormal?

318
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:08,604
Or you mean another folding man?

319
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,524
Don't know what you think you're hiding.
We've seen what you can do.

320
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:14,026
So are there more here?

321
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,876
What are you afraid of?

322
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,440
You chased me,

323
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,579
you trapped me,
you put me in this... in this cage.

324
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,024
You experimented on me.

325
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:31,877
Well, that might make you angry,
but that's not what you're feeling.

326
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,758
If he finds out I'm here,
he'll kill me.

327
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,177
Nomad?

328
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:44,490
- Why would he kill you?
- He gave me the signal, shoot to kill,

329
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:47,643
- and I hesitated.
- And that's a capital offense?

330
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,273
He came that close
to executing me on the spot.

331
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,124
Son of a bitch!

332
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,033
He hit the silent.

333
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:05,930
Do it.

334
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:13,512
Let's get out of here.

335
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,534
How do I know you're not Nomad?

336
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,147
Nomad never would've
let himself get caught

337
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:25,428
unless he wanted to be.

338
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,476
He would've turned you
into a stain on the sidewalk first.

339
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,855
Why'd you bring me here?
What do you want?

340
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:37,484
I want you to help us get Nomad
before he can do any more damage.

341
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,590
- Nomad's not the problem.
- No?

342
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,072
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

343
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:46,970
You're the problem.

344
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,372
The whole world of normals, you can't
accept those who are different.

345
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:53,000
This whole place is full
of those that are different.

346
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,610
What does that make you,
the zoo keeper?

347
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:59,214
And what about the drugs?
They make it less painful?

348
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,508
- What, normals don't use?
- They don't use gold.

349
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:05,053
So if I shot heroin,
I'd be a model citizen, right?

350
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:07,477
You know that he plans to exploit
every last one of you?

351
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,558
He wants to free us.

352
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:11,694
Children against their parents,

353
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:13,311
abnormals against normals...

354
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:16,615
How many more like that pawnbroker need
to get wasted on the road to freedom?

355
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,692
- I need a fix.
- I'm sure you do.

356
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,654
Let me guess, you used to set
ant colonies on fire

357
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:25,157
when you were a kid, right?

358
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:27,242
- Where's Nomad?
- I may be weak,

359
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:30,203
- but I will not betray my kind.
- If you give a damn about your kind,

360
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,540
you'll see that what this lunatic
is doing ensures their destruction.

361
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,750
Go to hell.

362
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,060
It's pretty much what I expected.

363
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,219
I can get him to talk.

364
00:23:57,122 --> 00:23:58,593
I just need more time.

365
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:01,694
There's an expression
amongst creature hunters.

366
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:04,404
If you could teach a lion English,
you still wouldn't understand him.

367
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:08,523
- We're not talking about a wild animal.
- It's exactly what we're talking about.

368
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,577
Only this guy's way more
intelligent than most.

369
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,147
And, as a consequence,
more dangerous.

370
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,130
I'm late.

371
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:16,757
Going out?

372
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:20,142
I owe it to Mr. Jones
to tell him what we've learned.

373
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:21,129
Stay safe.

374
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:38,066
How does a flying abnormal
fall to his death?

375
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,159
Somebody literally
clipped his wings.

376
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,379
There was a struggle with a knife,
undoubtedly at the top of the building.

377
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,881
The assailant left traces
of his own blood.

378
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,243
- Did you run it for DNA?
- No matches to an individual,

379
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:10,554
but genetic markers indicate it was
definitely the blood of a folding man.

380
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,882
Retribution for the help
that he provided us?

381
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,960
Not retribution, a power grab...

382
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,810
Control of the city's crime syndicate

383
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,436
and hundreds of thousands
in drugs and cash.

384
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,065
Just as Mr. Jones feared.

385
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,193
No doubt Nomad will use it
to pay for his truckload of TPG.

386
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,479
We've got less than 9 hours.

387
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,959
If we don't intercept that shipment
and Nomad gets his way,

388
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,325
the city had better brace itself
for a crime epidemic.

389
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:34,839
I still think Malcolm knows
more than he's telling us.

390
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,972
Has he ever talked
about Oliver's son?

391
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:39,207
Aaron.
No, not yet. Why?

392
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:42,752
Well, based on his father's description,
he might be a chink in Nomad's armor...

393
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,100
Intelligent, close to his family...

394
00:25:45,314 --> 00:25:47,646
- See what you can find out.
- All right.

395
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:53,241
TPG, TPG, TPG...
Nope, nope...

396
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:58,661
I keep checking on the key ingredients
for making TPG, like you asked,

397
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,851
looking for shipments to any
nearby locations, but still nothing.

398
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:03,409
Break it down further, Henry.

399
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,095
The chemist may be making
the constituent compounds themselves

400
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:07,835
in order to avoid being detected.

401
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:09,105
Oh, I get it.

402
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,039
See who's buying the ingredients
to make the ingredients.

403
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,109
Precisely.

404
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,038
The gold drug...
When does it arrive?

405
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,370
Austin federal, 2005.

406
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,595
That one took you down a notch,
didn't it?

407
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,651
What, did you expect me to deny it?

408
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:43,230
Nomad knew more about you
than you knew about him.

409
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:47,025
Irony was, you came so close
to breaking that case.

410
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:51,761
- He got a real kick out of that.
- Were you in the vault with him?

411
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:55,267
Yeah.

412
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,647
- That didn't bother you?
- Of course they bothered me.

413
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,870
The bank manager
was begging for his life.

414
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,803
Said he had two little kids,
one with serious mental problems.

415
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:09,257
Nomad just shot him in the head,
laughing the whole time.

416
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,967
All those years, you didn't think
about just walking away?

417
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,277
And go where?

418
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:17,745
We had to stay together for safety.
Why is...

419
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,445
Why is that so hard for you
to understand?

420
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,819
Why don't you tell me
about Aaron Braithwaite?

421
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,320
Aaron wanted to stand up to him.

422
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,030
- Did you consider listening to him?
- No, you don't get it.

423
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:38,952
You have no idea what Nomad is like.

424
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:40,743
Tell me.

425
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:47,031
He makes you weak,

426
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,776
and then he tears you apart.

427
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,982
And then he puts you back together,

428
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,697
only it's his way this time.

429
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:03,148
Aaron always said if we had any chance
of breaking his hold on us,

430
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,228
we'd have to stop using.

431
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,787
- We can't keep doing this.
- It's wrong.

432
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,235
You want to be free again, right?
You want to see your family again?

433
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,277
Of course, but

434
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,945
- We've got to be united if we fight .
- And then what?

435
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,698
He'll hunt us down like dogs.

436
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:19,326
That's exactly
what he wants you to think.

437
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,335
Did I interrupt something?

438
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:31,654
No.
I didn't ask you, Malcolm.

439
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:34,174
I was asking Aaron.

440
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,718
You stirring up
trouble again, Aaron?

441
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,296
Have you had your fix today?

442
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:54,217
If anyone has something to say,

443
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,584
they can say it to my face.

444
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,080
Relax.

445
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:07,952
I brought you some glitter.

446
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:19,916
The gold...

447
00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:22,945
The gold drug
has always been the key.

448
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:27,142
Nomad has to keep us hooked on it.

449
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,616
You must be going through hell.

450
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,001
I'll survive.
I can fight it.

451
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:33,608
But can you fight him?

452
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:36,650
Not by myself.

453
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,548
How many more innocents
are you going to help him slaughter?

454
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:42,841
Help me, Malcolm.

455
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,549
Aaron talked about a place...

456
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:59,179
<i>About a place we could go to...</i>

457
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,358
<i>If we ever got away from Nomad.</i>

458
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:09,372
If Aaron was in that apartment,
he must have moved everything out.

459
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:11,629
You think these might be his things?

460
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,193
Maybe.

461
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:15,671
Or maybe

462
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,928
Malcolm led us on a wild goose chase.

463
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:35,241
I'm so sorry.

464
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:38,105
When we promised you
to find your son,

465
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:40,236
I never imagined
that it would be like this.

466
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:45,545
I wanted

467
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,360
Aaron...

468
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:48,831
to be a doctor.

469
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,517
I could imagine him working in

470
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:54,272
a place like the Sanctuary.

471
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:02,729
He was a smart boy.

472
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,208
He was kind.

473
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,093
What is there left for me?

474
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:13,906
What's left for any of us?

475
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,201
When you broke it all down for me,
the most basic recipe for TPG,

476
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,272
no shortcuts,
everything from scratch,

477
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:30,504
the only local buyer
is a small manufacturer

478
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,304
just three miles north of the city.

479
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,761
Aridan Labs...

480
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:35,438
It's almost 4:00.

481
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:38,373
Our chemist will be leaving
for his rendezvous any time now.

482
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:41,585
Well, if we're right,
he should lead us straight to Nomad.

483
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:46,060
I've come up with a chemical test
for the TPG, once we find it.

484
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,827
It's the only thing that will turn
this liquid a brilliant blue.

485
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,536
- What about Will?
- He wants one more run at Malcolm.

486
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,681
I don't think
we should take him away from it.

487
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,646
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

488
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:19,274
but we found Aaron

489
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,316
- at the location you gave us...
- No...

490
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,848
There's not much doubt
about who's responsible.

491
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:26,433
He was my best friend.

492
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,776
If I had only supported him,

493
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,733
he'd probably still be alive,

494
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:37,000
if we had all just stood up to Nomad
like he wanted...

495
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:40,474
His blood is on my hands as sure as
if I pulled the trigger myself.

496
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:42,130
But you didn't pull the trigger.

497
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,337
- You're not a murderer, Malcolm.
- Amn't I?

498
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,134
How do you know what I'm capable of?

499
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:50,023
You're right.

500
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,395
I don't.

501
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:53,723
I've watched him kill more than once

502
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:55,154
and done nothing.

503
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:59,546
I helped him beat a man
to within an inch of his life.

504
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,191
And guess what, I enjoyed it.

505
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:04,027
I've given over

506
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:05,197
what I am,

507
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,506
who I am, to a monster.

508
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:08,784
Your awareness,

509
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,576
your remorse,
that's what separates you from Nomad.

510
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:15,198
Nomad's just an excuse.
My addiction is just an excuse.

511
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:16,546
I'm the monster.

512
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:18,249
I'm the monster!

513
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:20,835
Help me get him,

514
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:22,623
- Malcom.
- Look at me.

515
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,449
I can't even

516
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,998
get through a day without gold

517
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:31,305
- pumping through my veins.
- You're kicking it.

518
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,640
And if you can do it,
so can other folding men.

519
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,636
I'm too weak.

520
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:37,235
I'm too weak.

521
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,470
My strength comes from the gold

522
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:40,859
and from Nomad.

523
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,716
No, your strength comes from you.

524
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:45,801
Malcolm, listen to me...
Folding men are dying.

525
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:49,077
Innocent people are dying.
Now, you know where he is.

526
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:51,655
I can't...

527
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:55,277
Why don't you do it for Aaron?

528
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:58,748
He gave his life up for you guys.

529
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,612
We're running out of time, Malcolm.

530
00:34:11,057 --> 00:34:12,057
I can only

531
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,306
tell you where they used to be based.

532
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,611
It's in an old factory.
The city...

533
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:19,894
shut it down.

534
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:21,883
Toxic metals.

535
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,476
All kinds of places

536
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:26,990
to hide.

537
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:28,433
No matter where

538
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,823
Nomad moved,
he always kept information there,

539
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:34,164
in loose floorboards,
in the walls...

540
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:38,692
The locations of his safe houses,
the drug labs,

541
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:40,478
weapons caches...

542
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,625
Where would I find these things?

543
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,985
I'll give you the address,

544
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:45,914
I'll...

545
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:47,534
draw you...

546
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,091
diagrams of it, describe it all to you.

547
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:51,920
Or you could just come with me.

548
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:54,982
That's...

549
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:56,791
That's not going to happen.

550
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:02,931
Do it for Aaron.

551
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,250
You're doing the right thing.

552
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:35,478
Trust me.

553
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:37,207
Okay.

554
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:39,515
Let's go.

555
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:58,240
Sorry.

556
00:35:58,454 --> 00:35:59,925
No deliveries after hours.

557
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:03,925
Tell us what's in those containers?

558
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,374
Sure.
Just don't shoot me.

559
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,433
It's laxatives.

560
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,838
Sorry, I don't believe you.

561
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,931
Hands up! Get 'em up!
Both of you.

562
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,357
It's not TPG.

563
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:35,738
Sit down!

564
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:41,945
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

565
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:43,388
Don't be.

566
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,259
I mean,

567
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,672
I'm sure under normal circumstances,
you're a very good judge of character.

568
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,644
I'd like you all to meet Dr. Zimmerman.

569
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:58,380
You'll find you have a lot in common...

570
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,844
No backbone.

571
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,644
- Carver, get me a chair.
- Yes, sir.

572
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,435
And get me my gun.

573
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:07,595
Right away.

574
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,859
<i>How do you know what I'm capable of?</i>

575
00:37:14,283 --> 00:37:16,529
<i>Nomad never would let himself
get caught...</i>

576
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:18,281
Unless he wanted to be.

577
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:19,824
<i>He may be crazy but he's,</i>

578
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:21,742
also a criminal genius.

579
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,286
On the ground.

580
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:24,637
<i>He hit the silent.</i>

581
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,223
Let's get out of here.

582
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,415
<i>You're not stirring up
trouble again, are you, Aaron?</i>

583
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,425
Have you had your fix today?

584
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:45,097
If anyone has something

585
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,017
to say,

586
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,312
they can say it to my face.

587
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:50,813
<i>I'm the monster.</i>

588
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:52,238
I'm the monster!

589
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:57,816
You're Nomad.

590
00:37:58,731 --> 00:37:59,688
Carver

591
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:02,116
is your pawn.

592
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:06,120
- They're all your pawns.
- Mind like yours, Zimmerman?

593
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,224
Too smart for the room.

594
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:10,839
Overthinks everything...

595
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,725
The easiest to

596
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,282
manipulate.

597
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,672
Can't you see what he is?

598
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,009
He's just an addict.

599
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:22,929
He's just an addict
with a messianic complex.

600
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:26,331
- He doesn't care about any of you.
- You still don't get it.

601
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:28,703
I love my people. I'm doing this

602
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,070
for my people.

603
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:33,189
No more cowering in the shadows.
I'm bringing them into the light.

604
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,275
And what about anyone
who gets in the way?

605
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,236
I think you know the answer to that.

606
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:40,804
In a little while,

607
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:44,533
I'll have my hands on enough TPG to draw
recruits from all over the continent...

608
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,787
A small army
of the most powerful folding men.

609
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,629
Whatever you do to me,

610
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:53,364
they'll know,

611
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,419
at the Sanctuary.

612
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,694
They'll know,
and they'll be all over you.

613
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:01,965
If I know Dr. Magnus...

614
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:04,322
and I do, at least by reputation...

615
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:07,390
She's undoubtedly
already fallen for my bait.

616
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,492
It's amazing the kind of
disinformation you can plant

617
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:12,383
with just a little know-how.

618
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:14,202
And you'll love this, Will.

619
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,015
The TPG,

620
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,387
my TPG...

621
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,937
It wasn't made locally.

622
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,571
It's coming from Austin.

623
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:30,695
I wasn't worried about the police

624
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:32,094
or Mr. Jones

625
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,944
or anyone, for that matter,
except the Sanctuary.

626
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:39,415
I had to make sure
that none of you would interfere.

627
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:48,217
He ordered you
to kill that pawnshop owner.

628
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:51,684
- All it took was a look.
- Well, unfortunately, all these

629
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:54,112
revelations...
You won't be able to share them

630
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:56,772
- with the rest of the world.
- And what about Aaron?

631
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:59,224
Going to let someone
take the rap for that too?

632
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:01,777
- What's he talking about? Is Aaron...
- He's dead!

633
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:05,159
It's a terrible shame.

634
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,002
Jones had him killed,

635
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:10,366
and then he stuffed his body
in a washing machine.

636
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,289
I never said how he was found.

637
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:21,184
He was my friend.

638
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,883
Put the gun down, Carver.

639
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:26,093
Put the guns down, all of you.

640
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:27,952
That looks like barrels of fun.

641
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:29,221
He was just a kid!

642
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,058
He was trying to undermine me.

643
00:40:32,218 --> 00:40:34,435
He was trying to undermine all of us.

644
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:36,698
- He deserved a traitor's death.
- Drop...

645
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,481
the guns. I will not ask again.

646
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:43,986
Son of a bitch.

647
00:41:00,814 --> 00:41:01,921
Will...

648
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:04,092
I'm sorry, I...

649
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,003
How did you know?

650
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:12,232
I had a tracking device
put on your car...

651
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:14,188
Just in case.

652
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,567
Four to six weeks
and most of our folding men

653
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:27,310
can be returned to their homes...

654
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:29,417
Hopefully drug free.

655
00:41:36,742 --> 00:41:38,742
Look, can you just say it, please?

656
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:40,709
I mean,
it's the elephant in the room.

657
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,225
I let myself get conned.

658
00:41:42,345 --> 00:41:43,949
We all let ourselves get conned.

659
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,548
Some of us just had a plan B.

660
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,794
Well, that's the last time
I play by the old rules.

661
00:41:47,914 --> 00:41:49,337
Don't be so hard on yourself.

662
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:52,261
We stopped the destruction of
an entire culture of abnormals.

663
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:55,456
And you got to the bottom of one of
your Agency's biggest mysteries.

664
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,449
You're right. What am I talking about?
I'm a hero.

665
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:02,440
Actually, on a scale from zero to hero,
you're more like...

666
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,608
Ashley...

667
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:06,193
Almost respectable.

668
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:25,880
Just under the wire.

669
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,443
Thanks again, Jake.

670
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:30,057
Did you get what you need?

671
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah.

672
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:33,554
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

673
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:34,889
So...

674
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:38,800
What, are you going to try
to reopen the Austin murders?

675
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,687
No,

676
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,242
I couldn't make any more sense of it
this time around than I did the first.

677
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,571
It's a shame, really.

678
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,552
Yeah, well,

679
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:47,985
- We can't solve 'em all?
- No, I mean you.

680
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:52,480
I don't think I've ever met an agent
with more raw potential.

681
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,256
I appreciate.

682
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:56,819
It's too bad you still can't seem
to catch a break.

683
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,520
Don't worry about it.

684
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,694
Sometimes...

685
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,961
Sometimes you gotta know
when to "fold" 'em.
