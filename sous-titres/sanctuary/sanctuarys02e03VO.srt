00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:02,126
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:04,253
- Name.
- Kate Freelander.

3
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,239
<i>For the record, I'm not Cabal.</i>

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,549
- Dana Whitcomb.
- <i>You have my daughter.</i>

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,177
- <i>I want her back.</i>
- Your daughter... or your work?

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,379
<i>What are you still doing here?</i>

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,647
<i>I thought you were going to evacuate
with the other residents.</i>

8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:20,519
She wasn't supposed to be here.

9
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,565
Please...

10
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,226
Mom...

11
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:03,973
It's a miracle.

12
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:14,332
Mom...

13
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,577
Welcome home.

14
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,131
The repairs on the Beijing Sanctuary

15
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:32,383
will be finished in March.

16
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,456
And how long before the Moscow
and London Sanctuaries are reopened?

17
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,459
Three months, provided the contractors
hold to their estimates.

18
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,584
Tokyo, however, is a total loss.

19
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,896
Which means we have a lot
of dispossessed residents to deal with.

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,071
The Sanctuary network survived.

21
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:47,962
That's what matters most.

22
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:50,751
It's just...

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,778
hard to keep that in mind sometimes.

24
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,827
- So many tragedies to process.
- I take it that's our cargo.

25
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:02,696
No, ours is in the hold.

26
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,624
I've got five trucks waiting, so...

27
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,126
And the rest?

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,588
Magnus said you requested space
for 20 abnormal refugees.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,969
Not 20 abnormals...

30
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:14,467
20 containers of abnormals.

31
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:36,217
I can see the light.

32
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,456
Now, that's better.

33
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,871
Man, was it hot in there!
Boy, I could sure do with a lemonade.

34
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,249
Yo, Beijing, what's a guy gotta do
to get a cold drink around here, huh?

35
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,100
You're a lot of help.

36
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,837
I'm out of here.
See you.

37
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,895
We're going to need
some more trucks.

38
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,932
The Team Projet-SG

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,642
presents:

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,853
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 3
Eulogy (v. 1.00)

41
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:12,358
Timing by: Arrow,
nitrogenc, Salomon

42
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:31,168
http://projet-sg.net

43
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,356
Stop doting on me.

44
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,900
- It makes my teeth itch.
- Mine too.

45
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,390
Now, eat.

46
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,877
I should be helping Henry and Will.

47
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,139
They're fine.

48
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,408
Everything's running smooth as silk.

49
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,270
No, you don't.

50
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,661
This is a freaking mess.

51
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,048
So many wonderful guests!

52
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,770
We got to figure out
a tagging system,

53
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,580
'cause half these things shouldn't
even be breathing the same air.

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,475
Come and get it, shorty!

55
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,436
I'm short?

56
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,835
So all grade four security risks
are in the Shoe.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,038
How's the food
and water holding up?

58
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,467
Down, Smithers.
Sit!

59
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,159
All right.

60
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,699
I pulled in big favors
from our suppliers. Got...

61
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,245
Yeah, he's not well.

62
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,624
God...
I hope the plumbing holds up.

63
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,591
I'm not worried about that. Magnus isn't
letting me reset the EM shield.

64
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,819
It's still set to high security mode.
You have any idea

65
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,052
what kind of drain that is
on our electrical system?

66
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,219
I'm sure Magnus is not overly concerned
about the utility bill right now.

67
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm just saying,
we can't even plug in a toaster

68
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,030
without blowing a fuse.

69
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:13,719
I got 15 guests on the upper levels,
another dozen in trucks...

70
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,980
I know, okay?

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,107
Everything's a mess right now,
but we can handle it.

72
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,250
Really?
Tell that to the 12 guys waiting...

73
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:22,549
We can handle it, okay?

74
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,949
Let's just give 110%

75
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,847
and take it one game at a time.

76
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:28,327
Okay, one game at a time.

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,784
- It's time for you to be the man.
- Be the man. Look out!

78
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,415
- Smithers, come on!
- Would you... Could you...

79
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,084
Sorry... About him.

80
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:37,778
All right,

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,356
be the man.

82
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,036
Be the man...

83
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,016
Good times.

84
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:05,232
This is why we ask
for a cleaning deposit from you

85
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,757
when you check in.

86
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,155
So you're really going, huh?

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,270
I can't exactly stay.

88
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,358
The whole attack on this place,

89
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,484
me shooting the boss' kid
with a rocket,

90
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,159
the kid going boom...

91
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,772
Things are just too...

92
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,050
weird now.

93
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,272
Things are usually weird
around here,

94
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,237
but I agree,
they're especially weird right now.

95
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:33,058
I appreciate you guys letting me
stay here as long as you have,

96
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,812
- but you need room at the inn, so...
- Kate, do you want to stay here?

97
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:42,991
Why do you ask?

98
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:47,365
You've taken your sweet time leaving.
You've obviously made yourself at home.

99
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,556
I don't know.

100
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,768
The leg's still a bit stiff.

101
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,914
I was planning on waiting until I was
in peak condition before shipping out.

102
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,545
Whatever.

103
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:04,548
If you're leaving, clean the place up,
and if you're staying,

104
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,166
clean the place up.

105
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,873
Garbage pickup's at 4:00.

106
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:09,148
Good to know.

107
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,055
"Garbage pickup is at 4:00."

108
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,506
Are we going to do this now?

109
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,845
Fine, and don't bare your teeth at me!
I know what that means!

110
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,348
Please, Will,

111
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
come in.

112
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:58,769
We'll discuss this later.
God...

113
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,320
I know you've had your hands full,

114
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,255
and I really appreciate
you all giving me some time,

115
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,450
and I'm hardly the only one
personally affected by recent events.

116
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:16,576
We haven't spoken
since Clara's memorial service.

117
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,701
Yeah, which was five days ago.

118
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,537
Magnus, what happened was...

119
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,038
The worst thing I could imagine,

120
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,463
but it happened,

121
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:31,735
and you mourning Ashley alone
is not going to do yourself

122
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,405
or anyone else any good.

123
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,681
- Without closure...
- I know all of that.

124
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,602
Why are you delaying the inevitable?
Why are you hiding in here?

125
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:42,855
Simple or complicated version?

126
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,493
Your choice.

127
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:49,734
- What are you doing?
- I've wanted to tell you that for days,

128
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,193
but I had to be sure,

129
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:53,615
and now I am.

130
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,617
Of what?

131
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:59,496
I'm not mourning anything,
not yet...

132
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,898
Because I believe
there's a very real chance

133
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,919
that Ashley may still be alive.

134
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:12,878
Is that a real,
live stenopelhabilis?

135
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,687
Not so much alive as dead.

136
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:20,350
These two were the last of their kind.
They bought it when London was hit.

137
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,153
I didn't even know
there was any left in existence.

138
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,091
There are many species under our care
we prefer people to believe are extinct.

139
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,109
No way, you had a male and a female?

140
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,695
We were trying to breed them.

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,532
Dr. Magnus wanted them
brought here for study,

142
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,000
and safekeeping.

143
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,467
What?

144
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:41,747
You don't think
I know about the tusks?

145
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,842
That's all you see, isn't it?

146
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,462
Do you know how much those are worth
on the European market alone?

147
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,587
And I'm talking for each pair.

148
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,958
Forget about Asia,
that'd be, like, double the...

149
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,008
Who are you?

150
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,221
Ark-Fong Li,
head of the Beijing Sanctuary,

151
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,888
meet Kate Freelander,
professional pain in the ass,

152
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,375
who I believe was just leaving.

153
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,161
I was, but Will asked me
to stay a little longer

154
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,855
and help out
with all the newbies and stuff.

155
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,019
Garbage detail.

156
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:12,992
My idea.

157
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,287
See ya.

158
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,565
How could she have survived?

159
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,537
And believe me, I say this...

160
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,040
wanting her to be somewhere, anywhere,
alive and well.

161
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,167
Which could very well be the case.

162
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,590
The first attacker
teleported at 18:25 hours.

163
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:38,262
Notice the change
in the EM field's strength?

164
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,533
The second attempted teleport
happened less than three minutes later.

165
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:46,046
- Further destabilizing the field.
- Exactly.

166
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,547
So you're saying
the EM field was unstable when...

167
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:52,905
Ashley teleported at 18:29 hours.

168
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,712
- You think she got through?
- A further analysis needs to be done

169
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:03,224
to determine exactly
where she could have landed.

170
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,937
I need you to be
my emotional compass.

171
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:10,399
We nearly lost the Sanctuary network
because of my judgment.

172
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,546
I need to know
that my instincts aren't wrong.

173
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,916
That my feelings don't end up
blinding my decisions.

174
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:42,409
Heck, yeah.

175
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:03,938
Come to mama.

176
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,392
I'm gonna gag.

177
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:27,497
I'll be damned...

178
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,220
Love child of the dead.

179
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:38,101
Come to mama...

180
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:42,698
You little...

181
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:51,768
Fabulous!

182
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,022
If we move
the Kitapholus Drocena here,

183
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:58,335
we could put the Seroslugs
on the third floor by the Lotus Elks.

184
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,214
No, Lotus Elk eat Seroslug.

185
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,739
What about the cryo-lab?

186
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,150
That's the only room
that goes to minus 30 degrees.

187
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:08,327
I was hoping to save that
for the northern Halcylops.

188
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:10,452
What about the Pradophili?

189
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,069
Ape man...

190
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:16,503
And short human guy,
I ordered Thai food, like, an hour ago.

191
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,967
What, are you clowns on strike,
or what?

192
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,801
Annoying insect guy,
you'll eat when it's your turn to eat.

193
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,357
Wait a minute. You hate me
because I got wings, don't you?

194
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,546
Because I have the freedom of flight

195
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:29,710
and you don't!

196
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,672
Yeah, that's why I hate you.

197
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:34,462
Now go back to your shoebox
and let us work, please.

198
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:35,772
You gonna eat that?

199
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,877
Because I can make
a serious smorgasbord with that.

200
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,595
Listen,

201
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,882
will you go away
if I give it to you?

202
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,667
Holy jeez!

203
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,888
The density of these things.

204
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,998
I can feel my deltoids.

205
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,686
Hey, sweet cheeks, my room, now!

206
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:57,811
You wish.

207
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:01,089
What happened to you?

208
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:07,596
It seems like the dead female steno
was still able to carry a healthy baby,

209
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,431
and Mazel Tov,

210
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,700
she had one.

211
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:13,467
That's great! We should put it
in an incubator or something.

212
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,103
Slight problem.

213
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:16,865
It got away.

214
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,140
Say again?

215
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,720
I tried to stop it,
but the little bugger tried to eat me.

216
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,350
They were all in stasis.

217
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,820
Mom was in stasis.

218
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:28,366
Junior, as it turns out,
not so much.

219
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,030
This is not good. This is not good.
We have to find it

220
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:32,760
before it gets eaten by something,

221
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:33,925
or vice versa.

222
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,285
What were you doing down there?

223
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:42,885
That is a very...

224
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,841
Astute question.

225
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:48,165
Perhaps you'd like to sell me too?

226
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,445
Maybe.

227
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,755
A baby stenopelhabilis.

228
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,695
How in the world?

229
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,320
That's nasty food.

230
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:09,241
Not good for you at all.
Here, now.

231
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:12,077
Here, just let me...

232
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,487
I know that look.
Just spill it.

233
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:26,815
What do you think
happens after we die?

234
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,179
You've seen more lives end
than anyone else that I know.

235
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,920
Kurt and Albert and I
got into this discussion once

236
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,310
at a Princeton football game.
I think it was 1953.

237
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,188
Albert argued
that the concept of matter

238
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,774
equaling energy, and vice versa,

239
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,276
was far more ubiquitous
than any of us could have imagined.

240
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:48,865
That would be Kurt Godel
and Albert Einstein?

241
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,525
Of course.

242
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,535
I'm a guy hammering in stakes here.
You want to have a little mercy?

243
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,255
What do I think death is?

244
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,295
Did you ever see "Field of Dreams"?

245
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,545
- I loved that movie.
- The cornfield.

246
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,915
It's rather like that.

247
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,780
I never understood
what happened in the cornfield.

248
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:10,510
Nobody did.
That was the point.

249
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,625
You're missing out on all the fun.

250
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:22,285
There's food if you're hungry. Dr. Li
can patch you up if you're injured.

251
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:23,975
I haven't the time.

252
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,365
I wonder why.

253
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:29,970
You'll be pleased to know Nikola and I
are making significant headway

254
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:31,406
into the Cabal's operations.

255
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,660
Individual cells exist,

256
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,425
but the central brain trust has...

257
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:38,635
been undone.

258
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,345
You're killing them off.

259
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,455
They exist

260
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:47,422
only as disparate,
disconnected camps now.

261
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,509
And Dana Whitcomb?

262
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,138
A fugitive,
but it's only a matter of time.

263
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,141
She will answer for what she's done.

264
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,310
With her life?
Will that help?

265
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,938
On second thought,
don't answer that.

266
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,205
Perhaps once I've found her,

267
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,075
I'll simply hand her over
to the authorities?

268
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:11,529
I don't need your blessing!

269
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:14,616
There is a part of you

270
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,875
that's dying for the moment
I come and tell you it's done.

271
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,090
I'm choosing to focus
on other things, John,

272
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,565
like rebuilding.

273
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:28,588
Then plan Ashley's funeral.

274
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,383
Not yet. Not until I say.

275
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,390
- This delusional game you're playing...
- There is a chance...

276
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:35,815
Is there really?

277
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:39,065
You may have been able

278
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,275
to convince these others
to follow you down

279
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:46,705
this perverse rabbit hole,
but I will not!

280
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,240
They took her from us in the most

281
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,625
unnatural way possible!

282
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,535
I'm doing my part.

283
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:04,958
Do yours.

284
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,005
Gas station's five miles back.

285
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:47,625
Actually, I'm trying to find
Tehuatonichen.

286
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,669
My information says
it's in this area.

287
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,837
Am I close?

288
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:54,035
Ain't nothin' round here but desert.

289
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,270
We'll track the steno,
and we'll bag it with snares,

290
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,380
or if we have to,
we'll use a shock web.

291
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:12,505
Definitely not, and please, gently with
the snares. We don't want to hurt it.

292
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,915
Dude... Snares? It's a steno.
I say

293
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,925
you set the phasers to 11

294
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:22,655
and fry the sucker.

295
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:24,705
It was defending itself,

296
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,885
most likely from being sold
on the black market by you.

297
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:33,588
We need some bait.

298
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,940
We were feeding its parents
bamboo leaves and shoots...

299
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:38,885
Or my day-old hamburger...

300
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:40,678
Shush.

301
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,620
As I was saying,

302
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:46,110
we have several rare genera of bamboo
from the southern Yangtze region

303
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:48,340
which I'm sure it will
find very delicious.

304
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:50,180
Let's just get this thing
back in a cage

305
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,440
before it gets eaten
by something hungrier and bigger.

306
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,192
I'm telling you, burgers!

307
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,777
Thanks for the tip.

308
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,695
And the whole snare thing,
big mistake!

309
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:02,985
I can't see anything here.

310
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,955
There's no evidence
in the bio-scanner of Ashley

311
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,957
escaping the EM field perimeter.

312
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,752
I've been looking at this
from the wrong point of view.

313
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:17,095
I thought the field de-stabilization
could have allow her to go through it.

314
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,600
- What else could it mean?
- That she simply bounced back

315
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:23,370
within the field itself, re-materialized
somewhere inside the Sanctuary.

316
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,745
Think about it.

317
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:29,055
Why did the field weaken
at the exact moment that she teleported?

318
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,870
An anomaly? A power surge because she
was taking one of the super abnormals

319
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,732
- with her at the time?
- You're reaching.

320
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,710
All we need to do is search
for elements of Ashley's DNA

321
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,505
inside the Sanctuary.

322
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,345
You're reaching.

323
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:45,410
We have had a work crew in the Sanctuary
for a week and no one has found anything

324
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,300
that could possibly be construed
as a body.

325
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,245
But they haven't been everywhere.

326
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,005
She could be disoriented...

327
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:57,595
Or hurt.

328
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,008
Or gone.

329
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,515
Do you really want me to stop?

330
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,795
Ground floor, lower level secured.

331
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,286
Okay, good.

332
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:21,435
Dr. Li?

333
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:23,465
No sign yet.

334
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:26,740
Perhaps it's sleeping somewhere.

335
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,865
They only sleep at night.
It will definitely be awake.

336
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,755
Everybody stay in touch.

337
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,445
I have him.

339
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,875
Can you get it?

340
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:52,715
All right.

341
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:54,635
All right...

342
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:09,625
On the move,
going for the lower levels.

343
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:12,455
Big Guy, it's headed your way!

344
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:13,905
Ready.

345
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,216
Got you, you little...

346
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,155
- What happened?
- It jumped.

347
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,356
- It can't jump. Stenos don't do that.
- This one did.

348
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,045
Damn it.

349
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,870
It's in the vent system.

350
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,822
- Can't you just trap it in there?
- Not fast enough. This is very bad.

351
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:52,665
Great. It's gone.

352
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:57,565
Well, you clearly
don't need my help.

353
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:12,975
This is a disaster.

354
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,985
The Titanic's a disaster.

355
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,125
Madonna's movie career, disaster.
This is nothing.

356
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,945
You don't get it, do you?

357
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,370
I'm supposed to be the man, and losing
a one-of-a-kind baby steno

358
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,071
does not exactly make me "the man".

359
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,985
Quite a predicament.

360
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,830
If only you had the services

361
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:33,955
of a world-class hunter/tracker
at your disposal.

362
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:35,745
Name your price.

363
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,040
Never say that to me
unless you mean it.

364
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:39,235
I'm saying it.

365
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:43,254
Mommy and daddy's tusks.

366
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:45,298
No. No way.

367
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:50,805
The bamboo salesman and the giant
walking rug are running the Sanctuary,

368
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:54,905
and I'm right here,
healthy, willing and able.

369
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,485
Come on, Henry,
do you wanna be the man or not?

370
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:05,374
- One steno tusk. One.
- Two sets of two, or it's not worth it.

371
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:06,736
One set...

372
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,529
- The female.
- Fine.

373
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:11,645
Let's roll!

374
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,870
Once the scan is complete,
any biological artifacts

375
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,092
matching Ashley's DNA
should show up.

376
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:20,895
If we do find something,
how do we know that it's not from

377
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:24,260
one of the super abnormals?
Didn't they share Ashley's DNA?

378
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:26,970
I'm hopeful that there are ways
to tell the difference.

379
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:30,005
Either way, we should have
a good idea of what really happened.

380
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,639
I can't tell if this is
a real investigation or a train wreck.

381
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,727
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't...

382
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,300
Never stop doing that,

383
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,975
being honest with me.

384
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,148
Anything else,
and I will be insulted.

385
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,745
Thanks. Sancho Panza had it easy.

386
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:55,515
Ashley and I always had to face
tragedy and loss in our work.

387
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:57,370
I taught her a saying...

388
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,575
"Nos must amitto vivo en."

389
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:02,166
"We must let go to live on."

390
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,377
Well done, Sancho.

391
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:08,025
You know, she always faced death
better than me,

392
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:09,795
among many things.

393
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,384
That must've been hard,

394
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,803
just you and her.

395
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:16,865
It was worth every minute.

396
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:24,063
<i>There has been an incident
at Vera's Burger Shack</i>

397
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,231
<i>on Salisbury.</i>

398
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,465
Just let me handle the cops, okay?

399
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:32,520
- Can I help you folks?
- Health Department.

400
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,635
We got a call
about a code violation.

401
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:36,905
Okay, go ahead.

402
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,675
- Health Department?
- No one ever checks.

403
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:44,083
- So, what did I tell you? Burgers.
- Okay, Shush.

404
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:48,395
It happened only 20 minutes ago.
It couldn't have gotten far.

405
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,565
Especially if it just ate.

406
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:58,139
Is it just me,
or has its shoe size gone up?

407
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:01,184
We're going to need a bigger cage.

408
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:08,630
Just chowed down,
been on the run for a while.

409
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:10,818
If I was a full, tired critter,

410
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:14,065
- I'd want a place to lay low for a bit.
- Make a nest.

411
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:15,805
I'm thinking yeah.

412
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,205
Made it myself.

413
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,169
I'm not hungry, thank you.

414
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:39,138
Will, would you please stop hovering?
I can take care of myself.

415
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:43,095
You've barely eaten for six days.

416
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,830
You've had hardly any sleep.
Even for you, this is extreme.

417
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:48,455
- I'm fine.
- Yes and no.

418
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,675
You've got a clear mind, good focus,
but you also...

419
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:57,075
You drift off

420
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:00,155
- now and again. You leave.
- It's just memories.

421
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:05,320
- If this bio-scan comes up empty...
- What theory will I cook up next

422
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,800
to keep this quest alive?

423
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,105
- No, I wasn't saying that.
- Yes, you were.

424
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:13,305
I need to know,

425
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:15,645
are you searching for closure...

426
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,343
or a miracle?

427
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,415
There are no such thing as miracles.

428
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:24,775
It's found something.

429
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,313
The coordinates say
it should be right...

430
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:33,825
There.

431
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:36,955
Oh, my God.

432
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,920
Once you get it free,
bring it to the lab.

433
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,745
I'll run a full autopsy.

434
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,625
I'll meet you there.

435
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:01,715
- Big guy, if you want me to do this...
- No.

436
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,105
Okay, I draw the line.

437
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,760
Come on.
Big kudos to the consultant.

438
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:19,310
You were right about it
trying to find a place to lay low.

439
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:21,198
That's a sewer down there.

440
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:26,214
City worker gets attacked in the sewer.
We go into the sewers.

441
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:28,800
And the stink that never
comes out of your clothes?

442
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,208
Are we ignoring the need
for new wardrobe?

443
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,425
Get in the hole.

444
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,905
But not with this.

445
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,121
Come on.
Get with the program, please.

446
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,620
Hank, reality check.

447
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:45,848
This thing just sent a fry cook
and a sewer worker

448
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:49,326
to the emergency room
with lacerations.

449
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:53,151
It's obviously way nastier
than it was this morning.

450
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:56,225
You want the tusks or not?

451
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Anything?

452
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,010
The remains are too burnt to determine
a fingerprint pattern.

453
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:05,390
- What about you?
- X-rays we were able to recover.

454
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:08,794
Tissue analysis and bone density results
will take a little more time.

455
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:13,394
- This isn't Ashley.
- How can you tell?

456
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,196
Ashley broke her right femur
when she was 12 years old.

457
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,923
This one shows no evidence
of re-calcification.

458
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,904
These are the remains of one
of the other abnormals that attacked us.

459
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:27,223
Okay, well, it's something.

460
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:31,435
Look, I know you were hoping
for something else, but...

461
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,215
I'm feeling quite tired, Will.

462
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,584
I think I'll lie down for a while.

463
00:29:57,455 --> 00:30:00,605
These fries look almost fresh.
It's got to be close.

464
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,095
Once we do bag it,

465
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:07,225
breaking it from its junk food habit
is going to be a bitch.

466
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:10,483
All right, these tunnels rejoin
a couple blocks south of here,

467
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:13,490
You take left, I'll go right.
We'll flush it out on the other side.

468
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,065
Sounds like a plan.

469
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:18,715
- Keep in touch, and remember...
- Stun, no gun. I got it.

470
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:20,985
Great.

471
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:44,885
Policy-schmolicy.

472
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,275
Hello.

473
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:03,365
What are you looking for?

474
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:05,779
A place that doesn't exist,
apparently.

475
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:07,645
Tehuatonichen.

476
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,875
You're right. It doesn't exist.

477
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,235
And yet,

478
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,747
you've heard of it.

479
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:21,935
Einstein was right.

480
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,381
- Matter into energy.
- Right.

481
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,342
- But landing where?
- The EM field itself.

482
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:29,428
That's what the fluctuation means.
That's why I keep seeing...

483
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:35,267
The magnitude and amplitude of the field
increased at the time of her jump.

484
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,435
EM fields absorb energy.

485
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,860
She could be somewhere
in the EM field's buffer,

486
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,231
trapped mid-teleport.

487
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,471
- In the computer?
- Exactly.

488
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,277
That's insane.

489
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,030
Ashley teleported
with another super abnormal.

490
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,581
The fluctuation could be
the EM field's buffer

491
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,532
capturing both signatures
and storing them...

492
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:57,289
Even if she is in here, somehow,
what are you gonna do?

493
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:00,209
You're gonna try to communicate,
to pull her out somehow?

494
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,534
If we could recreate
her signature effectively,

495
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,713
- there may be a way to...
- To what?

496
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:08,517
There are so many variables to consider,
Will, so many pieces to this puzzle.

497
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:10,515
One more test.

498
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,346
I run an exponential wave analysis.

499
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:15,391
I search the EM field
for her particular...

500
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,078
What next?

501
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,205
Come on, Junior...

502
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:40,415
Easy, now...

503
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,102
Let's take this nice and slow.

504
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you want a piece of me, boy?

505
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:52,885
Do you?

506
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,324
You're a boy, right?

507
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:19,348
So, it's bigger.

508
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,452
Move! Move, move!

509
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,188
I thought you said no guns!

510
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,275
I said no guns for you.

511
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,036
Get off of me.

512
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:38,848
Where the hell are we?

513
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:40,835
I don't know.

514
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,615
Looks like your room.

515
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:47,815
These are my jeans.

516
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,461
Oh, man.

517
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,555
- What?
- I think we found its nest.

518
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:56,975
We got to get out of here.

519
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,974
Why didn't it kill you
in the tunnel back there?

520
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:07,020
- It's coming!
- Yeah, I know. Just hold on a sec!

521
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,188
I'm gonna empty a mag into it!

522
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,525
- No, you are not!
- Yeah, I am!

523
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:13,955
Food, water, shelter...

524
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,239
Wait!

525
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:34,525
What the hell?

526
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,051
Look around you.
What's the first thing it did?

527
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:41,685
It licked your face, ate your food,
stole your clothes.

528
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,724
You were the first thing it saw.

529
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:45,809
It thinks you're its mother.

530
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:49,205
I think it has your eyes.

531
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:51,435
Barf.

532
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:55,205
Get off.

533
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:06,638
I came to return this to you.

534
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,395
It was given to me in the Amazon.

535
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:16,045
He was Sani,

536
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,145
our last living Shaman,

537
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,225
spirit leader of our tribe.

538
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,894
I was asked to bring him home.

539
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:28,115
For 300 years,

540
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:31,895
we've been waiting for his return.

541
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:37,986
This means my ancestors
will be at peace.

542
00:36:45,695 --> 00:36:47,287
We want you to have this.

543
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:51,405
It was meant for you.

544
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,775
May it guide you through dark places

545
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,685
and into the light.

546
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:14,606
You should see this.

547
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,948


548
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:30,497
{\No sign of requested energy signature
within electromagnetic field.}

549
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,675
I'm truly sorry, Magnus.

550
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:36,197
Tell everyone the memorial service
will be tomorrow.

551
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,325
I need to reset the EM field.

552
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,355
There's your rare baby, Dr. Li,

553
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:53,155
intact and everything.

554
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:57,024
You've traumatized it.
It keeps showing its teeth.

555
00:37:58,255 --> 00:37:59,855
To you, not to me.

556
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:03,959
You're just jealous because Ralphie
chose me for its mother.

557
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:05,741
You don't even know
what gender it is.

558
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,618
Does it really matter?

559
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,963
It's got a ring to it.

560
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:26,349
You're growing on him.

561
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:34,199
Feels good, doesn't it?
Being a good guy?

562
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:38,485
I got to admit,
you're pretty good at this.

563
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,609
Back at ya, Hank.

564
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,279
You gonna stick around?

565
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,157
Well, I got to get paid, don't I?

566
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:48,765
Right.

567
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,875
A deal's a deal.

568
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:53,535
One steno set.

569
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,207
Have fun in Maui.

570
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,825
Tell you what,

571
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:05,884
hang onto them for me.

572
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,761
I'll collect them later.

573
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:15,845
See you, baby.

574
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,435
I see you've come to your senses.

575
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:35,375
Interesting turn of phrase.

576
00:39:36,845 --> 00:39:39,350
All my senses tell me
that she's still alive,

577
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,294
- somewhere...
- Stop.

578
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,625
Please.

579
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:50,115
In the end, what she chose to do,

580
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,943
she did as Ashley,
not what they turned her into.

581
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,955
Please take some solace in that.

582
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:01,635
I think not.

583
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:04,651
Are you joining us?

584
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:07,515
You may have found closure.

585
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:10,545
I haven't.

586
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,137
Not yet.

587
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,115
<i>Nos must amitto vivo en.</i>

588
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,055
We must let go.

589
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,075
I can't.

590
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,605
You have to, mom.

591
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:30,895
But you're...

592
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:33,967
You're my life.

593
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:38,705
- Without you...
- You'll never be without me,

594
00:42:40,445 --> 00:42:42,995
and I know
that you will always love me.

595
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,625
No matter what.

596
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:59,065
Please.

597
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:02,715
I'm so sorry.
