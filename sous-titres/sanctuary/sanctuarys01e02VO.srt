00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,806
Hello?

2
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,318
Okay, who the hell just used my can?

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,570

10
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,064
Station's closed, pal.

11
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,582
Buddy, what the hell's going on?

12
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,521
You know what?

13
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:50,347
I don't want to know. You just stay put.

14
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,244
Control 4, this is Rail check 2.

15
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,128
I got a pick up on Southbound plateform.

16
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:02,268
Some privacy if you please.

17
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,221
We're just getting to know each other.

18
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,319
I am so sick of that.

19
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,571
Will my friend,

20
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,041
you are on fire tonight.

21
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:21,017
Good.

22
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,296
You're awake.

23
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,250
Considering I'm looking at
a photo of you and Joe Louis,

24
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,700
I don't think so.

25
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,100
I apologize for
my boldness this evening.

26
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:37,009
Woman from earlier,

27
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,764
creepy house, wacked photos.

28
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,036
Probably working through
some childhood stuff?

29
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,122
Bedwetting issues, night fears.

30
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:47,012
Still, this is good stuff.

31
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,598
Even for me.

32
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,551
Dr Zimmerman.

33
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,880
I assure you I am real,

34
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,536
as is this place, and everthing in it.

35
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,860
No, see, that's impossible.

36
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,802
Because if this place is real
and I did pass out here,

37
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,751
then that means that...

38
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,205
Oh god...

39
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:22,082
I love the dark.

40
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,717
It's such a wonderful feeling.

41
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,390
Letting the blackness envelop you,

42
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,554
hide you,

43
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,139
protect you from harm.

44
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:38,405
I know all too well
what it is like to be different,

45
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,456
to have others hate me,

46
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:44,233
fear me...

47
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,798
the way he fears you...

48
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:55,318
Fulfill your desires,

49
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,037
do your heart's content.

50
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,155
With one condition.

51
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,182
I need your help...

52
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,423
to find an old friend.

53
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,819
My manservant seems
to have a profound impact on you.

54
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:45,697
Yeah, if you call fifteen years
of therapy down the drain profound.

55
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,205
My patients and
I are unused to visitors.

56
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,284
- We should have warned you, I suppose.
- That thing is your patient?

57
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,252
Former patient actually.

58
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:57,821
After I removed more than a few bullets
from his body, he refused to leave.

59
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:59,957
So I gave him a position on my staff.

60
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:03,719
And I must say he brews tea
as poorly as a short order cook.

61
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:08,533
- He flushed me out of my shower.
- Did he use your toilet?

62
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,982
That is so annoying.
I'll be sure to have a word with him.

63
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:13,983
No, it's not the toilet flushing
that bothers me,

64
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,531
it's the kidnapping.

65
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,715
- And that fact that he's a...
- Well, he can't help who he is.

66
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,429
Okay, you know what?

67
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,417
This is been great, but I'm overdue
for a round of heavy drinking

68
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,078
and some tranquilizers so...

69
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,042
If I could just have my clothes, please.

70
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,117
As you wish.

71
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,856
But outside that door
are creatures that makes

72
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:39,194
my buttler seems
like a housecat by comparison.

73
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,954
Sanctuary for all is not an empty motto.

74
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,355
A scone?

75
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,788
Rail check 2, this is Blue Rider 9.

76
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,946
Respond.

77
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,481
Respond Rail check 2.

78
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,347
Nothing.

79
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,488
I hate this goddamn sector.

80
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,661
No one likes working under the old city.

81
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,897
Too many bad memories.

82
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,591
Well if this guy caught an Express

83
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,359
he could be up in Gunns Landing
for all we know, or

84
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,828
friggin Sentinel Green...

85
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,137
We've been checking the switches
on the number 4 line, near 149th.

86
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:18,212
- I'm thinking he didn't go far.
-  Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,977
Yeah, I'm thinking you're right.

88
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,176
So you're a doctor of what exactly?

89
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,069
It depends on the patient of course.

90
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,056
Of course!

91
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,258
You spent eight years
of your life studying medecine...

92
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,476
for what?

93
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:42,509
So you could practice a profession
that has almost nothing to do

94
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,784
with the reality
of the world around you?

95
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:48,915
How about a little context
with that character assassination?

96
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,515
That,

97
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,107
I can provide.

98
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,613
I specialize in teralogy,
among other things ...

99
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,716
I'm sorry, teralogy?

100
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:07,272
... combined with healthy doses of
cryptozoology and xenobiology as well,

101
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,975
when the need arises.

102
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,324
Please.

103
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:26,558
Teralogy, from the greek "teras"

104
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,541
meaning hideous creature, deformity,

105
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:31,457
unknown being.

106
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,099
New guy.

107
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:49,494
Hey!

108
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,622
New guy.

109
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:53,675
New guy...

110
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,122
New guy!

111
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,353
Stop it! Both of you.

112
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,716
I apologize. They're incorrigible.

113
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:06,816
None of these...

114
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,394
things are running around free, right?

115
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,236
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,287
Exercice time isn't for
another two hours.

117
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,386
The purpose of this institute
is to find and help

118
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,805
the unfortunate creatures of this world.

119
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,233
Dr Zimmerman,

120
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,552
I believe there is a vital role
for you to play here.

121
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:31,209
You want me to help you
capture monsters?

122
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,524
I prefer to call them abnormals.

123
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:34,855
Please.

124
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,403
You find my offer amusing.

125
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:44,509
- Yes.
- Because you're afraid.

126
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,469
You work with monsters.

127
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,768
I work with sentient beings.

128
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,033
each worthy of
the same respect that humans,

129
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,868
even animals, receive automatically.

130
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,431
They are the key to the
evolution of our race.

131
00:11:58,526 --> 00:11:59,730
And yet we revile them,

132
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,188
destroy them.

133
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,445
And worst of all,

134
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:05,853
pretend they don't even exist.

135
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,175
But they are out there Dr Zimmerman,

136
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:11,222
lost, like children,

137
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,239
misunderstood, hunted.

138
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:16,700
Are they really so different from
the outcasts you treat every day?

139
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,480
You knew Mr Tolson
was telling you the truth.

140
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:26,228
And in that one moment, I saw that
you were capable of so much more.

141
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:29,316
I believed some of his story.

142
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,864
That doesn't make me
Jeckyll to your Hyde,

143
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:34,881
- or whatever the right combo is.
-  Open your eyes.

144
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,343
Good doctors come and go.

145
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,748
But the really great ones have always
seen beyond the bounderies of science,

146
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,391
beyond the known

147
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,578
The great ones dare to believe

148
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,289
in the unbelievable.

149
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,735
He must be close.

150
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,912
Who?

151
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,730
Our quarry.

152
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,195
So how did you know
the killer's next victim

153
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,953
would be down here and not...
you know...

154
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,082
up,

155
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:43,953
uptown.

156
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,920
I have my sources.

157
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,411
Could you be a little more
cyptic please?

158
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,814
Because I was starting to feel in the
loop there and we wouldn't want that.

159
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,461
Our subject is unused to human contact.

160
00:13:56,942 --> 00:14:00,723
He would seek refuge in these
catacombs if only for the solitude.

161
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,673
Plus I have a police scannner.

162
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:21,693
And how did you know the victim
was the work of the subject.

163
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,712
Because I had been tracking
the little dweeb all night.

164
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:25,832
Hi.

165
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,074
With very little success I'm afraid.

166
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,783
Well, that's because
someone else was down here.

167
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,717
Tall dude.

168
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,083
Moves faster than me.
If that's possible.

169
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:40,729
What did he look like?

170
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,891
Old, trenchcoat...

171
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:44,889
didn't see much.

172
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:45,836
Guys!

173
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,584
It's okay.

174
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:57,857
It's okay.

175
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,511
Stop!

176
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,135
We need him alive.

177
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:11,296
We want to help you.

178
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:15,567
Do you undertsand me?

179
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,596
Over here! Over here!

180
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,363
Yeah. That's it. That's it.

181
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:37,790
Okay.

182
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,041
Easy.

183
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,080
A little help here please.

184
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,248
You okay?

185
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,483
I'm fine.

186
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,007
Far from it.

187
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:00,826
This chaos was completely avoidable.

188
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,941
Give me a break.
I've been avoiding cops, ghouls

189
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:05,099
and god knows what else
in dark tunnels all night.

190
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,095
I need food. I need a bath.

191
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:09,026
I don't need a lecture.

192
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,361
Okay, so I'm...

193
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,708
getting that you two know each other.

194
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,312
Dr Zimmerman,

195
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,004
this is Ashley.

196
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,962
My daughter.
