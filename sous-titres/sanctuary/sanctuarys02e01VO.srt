1
00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:02,340
<i>Previously on </i>Sanctuary...

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:04,604
<i>The Cabal are
a powerful shadow organization</i>

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>bent on controlling
all abnormal life on the planet.</i>

4
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:13,083
<i>The war has begun.</i>

5
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,681
<i>Pitting humans against abnormals,</i>

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,642
<i>deciding who lives and who dies,</i>

7
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,268
<i>the Cabal has to be stopped.</i>

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,603
It's why I started this mission
more than a century ago.

9
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,561
<i>We were a part of something,
something we called the Five,</i>

10
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>a small group dedicated to expanding
our knowledge of the physical world.</i>

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,937
<i>Your mother was able to procure
a very rare sample</i>

12
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,866
<i>of ancient, untainted vampire blood,</i>

13
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>blood that supposedly possessed
miraculous properties.</i>

14
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,873
<i>Your mother and her colleagues
will no doubt try to stop us.</i>

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,124
They'll fail.

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,192
You're going to help us
complete our plan.

17
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,337
- What did you do to me?
- You're going to die today, Ashley.

18
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,690
It was a set-up.
Something else is going on.

19
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:53,969
We're too late.

20
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:14,972
Thank you, Ashley.

21
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,851
You've been everything
we could have hoped for.

22
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,772
Welcome to your rebirth.

23
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,018
Did you bring it?

24
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,323
Highest quality.

25
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,467
You must be desperate indeed.

26
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,088
Desperate was last month.

27
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:20,765
This month means breathing
the same air as people like you.

28
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,589
And I am so honored.

29
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,128
No games.
What do you know?

30
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,529
Word is, you seek blood,

31
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:30,691
but what kind?

32
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,529
That of ancient vampires,

33
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,342
or your own kin?

34
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,550
And, may I say,

35
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,968
things have been quiet
for so many of us

36
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,443
since Ashley's...

37
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:41,732
departure.

38
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,580
Silver linings and all that.

39
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,581
If you're done enjoying yourself...

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
Hardly,

41
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,397
but to business.

42
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,463
You wish to know
Ashley's whereabouts,

43
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:55,034
what the Cabal has done with her,

44
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,759
among other things.

45
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,521
And if your information
proves valuable,

46
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,639
I'm willing
to reward you handsomely.

47
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,806
I do know...

48
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:04,934
things.

49
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:07,061
Trading is my trade,

50
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:11,497
and this is a lovely token
of your desperation,

51
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,401
but, as it turns out,

52
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,009
I have nothing left to say to you.

53
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,350
You won't make it out of here alive

54
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,743
if you try to harm me.

55
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:25,037
<i>Salaam aleikum.</i>

56
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,350
<i>Aleikum salaam.</i>

57
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,921
Please, love of God, no problems!

58
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,229
No problems...

59
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,485
It's much nicer out here,
don't you think?

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,660
Less smoky,

61
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,734
easier for you to think clearly.

62
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,550
So, unless you'd enjoy
an express trip

63
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,986
to someplace very cold,

64
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,116
I'd suggest you be
a little more forthcoming.

65
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,363
No one knows much,

66
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:09,488
but word is,

67
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,680
they control her mind completely,

68
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,533
and that she is...
more than she was before.

69
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,217
That she is like you.

70
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,009
We need a location.

71
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:22,136
I don't know.

72
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,991
- Which direction is true north?
- I'm not resisting!

73
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:26,566
I am not resisting.

74
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,094
She is deep within their network.

75
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,521
No one, not even their most
trusted operatives,

76
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,037
has access,

77
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,567
and they are using her
for something,

78
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,681
a special project,

79
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,564
something only the most
powerful people

80
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,198
in the organization know about.

81
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,347
I've seen this before

82
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,538
with those the Cabal
claim as their own.

83
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,082
She is a ghost.

84
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,307
The girl you knew as your daughter

85
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:00,925
is dead.

86
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,104
The Team Projet-SG

87
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,401
presents:

88
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,612
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 1
End of Nights - Part 1 (v. 1.00)

89
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,117
Timing by: Arrow,
nitrogenc, Salomon

90
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,927
http://projet-sg.net

91
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,659
I can't do it.

92
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:35,063
I won't do it, actually.

93
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,036
<i>Oh, come on, Will,
just one nickname.</i>

94
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,661
<i>It can be something manly.</i>

95
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,358
Something manly?
Like what?

96
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,110
<i>Huggy bear.</i>

97
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,936
Huggy... Now you're just mocking me,
and that's not fair.

98
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,782
<i>No, this is a long-distance
relationship.</i>

99
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,974
<i>I mean, we need all the lovey-dovey</i>

100
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,749
<i>cutesy crap we can get.</i>

101
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,477
- <i>Keep the fires burning.</i>
- Do you know what?

102
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:58,662
London has made you soft, darling.

103
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:01,348
You should come home before you start
thinking cricket is a real sport.

104
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,265
It's not a sport.
It's a little insect,

105
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,165
makes a little song with its legs.

106
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,290
<i>I don't know,</i>

107
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,802
<i>the UK Sanctuary's
kind of growing on me.</i>

108
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:12,582
Yeah, I heard...

109
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,041
I heard you're doing
really well out there.

110
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,566
<i>I miss you, a lot.</i>

111
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,734
I miss you, too.

112
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,196
<i>You sure you can't catch a red-eye,
come out just for a few days?</i>

113
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,446
Do it. Just do it. Do it.

114
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:35,329
I'd love to, but, you know,
I'm kind of minding the shop here.

115
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,955
Listen... I gotta go.

116
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,000
- <i>Be good.</i>
- You too.

117
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:44,756
See ya.

118
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,674
You know, actually,
I'm fine to cover things here

119
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,614
if you two want to go
moon over each other in Covent Garden.

120
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,991
There's a lovely cafe

121
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,449
where Churchill used to
gorge himself on pastries.

122
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,227
Thanks, but...
I think I'll take a rain check.

123
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,627
Young love is so...

124
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,883
Heartbreaking to observe
as a scientist.

125
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,739
So passionate, so innocent,

126
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,807
and yet so utterly doomed.

127
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:13,294
So I'm guessing you've never
been in love, then?

128
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,072
Countless times, my friend.

129
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:18,258
See, the difference is
I recognize the emotion for what it is,

130
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:20,323
an irrational,
self-destructive impulse

131
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,959
which is disguised as joy.

132
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,545
Was there something you wanted,
or you wanted to come and ruin...

133
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:29,508
Your shaggy friend is still refusing
treatment, and, frankly, I'm insulted.

134
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,386
Right, yeah, because I forgot,
this is all about you.

135
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:35,578
I have spent weeks

136
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:38,201
creating a working treatment
for the Lazarus virus.

137
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,617
I spend weeks more
traveling the Earth

138
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,829
disseminating it
to the affected abnormals,

139
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,816
effectively stemming an outbreak,

140
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,941
and in the end,

141
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,845
the creep in the room with the hair

142
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,960
doesn't want to take his medicine!

143
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,135
- It's personal, and we know it is.
- What do you want?

144
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,457
Henry's talking to him.

145
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,580
Does your hirsute friend understand

146
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,080
that he's facing probably
the most unpleasant

147
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,989
slow, lingering death
in all creation?

148
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:04,501
I'm sure you made it
abundantly clear.

149
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,082
Also...

150
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:09,888
Huggy bear,

151
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,719
we're out of wine.

152
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,587
- That's not my nickname.
- Huggy bear!

153
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,091
Hey, Big Guy...

154
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,579
Leave me be, Henry.

155
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,219
Yeah, tried that,
doesn't really work for me,

156
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:45,715
for any of us, actually.

157
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,179
You know what I'm going to ask.

158
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,670
Seriously, who cares if that cure
was cooked up by a world-class jerk?

159
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:56,428
- The stuff works.
- I will not...

160
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,923
take this treatment.

161
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,768
Your holistic cures aren't working.

162
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:05,348
We have to keep you locked up.

163
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:09,045
If I ingest

164
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:13,211
this human-made cure,

165
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,530
my people...

166
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,234
Will disown you, I know, I know,
but could you...

167
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:25,273
I will not betray who I am.

168
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,904
You'd rather die like a diseased,
psychotic animal instead?

169
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,478
That's great. I get that.

170
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,969
I get it.

171
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,290
I know who I am!

172
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:44,635
I know who I am!

173
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:47,593
What I am...

174
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,488
We're running out of road.

175
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:00,448
Something will turn up.
It always does.

176
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:04,589
We've interrogated every
Cabal-backed abnormal we can find,

177
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,955
and we've learned nothing,

178
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,127
- except that our quest may be hopeless.
- Are you quite finished?

179
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:14,798
Assam mentioned this being an extremely
rarefied project for the Cabal.

180
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,645
They must be receiving some support
from one of their corporate connections,

181
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,431
drug companies, software divisions.
There must be a chink in their armor.

182
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,485
So what's our next move?

183
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:29,062
Terrorizing Fortune 500 executives?

184
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,565
You're here
because I need your help,

185
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,448
and as Ashley's father,
you have the right.

186
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,575
Do i?

187
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,975
There was a time you would have said
the exact opposite,

188
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,331
just before trying
to put a bullet in me.

189
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,545
Tesla may have shocked you
into your senses, John,

190
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:55,095
but nobody becomes what you were
without a predilection for killing.

191
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,342
I've no doubt you'd return
to your murderous habits one day.

192
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,735
I wasn't asking you out on a date,

193
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,145
if that's what you're thinking.

194
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:15,535
Perhaps I just...

195
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,915
Wanted to know where we stood.

196
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:35,780
Hey, what do you got?

197
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,680
Slick-as-they-come heist
at an Interpol data farm near Montreal.

198
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,920
Someone swiped,
like, 200 petabytes of data.

199
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:43,130
- What kind of data?
- The classified kind.

200
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:46,210
MI-6 is involved in the investigation,
which means British Intelligence,

201
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:47,633
but that's not why we care.

202
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,394
Someone got in and out

203
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,312
- without tripping anything!
- Ashley.

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,231
- It's a safe bet.
- You get me in there?

205
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,067
I had Magnus
make some calls to set it up.

206
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,861
It's your new id.
All access pass to spook-ville.

207
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:03,198
- Comes with a lunch and a decoder ring.
- Well done, Henry.

208
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,125
Thank you.

209
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,150
Hard copies
of the stolen computer files.

210
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,178
There's nine more of these,
all to be remanded into your custody.

211
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,465
Great, thanks.

212
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,768
I got to tell you,

213
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,725
I'm very impressed.

214
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,435
My boss?

215
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,535
Very, very powerful guy,

216
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,192
and he just bent over

217
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,485
for yours.

218
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,470
Yeah, it happens a lot.

219
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:44,950
You have to know her.

220
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,324
Believe me, I tried.

221
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,100
Did a little digging,

222
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:51,965
see how a former profiler
like yourself ended up with...

223
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,132
senior intelligence
analyst credentials.

224
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,475
Guess what I found?

225
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,415
Nothing.

226
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,173
Way beyond my pay grade.

227
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,175
I've been there.

228
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:05,575
Listen, just...

229
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:06,964
Off the record,

230
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,848
because I know they'd send me
for a psych eval if I said this

231
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,725
too loud,
but the surveillance footage?

232
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:16,521
I would swear
she just disappeared into thin air.

233
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:27,115
You're not really
a senior intelligence analyst, are you?

234
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:32,954
Off the record?

235
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,375
Not even close.

236
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,555
Can you believe it's friday again?

237
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,365
The weeks just fly by.

238
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,360
We both work so hard
during the week,

239
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,035
we don't get a chance

240
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,825
to talk.

241
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,825
But then friday comes along, and...

242
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,975
Then we can catch up.

243
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,535
Unwind.

244
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,385
Decompress.

245
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,125
So...

246
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:27,615
How are you?

247
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:33,635
Everybody's talking about
your latest mission, by the way.

248
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:35,285
Stellar work.

249
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,475
Stellar.

250
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:39,095
I know,

251
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:40,905
if you could feel

252
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,215
anything,

253
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:45,318
you would feel like I feel.
You would feel pride.

254
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,905
How is she, doctor?

255
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,491
Top-top form.

256
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,859
All systems good.

257
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,705
Any sign of lapses?

258
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,340
No. She's been on the proper dosage
of control medication

259
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:00,665
for weeks now,

260
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,020
and everything's 5x5,

261
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:07,549
as her latest work proves, I'm sure.

262
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,717
Yes, we're all very impressed.

263
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,760
Well, she did all the heavy lifting.

264
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:17,475
I just opened the gate
and kind of pushed her out.

265
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:18,852
Begin phase two.

266
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,175
What?

267
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,358
I mean...
I thought I had another month.

268
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:29,015
Yes, but your success
accelerated the schedule.

269
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,823
I want her ready for trials
as soon as possible.

270
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,705
Okay.

271
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:47,905
Don't worry, hon.

272
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,615
I am going to be with you
every step of the way,

273
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,263
and when I'm done here,

274
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:58,215
you'll be better than you are now.

275
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:51,027
You tell me why this is so important
to you, because none of this adds up!

276
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:53,970
I have known you since I was a kid,

277
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:56,908
and in that time, you have never
once gone back home,

278
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,700
and you're willing to die for them,
but this is your home!

279
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,225
We're your family!

280
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,290
Damn it, talk to me!

281
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,096
I've never gone home

282
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,485
because I can't.

283
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,017
I am not welcome.

284
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:24,795
Why?

285
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:31,275
Mistakes were made.

286
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:34,738
I cannot

287
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:35,906
go home,

288
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:39,425
but I can

289
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,165
live

290
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,170
as my people do,

291
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,295
be true

292
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,620
to our ways!

293
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,105
If that means death,

294
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,995
then that is what I must accept.

295
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,165
Ashley's gone.

296
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,389
I can't lose you too.

297
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:05,155
The end...

298
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,815
Comes to us all.

299
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,275
I choose this.

300
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,315
Burning the midnight oil?

301
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,450
- I didn't know you were back.
- We just arrived.

302
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,095
Did you get what we needed?

303
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:12,790
I'm just going through it now.
There's only one file related to you,

304
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,005
something called "Project Montana",

305
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:18,135
an MI-6 off-book operation
from 25 years ago.

306
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,343
Dear God, of course.

307
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:22,512
- You remember this?
- Hard to forget.

308
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,290
They were trying to modify
the DNA of orphans,

309
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,675
remove any defects.

310
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:31,765
I began two years after the start,
consulting for the British government.

311
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:34,899
- You recommended they shut it down.
- It was reprehensible,

312
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,925
despite their lofty agenda.

313
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:41,395
I still don't know why the Cabal
would want an old file like this.

314
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,659
Then you believe it was Ashley
who stole the data.

315
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:48,035
It was her.

316
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,385
At least we know
she may still be alive.

317
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,423
I'm fine.

318
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,195
Bring all this to my lab.

319
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:02,844
I want Tesla to weigh in on it.

320
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,245
I was just going to say that...

321
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:09,275
It's good to see you again.

322
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,565
It's good to see you too, Will.

323
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:27,630
And here I thought
British Intelligence had scruples.

324
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,305
If you're going to help,
do try to remain sober.

325
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,205
Half-vampire.
Alcohol doesn't affect me.

326
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:36,160
Though since you showed up,
God, I wish it did.

327
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:38,840
Explains why my wine cellar
is now empty.

328
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,965
Consider it payment
for averting a global crisis.

329
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:43,445
Okay, so,

330
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:46,100
MI-6 takes six orphans

331
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:49,125
and performs this DNA
"scrubbing" procedure on them.

332
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:52,800
- Why? I mean, what's the end game?
- Perfectly flawless DNA?

333
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,335
- Is that even possible?
- They came pretty close.

334
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,775
The idea was to strip away any
imperfections from the genetic make-up.

335
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,527
- Almost Aryan in its aspirations.
- Exactly.

336
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:04,197
It was far too close
to a eugenics project for my liking.

337
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,949
What happened to the test subjects?

338
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:09,160
They became wards of the state.
Eventually they were all adopted.

339
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,740
- Most of them would be in their 30s.
- There must be something

340
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,370
about this Project Montana
the Cabal needs.

341
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:19,072
Yes, but it could be anything to do with
genetics, a rather large field of study.

342
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:21,673
This is all a fluke, they wanted
something else from the data farm?

343
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,260
No, I've been through
the entire list of stolen files.

344
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,580
Everything else has to do
with geo-mapping and ice floe charts.

345
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:29,550
This has to be
what they're looking for.

346
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,057
Perhaps I should remind us all

347
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,870
that whatever the Cabal is up to
it has something to do

348
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,478
with the source blood, otherwise

349
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,281
why trick us into stealing it?

350
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,356
Why turn Ashley

351
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,025
into a teleporting delivery girl
to hand it over to them?

352
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,361
Now, tell me,
what does the source blood do?

353
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:47,323
Activates dormant abnormal DNA.

354
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,160
But Project Montana
creates six orphans

355
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,835
with scrubbed DNA.

356
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:54,914
They'd be completely unaffected
by exposure to the blood.

357
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,950
Why steal information

358
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,044
about the only six humans in the world
that the source blood wouldn't affect,

359
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,839
- and why do they need Ashley?
- There's your real mystery.

360
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,380
Whatever's going on, we can bet that
these test subjects are in grave danger.

361
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:07,505
I agree.

362
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,220
Henry, go through the list.
Find out where they all are now.

363
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,056
We need to get to them
before the Cabal.

364
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:13,850
If they haven't been found already.

365
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:38,035
Don't fight it, Ashley,
just let it happen.

366
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,335
Honey, I hate to see you like this.

367
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,885
Rebirth is painful...

368
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:51,705
But it'll be so beautiful.

369
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:07,737
Good news first, or bad?
Four of the six Montana test subjects

370
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,040
are missing, disappeared
over the last few days.

371
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:12,800
- Got to say it's the Cabal.
- But two of them are still free.

372
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:15,160
- But the window's gotta be closing.
- Where are they?

373
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,747
One's just outside of Vancouver.
The other's in Essex, UK.

374
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,935
Find John. We need to move quickly.

375
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:34,495
Ms. Kennair?

376
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,035
Can I help you?

377
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:41,604
Today is your lucky day.

378
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,610
Those urges you're feeling

379
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,320
are entirely normal,

380
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,322
and they can be controlled.

381
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:38,915
See?

382
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,706
I told you
you'd be better than before.

383
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:45,505
Look at you!

384
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,305
It's okay.

385
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,430
It's okay.

386
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:25,615
- May I help you?
- Is this the residence of Martin Wood?

387
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,920
- May I tell him who's calling?
- Helen Magnus and Will Zimmerman.

388
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:31,890
- He should be expecting us.
- It's urgent that we speak with him.

389
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:33,265
May we come in?

390
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,468
Sure.

391
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,275
Have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

392
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:41,695
Thanks.

393
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:58,935
Bloody hell.

394
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,202
Henry, follow the van!

395
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:16,050
Zodiac, this is Freestyle One.
Package is onboard,

396
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:18,552
but I'll need some help
shaking a couple of bogies.

397
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,525
<i>Roger that, Freestyle.
We're waiting at the docks.</i>

398
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:56,132
She's headed toward the river.

399
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,400
I'll take left.

400
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,204
Watch it!

401
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,007
I'm coming in hot
and need to pull a touch-and-go.

402
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,530
Damn it!

403
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:52,796
Honey, I'm home!

404
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:55,995
This way!

405
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,395
Get out!

406
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:14,565
- Can I help you?
- On your knees. Hands on your head.

407
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,214
What have I got,
a tail light out or something?

408
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,285
She had help.

409
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,645
Can I just say,
this was really exciting.

410
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:55,165
You know, when...

411
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,885
they first asked me
to run this project,

412
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,548
the subject of maternal feelings

413
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:02,115
came up.

414
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:09,565
You see, I used to have a daughter.

415
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:15,195
She'd be about your age,
had she lived,

416
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,435
and I'd like to think that...

417
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:22,528
she'd be a lot like you.

418
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,625
A lot like you were.

419
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:35,285
Goodbye, Ashley.

420
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,368
This is the last time
you'll feel any pain.

421
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,025
I really will miss you.

422
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:50,435
I really will.

423
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:03,455
Let's start with your name.

424
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,420
Let's start with a badge,

425
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:08,626
because kidnapping is sometimes,
now and then, viewed as a crime.

426
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:09,950
We know you're Cabal.

427
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,036
You know who we are.
Stop acting like a fool.

428
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,078
Name.

429
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,457
Kate Freelander.

430
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:20,294
Yes, that is my real name,
even though it sounds made up.

431
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:24,465
- For the record, I'm not Cabal.
- So you're what, a freelance operative?

432
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,670
Dog walking, dinner reservations,
even do windows.

433
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,762
Whoever pays me the most
gets my services.

434
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,885
Where was that boat headed?

435
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:34,355
You guys aren't cops.

436
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:37,311
You're not bad guys.
You're not gonna shoot me or arrest me.

437
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,783
We're gonna go 'round and 'round,
and I'm gonna tell you jack,

438
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:41,630
and then I'm gonna escape.

439
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,405
It's a fun little game.

440
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,210
You sure you wanna play?

441
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:48,070
Whatever you've heard about me
may not be entirely accurate.

442
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:51,033
You may not be Cabal, but you can
lead us to them, and you will.

443
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,370
Look, I would love to help you out,

444
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,788
but business is business.
Nothing personal.

445
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,500
Really?

446
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,751
Come on...

447
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,174
- Easy!
- What the hell?

448
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,467
Nothing personal?

449
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,235
They have my daughter!

450
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,805
- Now, where was that boat headed?
- Look, I have no idea!

451
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,225
- Get used to sitting more.
- You're crazy!

452
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:35,015
It must be fun
asking her for a raise.

453
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,254
I don't wanna hear it!
She knows something!

454
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,579
I agree, but maybe let me see
what I can learn first.

455
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:45,713
Fine.

456
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,256
Either way, she'll talk.

457
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,150
You might wanna spend
a little less time with Jack the Ripper.

458
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,011
It's affecting your manners
somewhat.

459
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,645
Nice gun.

460
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,392
Can I see it?

461
00:32:58,985 --> 00:32:59,985
Sure.

462
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,397
Dude, lighten up. It's just a job.

463
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:05,983
Can I have one of those?
I'm beyond starving.

464
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:10,487
Look, you don't have to untie me, okay?
I'll eat it hands-free.

465
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,198
I'll make it look good, too.

466
00:33:45,795 --> 00:33:46,795
Go, go!

467
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,329
She's good.

468
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:06,805
I've been monitoring her closely
since the last treatment,

469
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,120
and her DNA mutation levels
are all exceeding expectations.

470
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:13,166
She's changing
even faster than we'd hoped.

471
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,841
Yes, and without
any cellular rejection,

472
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,166
so this is really going very well.

473
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:20,905
We should be able
to begin tests in...

474
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:22,440
48 hours.

475
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:24,180
Okay, well, the faster the better.

476
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:27,295
The timetable on this has been
accelerated by recent events.

477
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,425
Why, has something happened?

478
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,684
We failed to acquire
one of the Montana test subjects.

479
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:37,169
One less subject shouldn't affect
the viability of the operation.

480
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:38,560
Yes, I know, it won't,

481
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,090
but it does mean we have to act
more aggressively now.

482
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:44,665
You know, even if they put
all the little pieces together,

483
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,885
it'd take them years
to figure out what we're doing.

484
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,836
It's Helen Magnus and Nikola Tesla.

485
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,799
I've underestimated them before,
and I won't do it again.

486
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,225
48 hours?

487
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:58,665
48 hours.

488
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:11,760
How did things go with the test subject
that John brought back from England?

489
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:12,935
Swimmingly.

490
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:18,930
Behold, images of a perfectly
normal human being,

491
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:21,855
and I do mean both perfect
and normal.

492
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,350
Not a single genetic defect
or latent abnormality in her DNA.

493
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,725
Makes me sleepy just looking at it.

494
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:30,450
Assuming the other five
test subjects are the same,

495
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,550
what does the Cabal want with them?

496
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:35,530
Genetic manipulation, obviously,
but what kind?

497
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:39,160
Effective gene therapy is hardly
contingent on having flawless DNA.

498
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:41,960
And they can't use the source blood
to uncork their inner monster.

499
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,141
So what the hell
do they want with them?

500
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,725
And what does it have to do
with Ashley?

501
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,566
They're blank slates,
and I mean literally.

502
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:56,528
I agree the Cabal's agenda
revolves around using the source blood.

503
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,529
Of course.

504
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,282
If they've created some new abnormal,
what good is having only one?

505
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:03,035
Flawless DNA would be easiest
to overwrite.

506
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:06,650
They're not trying to summon a latent
abnormality in their victims' DNA.

507
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:10,170
They want to insert a pre-existing
pattern into their genetic code.

508
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,895
They're making copies.

509
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:13,865
Then the question is...

510
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,055
Of what?

511
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,019
- Well, this is a surprise.
- <i>Really?</i>

512
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,600
Because I delivered
the package to you, intact,

513
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:34,890
and at great financial and physical
expense to myself, I might add,

514
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:36,532
so stop screwing with me,

515
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:40,000
and let's talk about the fact that
no money has appeared in my account.

516
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,012
What's distressing
is that you allowed yourself

517
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:44,034
to be captured and interrogated
by Magnus.

518
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,869
<i>Come on, give me a little credit.</i>

519
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,210
I am a professional.

520
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,827
Nonetheless, as per our stringent policy
regarding mission protocol,

521
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,585
our business relationship is over
effective immediately.

522
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,920
You can't be serious!

523
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:58,715
All the best
in your future endeavors.

524
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:02,965
Bite me hard.

525
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:19,935
Never liked that bitch.

526
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:25,435
Yeah, I'm coming, hold on!

527
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,970
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Power bar guy.

528
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,162
It's nice to see you.
It's freezing out there.

529
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Wait a second.

530
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:37,480
How did you get past
the gate undetected?

531
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,155
Your security's lame,

532
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:41,635
and I really need to use your...

533
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:51,465
Oh, god.

534
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:53,525
A little help!

535
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,810
- This how you treat all your patients?
- The Cabal, how do we find them?

536
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,287
I never make contact with them
directly.

537
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,560
Really? I'd say you made
direct contact with them recently.

538
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,043
The Cabal put a price on your head,
didn't they?

539
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:18,414
You're here
because you've nowhere else to turn.

540
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,089
We have leads, unconfirmed intel,
but nothing we can act on.

541
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:25,719
You wanna give us something,
we can talk about amnesty for you.

542
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:26,987
From the Cabal?

543
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,015
- You're dreaming.
- Why'd you come here?

544
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, I was running low
on vital bodily fluids at the time.

545
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,852
Why do you think?
Any port in the storm, right?

546
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,160
Waste of time. Will, tell Henry to drive
Ms. Freelander to Mercy General.

547
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,795
Drop her at the emergency ward.

548
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,220
Yeah, right, you're gonna do that...

549
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:45,489
I went to one of their facilities!

550
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:47,765
Once.

551
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,284
Where?

552
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:54,235
Just above the US border,
in Alberta.

553
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,502
It was a station where they kept goods
until they could be moved elsewhere.

554
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,214
It seemed like a built-up operation.
Lots of personnel, cool tech.

555
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:06,040
I'll have Henry run a trace, check for
anomalies in the power grid pattern.

556
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:09,167
I'll talk to my contacts in intelligence
community, see if anything matches.

557
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:11,260
What about me?

558
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,183
You can't just leave me here!

559
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:16,755
Do I at least get jell-o?

560
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,612
Having a ballpark location was key.

561
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,074
There's only one spot with a history
of sucking up a ton of juice, see?

562
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,243
Big spikes all triangulated here.

563
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:35,110
That's a large complex about 200 klicks
from anything remotely populated.

564
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:37,582
- Nothing else there.
- Well, at least we got something.

565
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,645
Well done.
Tell everyone we have a target.

566
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,253
We leave immediately.

567
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:53,957
Once we gain access
to the facility itself,

568
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:57,290
our first priority is any information
leading to Ashley.

569
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,885
We find evidence leading to
the test subjects, even better.

570
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,835
Retrieve the source blood,
it's a grand slam?

571
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,260
One thing at a time, Dr. Expendable.

572
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,201
For all we know,
this could be a trap.

573
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:08,560
- Henry, stay in radio contact.
- Will do.

574
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:11,035
Go kick some ass, people.
Carefully!

575
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:15,705
Have fun storming the castle.

576
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,105
What the hell is this?

577
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,478
It's a set-up.

578
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:44,858
Ashley, thank god.

579
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:54,534
What have they done?

580
00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:57,454
It's time you came home.

581
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,209
Listen to me.

582
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:23,230
Manners, young lady.

583
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,695
Ashley, please, listen to me.

584
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,955
No! John, please, take me back!

585
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:06,189
- Take me back!
- She will kill you! She'll kill us all!

586
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,983
Get the EM shield back up now!

587
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,693
We had her! We found her!

588
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,487
What happened?
You left for 10 minutes.

589
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,738
- It didn't go well.
- What have they done to her?

590
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,040
She was waiting for us,
but it wasn't any Ashley you'd know.

591
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:20,287
They've used the source blood
to change her.

592
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,956
She's the only progeny
of two source blood-altered abnormals.

593
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,583
Smart move.

594
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,376
It's not gonna stop there.

595
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,427
They'll use the Montana test subjects
to make copies.

596
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:31,214
There'll be more like her very soon.

597
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,390
Phase 3 is now well underway.

598
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,870
I'm sure the results
will please all of you.

599
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:44,550
Six operatives are now ready
for deployment.

600
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:48,679
Their first mission will be the most
vital to our long-term interests.

601
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:57,045
The complete destruction
of the Sanctuary network.
