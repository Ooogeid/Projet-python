<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:05,288
This isn't a disease, Henry.

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:08,090
I have spent my adult life
working with abnormals,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,721
but now I am one.

5
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:12,162
Look, I can't account for myself
when I'm that thing,

6
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,763
and what if I hurt one of you?

7
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,474
The difference between you and me
is you can control your power.

8
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,309
And in time, so will you.

9
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:23,791
Awesome.

10
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,652
You are such a dork.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,851
You said, "no problem. I'll take over
the feedings while you're gone",

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,919
and then you crap out on me
before I even leave.

13
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:36,327
I know, but secure networks tank,
I'm the go-to guy. What am I gonna do?

14
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,480
Yeah, last time I ask you
for a favor.

15
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,044
I can swing by there after I'm done.
It'll be, like, 30, 40 minutes, tops.

16
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>40 minutes Henry Foss time?</i>

17
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,545
Jack will die of hunger by then.
Come on, you know he's our baby.

18
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:49,507
That is cold.

19
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,733
I'm just saying.

20
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:52,958
Go catch your flight, all right?

21
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:55,295
Don't want to miss
your romantic getaway.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,671
If you can call
a biochemistry conference

23
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,935
in beautiful downtown
Blackpool romantic.

24
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:04,689
Well, you got to admit,
at least he's making an effort.

25
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,798
All right, you're right, my bad.

26
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,872
<i>Besides, I'm already at the lab.</i>

27
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:10,924
Okay, you know what?

28
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,800
Just go, have a good time,
and don't worry about Jack.

29
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,120
- I'll make sure he's...
- <i>Oh, my God, Jack?</i>

30
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,765
- Rachel, what's going on?
- <i>Wait, Jack, stay there.</i>

31
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:23,465
<i>It's okay, I can help you.
I can help you...</i>

32
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,590
Damnit.

33
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:30,715
- <i>Rachel, what's going on?</i>
- Help me.

Oh, God...

35
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,964
- It's on the run!
- Load tranqs!

36
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,514
You go after Jack.
I got her.

37
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,901
All right, here.

38
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,512
Come on.

39
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,537
Just hang on.

40
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,131
Thank God.
Rachel?

41
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:28,393
It's okay.

42
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,648
It's okay.

43
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,984
The blood!
The blood...

44
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,531
No, hang on.

45
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,741
Stay with me.

46
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,295
Stay with me!

47
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,624
- Hey, doc?
- <i>Calm down.</i>

48
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,122
- It's Rachel.
- <i>Is she...</i>

49
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,028
<i>She's alive, but she's unconscious,</i>

50
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,002
- and she's been cut.
- Are you gloved up?

51
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,589
- Where's the Big Guy?
- <i>He's on his way</i>

52
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,674
with a haz-mat transport.
I'll prep the O.R.

53
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,275
Do you think she's infected?

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,077
<i>I won't know
until I get her into surgery, Henry,</i>

55
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,225
- but if the creature did lay spores...
- <i>I know, doc.</i>

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,088
She's dead.

57
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>I'm two blocks out,
widening my perimeter.</i>

58
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,076
Kate, talk to me.

59
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:19,425
<i>I saw something heading down
behind the hill warehouse.</i>

60
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,951
- How's her pulse?
- It's rapid, but it's kind of weak.

61
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,578
Could you pack her wounds?

62
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,872
Yeah, sure.
What do I do?

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,980
Right, I'll talk you through it.
You need to find gauze and forceps.

64
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
<i>And, Henry...</i>

65
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,422
Whatever you do, do not let her blood
come in contact with your skin.

66
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,926
Right.

67
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:41,971
The Big Guy's here.

68
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,456
<i>Kate, are you getting close?</i>

69
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,133
Easy, there, gumby.

70
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,323
It's just little old me.

71
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:20,718
<i>Kate, give me an update!</i>

72
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,703
Four tranqs and a concussion stun
to take him down.

73
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,228
Butt-ugly to boot.

74
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:01,175
Yeah, Big Guy's got her now.

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,299
They're on their way to you.

76
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,429
Doc, she was so pale.

77
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,222
I'll do everything I can.

78
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,420
Oh, my God, Gerald!

79
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,496
She was supposed to meet him
at the airport.

80
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,853
I got to tell him...

81
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,271
We'll call him.

82
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:17,232
I need you to stay there.
Scan and clean the room.

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,062
So lizard boy here
releases toxic spores.

84
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,001
Yeah, Henry's been working
with Rachel's team for about five years.

85
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,627
Never heard of Jack
releasing his spores even once.

86
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:48,180
He's supposed to be tame.

87
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,101
Bad call.

88
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,943
We do a C-spine, chest and abdomen.

89
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,295
Ready.

90
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,454
Give her one gram ceph.

91
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,570
Increasing oxygen to 40%.

92
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,903
Heart rate 98 and regular.

93
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:10,327
Pupils are equal
and reactive to light.

94
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,037
Abdomen soft.

95
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:14,931
Localizes to pain.

96
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,417
Kidneys?

97
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,821
- Clear.
- Good.

98
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,672
CBC, chem panel and gasses
are all within normal range.

99
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,303
Now, to the wound.

100
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:28,470
Good.

101
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,805
This one looks clean.

102
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,682
Let's hope they all are.

103
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,771
- She's infected.
- Damnit, the spores are active.

104
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:40,816
We need to get her into quarantine
before I can operate.

105
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:44,278
Hopefully I can get them out
before they multiply.

106
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,738
I have to try.

107
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,605
All right, I'm finished
with the holographic scan,

108
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,003
and I'm moving to the eradicator.

109
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:09,878
All right, buddy,
time to go to work.

110
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,186
Dude, you left the door open.

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,781
I'm a little busy right now.
Just finishing the DNA flame-out.

112
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,097
You hear that?

113
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:38,511
All right, french fries are done.

114
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,964
Just bagging the goods now.

115
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,875
<i>Okay, head for the back alley.
We'll pick you up on the fly-by.</i>

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,300
- Just need a little more time.
- The cops are coming in the front door.

117
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,428
- I'm almost there.
- Get out!

118
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,765
Never enough time.

119
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,183
Get out now!

120
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:12,409
- Was Will able to get a hold of Gerald?
- On his way.

121
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:14,435
Upset.

122
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,047
Of course he is.

123
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,695
There are too many.
Dividing too quickly.

124
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,685
Just stay sharp.
You have your medicine bag?

125
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,939
Let's hope we don't need it.

126
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,256
Trying to domesticate
one of these things,

127
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:53,382
that's like putting C4
through the Play-Doh fun factory.

128
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:56,522
I don't know, it's cutting-edge stuff.
Gerald focuses on its biochemistry

129
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,320
while Rachel studies its behavior.

130
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,882
They make a good team.

131
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,698
What I've seen of Jack's behavior,

132
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,790
he could still use
some obedience training.

133
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,261
The last time I saw him with Rachel,
he was pretty docile.

134
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,714
She was even teaching him
sign language.

135
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,202
I'm no scientist, but you teach
a deadly abnormal how to talk,

136
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,719
and all you'll get
is a deadly talking abnormal.

137
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,663
- This the thing that scanned the room?
- Don't do that.

138
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:55,497
Need a hand?

139
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:57,772
No, I'm good.

140
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,069
I got a system.

141
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,773
I get it.

142
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:04,710
You can't go to the crime scene,
so you bring the crime scene to you?

143
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,396
Yeah, best we can.

144
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,509
Do the cops have
one of these gizmos?

145
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:10,859
They wish they did.

146
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,725
So how'd you come up with it?

147
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,614
Will and me.

148
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,729
His specs, my program, my design.

149
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,162
Still a work in progress,
but it's the best we've got right now.

150
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:24,623
She a friend?

151
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,031
I mean, Magnus is on the job, so...

152
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,842
Rachel and I worked together
for about four years.

153
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,848
She's been helping me
to understand who I am,

154
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,973
what I am.

155
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,311
She wasn't afraid of it.

156
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,314
And the other guy is what,
her husband?

157
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,859
Yeah, he's like a brother to me.

158
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,228
Where's Rachel, Henry?

159
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:01,409
She's in the O.R.

160
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,412
- Is she...
- She's alive.

161
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,082
Take me to her, please.

162
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:17,634
- Blood pressure's falling.
- Give her a 500 bolus of saline.

163
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,356
Last one in this wound.

164
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,820
Oh, dear God.

165
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,651
The infestation's spreading.

166
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,119
We are too late.

167
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,232
We can't save her.

168
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,407
Dr. Magnus?

169
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:49,633
I'm so sorry.

170
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,468
I'm putting Rachel into stasis.

171
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,092
To die?

172
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,359
To slow down
the progression of the spores,

173
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,015
give me time to work on a treatment.

174
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,972
There is no treatment. You know that.
Once the host becomes infected,

175
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:10,754
the spores regenerate
until the host...

176
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,939
I'm not ready to go there, not yet.

177
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,275
I'm gonna fight for Rachel,
but I need your help.

178
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,686
What can I do?

179
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:20,030
I need your research
on Pleskidarsus spore regeneration.

180
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,032
I may be able to create a reagent.

181
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:25,301
But the chemical
that halts spore reproduction,

182
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,529
- it's far too...
- It's too caustic for human tissue,

183
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:28,654
I know.

184
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,042
I think I may be able to find a way
to lessen the toxic side effects.

185
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,254
- I need your research.
- You can use my set-up.

186
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,241
- Show me.
- Okay, come on.

187
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,055
Henry's detailed scan
of everything in the lab

188
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,567
corresponds to bar codes
on the cardboard.

189
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,499
Now that we've recreated the scene,
we can figure out what happened.

190
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:01,738
That's amazing...

191
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:06,117
In, like, a total geeky kind of way.

192
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,978
Jealous much?

193
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,365
All right, so you be Rachel, okay?

194
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,296
So you enter here.

195
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,172
Henry hears you say...

196
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,296
- Oh, my God?
- Correct.

197
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:22,701
So I must see that you, Jack,
are out of your enclosure.

198
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:27,069
Right. So I must have smashed,
forced my way out before you entered.

199
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,813
I drop my cell phone.
Do you rush at me?

200
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,318
No, because the major blood spatters
are here.

201
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,938
Right, and the wounds are
on the front of her body, not the back.

202
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,606
So for some reason, you approach me?

203
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,223
No, the trajectory
of the spatters...

204
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:43,955
It doesn't match the wound pattern
on Rachel's body.

205
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,051
Stand over me,
as if you're reaching for me.

206
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,726
- Like this?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,498
- What do you think?
- You know, it fits.

208
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,460
Okay, so he's down here.
She's reaching for him.

209
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,683
The woman's either crazy or stupid.

210
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,758
I mean, monster is loose,
you move away from it.

211
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:06,375
Unless she couldn't believe
that he would hurt her.

212
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,655
But she ends up over here.

213
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,183
Why?

214
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:15,805
It attacks, she trips,
slams into the drug cabinet.

215
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,399
- And lands right here.
- And then it finishes the attack

216
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,675
and splits out the window.
Seems straightforward...

217
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:24,379
Ish.

218
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,531
I don't know.

219
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,155
Nothing about this
seems straightforward to me.

220
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,575
She was so good to you.

221
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,550
I don't care if you're hungry.

222
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,512
Don't you realize what you did?

223
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,595
You hurt Rachel, Jack.

224
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:53,725
Yes, Rachel.

225
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,765
You hurt her.

226
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,205
Very bad.

227
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:58,647
Bad Jack.

228
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,355
Very bad.
Bad Jack!

229
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,385
You got that right.

230
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,960
Once I receive Gerald's data,
I'll start working on the reagent.

231
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,560
In any case, we'll have
to extract spores from Jack.

232
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,405
How much time?

233
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,003
Even in stasis, the tissue

234
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,115
already damaged by the spores
will necrose.

235
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,170
Her system won't be able
to handle it for too much longer.

236
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:28,295
Too young.

237
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:29,945
By far.

238
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:35,125
I'll collect the spores from Jack.

239
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:07,285
Just give me
a couple of minutes here.

240
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,226
I'm downloading my files

241
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,944
from my home network.

242
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,485
You need anything?

243
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,245
Right. I'll just...

244
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:21,665
I'm not blaming you.

245
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,555
Yeah, I am.

246
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,055
- I should have been there.
- Henry...

247
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:28,645
Not now.

248
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,305
Okay?

249
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,775
- I just, I can't.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

250
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,515
She's everything to me.

251
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:42,985
She's my life.

252
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,030
Tell Magnus...

253
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,525
all the data she needs will be
on her private LAN in 10 minutes.

254
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,495
Should give her a shot at...

255
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,865
God knows what.

256
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:01,955
Just go.

257
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,025
Stop!

258
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:02,585
That's enough!

259
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,769
- Damned animal!
- What the hell, Ger?

260
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,680
It killed her, Henry, it killed her!

261
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:08,855
She has a chance.

262
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,360
Nobody survives a Pleski attack.
You know that and so do I.

263
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,835
She has a chance.

264
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:16,825
She's dead.

265
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,665
Man...

266
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:30,830
I'm guessing he took the weapon
while he was working in Henry's lab.

267
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,950
- And the Pleski?
- It took a couple of bullets,

268
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:36,050
but its skin is so tough, I don't think
there should be any permanent damage.

269
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,450
The Big Guy's with him now.

270
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,177
- What about Gerald?
- He's a mess.

271
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,825
Henry's with him.

272
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,099
- I should never have left him alone.
- Well, the guy works for you.

273
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,519
There was no reason to think
he was going to go that far.

274
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,395
Still, it should never
have happened.

275
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,270
Assassination attempts aside,
how goes it?

276
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,595
Ironically, Gerald's research
is proving to be quite helpful.

277
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,225
Take a look at this.

278
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,782
- Is this going to put me off my lunch?
- Now, watch.

279
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:13,725
That works.

280
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,750
We just have to administer the right
amount, enough to kill the spores

281
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,466
- without harming Rachel.
- Right,

282
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,386
- like chemo.
- But far more tricky to regulate.

283
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,388
You figured out
what happened in the attack?

284
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:27,765
Kate's got something she wants me to see
so I'm heading to the mock-up lab now.

285
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:30,895
I know that look.

286
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:33,860
Rachel taught Jack
a form of sign language,

287
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:36,320
and I'm thinking of trying
to communicate with him, now.

288
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,610
I know it's not a conventional way
of gathering evidence,

289
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,370
and I know what you're going to say,

290
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:43,140
"If you could teach a lion to speak,
you still wouldn't understand him."

291
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,030
- Your dad's favorite expression.
- Because

292
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:46,760
we often make the egocentric mistake

293
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,080
of believing that abnormals
think the same way we do.

294
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:52,090
That their worldview
and logic patterns are similar.

295
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:55,410
In most cases, even with the most
intelligent species, they simply aren't.

296
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,922
I know. Their whole
cognitive process is different.

297
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm just saying, bear that in mind
when you have your...

298
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,205
chat.

299
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,055
How could you just sit there?

300
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,522
If that was your wife

301
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,375
on that table... If the only person
who really mattered to you was...

302
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,025
I don't know
where to put all this, Henry.

303
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:29,685
It lives and she dies?

304
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,525
You tell me what you'd do.

305
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:35,835
Honestly,
I don't know what I'd do...

306
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,545
You'd kill the damn thing!

307
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,506
You'd go all werewolf,
and you would take care of business!

308
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,803
Wanting something and doing something
about it are two different things.

309
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:44,928
Really?

310
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,765
You've never done anything crazy
in the moment?

311
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:50,125
Something maybe
you shouldn't have done?

312
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:52,815
This isn't about me.

313
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:54,896
- Magnus says...
- I want to go down there

314
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,415
in case she...

315
00:21:57,715 --> 00:21:59,692
I won't make any more trouble.

316
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,755
I can't leave you on your own, man.

317
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:06,880
Well, then you find someone else

318
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:08,355
to watch over me.

319
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:11,663
Just not you.

320
00:22:18,665 --> 00:22:20,405
Tell me what you see from here.

321
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:24,380
Rachel enters,
she sees the Pleski is loose.

322
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,761
Now, there's a tranq gun
right in front of her.

323
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,770
- Right, she had a defense.
- But she doesn't use it. Why?

324
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:32,058
I'm thinking...
Because of this.

325
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,065
Item 163, what's that?

326
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:41,567
- A syringe.
- Containing what?

327
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:44,821
I don't know, but my guess is
she was going for it when Jack attacked.

328
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,380
Okay, good, so she was trying
to inject him with something.

329
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:50,159
And not a sedative, 'cause that's
in the tranq gun, which she passes on.

330
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,210
Okay, bing, bang, boom.

331
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,320
Rachel enters, sees Jack is loose,

332
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,170
ignores the tranq gun and heads
straight for the drug cabinet.

333
00:22:57,295 --> 00:23:00,670
She drops the syringe before she can
use it, and now the big question is...

334
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,345
What was in the syringe?

335
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,355
What?

336
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,802
I'm not totally buying

337
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,929
the whole ready-to-go
syringe theory.

338
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,555
Item 73, what's that?

339
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,269
Medicine of some kind.
I don't know, I can't read the label.

340
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,070
Whatever was in that vial...

341
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,425
Was what she was trying
to inject Jack with.

342
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,609
Right...

343
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,900
I will talk to Henry. See if he can
generate a more detailed view

344
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:28,520
- of the 3-d scan.
- All right,

345
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,116
I'm going to go check on Gerald.

346
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,934
- Hey, Will...
- Yeah?

347
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:34,328
This is what you did
before you came here, right?

348
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:37,415
Like fancy detective work,
CSI stuff?

349
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:41,753
In reality, forensics is under-staffed,
under-funded, backlogged to the nines.

350
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:46,090
- Score one for the criminals, then.
- Put it this way,

351
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:49,595
if I had this tech to work with,
you'd have been behind bars years ago.

352
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,308
No, I wouldn't.

353
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,570
<i>A new sign is deemed acquired
only when reported</i>

354
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,313
<i>by three independent observers,
namely myself, Gerald, and...</i>

355
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:01,925
<i>Me. Hi.</i>

356
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,233
- <i>I'm trying to be serious.</i>
- <i>You should be serious.</i>

357
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,990
- <i>Yes, it is, don't laugh.</i>
- <i>I'm not!</i>

358
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:07,653
<i>Don't smile.
Now, you focus. Ready?</i>

359
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:09,065
<i>Go.</i>

360
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,295
<i>This woman is clearly insane.
Do not believe a word that she says.</i>

361
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,075
<i>Okay, anytime.</i>

362
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:19,675
<i>You remembered.</i>

363
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,790
<i>Watch out, watch out...</i>

364
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,712
<i>That is not going
to feed three people.</i>

365
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
- <i>Then you can eat the melty bits.</i>
- <i>You're the best.</i>

366
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,425
<i>Happy anniversary, baby.</i>

367
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,784
<i>Awkward, and that's on film.
I'm going to be sick.</i>

368
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:34,680
<i>Make a wish, make a wish...</i>

369
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,625
<i>Done.</i>

370
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,300
<i>The energy...</i>

371
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,935
<i>The energy.
The gods have blessed this union.</i>

372
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,425
She's beautiful.

373
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,401
What do you want?

374
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,560
Need to id something on the floor.

375
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:55,284
Sector 34.
Item 73.

376
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,371
- The label's hidden.
- I know.

377
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:02,235
Looks like Rachel was trying
to inject the Pleski with something,

378
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,800
though why she didn't just
tranq the sucker, I have no idea...

379
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:06,013
You don't know her.

380
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,088
Don't even try.

381
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,680
Just trying to solve a case,
that's all.

382
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:13,302
It's fine. I'll enhance the area,
and I'll focus on the sector.

383
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,670
Just give me an hour.

384
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:19,684
I know she means a lot to you...

385
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,902
Give me an hour.

386
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:26,605
Right.

387
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,183
I'm Will.

388
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,895
I'm sorry, never mind.

389
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,530
Are you hungry?

390
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:17,995
You're hungry.

391
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,185
But you have food.
It's there.

392
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:26,695
"Bad Jack"?

393
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,753
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

394
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:31,145
I don't understand.

395
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,105
Anything?

396
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:51,965
Still working on it.

397
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:54,325
How was your chat with Jack?

398
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,948
Turns out
he doesn't have much to say,

399
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,700
except I think he feels bad
about what happened,

400
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:01,325
which isn't very monster-like.

401
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,122
I looked through the vial to the label
on the other side. It didn't work.

402
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:08,584
Looking at that piece of glass there,
it kind of acts like a mirror.

403
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,195
If you focus on that sector,

404
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:15,585
kick up the rez, flip it around...

405
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:16,759
Betamethasone.

406
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,525
- Betamethasone?
- What is that, some kind of sedative?

407
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,474
- It's just a common immunosuppressant.
- Are you kidding me?

408
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,855
- She went for that over a tranq gun?
- There's got to be a good reason.

409
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,445
I'm betting there is.

410
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:53,245
I've given her
30 milligrams of the reagent.

411
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:55,495
We'll see how she responds
to the treatment.

412
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,535
We found something

413
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,225
in Rachel's lab.

414
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,640
I think she was trying to inject Jack
with betamethasone.

415
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:07,415
What?
Are you certain?

416
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,645
She was going for it
instead of the tranquilizers.

417
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,272
- Does it make sense?
- It might,

418
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:15,860
but it would suggest that Rachel knew
that Jack's ACTH levels were too high.

419
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:17,635
How so?

420
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:21,090
In Siberia,
the Pleski's native habitat,

421
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,409
there's a rare fungus,
Cordyceps Siberienses.

422
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,911
When the Pleski's exposed
to even small amounts,

423
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,080
it increases their ACTH levels.

424
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:31,084
- Which over-stimulates the adrenals.
- Exactly.

425
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,613
Now, Rachel's research was based
on the premise that the Cordyceps fungus

426
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:37,298
was the sole reason
that the Pleskidara are deadly,

427
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:40,634
and that without its influence,
they're a gentle, intelligent species.

428
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,660
It was a controversial theory,
even in the abnormal research community.

429
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:48,184
Okay, so, wait. So if Jack was somehow
exposed to the fungus, then...

430
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,120
It would explain how he escaped.

431
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,646
And why it took so many tranquilizers
to bring him down.

432
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,075
Why would he be exposed
in the first place?

433
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,527
Could have been a shipping container
that was somehow contaminated?

434
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:02,823
Knowing them, it doesn't make any sense.
They'd be so careful to screen for that.

435
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:05,951
Well, I'll do a blood test,
check the ACTH levels.

436
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:07,925
I'll talk with Gerald.

437
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:09,985
Are you crazy?

438
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:14,485
Of course we don't keep Cordyceps
in our lab, or anything similar.

439
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:17,720
There's a possibility that Rachel
suspected that Jack had been exposed.

440
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:20,740
Can I cut into your Matlock speech
here for a second?

441
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:22,243
And pardon me, okay,

442
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:25,702
but the Pleski attacked Rachel
because of its nature,

443
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,557
not because it was on drugs!

444
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,895
She wanted to believe it was tame,

445
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,812
but you can't take

446
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,314
an instinctive predator

447
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:37,815
and teach it to love people.

448
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:41,800
You and Rachel must have had some very
interesting discussions about this.

449
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:42,980
What do you mean?

450
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:47,109
Her work was spent trying to prove
that the Pleskidara could be socialized,

451
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,620
and yet you, quite obviously,
believe the opposite.

452
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,545
I support her in her work.

453
00:29:53,735 --> 00:29:54,735
I just...

454
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,462
don't let her know that I think
it's completely useless.

455
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,650
And yet you allowed her to continue
working with a dangerous species?

456
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,117
Come on, you know Rachel.

457
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:05,710
She's made up her mind
about something, that's, you know...

458
00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:07,835
She's a very able researcher.

459
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,815
Yeah, I admire her passion, I do.

460
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,231
But she spent more time
with the creature than she did with you.

461
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,895
Yeah, she did.

462
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,225
I thought this...

463
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,665
getaway would...

464
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:34,979
would help change things.

465
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,251
Maybe if we spent
a little more time together, I...

466
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,305
But now...

467
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:46,375
What if she dies?

468
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,435
What happens? Another...

469
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,384
able researcher gets hired,

470
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:58,230
and we continue on playing with "Jack"?
Is that what happens?

471
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:01,185
We're testing his blood
for ACTH levels.

472
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,415
If the results are negative...

473
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:08,073
I'll lock him away for good.

474
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,025
Of course you will.

475
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:14,475
Excuse me.

476
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,300
She's been stable
for more than an hour.

477
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,425
Good news?

478
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,595
Possibly.

479
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:27,551
She's out of quarantine?

480
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,464
I don't want to create false hope,

481
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:35,861
but the rate of spore division
has diminished significantly.

482
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:36,936
You're certain?

483
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:39,104
They're beginning to die.

484
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:42,066
We believe
she's no longer contagious.

485
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,658
She's flat-lined.

486
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,743
There are toxins in her bloodstream.

487
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,468
The treatment's killing her.

488
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,250
Second epi in.

489
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,751
- Charging to 300.
- Epi in.

490
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,130
No, let them work.

491
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,588
Come on, fight!

492
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,125
- Charged.
- Clear.

493
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,185
- Time.
- Four minutes.

494
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,429
I've given her epinephrine,
atropine, shocked her...

495
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,697
Seven times.

496
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:22,189
We need an alternative.

497
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,557
Too risky.

498
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,442
She's dead either way.

499
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,105
What are they giving her?

500
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:57,555
Hold on.

501
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:07,735
Normal sinus.

502
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:09,965
Lucky.

503
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,340
Thank God.

504
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:15,326
I need blood, cardiac
and liver panels.

505
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:21,685
The reagent's taking its toll
on her system.

506
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:23,805
We'll keep her monitored,

507
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:26,319
but I can't guarantee
that the treatment won't kill her

508
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,968
before it runs its course.

509
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:30,007
I'd like to be with her.

510
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:32,895
Alone.

511
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:55,465
How's Rachel?

512
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,117
Alive, for now.

513
00:33:57,355 --> 00:33:58,855
You should see this.

514
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,410
Jack's blood results.

515
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:03,780
The ACTH levels
are higher than normal,

516
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:05,702
dropping from a previous spike.

517
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:09,905
I'm checking his food remains
for traces of this Siberian fungus.

518
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,090
Why his food?

519
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,437
Rachel would be the most careful
about that, I should think.

520
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:17,346
The Pleski told him.

521
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,990
He kept making the sign for "eat".

522
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:25,115
Look, I tried to think outside
of my egocentric way of communicating,

523
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:29,608
but I'm wondering if Jack maybe somehow
knew that his food was being poisoned.

524
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:31,555
Or it's just hungry.

525
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,387
He hasn't eaten anything
since he got here.

526
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,855
Let me know what you find.

527
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:45,045
It doesn't look good.

528
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:54,995
It's stupid.

529
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,165
I was gonna surprise you.

530
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,440
The trip wasn't to Blackpool
for a convention.

531
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:04,565
It was...

532
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:06,545
to Paris.

533
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:11,245
A real honeymoon.

534
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:13,355
Finally.

535
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:19,408
This shouldn't have happened.
It shouldn't have been...

536
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:30,127
Can I have a private moment
with my wife, Henry?

537
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,345
I know, Ger. I'm sorry.

538
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:35,435
This is my fault.

539
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:38,035
I can't spend two minutes with her

540
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,645
without you showing up.

541
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,315
I can't...

542
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,115
take her to a movie

543
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:48,655
because you two
have already seen it.

544
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,733
First it's coffee with Henry,
and then it's a dinner here and there.

545
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:55,861
Pretty soon it's all about
whether or not you're available.

546
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:01,408
You know that she actually blushes
when you walk into a room,

547
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:03,205
and you know it,

548
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,275
and you insult me

549
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:06,878
every time,

550
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:08,850
pretending that it wasn't happening.

551
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,875
She's with you, Ger, not me.

552
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:13,879
- I never did anything.
- You don't have to, Henry, you are...

553
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,697
You're everything
that she wants me to be.

554
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,775
But I took care of things.

555
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,017
Something had to be done.

556
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:46,235
Mystery of the amped-up lizard
solved.

557
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,045
Damn.

558
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:54,127
Last three feedings were rife
with delicious Siberian fungus.

559
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:55,705
You did this.

560
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,415
You made this happen?

561
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,135
This is Rachel!

562
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:04,645
You're such an idiot, Henry.

563
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,590
Only two people had access
to his food supply.

564
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:10,865
So unless blondie was going
for suicide by Pleski...

565
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,980
Where's Gerald right now?

566
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,675
I wasn't trying to kill Rachel.

567
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:19,961
I was trying to kill you.

568
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,065
Man, don't.

569
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,515
Come on, Henry.

570
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,035
Let's see your real face, huh?

571
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,923
It's all right, buddy. Let it come.

572
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,010
Don't...

573
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:47,730
Come on, Henry, turn!

574
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:50,726
One of us is checking out, Henry,
and if you stay human, it'll be you!

575
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,094
Don't do this.

576
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,062
Come on!

577
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,273
That is enough!

578
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,441
Drop it.

579
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:02,705
Look at her.

580
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:07,005
I don't wanna live when she's gone.

581
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:12,164
But you'd take care of that,
wouldn't you?

582
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,876
If I mess you up ,
you'd take care of business.

583
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,502
You'd take care of me.

584
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,980
Stop...

585
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,827
Then you'd have to live with it!

586
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:23,165
Think logically.

587
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:25,565
You do not wanna take this action.

588
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,016
Come on, freak!

589
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:36,585
She's crashing again!

590
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,205
Is she...

591
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:54,985
She's stabilizing.

592
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,115
Are you okay?

593
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:17,385
How does someone recover
from something like this?

594
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:20,714
By not blaming yourself
for what happened.

595
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:24,940
Our marriage wasn't working.

596
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:26,735
I should have said something.

597
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,320
I should have stopped myself.

598
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:30,075
From what, feeling things?

599
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,829
I'm sure you tried
at some point or another,

600
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,384
but that doesn't work.

601
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:37,975
I can come back.

602
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:42,255
We'll talk later.

603
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,186
You look terrible.
Where's your make-up bag?

604
00:39:58,565 --> 00:39:59,565
Stop it.

605
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:04,355
You see, that's the problem.

606
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,935
I can't.

607
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:09,970
You and I got too close, Rachel,

608
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:11,491
and I went there willingly.

609
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:14,235
Because I gave you permission.

610
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,115
I don't know why I...

611
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:24,885
I think I was afraid to admit
that I'd made a mistake with Gerald.

612
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:27,841
I chose the wrong person.

613
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:30,860
No, you're not in love
with me, Rachel.

614
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:34,264
I'm just the third wheel to keep you
upright while you figured things out,

615
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,425
and I bought in too much.

616
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:39,565
You really don't think
that's all you were to me?

617
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:48,675
I am in love with you.

618
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:56,245
Then why did you marry him?

619
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:00,332
Because he was the one who asked.

620
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,875
Because you were always too scared
to open up to me.

621
00:41:06,335 --> 00:41:08,220
Is it because of what you are?

622
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:10,342
Did you think
I wouldn't accept that?

623
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,925
Oh, my God...

624
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:22,979
You don't love me.

625
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,695
We...

626
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,155
can't...

627
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,655
be together.

628
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:37,675
Because Gerald's my friend, and...

629
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:41,835
I'm so sorry.

630
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,440
I know what you're gonna say.

631
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:14,580
And you're totally right,
it's all on me.

632
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:15,705
Not all,

633
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:17,595
but enough.

634
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:26,060
I know you thought you were helping her
and her relationship with Gerald, but...

635
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:27,460
I was just making it worse.

636
00:42:29,435 --> 00:42:31,450
I just wanted to be there for her.

637
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,820
You know, be someone
she could count on.

638
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,045
Be a friend.

639
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:38,525
But things changed.

640
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:46,188
That's usually when it's best
to come clean.

641
00:42:48,295 --> 00:42:52,299
You can't let who you are keep you
from getting close to people, Henry.

642
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:03,755
Thank you for saving her.
