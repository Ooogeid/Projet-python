00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,825
What the hell?

00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:25,311

7
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,605
The abnormals.

8
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,726
What the hell is going on?

9
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:53,812
- More fun and games?
- Don't move.

10
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,885
I said, "Don't move!"

11
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,333
What the hell is going on?

12
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,625
What the hell happened to you?

13
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,004
Who are you?

14
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,049
- Will, it's me.
- Your name!

15
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,355
Satisfied?

16
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,933
I don't think so.

17
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,019
Helen Magnus died three years ago.

18
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,412
Answer my question.

19
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,841
- Who are you?
- I told you! I'm Helen Mag...

20
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:48,797
Let go of me! Let go of me!

21
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,423
Say it again. Say it again.

22
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:56,250
You expect to show up after 3 years dead
and think we're just gonna make nice?

23
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,375
No way.

24
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,682
You want me to believe this,
make it good!

25
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,119
You see, if you'd done
your homework, you'd know.

26
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,456
The real Helen Magnus died
in the battle for Buenos Aires.

27
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,376
And you'd have a good spin
on how she survived.

28
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,644
Right now...

29
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,630
- You got neither.
- I don't remember any battle.

30
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,305
How does this work?

31
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,218
Are you a chameleon?
A shape-shifter?

32
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,345
How did you get this far
by yourself?

33
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,138
- I am not an impostor!
- How?

34
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,215
I woke up in the Sanctuary!

35
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,686
We don't call it that anymore.

36
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,522
I found myself here.

37
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,940
You a telepath?

38
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,355
Is that it?

39
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:53,902
That's how you know my name.

40
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,129
- This is insane.
- Prepare one hit, medium voltage.

41
00:10:57,254 --> 00:10:58,824
This mind-reading crap won't fly.

42
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,576
Helen Magnus is dead!

43
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,709
Incoming!

44
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,321
- We have a breach.
- Go! Secure the perimeter!

45
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,314
- Did you summon them?
- What? No!

46
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,439
Did you?

47
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,773
You better pray this goes well.

48
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:33,984
Grenade!

49
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,836
One hit on my mark.
Cover me.

50
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:18,612
Damn it, Jason!
You're trying to be a hero again?

51
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,155
He's got time, Will!

52
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:28,997
Come on, we can use him!

53
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:33,405
Sorry, Jason.

54
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,758
Pack up the supplies.

55
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:42,844
We're heading out.

56
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:54,598
She's armed.

57
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:42,915
Please don't kill me!

58
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:57,682
I'm Helen.

59
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,998
Proper etiquette would be
to offer your name in return.

60
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,752
I've rigged up
some perimeter alarms.

61
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,024
Quite rudimentary,
but they should give us ample warning

62
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,543
if we have any visitors.

63
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,989
I'll see what else I can find.

64
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,118
Jessica.

65
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:34,317
Mitchell.

66
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,792
What were you doing down there
by yourself...

67
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:44,257
Jessica Mitchell?

68
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,051
What were you doing down there?

69
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,061
Shelter, mainly.

70
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,893
I suppose I was looking for something
to help me understand all of this.

71
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,172
There's nothing out there but them.

72
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,523
Your parents, are they...

73
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Sorry.

74
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,782
How long have you been on your own?

75
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,830
I don't know.

76
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:19,419
It's easier to keep moving
when you're by yourself.

77
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,048
Try and get some rest.

78
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,462
I'll be close by.

79
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,107
They'll find us, you know.

80
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,333
They always do.

81
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,234
We shouldn't stay here.

82
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,596
Where else should we go?

83
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,969
<i>The outbreak is spreading
at an alarming rate.</i>

84
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:30,044
<i>We cannot contain the impact.</i>

85
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,707
<i>The city is now evacuated.</i>

86
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,009
<i>Our last stand
is to hold on to the Sanctuary.</i>

87
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,235
<i>Hearing this,</i>

88
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,005
<i>we will abandon the last Sanctuary.</i>

89
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,009
<i>All efforts to find a cure
for this plague have failed.</i>

90
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,045
<i>Our only hope is to find safe ground
to protect what few of us remain.</i>

91
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,477
<i>I'm sorry for everything.</i>

92
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:08,603
Dear God.

93
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:40,809
Don't move!

94
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:46,345
Relax.

95
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,113
- I'm not here to start anything.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,238
Bleeding.

97
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,663
What happened?

98
00:17:58,609 --> 00:17:59,944
What do you think?

99
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,369
More palefaces,

100
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:06,126
but this time I'm the only one
who made it out.

101
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:10,839
How did you get in here?
I checked every access point.

102
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,883
I broke in
through the old river gate,

103
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,594
but don't worry,
I locked it behind me.

104
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,338
It's just shrapnel.
You can patch it up later.

105
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,022
Why should I,

106
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,247
after the reception you gave me?

107
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:39,081
Come on.

108
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,286
Let's get you sorted.

109
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,380
- Scare you?
- Only when I saw your face.

110
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,581
Behave, both of you.

111
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,513
It may be a shambles,
but this is still my house.

112
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:07,353
What?

113
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:14,706
Three years ago...

114
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,739
The Air Force dropped a daisy cutter

115
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,787
on an Argentine neighborhood
that you were trying to evacuate.

116
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:31,439
15,000 people were vaporized,

117
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,090
including you, at Ground Zero,

118
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,985
and suddenly, here you are,

119
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:41,327
alive and well.

120
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,694
You were gone, Magnus.

121
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:51,940
- Without a trace.
- I can't explain it.

122
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,528
- Try.
- I don't know.

123
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,704
I woke up here
with no memory of anything,

124
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,862
I mean, you, those creatures.

125
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,489
Buenos Aires?

126
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,082
Well, you look good.

127
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:11,334
You must have been holed up
somewhere real sweet.

128
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,601
You look like you've had...

129
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:15,896
food,

130
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:17,834
shelter,

131
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:19,712
sunlight.

132
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,167
Was there a colony

133
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,974
- that I didn't know about?
- The last thing I recall...

134
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:28,351
Was what?

135
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:29,715
A mission.

136
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,765
Central America.

137
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,941
Why can't I remember
anything since then?

138
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,651
It's like this is all a dream.

139
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,296
Everything is gone.

140
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,193
Everything we built,

141
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:49,497
gone.

142
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,376
Everyone we ever cared about
is dead!

143
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,527
Does this look like a dream?

144
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,801
What happened to you, Will?

145
00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:13,145
It was more than just a plague.
It was a new kind of species.

146
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:14,652
Cannibalistic,

147
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:15,968
mindless,

148
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,409
soulless.

149
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,054
At first we tried
containment, treatment.

150
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,144
We wanted to understand.

151
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,013
But it wasn't natural evolution.

152
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:27,452
Rampant infection rates.

153
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,745
Quick mutation.

154
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,788
Within a year, millions had turned.

155
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,512
It affected both humans
and abnormals.

156
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,467
Too many to fight.

157
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,190
Too powerful.
They fed on anything alive,

158
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,388
and if they drew blood,
if you survived the attack...

159
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,058
- You changed.
- Five, six hours,

160
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:51,832
a day max,

161
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:55,271
and you were one of them, infected.

162
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,856
We never found the origin?

163
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,108
But there had to have been
a patient pero.

164
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,456
The infection spread
too quickly to find the source.

165
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,360
We did everything we could
to slow it.

166
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,941
Nothing worked.

167
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:12,288
After a while, you were euthanizing
more than you treated.

168
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,119
Governments evacuated cities.

169
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,919
We abandoned the Sanctuaries.

170
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,577
That global panic thing,

171
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,227
it's a bitch, let me tell you.

172
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,471
Then they started deploying
tactical nukes.

173
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:33,869
How many are left?

174
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:35,951
Uninfected?

175
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,458
100,000 worldwide, maybe.

176
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:45,276
I set up a colony in the Arctic.

177
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,574
There's a few thousand
living on remote islands.

178
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,119
We've been fighting these creatures.

179
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,960
We're part of a larger militia,

180
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,750
but we've been
whittled down one by one

181
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,212
just trying to save
the last of the last.

182
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,383
It's over.

183
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,314
It has been for a long time.

184
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,680
Why can't I remember any of this?

185
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:17,932
You must've got out somehow,

186
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,367
been in a colony

187
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,591
suffering from amnesia,

188
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:25,413
- battle shock.
- No. No, that's not it.

189
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,503
There is a reason
I came back here now.

190
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,511
I don't feel so...

191
00:23:35,642 --> 00:23:37,123
- Quick, Will.
- Don't touch her!

192
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,710
- She's infected. You didn't check her?
- I didn't know!

193
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,884
- She's dead already.
- You said we have five hours,

194
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,759
maybe more.
Please, help me understand this.

195
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,760
- Magnus, if she turns, they'll come.
- Then I suggest you leave,

196
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:53,848
because I will not let you
shoot this girl.

197
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:50,446
<i>Unfortunately,
the elixir from the vial</i>

198
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,075
<i>seems to have had no effect on me except
a spike in my immunoglobulin levels.</i>

199
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,400
<i>Repeated attempts to bring them
back down into normal range have failed.</i>

200
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,247
This is all a very bad idea.

201
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:02,458
Which means you really must be you.

202
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:06,921
Why did you come here?

203
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:09,841
So you could retrace ground
you've already covered?

204
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:14,591
I don't have the right equipment
to run the proper blood tests,

205
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,471
but I should be able
to cross-reference Jessica's symptoms

206
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,377
with entries
from my previous research,

207
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:20,935
look for some sort of deviation.

208
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,503
Deviations?

209
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,882
They've become
the dominant species on the planet.

210
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,389
They're like locusts,

211
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:30,611
that turn other life forms
into more locusts.

212
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,531
But the contagion started somewhere.
Someone must have been the first.

213
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,950
Let's do the time warp again.

214
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:40,224
Typhus, smallpox, cholera,
yellow fever, scarlet fever, malaria.

215
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,832
They bear no relation to this disease.
Have you caught up yet?

216
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,477
There has to be evidence
of this disease somewhere in the past.

217
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:48,504
- It cannot have come out of nowhere.
- We've done this dance.

218
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,227
You've tried cures,
treatments, for years.

219
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,092
Nothing works.
The contagion mutates.

220
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
It wins.

221
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:56,804
Humans... are extinct.

222
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:57,976
We're not.

223
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,018
You and me, we're alive.
Isn't that a reason for hope?

224
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,022
Reason? There isn't a reason
for anything anymore.

225
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,356
We know how we're dying,
but why it's happening,

226
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:09,667
what we did to deserve this,
who the hell knows?

227
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,668
This doesn't make any sense.

228
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:14,670
- There has to be a way to stop it.
- You've already done this!

229
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,650
You tried

230
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,312
every single waking moment
until the very end.

231
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,707
You kept going.

232
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:22,205
You're still fighting.

233
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,933
Life without purpose isn't...

234
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:30,111
life.

235
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,846
I learned that from you.

236
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,706
I'm sorry I disappeared.

237
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:45,311
Company's here.

238
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,391
I'll go head them off
at the access tunnels.

239
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,793
You might want to go
protect the girl.

240
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:51,687
Couple of storerooms on the garage level
I missed when we evacuated,

241
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,005
though we were in kind of a rush.

242
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,180
I rigged this up
with one of our one-hits.

243
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,656
Should keep you in computerland
for a while.

244
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,821
I hate to break it to you,
but the internet's down.

245
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,490
Has been for about five years.

246
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,765
I'll survive.

247
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:07,670
More of them will be coming.

248
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:08,795
Defenses?

249
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,665
Nonexistent.

250
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:14,467
It's just me and you
against thousands of inhuman cannibals.

251
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,135
Well, then we should be fine.

252
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,342
There was a time
you would have laughed.

253
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,465
Yeah, I'm sure there was.

254
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,925
Central America.

255
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,920
Is that where the outbreak started?

256
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,223
Could that have been Ground Zero
for the contagion?

257
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:34,281
I think all evidence pointed
to the Pacific Northwest.

258
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,106
Why?

259
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,665
Honduras.
It figures into this somehow.

260
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:41,550
- Why?
- I don't know. I've to access my log,

261
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,989
but there's something there important
that I'm missing.

262
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,024
I'll be damned if I know what it is.

263
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,420
Magnus, what are you doing
with this girl?

264
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,081
I have a theory.

265
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,084
I found some anticoagulants and older
blood thinners in the storeroom.

266
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,628
The old dialysis-on-the-fly trick.
I've been there, done that.

267
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,879
I saw the notes,

268
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,590
but we've also never had
such an early jump on the infection.

269
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,130
All the other test subjects were either
long infected or completely turned.

270
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:08,139
Jessica's only been showing symptoms
for less than a couple of hours.

271
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,300
It's much earlier
in the transformation process.

272
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:12,685
Bring on the Hail Mary.

273
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:24,345
The others?

274
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,869
Henry...

275
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,825
made weapons for the government
until it finally fell.

276
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:40,618
He kept finding newer, better ways
to stop them, to kill them,

277
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,381
then his number came up.

278
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:45,115
I saw the photos.

279
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:46,915
The Big Guy...

280
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,420
refused to leave
after we pulled up stakes,

281
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,980
even though there was nothing here
left to protect.

282
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:55,670
I'm guessing he took more than a few
with him when he finally went.

283
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:56,795
And Kate?

284
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,625
She died.

285
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,265
In the fighting.

286
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:06,320
She was a good fighter,

287
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:07,645
a good leader.

288
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:12,275
Druitt...

289
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:20,539
He took a tactical nuke and teleported
into a high-density infection area.

290
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,547
He took most of Boston with him.

291
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:28,427
That was two weeks
after we thought you were dead.

292
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:37,010
She's been in v-tach
for more than an hour.

293
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,740
Pulse is off the charts.

294
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:41,450
There's a reason
we don't let it run its course.

295
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:42,900
It's not a pretty sight.

296
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,395
Just give it some time.

297
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,545
Heard that before.

298
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:02,795
I respect you trying
to save this girl,

299
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,960
it's even kind of nostalgic,

300
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,650
but come on, this is all just more stuff
for the archaeologists

301
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,525
to find in the future
after we're long gone.

302
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,975
Eastern Honduras, 10 years ago.

303
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,305
I remember.

304
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,630
What about it?

305
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:23,315
I went there

306
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:26,290
looking for the tomb
of Pacal the Second,

307
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:28,665
a Mayan king from the late dynasty.

308
00:32:31,795 --> 00:32:33,659
It wasn't long
after Ashley had died.

309
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:39,869
I was tired of outliving people I loved.
I wanted a cure for my longevity.

310
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:41,595
In a Mayan tomb?

311
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:45,015
I'd been researching
ancient myths and legends.

312
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:48,370
How certain cultures had claimed
to have found a way to shorten time,

313
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:49,550
to manipulate it.

314
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:52,050
The Mayan kings were abnormals

315
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:54,275
who aged very slowly, like I do.

316
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,836
There was evidence
that they'd developed an elixir

317
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:59,861
capable of giving them
a normal human lifespan.

318
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:01,995
The kings wanted a release
from their advanced age.

319
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,260
So you were looking for
a way to grow old.

320
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,066
What does that have to do with this?

321
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:10,946
It doesn't, except that the Mayan people
died out at an incredibly rapid pace.

322
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:13,795
The empire fell
within several decades.

323
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,036
Entire sections of their population
simply disappeared,

324
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,413
Gone without a trace.
No one knows why.

325
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,000
You think the contagion that's killed
the intelligent life on this planet

326
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,475
is the same one
that wiped out the Mayans?

327
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,005
That's impossible.
There'd be evidence...

328
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,851
The virus can mutate.
It is entirely possible.

329
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,395
Help me go further with this.

330
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:37,411
Tell me where things stood
before the end.

331
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,590
Was there anything I had tried that had
come close, anything remotely hopeful?

332
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:42,770
We certainly didn't talk about
the damn Mayans!

333
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,453
She was calling to them!

334
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:46,045
We need to seal off
any section we can't hold.

335
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,961
Fall back to a safe position
and wait for them to leave.

336
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,705
I'll help out as long as I can.

337
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,105
We can do this, Will.

338
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:57,745
I'm sure you've been through worse.

339
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,215
No, I haven't.

340
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:04,357
That last skirmish
didn't go so well for me.

341
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,735
We kill as many as possible,

342
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,780
and then when it's my turn,

343
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,775
you don't hesitate.

344
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,325
Not for one second.

345
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:51,205
That should buy us about 15 seconds.

346
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:57,446
You barricade yourself in here.
Don't let anyone in.

347
00:35:58,415 --> 00:35:59,615
Especially me.

348
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,595
- I just need some...
- Time?

349
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:06,775
Here.

350
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:09,215
Take this.

351
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:21,185
We had a son.

352
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,645
Kate and me.

353
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,195
He'd be about two now.

354
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:36,777
He's been living up in the Arctic colony
ever since she died.

355
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,700
We named him Magnus.

356
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:57,172
If you make it out of here,
you find him.

357
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:30,706
I need to go back further.

358
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,008
The Honduras mission.

359
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:44,970
<i>... from the Mayan tomb
of King Pacal.</i>

360
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:48,974
<i>I am hopeful about the one artifact
I found there that matched the legends.</i>

361
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,603
<i>Markings on this suggest
an unorthodox relationship to time,</i>

362
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:56,635
<i>the ability to manipulate it at will
via the protection of mystic guardians.</i>

363
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:11,229
<i>All of this makes me hopeful
that the contents of this vial</i>

364
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:14,124
<i>are what allowed King Pacal to die
within a normal lifespan.</i>

365
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,784
<i>A full chemical breakdown
and diagnostic of the fluid inside</i>

366
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:19,254
<i>should reveal its properties.</i>

367
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:44,947
<i>Seven years and nine months
since the outbreak began.</i>

368
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:48,992
<i>My unique physiology seems
to have prevented any outward symptoms.</i>

369
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:50,994
<i>The contagion mutates at such speed</i>

370
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,395
<i>I'm not sure
I can analyze it fast enough.</i>

371
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,114
<i>There's still no way to control
the immunoglobulin spikes</i>

372
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,289
<i>in the blood of those infected.</i>

373
00:38:58,455 --> 00:38:59,805
Immunoglobulin...

374
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,646
<i>Unfortunately, the elixir from the vial
seems to have had no effect on me</i>

375
00:39:24,771 --> 00:39:26,863
<i>except a spike
in my immunoglobulin levels.</i>

376
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,355
<i>Repeated attempts to bring them
back down into normal range...</i>

377
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,330
It was the artifact itself.

378
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:33,425
It held the contagion.

379
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,045
I was Patient Zero.

380
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,352
I caused this.
I caused all of this.

381
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,085
Dear god.

382
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,700
You're keeping it
hidden from the world.

383
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:25,925
Guarding it.

384
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:34,973
You won't let me destroy it,
will you?

385
00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:50,155
Is it safe here?

386
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:57,835
Thank you.

387
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:55,685
Welcome back.

388
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Nice coat.

389
00:41:57,405 --> 00:41:58,974
Did you pick that up in Honduras?

390
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:02,105
No, it's one of my own.

391
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:05,355
It's a very good look for you.

392
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,151
So how was the safari?

393
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,611
Safaris are in Africa.

394
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:12,737
Okay, then the...

395
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:16,195
"jungle hunt for the tomb
of the Mayan king",

396
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:19,880
which, when you think about it,
sounds like a bad cable special.

397
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,462
Which is why I went alone,
to avoid the mockery.

398
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,515
That's a good plan.

399
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:27,425
So did you find it, or what?

400
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:29,285
The tomb? No.

401
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:31,585
- No, I didn't.
- Really?

402
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:34,593
You did a lot of research.
It's not like you to strike out.

403
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,090
Searched the area for days.

404
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,315
Came up empty, not even a whiff.

405
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:44,331
We'll just call the trip
a massive tax write-off.

406
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:48,315
You're totally pissed, aren't you?
That you came up empty.

407
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,435
Absolutely furious.

408
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,207
Come on.
These things happen for a reason, right?

409
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:00,265
Look at that.

410
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,395
What a beautiful day.

411
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:07,755
Not bad, Will.
