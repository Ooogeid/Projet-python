1
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,115
Okay.

2
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:12,428
- Favorite album.
- <i>Nevermind</i>.

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,755
What is it that? Personal?

4
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,824
<i>Nevermind</i>, Nirvana.

5
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,345
You?

6
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:21,253
<i>Joshua Tree</i>, obviously.

7
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:24,941
- <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> and <i>Rhapsody in blue</i>.
- That's two.

8
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,802
Over the course of two lifetimes.

9
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,456
Gershwin played it for me
while he was writing it.

10
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:33,950
And no doubt you've watched
the sun come up with the Beatles.

11
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:36,285
Just one of them.

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,582
Is there anything better than eating
pastilla with your fingers?

13
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:44,377
Doing it in Morocco.

14
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,771
Which, by my calculations,

15
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,799
is still 6,000 miles
from our front lawn, sadly.

16
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,295
I'll get the tea.

17
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,714
So, what inspired this?

18
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,784
This midnight at the oasis thing?

19
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,935
It's a ritual I've grown to love.

20
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,010
It reminds me that the bedouins
had it right.

21
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,670
They have this philosophy
called Al-misaan.

22
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:08,859
It means never forfeiting
your principles.

23
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,248
What is it?

24
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,229
It's a...

25
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:27,332
It's a text message from the wife
of my best friend in college.

26
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:29,956
Danny's missing.

27
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,175
Can I help?

28
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,439
The police are useless.

29
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:41,642
This friend,
was he prone to trouble?

30
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,494
Who, Danny? No.

31
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:47,635
Nobody was more straight up,
more gentle.

32
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,044
It's time to make your bets!

33
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,080
Not for the squeamish!
Not for the faint of heart!

34
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:02,329
If you have a pulse,
you will convulse.

35
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,471
Ladies and dobermans,

36
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:07,293
for your blood-lusting pleasure!

37
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:11,577
Tonight's first fight...

38
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:14,759
Give it up for Beta!

39
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,971
Come on!
The great Beta, everyone!

40
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:23,142
And... Stretch!

41
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,532
Stretch!

42
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,234
No more bets! No more bets!

43
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,612
Right, come on, come on!

44
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,197
Fight!

45
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,560
Yes! Lovely!
Lovely!

46
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:01,847
Give it to him!

47
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,810
Yeah! Come on!

48
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:11,065
Stretchy, stretchy!

49
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,385
Yes! Yes!

50
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,321
Lovely!

51
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,284
All right!

52
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,819
Beautiful!

53
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:39,355
Finish him!
Finish him!

54
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,385
Get him out of here!
Get him out!

55
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:10,332
The Team Projet-SG

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,625
presents:

57
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,837
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 10
Warriors (v. 1.00)

58
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,341
Timing by: Arrow, Kujathemas,
nitrogenc, Salomon.

59
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,545
http://projet-sg.net

60
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,205
Oh, thanks for coming, Will.

61
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,129
What's this all about?

62
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,450
Danny would never be gone
this long without calling me.

63
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,305
He's in trouble, I know it.

64
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:05,220
- He say anything about taking off?
- No, nothing.

65
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,457
You know he's been working
with feeding the homeless, right?

66
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:11,637
Yeah, you got this whole gleaning thing
going on with local restaurants, sure.

67
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,610
I've been filling in for him,

68
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,295
and the thing is,

69
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:20,090
some of the people we provided meals
to went missing.

70
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,918
When Danny looked into it, he found
that at least a dozen homeless men

71
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:25,417
had disappeared over
the last few months.

72
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:30,246
- I haven't heard word one about it.
- Yeah, it barely made the newspapers.

73
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,497
Invisible victims, that's what
Danny always calls them.

74
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,935
Anyway,

75
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:40,402
when he went to the police,
they basically shined him on,

76
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,258
so he started
investigating on his own.

77
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,205
This is the file of stuff
he had gathered.

78
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,462
He always said
if he ever got in over his head,

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,760
you'd be the person to get him out.

80
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,228
And the police haven't
given you anything?

81
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,581
That's just it.

82
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,850
I get these looks
as if they know something,

83
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,023
but they won't tell me anything.

84
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:04,730
Hey, listen.
Danny's always been a survivor.

85
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,533
Whatever's happened to him, you know
he's going to get himself out of it.

86
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,059
- It's gonna be okay.
- All right.

87
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:16,125
Henry helped me collate
all the data Danny collected,

88
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,315
witness accounts, times, dates.

89
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,095
One particular vehicle was spotted
near three different locations

90
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,549
- where these guys disappeared.
- It was a white van.

91
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:26,502
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Just wait.

92
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,975
A homeless dude got a license number
when he saw his friend being abducted.

93
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,601
We traced it to a stolen vehicle that
was found abandoned near the estuary.

94
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,665
Is there anything out there?

95
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,687
Nothing inhabited.
Just a former awning factory.

96
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:41,734
Can you say "road trip"?

97
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:02,004
Glad you could join us, Mr. Peralta.

98
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,299
Well, I know you were anxious
for the latest on the trials.

99
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:08,969
- Ms. Whitcomb, gentlemen...
- Please...

100
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,755
We've field-tested 54

101
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:14,945
unique

102
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,019
meta-human fighters to date.

103
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:20,114
19 were beaten to death in the pit,

104
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,149
9 others were eliminated.

105
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,778
And the most successful?

106
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,739
The bio-armored meta-humans.

107
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,560
Five of our six variations

108
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,470
made it through to the semis.

109
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:36,048
The one we called Beta

110
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:39,751
- was definitely leading the pack.
- Wait... "was?"

111
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,625
We're still working on the right dosage,
but we're making more just like him.

112
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,811
How compliant was this Beta?

113
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,255
Exactly what the Cabal
had been hoping for, ma'am.

114
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,490
Submissive with his handlers,

115
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:55,656
murder

116
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,416
on his opponents.

117
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,916
The perfect field soldier
for the cleansing.

118
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,163
Right.
Six months to reach peak performance.

119
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:08,968
Train 'em in platoons. You'll have
your army sooner than you think.

120
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:11,360
Well, that presumes
you know what I think,

121
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,826
and that, Mr. Peralta, is doubtful.

122
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,840
Your spectacles are demeaning
to our higher purpose,

123
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,101
but they are an effective
proving ground.

124
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,610
What do you think went on here?

125
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:37,955
Executions?

126
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,610
There's a great range
in age for this blood.

127
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,355
Some of it seems months old,
and others seem very fresh.

128
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:52,015
Pattern tell you anything?

129
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,950
Medium velocity impact spatter,

130
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,075
multiple trajectories,

131
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,823
all consistent with
repeated blunt trauma.

132
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:11,885
Enswell.

133
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,825
As in, <i>all's well that ends well</i>?

134
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:20,893
It's a tool cut men use to stop
a fighter's eye from closing.

135
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,155
Epinephrine,

136
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,814
1:1000. If used topically,
it can stop bleeding.

137
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,360
- You think it was a training facility?
- Or a fight ring.

138
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,448
- Not exactly Caesar's.
- But for bare-knuckle throw-downs.

139
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:46,615
My god...

140
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:48,355
Who are you?

141
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,285
I'm Helen.

142
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:53,717
I'm your daughter.

143
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,394
Do you recognize me?

144
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:07,735
Come on,

145
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,245
I know this long-lost child scam
backward and forward.

146
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:14,564
You got to work
on your delivery, babe.

147
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:16,901
Your name is Gregory Magnus,

148
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,665
and you're my father.

149
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,494
My name, if you don't mind,
is Charles L. Denton.

150
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:28,154
If that's what you'd prefer.
What are you doing here?

151
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,695
Yeah, give me a minute, okay?

152
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,290
I'm just sleeping one off.

153
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:36,965
You know, free drinks?

154
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,304
My buddy got me in here.

155
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,655
To what,
an illegal fight?

156
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,255
All right, listen, if you're cops,
I want to see a badge.

157
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:50,920
- That's a very nasty cut. May I...
- I'll take care of it.

158
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:53,195
I'd like you to come back with us.

159
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,485
I'll clean that wound, and...

160
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,095
And we can talk.

161
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,866
We got nothing to talk about.

162
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,760
This might be a case
of mistaken identity.

163
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:04,997
I'm not mistaken.

164
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,332
I know my own father.

165
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,878
- Piece of work, this one.
- A quality I inherited.

166
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:25,185
We'll know before long whether it was
Danny's blood on that warehouse.

167
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,991
This Charlie's real identity aside,

168
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:31,240
he may be our best hope
at finding out what happened to him.

169
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:35,115
I can't begin to explain it,
but there is no mistaking who he is.

170
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,434
Can I be perfectly blunt?

171
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:42,455
By all means.

172
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,785
Half the dreams I had growing up
were about my mother.

173
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,805
I missed her so much that my...

174
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,376
subconscious took every opportunity
to bring her back.

175
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,294
Charlie, or whatever he chooses
to call himself, is not a dream,

176
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,883
and he's not a figment
of my imagination.

177
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,305
I know how compelling
seeing this man must be.

178
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:08,504
I lost him once, Will.

179
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,085
I'm not going to lose him again.

180
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,910
There are things
I need to know about you...

181
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,035
Charlie...

182
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:27,065
And if I wind up being wrong,
you'll be sent home with my apologies.

183
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:29,623
I presume you have a home.

184
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,169
I really do look like your father.
Okay, I get that.

185
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,060
I'll need to take a blood sample.

186
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:40,935
There are objective measures.
We could avoid a lot of bickering.

187
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,605
Look, if I am...

188
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:44,655
your father...

189
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,266
Do I own a piece of this?

190
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,485
Where were you born?

191
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,825
In the middle of a squall
in the Yukon territory.

192
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,885
My father was a...

193
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,320
bush pilot.

194
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:03,907
Your occupation?

195
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:05,955
On a good day,

196
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:07,619
I'm a scoundrel.

197
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:09,195
Special skills?

198
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:11,081
I play blues harmonica.

199
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:13,357
Not well, but frequently.

200
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,575
Your date of birth.

201
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,863
I'll be 61 in March.

202
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:22,265
Tell you what, bring a decent scotch,
I'll invite you to the party.

203
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,387
You were born in Devonshire in 1829.

204
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,735
Your wife was Patricia Heathering,
and you...

205
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:33,055
You were the leading
scientific light of your day.

206
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,766
You must understand, Gregory,

207
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,152
the board has been patient with you,

208
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,375
but their generosity has limits.

209
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,440
As does their imagination!

210
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,490
Can you not fathom the secrets
we are on the verge of unlocking?

211
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,040
By accepting your hysterical

212
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,797
and outlandish case studies as fact?

213
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:56,150
I don't understand.

214
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,170
Why are they always so angry at you?

215
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,173
They're not angry, sweetheart,
they're afraid.

216
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,508
What have you done
to make them so afraid of you?

217
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,885
Tell me.

218
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,375
I can't.

219
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,430
It's the drinking.

220
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:19,805
I won't deny it,

221
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,737
but I've never been called
anything close to 180.

222
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:26,550
What do you know about what went on
in those warehouses?

223
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:29,755
I told you.
It's a little innocent gambling,

224
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,660
a couple of bad boys
whalin' on each other.

225
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,457
One of those bad boys,
was he a young asian man?

226
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,735
You know, it's...

227
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,545
It's all kind of a blur,
to be honest.

228
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:44,525
His life is in jeopardy.
If you know anything, anything at all...

229
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,886
I get these blackouts...

230
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:52,224
But, no, that doesn't include
forgetting who I am.

231
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,060
Why are you hiding
everything you know to be true?

232
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,228
Do I...

233
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,575
give my drink orders to you,
or do you have someone for that?

234
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:07,322
Did you get anything on Danny?

235
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,765
Not directly,

236
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,145
but I borrowed Charlie's cell phone.

237
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,840
He took these photos at the fight.

238
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,915
Now, nothing of Danny, but...

239
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:17,835
look at this.

240
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,625
Oh, my god...

241
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:24,480
Tell me that's not an abnormal.

242
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,155
Not just any abnormal.

243
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,335
What do you mean?

244
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:33,380
Two years before my father disappeared
on an expedition to Mecca,

245
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,650
he created a number of new species.

246
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,925
It was, in effect,
the birth of genetic engineering.

247
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:41,515
He kept it all in this journal here.

248
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Now...

249
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:47,110
this particular species proved to be
so aggressive and dangerous

250
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:50,448
that he had no choice
but to destroy every trace of it.

251
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:54,743
But if he destroyed it...

252
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,905
How did it survive into this century?
I know.

253
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,940
We don't even know how your father
survived into this century.

254
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,794
Or if he even is your father.

255
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,630
It simply begs
any semblance of credulity

256
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:09,467
that a man identical to Gregory
would be a spectator at a fight

257
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,560
in which the very species of abnormal
he created would be a combatant.

258
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,735
Okay, yeah,

259
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:17,355
it is very, very weird.

260
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:21,021
What does it say about these matches
that an abnormal is being used?

261
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,380
I worry that your friend Danny
may have stumbled onto something

262
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:28,055
far more sinister
than extreme fighting.

263
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:34,615
- How good's your memory, Charlie?
- I remember better days than this.

264
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,965
Gregory Magnus may not know
a single thing

265
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,390
about what happened
to Will's friend, Danny,

266
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:40,707
but Charlie Denton does.

267
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,830
What do you know about those fights?
Don't tell me it's all a little blurry.

268
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:48,020
You know, you got issues.
Anybody ever tell you that?

269
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,591
We know that people
gamble on these fights,

270
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,810
and that abnormals are pitted
against one another.

271
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,097
Do the fighters die sometimes?

272
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,055
We all die sometime.

273
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,729
So you don't have a problem
betting on these blood matches.

274
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,247
Kill an abnormal,

275
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,765
save a pit-bull.

276
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,859
Perhaps you're not
my father after all.

277
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,196
He would never have been so callous.

278
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,406
Well, now we're making progress.

279
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,395
The father I knew

280
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:17,965
risked everything

281
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:21,925
for the simple belief that all creatures
deserved a fair chance.

282
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,544
If I had a daughter,

283
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,285
I'd want her to be just like you.

284
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:33,185
A little less borderline schizo,
but otherwise...

285
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,760
See, that's a trait that
you and Gregory share,

286
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,001
stubbornness.

287
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,375
You probably drove him
to the edge, too.

288
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:46,005
If you know anything
about what happened to these men,

289
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,135
then please, tell me, Charlie.

290
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,395
I don't know.

291
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,025
I swear I don't.

292
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,965
But I know someone who would.

293
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,562
The beauty of this one
is that they built it so the engine

294
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:11,715
sounds harmonized at freeway speed.

295
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:17,270
- They don't make 'em like that anymore.
- But they are making something new.

296
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,889
You're the man with the 411
on the abnormals fight club.

297
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:21,685
Charlie told us.

298
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,355
- I know cars.
- Yeah, you also know the players,

299
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,565
and you don't want
to tick off our boss.

300
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:31,215
Trust us on that.

301
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:36,705
It's been going on a year,
year and a half.

302
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:38,867
The money's huge.

303
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:42,620
- It moves through all the big books.
- What's the betting on Danny Bradley?

304
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:46,100
Oh, they don't go
by names like that.

305
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,275
Destroyer.

306
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:49,044
Slice 'n dice.

307
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,410
The Re-arranger.

308
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,670
Where can we find the next fight?

309
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,845
I could make a couple of calls.

310
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,310
I'll tell you what I hear.

311
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:01,120
But I warn you, the buy-in is steep.

312
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,914
And it's all super-secret.

313
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,375
Word doesn't get out till mid-week.

314
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,740
Tests from the floor
of the warehouse.

315
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,715
Everyone who bled in that ring
was an abnormal.

316
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,835
So Danny wasn't there.

317
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,940
Not the Danny you remember,
in all likelihood.

318
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,515
What does that mean?

319
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:28,990
His blood's been altered.

320
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,461
They've changed him,
or he's changed himself.

321
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,463
Danny's an abnormal now.

322
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:39,305
What about the blood comparison
between you and Charlie?

323
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:42,535
That's my DNA on the left
and his on the right.

324
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,470
Father and daughter.

325
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:50,240
The only way that's not the man
who made me who I am

326
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:53,817
is if they used his DNA
to create a new Gregory Magnus.

327
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,571
Yeah, it's Charlie.

328
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,520
How are things at the Sanctuary?

329
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:04,285
<i>Magnus is coming along just fine.</i>

330
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:06,915
The asset is in place.

331
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,465
I'm happy to hear that.

332
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,175
Recognize this?

333
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,099
What, <i>From Russia with love</i>?

334
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,204
It's the lab I built
based on your designs.

335
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,665
I...

336
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:36,530
designed this over
a hundred years ago?

337
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:40,241
Well, not the modern equipment,
of course, but the core concept, yes.

338
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,022
Do you remember the first time
you took me into your laboratory?

339
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:46,666
Look, I'm sorry, but...

340
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:50,957
I'm not getting the antacid flashback
you were hoping for.

341
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,060
You...

342
00:20:56,185 --> 00:21:00,049
are the most talented
medical researcher I have ever known,

343
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:03,386
and yet you keep your most important
work hidden from the world.

344
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,645
From me.

345
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:09,795
If you truly believe
that I have potential, father, please,

346
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,270
help me achieve it.

347
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,165
Once you

348
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,845
enter this door,

349
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:27,415
you are on a path
that cannot be reversed.

350
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:45,525
You told me my world
would never be the same.

351
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,525
No offense, but...

352
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,840
Your old man
sounds like a whack-job.

353
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,590
I loved him with all my heart,

354
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:55,165
and you're remembering a little.
I can see it.

355
00:21:58,445 --> 00:21:59,445
These

356
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,361
were your surgical tools.

357
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,705
In your hands, they were magic.

358
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,995
Is that right?

359
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,080
Hello?

360
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,924
- <i>It's the mechanic.</i>
- Did you get the information?

361
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,390
<i>Not on the phone.</i>

362
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:27,265
<i>Meet me at Hollister
and 80th in 20 minutes.</i>

363
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:29,035
<i>500 cash per invite.</i>

364
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:30,305
<i>Come alone.</i>

365
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:41,465
This is the microscope
you gave me when I was 10.

366
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:44,780
You said it would give me
access to an unseen world,

367
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,985
a world you said
was filled with untold wonders.

368
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,055
I need a refill.

369
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,300
It's a part of you.
You can't deny it.

370
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:57,792
It's connecting for you.

371
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:01,550
You came back here for a reason, father.
It can't have been by chance.

372
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:03,575
Stop it, will you? Back off!

373
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:05,258
I'm not your...

374
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,545
Father, what's wrong?

375
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,025
You put up quite the struggle,
or so my boys tell me.

376
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:35,593
The mechanic says
you're a big fan of the fights.

377
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:36,539
Danny...

378
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,291
Where's Danny?

379
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:41,945
I've got someone else
I'd like to introduce to you to first.

380
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,631
Meet your new boss.

381
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,565
What about our rookie
from the Sanctuary?

382
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,296
He's been given every courtesy.
For now.

383
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,635
Ironic if he turns into
something useful.

384
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,585
Well, I can't see him
going the distance.

385
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,520
Just make sure he has
the procedure first.

386
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:38,395
Once the scarab controls him,
we can juice him into abnormality.

387
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,190
With a little luck,

388
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,935
he might give us an insight or two.

389
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,175
Already been taken care of.

390
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,615
Anything else I could do for you?

391
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,195
Smell better.

392
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:52,532
Right.

393
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,576
There's an insect-like
creature deeply embedded

394
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,575
in the muscles
in the base of his brain.

395
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,330
What the hell is it?

396
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,208
I can't say for certain
without doing more tests,

397
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:06,337
but all my instincts are telling me that
this is what's controlling my father,

398
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,069
keeping him from remembering
who he really is.

399
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:10,810
Are you thinking the Cabal?

400
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:13,470
These fight clubs could be
their living laboratories,

401
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,685
homeless people, their guinea pigs.

402
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,182
Will is missing
and I do not have a good feeling.

403
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:20,410
- Have you checked the levels?
- Up and down.

404
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,896
He might have gone to see the mechanic.
There was an address in the office.

405
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,840
- We gotta get out.
- Chances are that was

406
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:28,310
- for the snatch-and-grab.
- We find out where is this fight,

407
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:29,780
we'll find Will and Danny.

408
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:33,197
The one man that's holding out on us
is the one that might know something.

409
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:45,615
I thought you'd never wake up.

410
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:56,425
- What have they done to you?
- Same as it ever was...

411
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,395
Only now I'm better.

412
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:00,745
Stronger,

413
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,745
faster, smarter...

414
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,435
Kayla's out of her mind,

415
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:05,965
worrying.

416
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,441
She doesn't know
if you're dead or alive.

417
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:10,555
What's it look like to you?

418
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,425
You're scaring me.

419
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:20,995
There's a time

420
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:22,725
and a place, Will.

421
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:26,105
This is my time,

422
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:27,905
my place.

423
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,713
You don't even know what
they gave you, do you?

424
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:33,132
They gave me a front-row seat
to the world.

425
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,065
What was that thing,

426
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,386
that insect?

427
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:40,843
That's nothin', man.

428
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,255
The real deal is the juice!

429
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:47,772
Listen to yourself.

430
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,105
You don't even sound like you.

431
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,305
I've never felt so alive.

432
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:55,029
It's like I'm flying without wings.

433
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,197
Come on!

434
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,076
If you heard a kid in your program talk
like that, you'd kick his ass.

435
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,215
This is freedom, brother.

436
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,625
You've been living in a box.

437
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,765
You'll see what I mean.

438
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,425
You'll be a warrior like me.

439
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,355
They've done it to me.

440
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:39,460
Your friends at the fight ring
have taken our colleague.

441
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:42,885
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- This is getting old, Charlie.

442
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:45,413
It's obvious you know more
than you're telling us.

443
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,123
Obvious to you, maybe.

444
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,397
Even if I could lead you to those
people, I'd be paying in body parts.

445
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,513
There's still one or two
I'm kind of fond of.

446
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,965
I don't know you from Adam,

447
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:59,375
but my mom says you're her dad,
and that makes you my...

448
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,655
My grandpa.

449
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,700
And that gives me the right to tell you
that you're one cranky, ungrateful sack.

450
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:08,280
- You be careful, young lady.
- My mother worshiped you!

451
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,980
She makes it sound like you were
the smartest man in the world.

452
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,960
Not smart enough, apparently.

453
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,610
We're family, okay?
Whether you believe it or not,

454
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,946
and what you're doing to my mom, to Will
and to all those people, is wrong!

455
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,823
Well, we know where she got the lip.

456
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,783
Enough!

457
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,203
If you have any decency left in you,
you will tell us where is that fight.

458
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,914
Look, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

459
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,542
Well, then, you leave me no choice.

460
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:34,000
If only Gregory will tell us
what Charlie knows,

461
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,085
then we have to find a way
to release him.

462
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,905
I'm quite deft with a scalpel.

463
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,011
I learned at the side of a master.

464
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,433
I heard him say they were taking you
straight to a ten.

465
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:49,477
A ten?

466
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,195
That's the bomb, man.

467
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,190
That's what I want.

468
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,305
I'm still waiting for a four.

469
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,085
We gotta get outta here.

470
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:02,275
Don't fight it.

471
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,870
It's useless.

472
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:10,748
Do you know why you're alive, Will?

473
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:14,377
By the time you leave this place...

474
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,040
If you leave this place...

475
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,884
You'll know.

476
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,170
It's a local anesthetic only,

477
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:35,439
so you should be awake
for the entire procedure.

478
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,365
It's deeply embedded.

479
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:22,955
What...

480
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:27,699
- What is it?
- It's the juice.

481
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:30,286
I didn't think
it could happen this fast.

482
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:31,955
What...

483
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,456
What do I look like?

484
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:37,325
Like a god, Will.

485
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:41,585
Like a god.

486
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:51,260
There's a rhythm to the creature's
movements. If I can get it

487
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:54,159
on the proper pulse point, I should be
able to pull the legs out individually

488
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,920
- and tie them off.
- If you can't?

489
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:58,345
The hinged spurs on the pincers will

490
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,505
propel the remnant
all the way to the spinal canal,

491
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:04,355
where it will paralyze
and then kill.

492
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:07,745
Can you hear me, Charlie?

493
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,240
You said you're going to kill me.

494
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:12,494
Hopefully not.

495
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:20,590
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

496
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,715
I give you ugly fighters!

497
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:27,055
Ugly fighting!

498
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:31,145
Ugliness for the beautiful!

499
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,391
Tonight's main card,

500
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,695
a meat club first.

501
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,365
A battle royale!

502
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,350
With...

503
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,995
Double Doom!

504
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:48,655
And...

505
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:51,270
The Lobster!

506
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,355
Versus

507
00:31:57,975 --> 00:31:59,185
Riot!

508
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:03,945
And...

509
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:07,705
in his meat club debut,

510
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:10,400
the... Boy...

511
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,810
man!

512
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,185
You feel it, Will?
This is what it's all about!

513
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:30,447
You know the rules!
There are no rules!

514
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,600
Last man standing walks away!

515
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,955
And start fighting. Right!

516
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:38,622
Come on, fight!

517
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:41,455
Fight! Fight!

518
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,165
Fight!

519
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,025
Fight!

520
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:46,046
Camden!

521
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,508
Come on, you freaks, let's fight!

522
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,187
That's it!

523
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:18,265
His vitals are spiking.

524
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,999
- Trouble.
- What?

525
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:24,690
The front pair, doomsday wired.

526
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:27,280
Completely enmeshed
in his peripheral nerve.

527
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,855
And if it gets cut?

528
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,675
So does his lifeline.

529
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,186
<i>You were born in Devonshire
in 1829...</i>

530
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:45,518
<i>110 over 70.</i>

531
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:47,535
<i>Blood's moving.</i>

532
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,074
- Hang on, father.
- I'm trying.

533
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,940
Mom, he's in a lot of pain.
Can't you knock him out or something?

534
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:06,584
I need him conscious.

535
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,035
<i>Once you enter this door,</i>

536
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,677
<i>you are on a path
that cannot be reversed...</i>

537
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,035
<i>Cannot be reversed...</i>

538
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:24,975
<i>Well, Gregory,</i>

539
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,564
you've designed
the perfect fighting machine.

540
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,675
You don't know
the hell you'll unleash.

541
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,706
Can you hear me?

542
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,274
Get it out of me!

543
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:39,155
I need your help.

544
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm the patient, for god's sake.

545
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:47,655
You were also the most able surgeon
the Royal College ever produced.

546
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:51,535
These last pincers
are the neural tap.

547
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,160
How do I separate them
without killing you?

548
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,555
The Norwich... Giant.

549
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:01,545
The what?

550
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:03,985
Mom, what did he say?

551
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,135
A pituitary abnormal
on a hair-trigger to self-destruct.

552
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,840
Isolate the creature's neural
kill switch,

553
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:12,145
cut it before it can send
the signal.

554
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:14,175
Sounds like a plan.

555
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:17,825
Except the Norwich Giant
died on the table.

556
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,550
Nice. Lovely.

557
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,225
I've exposed the peripheral nerve
where it's been hijacked.

558
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,811
I have the cut point.

559
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,026
Do it, mom.

560
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,046
Game's over.
Back down.

561
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,045
Let's get on with it!

562
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:59,805
Come on. Get him out!

563
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,761
Fight! Fight!

564
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,898
All right, all right, you two.

565
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,525
Let's go!

566
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:21,155
Here we go!

567
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,829
Look at me!

568
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:40,935
Got it.

569
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,017
D&S... Meat packing...

570
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:56,925
I'll get an address.

571
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,131
I think we have a winner.

572
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,235
Love it.

573
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:30,875
Come on.

574
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,255
This is your time, right?

575
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,575
Is that what you said?
Is this what you want?

576
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:50,365
Is this what you want?
Is this what you all want?

577
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:53,495
Get up!

578
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,125
Get up!

579
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,711
Finish him, you dumb bastard!

580
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,055
Come on!

581
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:11,639
It's me, Henry.

582
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,647
This isn't you!
This isn't you.

583
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,065
Come on! Come...

584
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:24,986
Will, this is not you.

585
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,078
Help... Help me.

586
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,915
Come on! Kill him! Let's go!

587
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:43,455
Stand down!

588
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,885
- Help me.
- You're going to be okay.

589
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,555
You're going to be okay.

590
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,016
Listen to me. The first thing we gotta
do is get that thing out of you, okay?

591
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,615
You think you're breaking up
some fights? You have no idea

592
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,055
- who you're messing with.
- Pass the same message onto the Cabal.

593
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,799
- What do you want?
- I want these fights stopped.

594
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:31,011
And the genetic experiments.

595
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:33,888
You surface someplace else,
and we'll be waiting.

596
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:36,605
All right.

597
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,155
All right!

598
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,495
This is the last cycle.

599
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:52,230
All signs are that your body
has purged the abnormality.

600
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:53,905
Danny's not far behind.

601
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,655
I keep thinking, was that me,

602
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:01,235
ready to kill a friend, or was it...

603
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:03,365
somebody else?

604
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:07,055
We all have
the impulse for violence.

605
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:09,515
The true measure of a species,

606
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:12,225
indeed, of a person,
is in our restraint.

607
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,415
- Oh, my God. Danny...
- Kayla.

608
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,585
Oh, my God.

609
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:33,615
I love you.

610
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:35,805
Thank you.

611
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,795
The first 10 years after you were gone
were the hardest.

612
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,825
I kept asking myself,
"what would father do?"

613
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,785
I can't stay here, Helen.

614
00:41:56,485 --> 00:41:57,485
Why not?

615
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:01,735
I have decades I haven't touched on.
So much I need to show you.

616
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,875
The longer I'm here, the greater risk
I pose to your well-being.

617
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:12,395
I wanted one day to come back
to help protect you from your enemies,

618
00:42:13,145 --> 00:42:14,697
not to wind up helping them.

619
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:17,242
The Cabal had already asserted
themselves as a threat long

620
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,369
before they tapped your expertise.

621
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:23,815
I admit, their engineered warrior,
the one you designed,

622
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:25,955
that does make me worry.

623
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:27,919
When I finally put it down,

624
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:33,355
it had taken the life
of every abnormal in my laboratory.

625
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:37,745
Then who better to find
its weakness than you?

626
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:41,415
And what better place than here,
in the Sanctuary?

627
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:43,775
I'm sorry.

628
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,725
I'll have to seek
my own way for now.

629
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,095
But I promise you, Helen,

630
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:54,435
I'll never be far.
