3
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:00,121
This is 7 David 5,
responding to a 10-11,

4
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,648
149th and Cordova.

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,218
<i>Copy that, 7 David 5.</i>

6
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,129
Open up, police!

7
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,162
Let's go! Open up!

8
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,842
Ma'am, we've had some complaints
about the noise.

9
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:34,860
We want no trouble.

10
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:37,099
Then you don't mind if we come in?

11
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:38,432
No.

12
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,670
You folks want to tell me
what's going on?

13
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:48,009
We have trouble early tonight, but...

14
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,588
no trouble now.

15
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,591
Please... you go.

16
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,822
We have no trouble.

17
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:00,946
It's okay.

18
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,595
Ma'am, I'm gonna enter this room.
Please, step aside.

19
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,009
Please...

20
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,843
Relax, it'll be fine.

21
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,087
Russo!

22
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:17,673
We need backup!

23
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,126
7 David 5,
requesting backup on that 10-11.

24
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,436
<i>Copy that, 7 David 5.</i>

25
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,694
7 David 5, EMT, stat.

26
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,654
It's a kid.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,580
Hey, kid, you okay?

28
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:56,503
It's okay. I'm just gonna come over
to you real slow,

29
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,932
and I'm going to reach out
and grab my hand, okay?

30
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,976
No, come on, it's okay.
You're okay. Just reach out.

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Come on.

32
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,858
No, come on. It's okay. Come on,
I need you to just take my hand.

33
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:11,821
I said come here!

34
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:34,190
Oh... God...

35
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:41,782
- Excuse me?
- Hey, is everything good?

36
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,140
Well, yeah, it's great.
It's delicious, but...

37
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,591
- Is it the chef's night off?
- Actually, yeah.

38
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,153
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, it's just that...

39
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,968
the balsamic drizzle is
counter-clockwise.

40
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,633
Instead of clockwise.

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,953
Not that it matters. It's just that...
Hold on.

42
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:17,505
May I?

43
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,749
Damn.

44
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,625
Thanks.

45
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,309
- It's part of the job.
- Now he's here.

46
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,243
You're too late, Zimmerman.

47
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,409
Yeah, I was at dinner.

48
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,829
- Well, we got our guy.
- No kidding?

49
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:46,998
Wow, that's great. Really great.

50
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:49,268
Two of our own?

51
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,503
- Do their families know?
- It's covered.

52
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,220
As long as I'm here,
you mind if I take a look around?

53
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:00,303
Sure, whatever.

54
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,466
A lot of people living
in one apartment.

55
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,370
Five?

56
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:24,146
Four, including the third DB.
An old man.

57
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,062
Religious people.

58
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,341
Ukrainian or Russian?

59
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,048
Russian.

60
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:45,765
- And just the one kid?
- No, no kids.

61
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,241
Hyperactive.

62
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:54,648
Fidgety.

63
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,403
These scratches are pretty fresh.

64
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:01,288
- What the hell's he talking about?
- We got the shooter, Zimmerman.

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,916
He's at the hospital
with one of our eyewitnesses.

66
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,189
Guy's a forensic shrink,
thinks he's Sherlock Holmes.

67
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,108
I heard the agence
gave him the boot.

68
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,441
Yeah, now he's all ours.

69
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,488
Better go keep an eye on him.

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,258
Night sweats.

71
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,695
A lot of fear in the air.

72
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,358
Borscht, too, but... mainly fear.

73
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,649
Gee, maybe it has something to do
with the triple homicide.

74
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,861
No, I mean before that.

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,045
Deadbolt on the bedroom door,

76
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,896
it locks from the outside.

77
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,322
And these shades are never up,

78
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:31,632
but they're not trying to hide
their heritage. They're not illegals?

79
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,752
That's right.

80
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,500
So, what are they hiding?

81
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:38,086
But what part of "We got the shooter"
don't you understand?

82
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,216
I'm thinking there was no shooting.

83
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,633
I don't need ballistics

84
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,371
to recognize the damage
of close-range small caliber,

85
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,588
and we got eyewitnesses,

86
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:52,415
- or weren't you listening to that part?
- Couple things don't jibe.

87
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,808
Multidirectional
cast-off on the walls.

88
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,141
It's from a blunt implement, maybe.

89
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,657
Five people in one small apartment.
Space is precious,

90
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,251
- but one drawer's empty?
- I told you, four people.

91
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:06,718
Another drawer's got a comic book
hidden under the clothes.

92
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:07,693
So what?

93
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,535
Well, it's not as if it's porn.

94
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:16,263
Then there's, why were all four adults
sleeping in the living room?

95
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,604
No, something else is going on here

96
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,979
that we haven't accounted for.

97
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:26,618
And what the hell's that
supposed to mean?

98
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:30,054
I don't know.

99
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,379
Hey, wait a second!

100
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:47,953
This is getting weird.

101
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,895
Not the way i'd hoped we'd meet.

102
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,040
Will?

103
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:14,450
Stay where you are...

104
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:17,303
Mommy!

105
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:19,705
Mommy!

106
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,086
You okay, Sherlock?
We found you out cold.

107
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,659
A little bit sore.

108
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:50,486
Let me guess.
You got decked by a hyperactive kid.

109
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,032
No, somebody coming down the alley
clipped me and kept going.

110
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,316
As soon as you're up to it,
Kavanaugh wants to see you upstairs.

111
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,577
Witness ID.

112
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,180
I'll be a couple of hours.

113
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,006
Yeah, we got our eyewitness
right here at the hospital.

114
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,906
Yeah, a Mrs. Lutrova,
daughter of vic #1.

115
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:40,051
Absolutely. By the book.
I'm looking at our guy right now.

116
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:44,020
Yes, sir. As soon as
we get a positive ID, i'll let you know.

117
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:47,718
Not a word to the press
without your say so, I understand.

118
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:49,152
Okay, bye.

119
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:54,363
What the hell happened to you?

120
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,199
Car versus idiot.

121
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,708
- I was the...
- Right, yeah.

122
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:00,930
Well, bad night all around, I guess?

123
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:03,318
Who's your man?

124
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:05,884
Vern Kovacs.

125
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,885
Apartment two floors
below our crime scene.

126
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:10,734
He's got a whole list of priors there.

127
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:14,854
Just got paroled after doing a dime
for armed robbery, rape, and assault.

128
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,375
You'd think
he'd eliminate the witnesses.

129
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,998
I mean, after three,
what's the downside?

130
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:25,706
Come on. Chances are he wasn't doing
a lot of thinking.

131
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,102
- Do you have a motive?
- Yes, I do.

132
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:29,897
I'm trying to solve this case.

133
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,035
Mrs. Lutrova? Come in.

134
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:34,672
Now, this is Dr. Zimmerman.

135
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,134
He is a forensic psychiatrist
attached to homicide.

136
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,678
I'm very sorry for your loss.

137
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:42,869
Now, ma'am,

138
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,352
do you see the man
who murdered your father

139
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,913
and those police officers tonight?

140
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:59,413
Now, take your time, because we need you
to be sure about this, all right?

141
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,903
He is the one.

142
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,428
He killed them.

143
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:22,930
You're certain?

144
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:25,631
His face. I could never forget.

145
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,206
Okay, all right.
Well, that's good for now.

146
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:31,859
Again, ma'am,
my condolences for your loss tonight.

147
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:33,611
Ma'am...

148
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,465
- Thank you, God.
- Listen to me.

149
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,344
- No, just give me a second.
- Tracy, yeah,

150
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,461
I need to talk to the DA's office
right away.

151
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,890
Hey, Fets.

152
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,901
I need five minutes with her.

153
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,834
- Later, Doc, I'm taking her home.
- No, no, now.

154
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:06,534
Mrs. Lutrova, I realize that you've been
through a lot tonight,

155
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:09,711
but you and I both know
that you just lied in there.

156
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,683
Body language. Averting your gaze.
Hands to your face. Rising vocal pitch.

157
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:17,143
You'd never seen that man before
in your life, had you?

158
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,742
I don't know what you say.

159
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,714
And you felt no guilt about it.

160
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:24,882
I do what's right.

161
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,800
You leave me alone now.

162
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,652
I was at your building tonight
when everything happened.

163
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,502
I saw a kid coming from your apartment.
Maybe 10 years old.

164
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,245
There is no boy. No.

165
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:39,502
- I never said it was a boy.
- Enough bad thing happen tonight.

166
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:40,879
You leave me alone now.

167
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,671
- Mrs. Lutrova, please.
- You stop. I go home.

168
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,900
- Fresh meat coming through!
- Subtle.

169
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:03,134
Russo, Albert and Birch, Lawrence.
Two cops. Bit it tonight uptown.

170
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,704
Yeah, we've been expecting them.
Put them in holding.

171
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,347
Got one more coming later.
EMS says it was a real butcher shop.

172
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,146
Aren't they all these days?

173
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:16,866
- They're in the cold room.
- Thank you.

174
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,821
- Lunch next week?
- Love to.

175
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,607
20 bucks?
I ain't giving it away, pal.

176
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,467
Ain't you a drink of water?

177
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:49,004
And I'm kind of thirsty.

178
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,094
Is that so?

179
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:56,415
I'm guessing you're looking for
a little action yourself.

180
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,743
In fact, I am looking for something.

181
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:02,982
Perhaps you can help me.

182
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:05,992
English, right?

183
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,130
I've got a thing for the brits.

184
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,241
So polite and all.

185
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,175
Well, this place,

186
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,352
rather strange,

187
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:21,084
a sanctuary, and it takes in,
only the most

188
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,629
unusual guests.

189
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:29,065
There's a big old place
down by the water,

190
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,452
Grayson Street, I think.

191
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,707
I've heard all kinds of stories,
but I never put much stock in them.

192
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,075
I'll take you there, if you like
but it'll cost you extra.

193
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,872
How very kind of you.

194
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,424
But I think I can find it on my own.

195
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:48,688
The woman is lying, I'm sure of it.

196
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,942
I don't know why we bother
interviewing eyewitnesses.

197
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,718
I mean, you could just come in
and you could work that voodoo crap

198
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:56,277
you've been working for the last
six months. It'd be great, right?

199
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,858
That's what you think
of behavioral science?

200
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:00,955
Two cops died tonight.

201
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,995
Now, we owe it to these guys
to do right by them.

202
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,664
Okay, okay, so what happens
when forensics comes back

203
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,859
and says those weren't bulletholes
in their foreheads?

204
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,844
Then Kovacs used something
else as a weapon.

205
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,385
It doesn't change anything.

206
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,618
So unless you've got something else,
something different...

207
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,126
I saw something tonight.

208
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,050
In the alley. It was a boy
maybe 10 years old.

209
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,314
It looked like he was running
from the crime scene, so I followed him,

210
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:34,346
I think the person who knocked me down
was following him, too.

211
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,303
Well, none of the witnesses
mentioned a boy.

212
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,706
I don't know, there was something
about him. It was like...

213
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,800
He wasn't just scared. It was like
he was in the grip of something.

214
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,434
Right. So,

215
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:53,537
we have eyewitnesses,
a suspect with priors, but you, you...

216
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,198
- like a 10-year-old kid as the shooter?
- No, I'm just saying

217
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:59,785
if you find the kid, then you'll know
how those three men died tonight.

218
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,504
Go home...

219
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,066
- Why don't you want to hear this?
- Because this is...

220
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,375
Because this is exactly
the same kind of BS

221
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,442
that got you bounced
from the Agency.

222
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:12,260
Now, I were you,
I would just back the hell off.

223
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,597
The detective is right, by the way.

224
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:36,566
Excuse me?

225
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,837
He can't use anything you gave him.

226
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,742
- Do I know you?
- How's your head?

227
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:44,067
Wait...

228
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:46,122
You ran me over.

229
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:47,974
You got in the way.

230
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,374
Of what?

231
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:50,794
My pursuit of the boy.

232
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,566
The police have the wrong man.

233
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:56,717
The evidence will bear it out if they
don't suppress it for a conviction,

234
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,344
but the boy is indeed real,
and he needs our help.

235
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:03,936
- Who are you?
- Let's just say I'm someone

236
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,536
who's chosen to embrace
the full spectrum of our reality.

237
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:11,968
There are things in this city,
in this world...

238
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,800
that no one wants to admit are real.

239
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,818
Okay, you're creeping me out now.

240
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:18,196
Dr. Zimmerman,

241
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:23,384
have you ever asked yourself
why you lost your job at the Agency?

242
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,444
That's impressive.

243
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,248
What did you do, google me?

244
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:30,834
Your theories were controversial.
You were headstrong.

245
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,645
Your so-called failures
were really theirs.

246
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:35,566
They failed to keep up
with your insights...

247
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:38,175
Lady, I'm getting soaked here.
What do you want?

248
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:41,030
You, Dr. Zimmerman.

249
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,691
As I see it, you have two choices.

250
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,933
You can go back to a life
where you're unheard and unappreciated,

251
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:48,064
or...

252
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,317
you can squarely face the truth

253
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,357
you've been seeking
since you were a child.

254
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:57,069
We both know you caught a glimpse
of that truth tonight.

255
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,391
Don't turn away.

256
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,767
Who are you?

257
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,993
I have a proposal.

258
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,852
All I ask is
for a little of your time.

259
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,538
Thanks, but...

260
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:24,116
If you're looking for resumes,
why don't you try monster.com?

261
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,345
I already have a job.

262
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,844
God, don't do that.

263
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,887
You know I still have a key.

264
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,093
Yeah, and you know how I love
these surprise visits.

265
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:54,154
What are you doing here, Meg?

266
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,898
I heard a couple cops got killed
at the precinct tonight. You okay?

267
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,327
The usual.

268
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:02,292
Eating badly, sleeping worse.

269
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,639
You?

270
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,710
Just, you know...

271
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,410
wanted to see if you were all right.

272
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,290
And get the rest of my stuff.

273
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,123
Is that everything?

274
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:35,142
If you find my hair straightener,
you can bring it by the ICU.

275
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,956
Hair straightener.
Got it.

276
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,033
It's kind of like returning
a high school ring or something.

277
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:45,083
And the last two years of our lives
come down to a punchline.

278
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:46,421
That wasn't...

279
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,455
Look, let's not do this, okay?

280
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:51,685
I can't go 10 rounds tonight.
I just don't have it in me.

281
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:54,088
They still riding you at work?

282
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:56,831
Nothing I can't handle.

283
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:59,893
Don't take this the wrong way, Will,
but you invite the ridicule.

284
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:02,212
- Did you get the same invitation?
- That's not fair.

285
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,475
Come on, Meg, you always
thought I was a wack-job too.

286
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:09,659
Look, whatever it is
that finally helps you sleep at night...

287
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:12,983
I hope you find it.

288
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,151
- Goodbye, Will.
- Meg...

289
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,595
- Good evening.
- Hi.

290
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,877
So, what made you decide to call?

291
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,750
- You said you were pursuing the boy.
- Indeed.

292
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:20,749
Why?

293
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:23,376
I suspect you know why.

294
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:27,991
No.
Honestly, I don't.

295
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:34,304
Well, then, this will be
a very illuminating evening.

296
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,495
Would you like a cup
of tea, Dr. Zimmerman,

297
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:43,555
or perhaps something stronger?

298
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:46,619
No. No, thanks.
I'm good.

299
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:49,707
You no doubt have questions
about this place.

300
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:52,837
Just one.
How come there's no organ music?

301
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,625
I'm glad to see
you maintain a healthy sense of humor.

302
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:59,066
Yeah, well, it's invaluable
in police work.

303
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:02,312
Nothing brightens up a murder scene
like the right zinger.

304
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,668
Levity helps keep
far more insidious things at bay.

305
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,501
The boy you saw.

306
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,620
He's very special,
or so I was led to believe

307
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,473
by people I've come to rely on
for such information.

308
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,252
Did he kill those men?

309
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:16,668
Yes and no.

310
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:18,863
Not the boy, per se.

311
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,255
If the boy did do it,
and you have knowledge either way,

312
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,564
I need to know.

313
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:28,775
And if the answers I provide
pose even greater questions?

314
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:32,376
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Are you certain about that?

315
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:33,775
You know what?

316
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:36,346
Next time that you just
want some company,

317
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,131
don't give your card out
to strangers on the street.

318
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,200
By the time the night is out,
I expect to have the boy in my custody.

319
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,915
Until then,
I hope you'll understand,

320
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:47,562
that I'm reluctant to speculate
on his guilt or innocence.

321
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:50,533
- But you're saying you can find him?
- I believe so,

322
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,427
and when I do,
I could use your help.

323
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:55,371
Really?

324
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:57,590
For what?

325
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:01,242
You call this place a sanctuary.
For whom?

326
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,467
Or what?

327
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,596
You know what?
This was a really bad idea.

328
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,431
I'm very sorry
to have wasted your time,

329
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,104
and I'm even sorrier
that you've wasted mine.

330
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:20,561
Your instincts told you
that the boy was anything but normal.

331
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:22,741
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

332
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:28,144
Inside these walls are beings that make
his qualities pale by comparison.

333
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,051
"Sanctuary for all."

334
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,899
It's not an empty motto.

335
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,188
Damn sector gives me
the willies, man.

336
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,803
No one likes working under old city.

337
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:46,433
Place is toxic.

338
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,407
Rent's cheap, though.

339
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:50,580
Hold it.

340
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:56,606
What the hell are you doing
down here, kid?

341
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,177
Look, wherever you ran from,
this place is worse, okay?

342
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:03,673
So let's go.

343
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:07,976
- Wasn't a request, kid.
- Wouldn't do that if I were you.

344
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:28,183
Peachy.

345
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:37,255
So you're a doctor of what, exactly?

346
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,045
The specific discipline
depends entirely on the patient.

347
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:44,031
Do you have anything
for chronic insomnia?

348
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,780
Fair warning, Dr. Zimmerman.

349
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:49,767
You're about to leave
the world you know behind.

350
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,014
I'll take that as a no.

351
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:58,410
This way.

352
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:08,349
I specialize mainly in cryptozoology
and xenobiology...

353
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,974
Teratology, too,
when the need arises.

354
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,679
"Teratology"?
What the hell is that?

355
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:21,966
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

356
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:02,859
Please.

357
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:07,971
A mermaid?

358
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,577
- You got to be kidding me.
- Teratology.

359
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:15,395
From the greek <i>teratos</i>,
meaning deformity, hideous creature.

360
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:17,390
Unknown being.

361
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:20,638
How is this even possible?

362
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,877
He's a little frightened
of strangers.

363
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,381
He's frightened?
What the hell is that?

364
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:47,958
His classification is of less importance
than the reality of his existence.

365
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,878
I discovered him
after his natural habitat was destroyed

366
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:53,169
by a South American
mining operation.

367
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,314
Sadly, he may be
the last of his species.

368
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,922
Oh, my God...

369
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,598
Come, now, don't be shy.

370
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,143
Elemental powers
can be very difficult to control,

371
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:26,278
but we have been making progress.

372
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,010
The purpose of this sanctuary is to find
and help the unfortunate creatures

373
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,059
of this world.

374
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,176
Some need saving.

375
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:42,016
Others can't be allowed to roam free.
Case in point.

376
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:44,641
New guy...

377
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:46,291
New guy!

378
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:49,080
Welcome!

379
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:51,616
Watch your back!

380
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:54,083
Stop it, both of you.

381
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,530
I apologize.
They're incorrigible.

382
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:02,850
Nature is nothing if not diverse.

383
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,424
The patients on this level are kept
in cells for their own well-being.

384
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:16,175
For others it's a refuge
of last resort.

385
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:20,903
What, you mean
some come here, what, voluntarily?

386
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,286
- Does that mean that others are...
- Running free? Absolutely.

387
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:30,395
This isn't a zoo,
and it's certainly not a prison.

388
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:33,074
Yeah, but some of these things,
they look dangerous as hell.

389
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,249
We have a dual obligation.

390
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:39,247
To study the miraculous,
and to protect against the perilous.

391
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,750
Yeah, but...

392
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,274
The dangerous ones.
What's the point of even keeping them?

393
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,662
Every creature
expands our knowledge.

394
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,696
We learn from the deadly
as well as the benign.

395
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,363
How many more are there?

396
00:34:54,015 --> 00:34:54,764
Many.

397
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,773
So I'm guessing few people
have seen what I've just seen.

398
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:02,893
Very few.

399
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,488
How do you keep a secret this big?

400
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:08,075
Very carefully.

401
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:10,819
The survival of my patients
depends on it.

402
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:12,453
Please...

403
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:18,844
It's all right.
It's all right...

404
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,956
He's just as unnerved by you.

405
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:35,466
He's been relatively isolated
since I first treated him.

406
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:39,765
Thank you.

407
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:44,224
No.

408
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,645
That... thing is your patient?

409
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,650
Former patient, actually.

410
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:11,363
After I removed
more than a few bullets from him,

411
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:12,590
he refused to leave,

412
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,221
so I gave him a position
on my staff.

413
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:18,721
I'm not sure he'd appreciate
you calling him a thing.

414
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:25,919
Why me?

415
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,789
Because, Dr. Zimmerman,

416
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,080
I believe there's a vital role
for you to play here.

417
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:34,070
By helping you capture monsters?

418
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,405
We prefer to call them "abnormals".

419
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:39,630
The most important thing

420
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,245
is that my patients have a place
where they can feel safe.

421
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,923
Where we can help them,
learn from them.

422
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:47,386
My head's kind of doing
the backstroke.

423
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,168
Are you offering me a job here?

424
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,686
I'm offering you a chance
to explore a world

425
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,087
that you've been trying
to understand on your own,

426
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:55,860
with very little success.

427
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,898
You find my offer amusing?

428
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,902
- No, it's not that. It's just...
- You're afraid.

429
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:05,893
You work with monsters.

430
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,267
I work with sentient beings,

431
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,270
each worthy of the same respect
that humans,

432
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,545
even animals, receive automatically.

433
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,503
These creatures are the key
to the evolution of our race,

434
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:18,031
past and future,

435
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,199
and yet we revile them,

436
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:21,687
destroy them,

437
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:24,996
and worst of all,
pretend they don't even exist.

438
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:29,145
But they are out there,
Dr. Zimmerman.

439
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,715
Lost, like the child
you saw tonight.

440
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,902
Misunderstood, hunted...

441
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,843
And they need our help.
Your help.

442
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,794
I still don't understand
why you would come to me.

443
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,768
Because I need someone
who can see beyond the surface,

444
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:50,479
see the world as it really is.

445
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:55,026
I profile criminals,
not monsters.

446
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:59,243
You can't see the irony
in that statement?

447
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:01,333
You know what I mean.

448
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,654
You're a student
of the human animal.

449
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,963
You see things,
you read things in behavior,

450
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,541
that I believe cut across the variations
of outward form.

451
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,915
Where others see stubbornness
and failure,

452
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,935
I see great potential.

453
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:19,062
Good doctors come and go,

454
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:23,053
but the great ones have always seen
beyond the boundaries of science,

455
00:38:23,215 --> 00:38:24,589
beyond the known.

456
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,486
The great ones

457
00:38:27,953 --> 00:38:30,721
dare to believe in the unbelievable.

458
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,681
We've found our boy.

459
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:03,618
What happened to those guys?

460
00:39:03,987 --> 00:39:05,200
The boy again?

461
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,047
Seeing as they're alive, I doubt it.

462
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,528
I have my theories.

463
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,202
What I still don't understand is,

464
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:23,491
who tipped you off
that the boy was down here?

465
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:24,409
I did.

466
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:28,072
I've been tracking
the little dweeb all night.

467
00:39:28,192 --> 00:39:30,094
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

468
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,992
- You said you had him.
- I did, until the circus arrived.

469
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:34,762
Still, roughing up two policemen.

470
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:37,169
They were gonna get
themselves killed.

471
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:38,730
Guys?

472
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:55,240
It's okay.

473
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,364
Don't!
We need him alive!

474
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,786
We want to help you.

475
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:17,014
Do you understand me?

476
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:20,814
We're not going to hurt you,
I promise.

477
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:26,470
That's it.

478
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:33,883
Over here.

479
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,179
Over here...

480
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:37,496
Yeah, that's it.

481
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,482
That's it... nice and easy.

482
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:43,400
Any time.

483
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,369
You okay?

484
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:56,876
Yeah, I'm fine.

485
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,502
This chaos was
completely avoidable.

486
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:03,843
These tunnels reek, and I need a bath.
I don't need a lecture.

487
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,481
Seriously, who are you?

488
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:10,977
Dr. Zimmerman, this is Ashley.

489
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,409
My daughter.

490
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:22,316
I get it, all right?

491
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:25,899
Mom, take it easy.

492
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:28,650
All I'm saying is that we could have
better coordinated our efforts.

493
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,906
Again, we got the ghoul, okay?
Take a pill.

494
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:35,479
I apologize for Ashley's
unruly behavior, Dr. Zimmerman.

495
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:39,353
What she lacks in refinement,
she makes up for in her field skills.

496
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,475
Really?

497
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:43,628
Somebody saved your life tonight.

498
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:44,834
Oh, wait!

499
00:41:44,954 --> 00:41:46,789
- That was me.
- Hold still.

500
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:50,440
So I take it you guys do this a lot?

501
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,346
Oh, this is nothing.

502
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:54,955
Hey, Mom, do you remember
the summer I turned 18?

503
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:57,101
We do an entire den of werewolves.

504
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:00,187
You know, as in bag and capture?

505
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:03,360
Sedate and catalogue?

506
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:06,443
It wasn't just me, mom was there, too,
and a few nervous locals,

507
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:09,399
one who seriously looked like
Adrien Brody.

508
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,543
Ashley...

509
00:42:10,663 --> 00:42:12,408
Mom, you thought he was hot, too.

510
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:15,791
Dr. Zimmerman is our guest.
Please bear that in mind.

511
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:19,504
Anyway, we were low on silver tips,
full moon's on the rise...

512
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,249
You're making this up.

513
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:25,322
You got the tour, right?

514
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:26,603
Yeah, but...

515
00:42:26,768 --> 00:42:29,417
There we are, darling.
Good as new.

516
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,882
Thank you.

517
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:34,638
Hate to bleed and run,
but I got to be on the eastside in 20.

518
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,058
For what reason?

519
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,225
Sylvio has some fabulous
new product for me.

520
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:41,758
Top of the line kevlar,
prototype hollow-points,

521
00:42:42,514 --> 00:42:43,689
digital fuses...

522
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:46,490
Actually, I'd prefer it
if you stayed in this evening.

523
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,230
What do you mean?
Why?

524
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:51,030
There's been some fluctuations
in the EM shield.

525
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:53,753
I'm sure it's nothing,
but just to be on the safe side...

526
00:42:53,873 --> 00:42:55,609
But this won't take an hour,

527
00:42:55,778 --> 00:42:58,243
and I promise
I'll grind him down on the price.

528
00:42:58,363 --> 00:42:59,921
We buy in bulk, we save a ton.

529
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,545
We're Sylvio's best customers.

530
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:04,168
His amazing deals
aren't going anywhere, believe me.

531
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,707
It's been a long night, Ashley.
Please.

532
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:09,552
Mom, come on, I'm just...

533
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,887
Okay, Facebook it is.

534
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,210
Nice to meet you.

535
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,202
Keep the ice going.

536
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,268
So she's your daughter?

537
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:27,097
What, did you have her
when you were, like, 12?

538
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:28,751
Very flattering.

539
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:30,104
Adopted?

540
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,779
The details are unimportant.

541
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:37,007
Ashley is my flesh and blood,
and she plays a vital role in my work.

542
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,453
She bags 'em, you tag 'em.

543
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,802
Something like that,

544
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:45,668
but I find it's what happens afterwards
that matters the most.

545
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:53,523
What is that?

546
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:56,954
Massive genetic mutation,
creating a symbiotic appendage.

547
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,388
Whatever it is, it helped him clear
20 feet across an alley earlier tonight.

548
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:04,698
Probably its most benign use.

549
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,204
Such imperfect children
are often adopted

550
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:10,637
by well-meaning
immigrant families.

551
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,071
Some are blind.
Others have deformities, mental illness.

552
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:18,202
I'm sure he seemed perfectly normal
in his photograph, if they even saw one.

553
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,869
What do you intend to do with him?

554
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:23,805
I'll determine
his physiological treatment,

555
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:28,793
but we have no hope of truly helping him
until we gain his trust.

556
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,359
Wait...

557
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:37,921
Is this why...

558
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:44,333
No.

559
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,981
There's nothing in my training
that apply to a patient like this.

560
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:52,234
Your training can't help you here
as much as your intuition can.

561
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:56,296
This is insane.
I can't do this.

562
00:44:56,857 --> 00:44:59,633
What's more terrifying to you,
Dr. Zimmerman?

563
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:02,503
That frightened,
confused boy down there,

564
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,621
or the possibility that you lack
the courage to help him?

565
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:10,586
Tell me,
what do you see when you look at him?

566
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:27,522
Body language is...

567
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:29,463
agitated,

568
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,689
though he's given us no trouble
since he woke up.

569
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:36,032
In fact, the only hostile thing
in that room is that...

570
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,274
- thing.
- Then see beyond it.

571
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:40,942
See the boy.

572
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:44,739
If you can do that,
then you can help him.

573
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:47,678
If not, then so be it.

574
00:45:49,003 --> 00:45:51,614
I'll simply admit
that I was wrong about you.

575
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:03,033
I'll leave it to you.

576
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,544
Release him.

577
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:30,866
Please.

578
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:39,758
Trust me.

579
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:00,920
It's okay.

580
00:47:02,484 --> 00:47:03,607
It's okay.

581
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,327
How you doing?

582
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:14,840
You wanna sit down?

583
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,991
Kind of harsh for a job interview,
don't you think?

584
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,181
Thank you for your opinion, Henry.

585
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,967
I'm just saying, it's a newbie all alone
with the new arrival...

586
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:33,260
- Whom he helped capture.
- Yeah, sure, he might pull it off.

587
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:36,817
You know,
even a blind squirrel can find a nut,

588
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:39,526
or is it monkeys and bananas?
I can never remember.

589
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:41,672
- Do you have what I asked for?
- Yeah.

590
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,868
The analysis of the goop you took
from the cops' frontal lobes?

591
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,108
Check.

592
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:50,192
Not many places you're gonna find
radiation traces that pure.

593
00:47:50,312 --> 00:47:52,375
Mostly former Soviet Republics,

594
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:55,135
but if you match up the mineral traces
in the plutonium sample

595
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:57,794
to known mining operations
in each possible location...

596
00:47:58,557 --> 00:47:59,797
Chernobyl.

597
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:02,925
Only city in the world with more
personal geiger counters than clocks.

598
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:06,474
Many of the survivors of this disaster
moved on and had children.

599
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,596
Yeah, if you can call them that.

600
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,550
Your sensitivity is breathtaking.

601
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,478
The kid sucks brains!

602
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:16,275
- Not that I'm being judgmental.
- Is there anything else?

603
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,115
No, not really.

604
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:20,776
A working girl was found murdered
behind a warehouse

605
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:23,439
down near circle square
about four hours ago.

606
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:24,861
Murdered how?

607
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:27,887
Just your typical old-school stabbing.
No one saw anything.

608
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,619
- Cops are clueless, as usual.
- Send me what you have.

609
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,150
Really? We care about this?
I mean, it's very sad, but...

610
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,486
Send it to me.

611
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,423
Okay, fine.

612
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:42,418
I'll transfer the CCTV footage
from that part of town to the network,

613
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:44,470
which, by the way,
is still fluxing like a bitch.

614
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,580
Did you get the request I sent
for those upgrades?

615
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,987
We'll talk about it.

616
00:48:48,206 --> 00:48:49,298
Okay, fine.

617
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,994
By the way,
if there's a cleanup on aisle 2,

618
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:53,727
I don't wanna know about it.

619
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:06,290
- I thought your mom grounded you.
- She did.

620
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:08,542
I'm just going out to get some...

621
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:11,785
- feminine products.
- Yeah, feminine like a crate of Uzis?

622
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:14,110
Dude, you want me
to get us some toys or what?

623
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,512
- Hey, I never saw you.
- Attaboy.

624
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:21,110
Time out a second!
Time out!

625
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,973
Everyone just calm down.

626
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:26,537
You think that's supposed
to scare me, huh?

627
00:49:26,657 --> 00:49:28,594
Let me tell you something,
you see this guy here?

628
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:32,003
He scares me a hell of a lot more
than you do.

629
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:34,766
No offence.

630
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,074
All right,
let's just calm down, all right?

631
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,976
Will you give us some space here?

632
00:49:44,053 --> 00:49:45,115
It's okay.

633
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,241
Just relax...

634
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:59,790
Okay, how come you're not trying
to eat my brain anymore?

635
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:04,392
I think I'm getting
the hang of things here.

636
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:06,579
The less i'm scared of you,

637
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,056
the less you wanna
snack on my cerebellum?

638
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,723
I'm just gonna put this down.

639
00:50:22,488 --> 00:50:23,951
Do you have a name?

640
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:26,985
Alexei.

641
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:31,168
My name's Will.

642
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:40,995
You wanna tell me
how this all started?

643
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:45,543
I lived in Kiev with parents.

644
00:50:46,932 --> 00:50:49,529
They told me I was not safe.

645
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:53,679
That if people found out
about me,

646
00:50:54,462 --> 00:50:56,047
I would be taken away.

647
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,180
Family adopt me,

648
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,135
bring me here,

649
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:04,936
but they not like me.

650
00:51:05,906 --> 00:51:07,355
Not after...

651
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,629
Wasn't the kind of reception
you were hoping for, huh?

652
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:15,986
They were afraid.

653
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:18,419
I tried to stop it,

654
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:21,915
but only more fear comes.

655
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,071
So the more fear,

656
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,188
the more it comes out?

657
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:36,388
And you can't control it.

658
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:41,101
It's a defense mechanism...

659
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:44,108
with a mind of its own.

660
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:45,731
It is not my fault.

661
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,852
I not want to kill.

662
00:51:49,781 --> 00:51:51,640
No, you just wanna be safe.

663
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:53,945
Listen to me, Alexei.

664
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:55,654
Feeling safe

665
00:51:57,007 --> 00:51:58,811
is something we all need.

666
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,460
That is nothing to be ashamed of.

667
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:06,301
All right?
You're no different than anybody else.

668
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:08,962
You don't fear me?

669
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,851
No.

670
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:26,819
Magnificent.

671
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:25,489
A brain-sucking anaconda
living in his intestinal tract...

672
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:27,807
Sorry I missed it.

673
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,505
Can we get down to business?

674
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:32,263
Come on, now, baby girl,
we're just talking shop.

675
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,262
Sylvio, please.
You're giving yourself an headache

676
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:38,518
trying to figure out how much that kid
is worth on the open market.

677
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:42,420
Just my greedy baseline personality.

678
00:53:42,975 --> 00:53:45,684
Well, you wanna work with us,
you play by our rules, you know that.

679
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:47,362
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:50,067
Look...

681
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:53,775
I'm down with the whole
protect and study thing,

682
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,719
Okay?
Peace, love, and incense...

683
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:03,577
Do I have your attention?

684
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,794
Sylvio, are you okay?

685
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,965
Been better.

686
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:13,080
Gun!

687
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:15,157
Let's go.

688
00:54:17,072 --> 00:54:19,040
Stings like a son of a bitch.

689
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:22,022
- Anyone we know?
- Can't tell yet.

690
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,979
I'll be fine.

691
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:25,100
Go.

692
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,975
- You sure?
- Ash,

693
00:54:27,533 --> 00:54:30,186
I gotta scream like a girl now.
I don't need witnesses.

694
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:31,814
Okay, understood.

695
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,214
Don't do it.

696
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,537
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

697
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,086
If only you knew.

698
00:54:56,818 --> 00:54:58,324
Aren't you a little cold?

699
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:00,701
Opinion seems to be divided.

700
00:55:02,076 --> 00:55:03,374
Care to join me?

701
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:09,121
I'm not usually so good
with heights, but...

702
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:11,725
what the heck.

703
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,624
That is quite a view.

704
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:35,687
I come here to reflect,

705
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:38,010
particularly when I can't sleep.

706
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:42,309
I'm guessing that happens a lot.

707
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:45,095
You're finding all this too much,
aren't you?

708
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,532
I don't know.

709
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:49,090
I think I'm handling the whole...

710
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,701
world-turned-upside-down
thing pretty well.

711
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,448
But you're having a hard time
accepting it.

712
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,006
If you were me, wouldn't you?

713
00:55:58,126 --> 00:55:59,151
I was you,

714
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:01,926
a long time ago.

715
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:07,554
All this is extraordinary.

716
00:56:08,456 --> 00:56:10,328
It's beyond extraordinary.

717
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:12,768
It's just...

718
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:17,802
it's not my world.

719
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:22,344
I'm having a little difficulty
wrapping my head around it.

720
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:27,155
This wasn't an impulse on my part.

721
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:32,017
I've known this was your destiny
since you first came to my attention.

722
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,985
Yeah, since you knocked me down
in an alley.

723
00:56:39,717 --> 00:56:41,651
Since you were eight years old,

724
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:42,898
actually,

725
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,741
when you told the world
a monster killed your mother.

726
00:56:54,803 --> 00:56:56,307
How'd you know about that?

727
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,534
Not that anyone believed you.

728
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:01,394
From then on,
you were the odd one,

729
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:04,799
the strange child who saw
monsters lurking in every shadow.

730
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,426
The boy who cried wolf,

731
00:57:08,546 --> 00:57:11,238
until the fear and mockery
became too much, and you recanted.

732
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,526
You couldn't have seen what you did.
You must have imagined it.

733
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,520
But you didn't imagine it.

734
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:23,374
And that trauma spurred a commitment
to the study of the mind.

735
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,098
You became obsessed with perception.

736
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:30,539
You published papers on how easily
we mistake illusion for reality.

737
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:33,787
It was real...

738
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:41,997
What I saw was real.

739
00:57:44,403 --> 00:57:47,967
The life you've built is the only way
you could make sense of what happened.

740
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:55,068
How can you expect me
to help these creatures,

741
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,474
when one of them...

742
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,498
one of them
took everything from me?

743
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:07,541
Only you can answer that.

744
00:58:11,502 --> 00:58:12,624
You knew.

745
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:16,723
You knew how this would affect me.

746
00:58:20,717 --> 00:58:22,377
It's your choice, Will.

747
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:24,776
In the end, it's...

748
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:27,059
a massive leap of faith.

749
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,591
Come out, you son of a bitch.

750
00:58:58,103 --> 00:58:59,579
You seem very angry.

751
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:02,955
What the hell?

752
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,673
Is it because of your friend?

753
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,588
I don't like people getting spiked
on my watch.

754
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,900
He hardly seems worthy
of your concern.

755
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:48,588
Perhaps I should just
give myself up.

756
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,066
Funny, you don't strike me
as a quitter.

757
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:00,991
That's a...

758
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:04,646
nasty toy for someone your age.

759
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:08,111
It's a present from my mom.

760
01:00:10,795 --> 01:00:12,845
Then you'd better have it back.

761
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:31,089
You're thinking,
"Who is he?"

762
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:33,357
"What is he?"

763
01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:35,176
How will I bring him down?"

764
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:37,429
Actually just focused on
your old man breath.

765
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:39,180
That is some nasty
bridgework, dude.

766
01:00:40,759 --> 01:00:43,209
Ill manners
do not become you, my dear.

767
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:55,521
All right.

768
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:57,462
Enough of this.

769
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:00,368
Let's get it on.

770
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:12,588
You have decent technique.

771
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,801
Completely lacking in discipline,
but impressive enough.

772
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:20,401
Okay.

773
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,056
Who are you?

774
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,610
Just someone new in town.

775
01:01:25,107 --> 01:01:26,157
Beyond that,

776
01:01:26,897 --> 01:01:30,047
I wouldn't want to be the one
to spoil the surprise.

777
01:01:31,116 --> 01:01:31,816
Now...

778
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:35,486
it's time you learned
to respect your elders!

779
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:00,128
Yes, the shield is working.

780
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,460
If it's him, we're safe.

781
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:07,142
Actually, I'm not afraid
of him harming me.

782
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,229
More of what he may do to others,
what he may have already done.

783
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:14,874
If the truth were to come out,

784
01:02:15,952 --> 01:02:18,402
the consequences
would be devastating.

785
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:21,775
Okay.

786
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,255
I grudgingly admit
you've got some game.

787
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,331
I've been following your exploits
for quite some time.

788
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:30,833
You're a very intrepid duo,
you and your mother.

789
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:34,026
Protect the innocent.

790
01:02:34,146 --> 01:02:36,426
Study the bizarre,
the inexplicable.

791
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:39,092
Listen to rants
from violent weirdos.

792
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:41,268
Hazardous work indeed.

793
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:42,777
Hey, buddy...

794
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,230
Nobody spikes my van.

795
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:56,317
Only the chosen left alive,

796
01:02:57,046 --> 01:03:00,262
immortals all, the holy five...

797
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:01,367
Shut up.

798
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,078
Thanks, buddy.

799
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:09,288
Now, he's got to be
worth something.

800
01:03:16,362 --> 01:03:19,694
I'm just saying that if you took the van
every now and then instead of your bike,

801
01:03:19,814 --> 01:03:22,594
I wouldn't have to do retrievals
in the middle of the night.

802
01:03:22,714 --> 01:03:25,229
Well, Henry, the only vans I ride

803
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:28,227
have Lord Poseidon
airbrushed on the side.

804
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,097
What?

805
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,723
Vans are for losers.
I like my bike.

806
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:33,707
Nice.

807
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:37,204
Now, see, he looks
harmless enough.

808
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:39,885
He took 10,000 volts
plus a triple tranq.

809
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:44,351
He is going to have a serious migraine
whenever he does wake up.

810
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:48,121
- So, what do you think this thing is?
- I don't know. Leave that to mom.

811
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,788
All I know is he was a serious handful.
Ask Sylvio.

812
01:03:51,935 --> 01:03:55,085
Sylvio's a baby.
Whined all the way to Dr. Lim's.

813
01:03:55,205 --> 01:03:57,253
A few special herbs and spices,
he'll be fine.

814
01:03:57,748 --> 01:03:58,698
Whatever.

815
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,844
Process the ghoul,
let mom know.

816
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:02,544
Me, I am hitting
the showers.

817
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:03,909
Okay, cool.

818
01:04:04,029 --> 01:04:06,137
Hey, where do you want him?
Gen pop or the Shoe?

819
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,870
I mean, he's going to be asleep
for, like, two days.

820
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,940
The Shoe.

821
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,484
Definitely maximum security
for this guy.

822
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,387
Okay, well,

823
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,846
- enjoy your stay.
- I plan to.

824
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:54,761
Crap.

825
01:04:56,672 --> 01:04:59,499
Seriously, dude, you're on, like, nine
different security cameras right now.

826
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:01,357
There's no way
you're getting out of here.

827
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,727
Oh, I have no intention of leaving.

828
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,090
Now...

829
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:07,643
what section are we in?

830
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:10,004
It seems so

831
01:05:10,124 --> 01:05:11,074
welcoming.

832
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,185
It's where we keep
the bad things.

833
01:05:15,386 --> 01:05:17,036
The worst of the worst.

834
01:05:21,866 --> 01:05:23,548
I like the sound of that.

835
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,260
That'll do.

836
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:45,722
Please...

837
01:05:47,136 --> 01:05:48,386
show me around.

838
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:50,265
Yeah.

839
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:07,592
This is it?

840
01:06:08,826 --> 01:06:09,611
Yes.

841
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:14,182
But all security measures
can be remotely reactivated,

842
01:06:14,302 --> 01:06:17,559
so, really, there's no point in...
wow, okay, we're cool.

843
01:06:19,694 --> 01:06:21,856
This facility is protected
by an energy field, is it not?

844
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:23,827
It's a modified EM bubble.

845
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:26,068
Protects outside interference
from jamming devices.

846
01:06:26,406 --> 01:06:28,644
Is that what she told you
it was for?

847
01:06:28,764 --> 01:06:29,814
Clever girl.

848
01:06:31,346 --> 01:06:32,283
What is it for?

849
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:34,068
Me.

850
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:37,163
- Shut it down.
- That doesn't make any sense.

851
01:06:37,423 --> 01:06:38,831
Shut it down.

852
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:40,622
Okay.

853
01:06:45,729 --> 01:06:46,479
Done.

854
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:51,093
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

855
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:59,031
Ashley...

856
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,313
I know, you told me to stay in.

857
01:07:02,882 --> 01:07:04,532
Where were you tonight?

858
01:07:04,678 --> 01:07:05,828
What happened?

859
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:07,466
Nothing major.

860
01:07:07,814 --> 01:07:10,117
Sylvio and I
ran into a bit of trouble.

861
01:07:10,237 --> 01:07:11,087
Trouble?

862
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,239
Some superfast
psychopathic dude.

863
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:15,821
Nothing we couldn't handle.

864
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:16,891
How fast?

865
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:20,604
Pretty hot moves
for a tall guy.

866
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:23,941
He had a great accent, too.
Kind of like yours, only...

867
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:25,011
more evil.

868
01:07:25,664 --> 01:07:27,129
Stay here, and I mean here.

869
01:07:27,566 --> 01:07:29,745
Relax, Henry put him in the Shoe.
We're fine.

870
01:07:29,865 --> 01:07:31,015
No, we're not!

871
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:32,594
Mom...

872
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,350
Henry...

873
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:43,238
What happened?

874
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,811
Mom, why are you
freaking out?

875
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:52,703
Grab what weapons you can.
We'll need them.

876
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:55,121
No! Not until you tell me
why this ghoul is such a problem.

877
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,091
Because he'll kill us both.

878
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:00,121
He allowed himself to be
captured by you, I'm certain of it.

879
01:08:00,565 --> 01:08:02,873
We may only have
moments before...

880
01:08:03,323 --> 01:08:04,373
Bloody hell.

881
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:06,321
Hello, Helen.

882
01:08:08,689 --> 01:08:09,539
John...

883
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:12,564
It's wonderful to see you again.

884
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:14,621
You know this ghoul?

885
01:08:17,714 --> 01:08:19,816
Your mother and I go way back.

886
01:08:26,098 --> 01:08:27,148
John, don't!

887
01:08:27,306 --> 01:08:28,816
This is about you and me,
not her.

888
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:31,049
For the moment.

889
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:36,246
You have no idea
what it's been like.

890
01:08:37,728 --> 01:08:38,784
Alone...

891
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,116
wandering this
godforsaken world.

892
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:44,732
Wanting only peace.

893
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:49,634
A fragment of what we had.

894
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:53,090
What I lost...

895
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,177
You have nothing to gain
by harming her...

896
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:57,009
or me.

897
01:08:57,129 --> 01:08:59,435
- Mom, shoot him!
- Shall we drop the pretense?

898
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:02,244
You know exactly
why I've come and what I want.

899
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:04,305
It's all within reach,

900
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:05,811
everything
I've ever wanted,

901
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:09,627
and you're going to give it to me,
or she will die.

902
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:10,447
Mom!

903
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:17,072
Oh, bloody hell...

904
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:28,314
Please don't do this.

905
01:09:28,434 --> 01:09:31,043
I don't know much
about your mother's pets,

906
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:33,393
but I would imagine

907
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:36,875
staying very still
would be advisable.

908
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:04,906
Ah, I knew him well.

909
01:10:08,035 --> 01:10:09,185
Where is she?

910
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,630
Where is she?

911
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:14,222
I'd tell you she was safe,

912
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:16,514
but I'd be lying.

913
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,141
No, your scruffy little helper
mentioned something about

914
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:22,888
where the worst of the worst
are kept.

915
01:10:24,022 --> 01:10:25,072
You bastard.

916
01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:28,381
Oh, no doubt she helped capture
whatever is in there.

917
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,645
They can reminisce.

918
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:32,106
- Threatening her...
- Is my only option, Helen.

919
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,016
I can hardly threaten you.

920
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:37,026
Using one of your own...

921
01:10:37,308 --> 01:10:40,058
precious creatures
as the blunt instrument...

922
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:42,503
some of my best work, I think.

923
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,577
I'll get there first.

924
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:47,908
And just put her someplace
more dangerous.

925
01:10:51,677 --> 01:10:53,597
I don't want her to die, Helen,

926
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:57,555
but that is exactly what will happen
if you test my resolve.

927
01:10:57,868 --> 01:11:00,968
There's only one reason
you would have taken this risk,

928
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,340
to risk her.

929
01:11:03,161 --> 01:11:04,611
Because you have to.

930
01:11:06,114 --> 01:11:08,788
- You're dying, aren't you?
- We're all dying.

931
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,973
It simply comes down
to survival,

932
01:11:12,514 --> 01:11:16,150
and I intend to do whatever is
necessary to ensure mine.

933
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,153
- Even if it means killing her?
- Her life is in your hands, Helen.

934
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:22,326
I don't think you want
to lose her over something

935
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:24,533
as easily accessible
as your own blood.

936
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,718
You saved my life once before.

937
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,751
You can do it again.

938
01:11:36,068 --> 01:11:37,618
I can help you, John,

939
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,765
and not by prolonging
this nightmare.

940
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:41,967
I can find a cure.

941
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,719
She clearly doesn't know.

942
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:46,430
How could I possibly tell her?

943
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,040
She must have asked

944
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:50,517
how she came
by her killer instincts.

945
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,562
She thinks her father's dead.

946
01:11:59,589 --> 01:12:01,654
I wonder how she'd feel
to learn the truth?

947
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:04,791
Your mind is poisoned, John,

948
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:06,911
through no fault of your own.

949
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,035
Helen Magnus,

950
01:12:09,003 --> 01:12:11,333
friend to nature's abominations,

951
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,424
and enemy of common sense!

952
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:15,913
Your blood, Helen!

953
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:21,924
Time is growing short.

954
01:12:39,307 --> 01:12:40,985
Okay, so I'm guessing
that's not normal.

955
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:06,579
Find Magnus!

956
01:13:12,342 --> 01:13:13,292
Ashley...

957
01:13:13,482 --> 01:13:14,332
Ashley.

958
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,646
We're going to get you
out of here, right?

959
01:14:06,049 --> 01:14:07,507
How can I be sure?

960
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:10,586
It's mine.

961
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:16,195
Centrifuged.

962
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:17,936
Pure.

963
01:14:42,305 --> 01:14:43,648
Thank you, Helen.

964
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:47,118
You won't regret it.

965
01:14:49,491 --> 01:14:51,614
I'm sorry I can't say
the same for you.

966
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:02,171
Forgive me, John.

967
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:06,052
The five.

968
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,519
The others...

969
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:11,166
will come.

970
01:15:31,997 --> 01:15:33,447
Come on.
We got to go.

971
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:34,950
We got to go.
Come on.

972
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:38,462
Stay in the light!

973
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:42,837
I've got her,
I've got her...

974
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:05,749
Dude, are you nuts?

975
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:08,293
It's a distinct possibility.

976
01:16:16,215 --> 01:16:17,165
Hey, Will.

977
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,880
How you feeling?

978
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:26,168
Fine, it just broke the skin.

979
01:16:28,309 --> 01:16:29,922
So I wanted to say that...

980
01:16:31,164 --> 01:16:33,967
I might've underestimated you...
a little.

981
01:16:36,977 --> 01:16:38,320
Saving my life...

982
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:39,932
was good.

983
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:43,201
Yeah, well...

984
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:44,908
any time.

985
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:47,856
So, we'll see you around?

986
01:16:51,426 --> 01:16:52,611
Honestly, I don't know.

987
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:55,898
You know,

988
01:16:56,374 --> 01:16:58,724
my mom can be
pretty dark and weird,

989
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:01,411
but she's good at this.

990
01:17:04,506 --> 01:17:06,656
And if those are for the Big Guy,

991
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:08,067
he's allergic.

992
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:11,898
Thanks.

993
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:27,187
Two days ago,

994
01:17:28,194 --> 01:17:30,344
you were the stuff
of nightmares.

995
01:17:35,886 --> 01:17:37,955
After my mom was killed, I...

996
01:17:42,477 --> 01:17:43,827
I was terrified...

997
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:48,205
of things that I didn't understand,
things that I...

998
01:17:48,325 --> 01:17:49,875
I couldn't understand.

999
01:17:54,885 --> 01:17:55,835
But now...

1000
01:17:58,498 --> 01:17:59,248
now...

1001
01:18:01,948 --> 01:18:04,182
maybe there is no such thing
as a monster.

1002
01:18:11,384 --> 01:18:12,334
Forget it.

1003
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,074
Just get better, all right?

1004
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:23,499
Will...

1005
01:18:28,397 --> 01:18:29,583
did you just...

1006
01:18:32,729 --> 01:18:35,547
it isn't true.

1007
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:40,302
What?
What's not true?

1008
01:18:41,464 --> 01:18:43,086
There is

1009
01:18:44,435 --> 01:18:45,862
such a thing

1010
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:48,651
as monsters.

1011
01:19:03,074 --> 01:19:04,724
Leaving, Dr. Zimmerman?

1012
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:08,056
How unfortunate.

1013
01:19:14,035 --> 01:19:15,685
What you've built here,

1014
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,770
and the research
that you've done.

1015
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:21,921
30 minutes in that library,

1016
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:26,191
and I got to the bottom of questions
I didn't even have the sense to ask.

1017
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:28,529
Some of the most...
confounding cases

1018
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:30,771
I'd ever worked on
were suddenly...

1019
01:19:32,418 --> 01:19:33,568
crystal clear.

1020
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,620
And yet you're ready
to walk away.

1021
01:19:37,113 --> 01:19:37,963
Just...

1022
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:40,546
just hear me out, please.

1023
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,160
You invited me here
because you said I was a truth-seeker

1024
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:48,852
just like you,

1025
01:19:51,362 --> 01:19:53,208
but I know you've withheld
things from me.

1026
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:57,254
What things, Will?

1027
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,723
It's all right.
You're safe now.

1028
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,230
You were there,

1029
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:18,765
weren't you?

1030
01:20:21,771 --> 01:20:24,221
She was an extraordinarily
brave woman.

1031
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:26,150
She died protecting you
from that creature.

1032
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,326
You could have stopped it!
Done something!

1033
01:20:28,486 --> 01:20:29,736
We tried, Will.

1034
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:31,683
I swear to you, we tried.

1035
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:36,079
It all happened so quickly.
We barely had time to rescue you.

1036
01:20:40,412 --> 01:20:42,747
You couldn't have been
more than, what,

1037
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,197
14?

1038
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:45,855
15 at the time?

1039
01:20:48,183 --> 01:20:49,737
Teenage monster hunter?

1040
01:20:51,384 --> 01:20:52,734
I don't think so.

1041
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:57,034
And then
there's your recent guest, Druitt.

1042
01:20:57,655 --> 01:20:59,774
Turns out that a John Druitt
was one of

1043
01:20:59,894 --> 01:21:03,320
Scotland Yard's prime suspects
in the Ripper case in the 1880s.

1044
01:21:03,724 --> 01:21:04,424
Yes.

1045
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,240
He was my first patient.

1046
01:21:08,307 --> 01:21:09,457
Which means...

1047
01:21:10,467 --> 01:21:13,417
either one or both of you
can travel through time,

1048
01:21:13,676 --> 01:21:17,250
- either that or you're more than...
- I am 157 years old.

1049
01:21:25,655 --> 01:21:28,503
How is any of this possible?

1050
01:21:28,827 --> 01:21:31,223
When you work at the frontiers
of science for as long as I have,

1051
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:33,629
the rewards,

1052
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:35,252
and curses, are...

1053
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:37,640
unexpected.

1054
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,150
My God...

1055
01:21:42,096 --> 01:21:45,744
you treated one of the most notorious
serial killers of all time.

1056
01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:48,197
He wasn't always that.

1057
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:50,379
He was dying.

1058
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:53,955
I gave him my blood
to prolong his life,

1059
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:56,568
but it all went wrong.

1060
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:04,714
Lonely tonight, gentlemen?

1061
01:22:15,783 --> 01:22:17,233
Still at it, Molly?

1062
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:21,315
Mr. Druitt.

1063
01:22:21,993 --> 01:22:23,343
You frightened me.

1064
01:22:24,259 --> 01:22:25,846
No rest for the gifted.

1065
01:22:26,654 --> 01:22:28,728
- You know that.
- Indeed I do.

1066
01:22:29,035 --> 01:22:32,887
You shouldn't be in the habit of
jumping out at the ladies these days,

1067
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:34,563
what with all the troubles.

1068
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,133
What was I thinking?

1069
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,900
- Forgive me.
- John!

1070
01:22:38,756 --> 01:22:40,208
This ends here.

1071
01:22:41,598 --> 01:22:42,476
Helen...

1072
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:46,321
what a lovely surprise.

1073
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:48,005
Molly,

1074
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:50,673
I would like you
to meet my fiancee,

1075
01:22:50,793 --> 01:22:53,096
or should I say former fiancee,
Helen Magnus.

1076
01:22:54,073 --> 01:22:55,961
Dr. Helen Magnus.

1077
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:58,119
Doctor?

1078
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:00,556
I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am.

1079
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:01,700
Well...

1080
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,090
- I'll be on my way.
- Stay.

1081
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:05,681
I insist.

1082
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:07,880
John, let me help you
before you make things worse.

1083
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,750
And how is that possible?

1084
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:11,912
I've already murdered, what,

1085
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:13,450
seven whores?

1086
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,620
How could one more make
the slightest difference?

1087
01:23:17,295 --> 01:23:18,289
Murdered?

1088
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,160
What more have I to lose?

1089
01:23:30,288 --> 01:23:32,490
Your power's driving you mad, John.

1090
01:23:32,855 --> 01:23:34,763
- I can help.
- My power is all I have left.

1091
01:23:36,589 --> 01:23:38,350
Let her go.

1092
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:51,696
As the lady wishes.

1093
01:24:08,364 --> 01:24:12,114
I've spent all the intervening years
trying to undo that mistake.

1094
01:24:14,836 --> 01:24:17,386
He was more
than your patient, wasn't he?

1095
01:24:24,683 --> 01:24:25,637
Ashley...

1096
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:28,469
I kept the embryo frozen
for over a century,

1097
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:31,520
until I could bear
the loneliness no longer.

1098
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:35,355
I brought it to term,
believing John was gone for good.

1099
01:24:36,624 --> 01:24:38,874
I underestimated his determination.

1100
01:24:40,918 --> 01:24:41,668
Okay.

1101
01:24:44,982 --> 01:24:46,121
Here's the deal.

1102
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:51,881
If we're going to work together,
the first rule, the only rule,

1103
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,175
is that you're straight up
with me.

1104
01:24:55,593 --> 01:24:56,997
I've just trusted you

1105
01:24:57,117 --> 01:24:59,806
with my deepest, darkest secret.

1106
01:25:04,092 --> 01:25:05,542
I know, it's just...

1107
01:25:06,956 --> 01:25:09,800
I just know that I've spent
a lifetime living a lie, and...

1108
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,470
I can't do it anymore.

1109
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:13,195
I understand.

1110
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:14,565
No, I'm serious.

1111
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:18,032
You open this place up to me,
every monster, every room,

1112
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:20,900
everything that crawls,
flies, teleports...

1113
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:27,034
If I'm gonna be of any use to you,
I've got to...

1114
01:25:28,275 --> 01:25:31,171
- I've got a lot of catching up to do.
- To say the least.

1115
01:25:37,138 --> 01:25:39,345
You know, I was hoping
that at least you'd be normal.

1116
01:25:39,925 --> 01:25:41,496
I'm sorry to disappoint.

1117
01:25:42,559 --> 01:25:44,097
Is there anything else?

1118
01:25:45,067 --> 01:25:47,017
- Is there health plan?
- No.

1119
01:25:49,138 --> 01:25:52,484
But I can promise you the adventure
of many, many lifetimes.

1120
01:25:57,089 --> 01:25:58,406
Shall we begin?
