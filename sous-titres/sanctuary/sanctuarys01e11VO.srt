1
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:06,873
Freddy, get going.
But stay in the area.

2
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,617
- We'll call when we need.
- Got it.

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,593
Tell me we're good
for battery and drive space

4
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,888
Yeah, we're good. I'm just
cleaning the coffee off the lens...

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,555
- Oh, today!
- Okay, yeah. Yeah, we're good.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,391
- Okay, let's go, let's go.
- All right.

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,725
What about the stuff in the van?
We can't edit without...

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,682
We need to travel light.
This is happening now.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,630
Cops haven't even had time
to set up a perimeter yet.

10
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:29,625
- See what I mean?
- Yeah... Yeah, I do.

11
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:32,520
Maybe there's a reason
why the cops are coming down here.

12
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,830
Like the fact that something
dangerous is going on?

13
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:37,944
- You said some people died, right?
- Right, which means something very cool

14
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,949
and newsworthy is going on,
and whoever gets the exclusive on this

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,100
is gonna be in the driver's seat
for a network job.

16
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,175
Okay, that's really cool,
it's just, you know...

17
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,245
you're a weather girl.

18
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,050
Meteorologist,

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,610
Bill O'reilly started as a weatherman.
Dan Rather was a sportscaster.

20
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:56,990
All you need is one big break.
This, my friend, is mine.

21
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:00,065
- Yeah, but wasn't O'reilly out of...
- Come on!

22
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,047
Amy Saunders,
Channel 13 Eyewitness News.

23
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:04,580
- Can you tell us what happened?
- We don't know anything.

24
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:07,865
- We'll brief you once we know more.
- Rumor is that three people are dead,

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,918
and there have been sightings of a wild
animal of some kind loose in the area.

26
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,190
Can you tell us what happened?
Is the public in danger?

27
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:16,169
- Is this a zoological crisis?
- Look, you'll know when we know, okay?

28
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:20,294
Now, back off, both of you. This area
is off-limits effective immediately.

29
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,380
Keep the camera rolling.

30
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:26,500
- I don't want to miss anything.
- I'm getting everything. Don't worry.

31
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,160
How do you know
there's another way into this place?

32
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:30,285
Crap.

33
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:33,580
So... okay.

34
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,985
I don't know about this, Amy.
This is...

35
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:39,303
Oh, sweet bike.

36
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,770
These warehouses are all interconnected
by a rail system.

37
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:46,868
All we need to do is to get into one
before the cops cordon them all off.

38
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:48,435
Like so.

39
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:50,655
Like so.

40
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,765
- And hello, Pulitzer.
- I don't know, Amy.

41
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:59,511
Look, I'm just saying
if there's a wild animal in here,

42
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,809
shouldn't we wait till we know
more about the situation?

43
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:05,120
By the time the cops get their act
in gear, the story will be over.

44
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:08,030
We get the jump on this,
we could make the 11:00 broadcast.

45
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:11,249
But what if it's a hostage situation,
or like, or something like that,

46
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,138
or, like, a mad bomber or something,

47
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,425
and like, the cops are just using
the wild animal story as a cover?

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,575
Maybe dudes from homeland security are
coming, because this is a terrorist...

49
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,952
Would you relax?

50
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:25,115
I've been monitoring the police band
since the first 911 call.

51
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,870
Witnesses said some kind
of lizard or something

52
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:31,045
escaped from a cargo ship
and attacked some people.

53
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,150
So we get the exclusive footage
on the recapture,

54
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,010
I get a promotion, you get a raise.

55
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,544
I don't want a raise, Amy!
I want to live!

56
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,465
Seriously, Zach, just man up, okay?
We'll be fine.

57
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,130
Holy...

58
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,255
Holy crap!

59
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,230
- This is...
- Just keep recording.

60
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,757
- Are you...
- Keep recording.

61
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,890
I'm going to keep recording.
There's dead people.

62
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,865
I'm going to keep recording.

63
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,285
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god...

64
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,025
That guy's totally...

65
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,675
Amy, he's...

66
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:03,905
Holy...

67
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:08,695
Holy...

68
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,614
Oh, my god!

69
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:13,565
What was that?

70
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:16,265
Amy, that was not
a zoo creature, or...

71
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,436
I don't know what that was.
That was something different.

72
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:22,040
- What was it?
- I know, I know, I don't know.

73
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:26,015
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but it knows we're here.

74
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:29,249
The Team Projet-SG

75
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,542

79
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,740
We're going to leave now, right?
I don't need a science degree

80
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,400
to figure out that the thing that we saw
is what killed those people.

81
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,865
Zach, just calm down.
We don't know what we saw.

82
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,940
Yes, we do. We saw
three extremely dead dudes

83
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:09,800
and something
that looked like a giant...

84
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,650
I don't know what, like,
an insect or something!

85
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:16,030
Look, whatever is going on here,
it's bigger than we first thought.

86
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,500
The higher the body count,
the better chance whatever we file

87
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,426
will get picked up nationally,
so just grow a pair, will you?

88
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,495
Shut up!
Both of you, shut up!

89
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,595
- How did you get in here?
- It was her idea.

90
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,540
We're with Channel 13.
Please don't hurt me.

91
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,815
You're both gonna die
if you don't get out right now.

92
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,910
- There's something in here.
- I know, I know, we saw it.

93
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,450
What the hell is it?

94
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:46,325
I don't know, but it killed
three of us before, he didn't blink.

95
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:49,440
It got three of my buddies, too,
who tried to stop it.

96
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:52,015
Okay, seriously,
we are so out of here.

97
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,470
I've been watching it.

98
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,245
It can only focus on
one target at a time.

99
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,080
Now, the only chance you have

100
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:01,590
is if I give it something to chase
instead, do you understand?

101
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,890
- No, we're not leaving.
- Yes, yes, we are, thank you.

102
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,465
- You see that door over there?
- Yeah.

103
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:11,910
You go for it like a bat out of hell
when I give it the distraction, okay?

104
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,785
Wait for my mark.
Ready?

105
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:17,961
Go, go, go!

106
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,585
Hey, over here!

107
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:33,435
- Oh, my god!
- Zach, tell me you got that.

108
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,775
Amy, come on!

109
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,975
Get off me!

110
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,035
Oh, my god!

111
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,310
- Are you okay?
- Are you insane?

112
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,385
- Clear! Henry!
- I'm on it.

113
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,689
- Are you two all right?
- No!

114
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm not sure if it was a direct hit,
but it's gone for now. Ashley's...

115
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,510
- What is this? What's with the camera?
- What did you do to it?

116
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,650
A short-wave sonic weapon.
I haven't met a creature

117
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,290
that likes getting hit with it...
when it works.

118
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:05,365
Who are you two?
Journalists?

119
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:06,910
We're with Channel 13.

120
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,260
- I'm...
- Amy Saunders.

121
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,770
"Weekend Weather Watch with
the fabulous Amy." I love your show.

122
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,790
I mean, I watch it, when I can.

123
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,353
- You're a weather girl?
- Meteorologist.

124
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,625
Almost. You're actually short
a few credits, so...

125
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,168
Sorry.
Where are we going?

126
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:27,275
Still no sign of it,
except for three more KIAs.

127
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,439
Do you mind getting that camera
out of my face?

128
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:30,914
Yeah, sure, sorry.

129
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:34,620
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Who the hell are you guys?

130
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,880
I mean, I've never heard of
a sonic super... whatever.

131
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,210
What are you, Federal law enforcement?
Military intelligence?

132
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,580
- Magnus, they can't...
- Listen, you two can't stay here.

133
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,847
- It's an extremely unstable situation.
- I told you!

134
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:50,534
- Why? What's going on?
- For God's sake, stop filming us!

135
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,950
- You don't understand what's going on.
- I'm a journalist,

136
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:56,024
and he will stop filming
when I say so, not you.

137
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,660
- People have a right to know the truth.
- Not this truth.

138
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,810
If you guys stick around,
it'll get messy, trust me.

139
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,070
Look, we can't baby-sit them.
It's too dangerous.

140
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,850
We tranq 'em, stuff 'em in a crate.
Wake them when we're done.

141
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,390
- I'm right here. I can hear you.
- We can't do that.

142
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,740
We'd leave them vulnerable
if we leave them on their own.

143
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:14,200
Excuse me, Men in Black, you can't
drug us, and you can't kick us out.

144
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,710
Okay, whatever you people are up to,
we want in.

145
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,385
Why? So it can end up
on the 11:00 news?

146
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,250
- You want to catch this thing, right?
- Yeah.

147
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,660
We just want to document it, okay?

148
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,250
We will give you all the footage
when this thing is over, I promise,

149
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,525
but don't cut us out of the plan.

150
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,850
You film what I tell you to film,
nothing more.

151
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,450
Fail to play by my rules,
and you will be left on your own.

152
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,875
- Understood?
- I'm down with that.

153
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,530
- Hold on a second, we can't just...
- We don't have a choice.

154
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:48,460
Escorting them out wastes precious time,
plus I don't think they'd go quietly.

155
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,890
- Definitely not.
- This is crazy. It's crazy.

156
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:52,570
Henry, do we have a fix?

157
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:55,245
Yeah, hold still, everyone.
I'm scanning.

158
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,360
Okay, I have movement.

159
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,730
It's moving out of range fast.

160
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,205
Southwest corner.

161
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:06,250
- You guys know what this thing is.
- Just let us do our jobs, please.

162
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,790
- Henry, how long do you need to set up?
- I don't know.

163
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,160
There's so many places in here
I could set up a shock-web.

164
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:14,437
Henry... Just tell us what you need
and a time frame.

165
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,930
Here. Here, by this crane.
Just give me two minutes to set it up,

166
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,130
then you send it running in here,
it's game over.

167
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,350
Cool.
Two minutes coming up.

168
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,805
Motion sensor.
Thank you.

169
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,945
Who are you guys?

170
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,625
Amy, we'll explain what we can.

171
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,806
We're a private research facility.

172
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:40,145
What are... What are those for?

173
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:43,849
That's super cool stuff, though.

174
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:48,155
Those little, like...
blow-uppie things or something?

175
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,355
Cool...

176
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:50,605
Is that...

177
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,330
Is that what you guys do, though?
You hunt things, like that thing?

178
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:58,105
Because that is some seriously
hardcore equipment you guys got.

179
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:03,255
You're just mapping out
where the bombs are going to go?

180
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:07,045
Could you maybe go film something else
while I do this, please?

181
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,355
Thank you.

182
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,025
It's my first real mission, you see?

183
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,290
I want to get out in the field
since I got this job, and, truthfully,

184
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,850
I just don't want to blow it.
You know what I mean?

185
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,860
Yeah, I know what you mean, dude.
That's cool. I'm just saying,

186
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,228
whatever your job is, you can...

187
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:38,160
I can't tell you that, bro.

188
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,285
Excuse me.

189
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:42,745
I don't even...

190
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,355
This is insane.

191
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:48,855
Okay, doc, we're ready to go.
Shock-web is hot.

192
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,640
Let's hope this works.
I don't know how much time we have

193
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,383
- before the police begin investigating.
- Three dead that they know of.

194
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:58,020
Once they trace the killings here,
they'll cordon off the area,

195
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:59,850
and bring in SWAT
to secure the building.

196
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,180
I'd say we have 20,
maybe 30 minutes, tops

197
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,400
before the window
of opportunity closes.

198
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,005
Opportunity for what?

199
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,950
Capturing it alive.

200
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,425
- What?
- Let's take cover.

201
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,375
Ready, Zach?

202
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,825
Ashley, we're ready.
Send it our way.

203
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:24,985
<i>Making it happen.</i>

204
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,885
Okay, it is pissed!

205
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:38,679
Are you sure?

206
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,005
Holy crap!

207
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:48,665
- Zach, you good?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

208
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,525
What happened? Did you get it?

209
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,950
Not exactly.

210
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:55,260
I can't believe that thing
shook off 100,000 volts.

211
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,915
So it didn't work.
What does that mean?

212
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,880
It means this creature's far more
powerful than we thought.

213
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,965
Oh, yeah?
So, what's plan B?

214
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,265
We're working on it.

215
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,075
Zach, come here.
Sit down.

216
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,475
- Can you give me my stuff?
- Yeah, okay, just hold on.

217
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,485
I just gotta get this...

218
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,405
- Here.
- Thank you.

219
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,305
Listen to me.

220
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,560
We got some really
cool footage, okay?

221
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,410
Probably enough to get us
a promotion and all that,

222
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,520
but can we just get the
hell out of here now?

223
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,330
Oh, Zach... Zachie.

224
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,135
These people are far more
than research scientists.

225
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,225
Oh, god...

226
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:54,815
- Zach...
- What?

227
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,325
This is another man's blood

228
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,650
- on my face.
- Yeah, I know. It's disgusting.

229
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,575
It makes me want to throw up.

230
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:04,825
Anyway...

231
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,885
They knew this thing was in here,

232
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,210
- and they came prepared.
- Not really.

233
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:13,145
That shock thing totally blew up,
and it got away.

234
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:15,530
Yeah, well, the point is they...

235
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:18,420
are part of the story now too,
not just the creature.

236
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:21,445
We need to learn
as much about them as we can.

237
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,310
Yeah, but you said you were going to
give the footage back to Dr. Magnus.

238
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:27,170
Yeah, I told her that just so
she wouldn't toss us out of here.

239
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:30,655
Oh, great. So,
now you're totally playing her?

240
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:31,885
Look...

241
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:37,060
We get footage of them
bagging this thing,

242
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:40,675
and sell it to the highest bidder,
this is brangelina money, okay?

243
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:44,605
- This is way bigger than we thought.
- You've got to be kidding me.

244
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:47,285
Look,

245
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,079
government black ops, military,

246
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,820
private security firm,

247
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:55,505
whatever these people do for a living,
they want to keep it a secret.

248
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,395
Well, maybe they're playing us,
you think of that?

249
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:03,635
And they're going to kill us after we're
done recording their little documentary?

250
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:07,585
- You should be rolling on this.
- Yeah, I know. Okay.

251
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,250
- Zoom in!
- This is just... This is too crazy.

252
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,160
Well, we have plenty of firepower.
We can always fall back on that.

253
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,560
It's definitely larger and faster
than I'd anticipated.

254
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,995
Yeah, and more dangerous,

255
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,060
but I'm guessing
you still want to take it alive.

256
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:21,050
It's incredibly valuable intact.

257
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,780
If we can do it without more collateral
damage, I think we should try.

258
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:24,905
And if not?

259
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,005
People are dead.
If we have to, we kill it.

260
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:32,255
Okay, good,
we have a plan B. I feel better.

261
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,770
Okay, so how do you want
to bag this thing in one piece?

262
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,390
I mean, I'd amp up the shock-web again,
but the thing's totally fried.

263
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:41,140
And the sonic's broken.
Again.

264
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,300
Dude, I told you
it needed better shielding.

265
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:45,580
Yeah, which messes with
the weight balance ratio.

266
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:47,725
- Ash, we've...
- Don't move! It's right behind you!

267
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,105
Where it is? Where?
Tell me where?

268
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,150
Please don't eavesdrop
like that again.

269
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:58,475
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to.

270
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,545
I hate you!

271
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,230
Go with tranq rounds only.
Everyone's armed. You too, Will.

272
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,260
We hit it enough times,
we should bring it down.

273
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:10,840
Failing that, the gloves come off,
and we switch to live ammo.

274
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,285
Two teams. Ashley and Henry
take the journalist,

275
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,050
- Will and I will take the cameraman.
- Who will keep taping.

276
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,095
Absolutely.
If we do have to kill it,

277
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,740
I want as much detailed footage
of its anatomy as possible.

278
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,640
Thorax and mandible, preferably.

279
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,545
Also images of its pincers
and anterior skeletal protrusions

280
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,030
would be very helpful.

281
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:30,785
Yeah, mandibles.
What... What's a... a pincer?

282
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:34,355
Dude, got a 9000-pound camera here.

283
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:36,955
Just...

284
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,600
It looks like a giant
cockroach or something.

285
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,055
Gorgeous, isn't it?

286
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:44,855
The theoretical name is
<i>Blattella Asahinai Sapien</i>,

287
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,670
an extremely rare species

288
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,525
found on islands
off the coast of Japan and Korea.

289
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:52,470
Supposed to possess
physiological attributes

290
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,725
dating back to the paleozoic era.

291
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,785
What, like dinosaurs?

292
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:59,435
Try 150 million years earlier.

293
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:02,400
Its biological makeup
could offer new insights

294
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,135
into our genetic building blocks.

295
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,605
Yeah, but it killed,
like, five people.

296
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,670
Well, taken from
their natural surroundings,

297
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,160
even the most docile creatures
become aggressive,

298
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,180
especially when they're trapped.

299
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,425
Battery warning light.

300
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,985
Just give me a second, guys.

301
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:21,355
So how did it get from
some island in Japan to here?

302
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:22,730
We don't know.

303
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,920
We got just word that someone
was trying to smuggle

304
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,725
- a rare abnormal into the country.
- A what?

305
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:29,055
Creature.

306
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:33,145
By the time we got here, it had already
broken loose and attacked people.

307
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,360
Who managed to capture one?
Those are totally vicious aliens,

308
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,235
like in the movies,

309
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,875
which I used to think were awesome.

310
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:42,645
Not anymore, though.

311
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,625
It's freezing in here.

312
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,715
Careful.

313
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,645
It's not in there.

314
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:15,985
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting this.

315
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,355
Cool.

316
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,655
Looks like it made a nest in here.

317
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:24,225
A chrysalis of some kind.

318
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,545
Likely to keep itself safe
while it traveled,

319
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,335
but why wait until the journey's over
to break out?

320
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,495
Maybe whoever captured it,
drugged it.

321
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,730
It wakes up here,
gets mad and busts out

322
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,175
before anyone can take
possession of the cargo.

323
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,035
But it had time to build
a safe traveling environment.

324
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,255
- It's odd.
- Yeah, totally.

325
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:50,325
It's kind of cool, though.
Looks like that stuff from ghostbusters.

326
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,555
<i>Mom?</i>

327
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,890
Go, Ashley.

328
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,700
<i>Henry's been monitoring
police chatter.</i>

329
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,230
<i>The area's secured,
and SWAT is 15 minutes away.</i>

330
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,990
- <i>Window's closing.</i>
- We gotta go.

331
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:04,430
Meet us back in engine repair.
I've something for Henry

332
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,545
- to run through the mobile lab.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

333
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:11,815
So, like,

334
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,305
choppers are coming in,
and that's it, we're done, right?

335
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:18,250
With the choppers coming?
You should, like, team up with...

336
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,100
Hey! Quit it with the yabbering.

337
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,845
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sorry. Sorry.

338
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:26,500
They have a full tactical unit inbound.
Building will be the first they sweep.

339
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,360
Once they arrive, how long
before they breach our perimeter?

340
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,910
10 minutes, tops.
We don't have time to screw around.

341
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,475
- Go, Zach.
- Don't plan to.

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,844
What does that mean?

343
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,985
I think the battery's
loose on this...

344
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,005
- What?
- Come here.

345
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,485
- What?
- What did you find out?

346
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:03,820
It made a nest, and it's supposedly
older than a dinosaur or something,

347
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,595
and it's from Japan.

348
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,865
About them.

349
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:13,855
I don't know. They're cool,
and they're smart,

350
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:17,785
- and the blonde one is totally hot.
- Zach, you are completely useless.

351
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,560
Amy, I'm a camera tech,
not a war correspondent, okay?

352
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,100
Why not cut me a little slack,
because, under the circumstances,

353
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,190
I'm doing a pretty good job
of holding this all...

354
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:26,865
I'm sorry. You're great.

355
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,700
Just calm down.

356
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,885
I'm calmed down.

357
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,355
Follow me.
I will show you how it is done.

358
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:39,365
Let's see.

359
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,017
Hey, Early, how is it going?

360
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,415
- It's Henry.
- Right.

361
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,215
Is this really your first mission?

362
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:56,875
Because you seem awfully
calm and confident,

363
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:00,795
and look at all this amazing
technology you've designed...

364
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,390
Okay, so I know what you're doing,
because you know I'm a big fanboy, and

365
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:09,030
you're using your feminine wiles so that
I tell you things I can't tell you, but

366
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,555
I can't tell you.

367
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,405
- That obvious, huh?
- Just a tad.

368
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:16,665
Look, this is a big
opportunity for me.

369
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:19,205
So...

370
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:28,785
Lot of... bullets.

371
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,395
So...

372
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,150
You're the tech support guy
for the team?

373
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,335
Pretty much.

374
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:40,425
Tied to a lab, watching
everyone else get the glory.

375
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,745
Look, I just want to prove
that I can do this, that's all.

376
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,205
That's all I'm trying to do, too.

377
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,420
Do you honestly think I want to be

378
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:53,835
"Weather watch with fabulous Amy"
for the rest of my life?

379
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,805
I want to be taken seriously
as a journalist,

380
00:19:58,005 --> 00:19:59,005
and...

381
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,035
that's why I took this chance.

382
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:05,280
And if all that happens to this footage
is that it ends up in a drawer

383
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,240
somewhere in your lab, then, fine,

384
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:10,235
but at least I know that it exists,

385
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:13,030
and that I had the guts
to follow my instincts,

386
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:14,155
you know?

387
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,825
So I'm analyzing the organic compound
found in the creature's nest,

388
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,370
see if I can find a chemical signature
so that we can trace it

389
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,105
a little more accurately.

390
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,675
Cool, so, when you catch it...

391
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:36,510
Is your facility
or your headquarters far away?

392
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,485
I mean, are you guys local?

393
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,815
I really do like your show.
I watch it all the time.

394
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:43,365
Do you mind?

395
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,960
That was you showing
me how it was done.

396
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,085
Mom...

397
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,096
He's alive, but he's not well.

398
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:58,673
- That's the guy from before!
- You know him?

399
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,545
Yeah, when we were first in here.
He helped us.

400
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:04,570
- We thought he was...
- He's lost a lot of blood.

401
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:08,205
There could be spinal damage.
We can't move him until I know more.

402
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:12,150
- How long until the scanner's ready?
- Two minutes. Almost done calibrating.

403
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,390
Non-fatal wounds
to the shoulder and knee.

404
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:16,190
Why would it leave him alive?

405
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:19,685
Maybe it didn't want to kill,
just disable what it viewed as a threat.

406
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:23,335
Let's stop playing games.
Let's take this thing down.

407
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,240
- Don't move, you're safe.
- You're okay, you're okay.

408
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,365
He isn't.

409
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:30,110
Sorry, it's just,
why lie to the guy?

410
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,375
Is it... Is it still in here?

411
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:36,985
For now it's keeping its distance.
We may have frightened it into hiding.

412
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,315
You won't stop it.

413
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,205
It moves too fast.

414
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:45,385
Did it attack you for any reason?
Did you provoke it?

415
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:48,475
Run, hide,

416
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:51,405
fight, it doesn't matter, man.

417
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,635
It doesn't make any difference.

418
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,565
It's not hiding from us.

419
00:21:58,765 --> 00:21:59,875
No, it's...

420
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,245
It's watching us right now.

421
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,485
It's learning.

422
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,201
I don't see it!

423
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,705
Ashley, stay with him.

424
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,236
Zach, come on.

425
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,065
- Rolling?
- Amy, I'm rolling. Don't worry.

426
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,030
Chemical signatures
all over the place.

427
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:27,780
The chrysalis it made is preventing
a clear lock. Plus it could have left

428
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:31,235
- more residue in places around here.
- Can you refine the signal?

429
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:33,495
Not on the fly, no.

430
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,095
You can't find it?

431
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,530
I thought you knew
what you were doing.

432
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:41,045
We do. It's a matter of being prepared
for the unexpected.

433
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,460
- See what I mean?
- What the hell just happened?

434
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:47,420
You think the cops
turned off the power?

435
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,949
They have no reason to. As far as
they know, this isn't a hostage crisis.

436
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,225
Turn on your on-board light.

437
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,205
Will, get them out of the way!
Henry, covering fire!

438
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,287
All right, come on. Let's go!

439
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:10,405
- Let's go, now, come on.
- All right, all right.

440
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,480
- Are you okay?
- Did you see that thing?

441
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,935
- It was right on top of us!
- Are you injured?

442
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,615
No, I think...
I think I'm all right.

443
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,745
It's okay. You're okay.

444
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,635
It's just waiting for us!

445
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:33,985
Look at me, look at me.
You're okay.

446
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:36,825
It was just...

447
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:40,360
- It was just waiting for us.
- I know. It's going to be okay.

448
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,955
It's going to be okay.

449
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,960
- Did you... Did you get any footage?
- Are you kidding me?

450
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,795
I almost dropped a deuce on myself
when the lights went off.

451
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,385
- That was interesting.
- Good shooting, Henry.

452
00:23:57,275 --> 00:24:00,275
- What happened?
- We winged it with a couple of tranqs.

453
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:02,170
Do you think it's unconscious?

454
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:04,775
To be honest,
I think we just made it angrier.

455
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,010
It definitely wasn't the cops
who cut the lights.

456
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:17,855
It's an insect. It can't know
how to work an electrical panel. Can it?

457
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,295
Even if they can,
why kill the power?

458
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,455
Because it sees better in the dark.

459
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:24,665
Dammit.

460
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,245
Sorry.

461
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:30,941
I've stabilized him for now,
but we need to get him to the Sanctuary

462
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,485
as soon as possible.

463
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:36,205
- None of this is going how we planned.
- No kidding.

464
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:38,340
Can you can
the commentary for a while?

465
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm just saying, this thing's owned
our asses so far, man.

466
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,955
As much as we'd love to blow its ass
to kingdom come, it's not cooperating.

467
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,675
I'm just trying
to find a logic pattern.

468
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,935
Somebody brings this thing here,

469
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,820
it gets free, and kills,
what, six people?

470
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:55,670
And it's remarkably intelligent.

471
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,520
And none of the perimeter alarms have
been tripped since we set them up.

472
00:24:58,645 --> 00:24:59,895
Why not escape?

473
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:03,145
It's not exactly like
we're holding the line.

474
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,730
- It's not trying to leave.
- Exactly.

475
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,235
Which makes me wonder,
why this warehouse?

476
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:11,820
- Why make this its turf?
- Yeah, why not go tearing through town

477
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,235
on some huge killing spree
or something?

478
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:17,550
There was a shipping tag on
the container it made its chrysalis in.

479
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:20,020
If we can find out who brought it,
we might be able to find out

480
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,460
- how they captured it.
- Warehouse manifest.

481
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:25,070
Should be in one of those offices
on the other side of the building.

482
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,250
All right, you three go.
Find out what you can.

483
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,190
I need to get this man
ready for transport.

484
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,995
I can take him in the van.

485
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,365
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

486
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,880
you guys need to finish this.

487
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,865
I've had my fun.
We got to get this dude out of here.

488
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:40,325
Thank you, Henry.

489
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:42,855
You sure you want to stay?

490
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,605
You need the footage,

491
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:51,475
and a reporter never abandons
her cameraman.

492
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,030
We're just going to go to the control
office, or whatever, right?

493
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,929
Like, not find more nests.

494
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,245
Yeah, that's the plan.

495
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,125
Let's do it.

496
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:05,715
Be careful.

497
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,715
- What...
- Check inside there.

498
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,975
What are we looking for?

499
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,780
We are looking for something that might
tell us how to stop that thing.

500
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,005
Right, cool.

501
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,435
Is there anything?

502
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,715
I don't know.
You keep asking me questions.

503
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:42,075
Sorry.

504
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:46,110
I know this is probably the worst timing
in the history of the world,

505
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:49,120
but, you know, is there any way
that you and I could go out, you know,

506
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:51,220
for something to eat, or a drink,

507
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:54,045
or, like, a matcha or
something like that?

508
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:55,515
Tea?

509
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,025
I'm flattered...

510
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:01,025
Zach, right.

511
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,755
I don't...
I don't go out on dates...

512
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,475
much.

513
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:08,430
I know, me neither.
I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

514
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:11,405
It's just the possibility
of me dying, just...

515
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,360
It always just brings out
the desperado in me.

516
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:16,295
Right. Raincheck?

517
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:19,345
Yeah, great. Great, so...

518
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,075
You're not a vegetarian, are you?

519
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:27,170
Why, what are you...
What are you thinking?

520
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:30,190
I was thinking, like... You know, maybe
like some Kobe beef or something.

521
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,715
- Steaks.
- Yeah.

522
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,235
Or...

523
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:38,845
- I think I got something here.
- Oh, good. You found something.

524
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,610
The crate we found
the chrysalis in was

525
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:47,230
one of two items registered
to the Japanese Vessel Miyazaki,

526
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:48,655
out of Hokkaido.

527
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,265
The other is a container
full of medical supplies.

528
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:56,065
No export company
or local receiver listed.

529
00:27:57,105 --> 00:27:58,355
Location?

530
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:01,835
Section 12?

531
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:05,135
Peachy.

532
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:14,845
This way.

533
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,015
Sorry.

534
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,165
Scratched.

535
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:49,975
I guess we're not the only ones
who are curious about what's in here.

536
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:53,935
Wild.

537
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:58,695
You want to use your special
lock-picking skills?

538
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,610
Stand back.

539
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:03,295
Cover Zach.
Zach, stay back.

540
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,505
- Back.
- All right, all right. I'll stand back.

541
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:09,825
- Ears.
- Ready?

542
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,485
That's...
That's a gun.

543
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,775
Nicely done.

544
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,215
What...

545
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:42,585
is that?

546
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:47,145
Maybe it's a bomb.

547
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,925
I don't think we can move this.

548
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:06,825
Then let's open it.

549
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,635
I can peg that.

550
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:11,845
Round 2.

551
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:16,355
- Ears.
- Okay. Sure.

552
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,195
- Take my flashlight?
- Sure, yeah.

553
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:34,225
Two, three...

554
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,405
What? Flashlight.

555
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:51,255
That's wild...

556
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,355
I guess now we know
why it doesn't want to escape.

557
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,185
It's protecting its young.

558
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,782
Oh, my camera's...
No, don't!

559
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:10,650
What are those things?

560
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,055
- Insect embryos.
- Size large.

561
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,820
No wonder it's pissed.

562
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:18,430
So they're like tiny scary insect
creatures waiting to be born?

563
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,180
That's just so gnarly...

564
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:24,045
So someone finds the creature's eggs,
steals them and bags the mom.

565
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:28,355
Who else would know about this?
This is an extremely rare species.

566
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:31,605
- The Cabal.
- Who?

567
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:35,860
They'd smuggle something like this
into the country for their own research.

568
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,810
Which would not be
for the common good.

569
00:31:37,935 --> 00:31:39,975
This is just so 007.

570
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,600
Seriously, do you have
any more openings in your office,

571
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,895
'cause I am totally down with this.

572
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:46,375
Serious.

573
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:49,795
I'm guessing that creature
wasn't captured at all.

574
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,620
It stowed away on that ship.
It followed these here out of pure...

575
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,294
Maternal instinct, yeah.

576
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:58,110
I guess the lucky thing is it's still
pretty early in the development cycle.

577
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,290
I doubt
they're anywhere near maturity.

578
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:02,280
Unless their cycle is super fast.

579
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:04,790
I'm sure this is probably
a really cool find, or whatever,

580
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:06,910
but if that thing wants to
protect its kids so bad,

581
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:09,375
shouldn't we get the hell
out of here right now?

582
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,735
Magnus has to see this.

583
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:14,200
She'll light up like
it's Christmas morning.

584
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:15,645
Your mom is weird.

585
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:17,750
No, like, cool, like,

586
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:20,329
"Whoa, so cool" weird...

587
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:22,345
- Sorry.
- <i>Ashley!</i>

588
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:28,215
- What's up?
- <i>Get back here immediately.</i>

589
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,535
Let's go, guys.

590
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,575
Stay close, stay close!

591
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,880
- He's having a seizure!
- Henry, sedative!

592
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,611
- Just hang on.
- Oh, come on! Come on!

593
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,679
Quick, quick.

594
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,105
Oh, my God...

595
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,045
Oh, my God.

596
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,855
His vitals were stable.

597
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:10,340
We were just about to move him.

598
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,530
He suddenly went
into anaphylactic shock.

599
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:13,699
Come on!

600
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:16,550
He was attacked by the creature.

601
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:20,145
It probably caused more than external
trauma. Look at the symptoms.

602
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:22,045
A neurotoxic venom.

603
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,045
Oh, that's great.

604
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,210
It's not just a bug, it's a...

605
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:28,260
giant poisonous bug!

606
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,945
That's great, that's just great.

607
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:34,635
He just...

608
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,265
That thing could do that
to all of us.

609
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:42,275
I'm sorry.

610
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:45,245
Did you think
this was some kind of game?

611
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:49,445
That you could just come here and film
some wild event, and then, what,

612
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:52,565
enjoy cocktails
at some award ceremony?

613
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,535
I've never seen anyone die before.

614
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,535
This is what you came for.

615
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:05,145
This is crazy.

616
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,830
Okay, forget about capturing it alive.
How do we kill it?

617
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:13,760
Actually, capturing it alive
is exactly what we're going to do.

618
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,390
- Come on.
- Mom, come on,

619
00:34:15,515 --> 00:34:17,810
I know you want this badly,
but really...

620
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:19,770
It's time to bring
the hammer down, big time.

621
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:21,180
We don't have to.

622
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:23,986
It wants to protect its young.
I say we let it.

623
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:28,210
- We leave the embryos exposed.
- Draw mom into the kids club.

624
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:29,745
Lock the door on it.

625
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,810
Presto, we got built-in
secure transport.

626
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:32,935
Exactly.

627
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,875
Yes! This is so freaking cool.

628
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:39,955
<i>Nothing.</i>

629
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:43,340
- You're getting this, right?
- Yeah, yeah,

630
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,958
don't worry,
I got a perfect view from here.

631
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:52,025
I'm glad you like my show.

632
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:54,875
Yeah, it's good.
You should be proud.

633
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:57,795
So should you.

634
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:00,585
Is this thing coming, or what?

635
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,215
Just give it time.

636
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,440
Once I had this mouse in my apartment,
so I set a bunch of traps for it,

637
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,360
but I never caught it, 'cause it was,
like, this super genius mouse...

638
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,460
- Zach, please.
- Sorry, Dr. Magnus,

639
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,880
- it's just, what is this thing?
- Dude,

640
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:19,080
- just chill out.
- I'm sorry, dude.

641
00:35:19,205 --> 00:35:22,475
I'm just a little stressed out
right now. There's a monster.

642
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,555
<i>Mom, we have a problem.</i>

643
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:33,360
<i>Police chatter says we're out of time.
SWAT is starting their sweep right now.</i>

644
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:34,535
Dammit.

645
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,375
Go, go!

646
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,845
Get it! Get it...

647
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:13,835
Push!

648
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:16,395
Come on.

649
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:26,115
You wanted it alive...

650
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:28,850
- You got it alive!
- Well done, Henry.

651
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:32,565
- Not bad for your first mission, buddy!
- Way to go, team!

652
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:38,470
That'll be the police.
Good timing, as usual.

653
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,905
- Them we can handle.
- Hypocrisy.

654
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:43,685
- What the hell?
- What are they shooting at?

655
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,415
Let's go!

656
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:47,329
Go?

657
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,740
What do you mean, let's go?
What is going on here?

658
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:51,875
What's going...
I just wanna...

659
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:55,415
This is just insane. I don't know.
What?

660
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:02,065
Oh, my God.
Oh, God! Oh, God!

661
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:06,895
What the hell?

662
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,795
But it couldn't have done this.
We just caught it.

663
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:16,155
Unless there's more
than one of them.

664
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:19,165
Guys...

665
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,526
Two of them.
You have got to be kidding me!

666
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:29,235
I can't get a fix!

667
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,395
- I think we just locked up its mate.
- Oh, that's not good.

668
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,615
That's not good.

669
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:47,535
Oh, where is it?
Where is it?

670
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,385
Oh, come on, where is it?

671
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,435
Hey, are you okay?

672
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,495
I think so.
I just... I don't know.

673
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,015
- What happened?
- This one's angrier than the first one.

674
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,945
Thanks for saving my ass again.

675
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,845
You're worth it.

676
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:15,205
Really?

677
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,680
You weren't just placating me
with a raincheck?

678
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:20,355
Like, I totally thought
you were back there.

679
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,225
I wasn't, really. I'm...

680
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:30,005
- I'm going to call you.
- Really? You'd go out with me?

681
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,045
That's to...

682
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,300
Considering everything,

683
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:15,015
it was incredibly brave of you
to contact us.

684
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,240
I changed my mind
about a dozen times

685
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,775
before I picked up the phone,
believe me.

686
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,526
And we do.

687
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:29,250
Look, I know you had to confiscate
the hard drive,

688
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,465
but technically that footage
belongs to Channel 13 News,

689
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:37,065
and my bosses know that something went
down in that warehouse, and that we...

690
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:40,805
That Zach shot a lot of footage

691
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,170
before he...

692
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:46,842
- They want to know what happened.
- A lot of questions are being asked.

693
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:50,600
And I figure the best way
to deflect them

694
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:53,770
is to put something together that
doesn't show anything incriminating,

695
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:54,895
that keeps

696
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,675
you guys and that...

697
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:59,896
- thing out of it.
- That's everything on there.

698
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,570
I can re-edit it to look like
a community square dance

699
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:04,375
if you give me enough time.

700
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:07,795
It won't go to air.

701
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:09,305
I promise.

702
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:13,385
Look, I know you guys think
I am a...

703
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,125
pushy, ambitious cold-hearted bitch,

704
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:19,055
but I came to you

705
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:20,985
because...

706
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,963
Because Zach shouldn't have...

707
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:30,552
What you guys do,

708
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:33,638
protecting people,

709
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:36,845
learning from the creatures.

710
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:38,295
Your work,

711
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:40,165
it's important.

712
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:42,005
So why not

713
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:45,050
show the world and further your career
in the process?

714
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:47,640
Because I thought
I should do the right thing,

715
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,635
and help you keep your secret,

716
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:53,450
so that maybe, at some point
in the future, you would help me,

717
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:56,965
and let me in on something
I can take to my superiors.

718
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:00,475
If you're looking for a deal
or a guarantee,

719
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,045
you won't get it.

720
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:06,115
All we ask is that you do
as your conscience dictates.

721
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,805
If at all possible.

722
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,605
We really need this to die down.

723
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:13,110
The rumor mill at the precinct
is in overdrive.

724
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:15,910
- Make us look...
- Like we were never there.

725
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:18,085
And that nothing ever happened.

726
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,455
Thank you.

727
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,980
I loved your last show. The one
about gore-tex and umbrellas?

728
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,205
Killer stuff.

729
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:47,765
Really.

730
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,805
Call me.

731
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:07,295
I'm just sayin',

732
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:10,265
chicks love dudes
who go on missions.

733
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:14,435
That's awesome!

734
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:18,495
I have it.

735
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,275
Yeah, book me an edit suite
right away,

736
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:24,895
and start laying pipe with New York.

737
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:28,285
This is...
This is going to blow their minds.

738
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:33,620
They'll want it first up
for tomorrow night's broadcast,

739
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:34,745
for sure.

740
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:57,945
<i>Nice try.</i>

741
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:02,130
<i>You know, the shame of it all is that
you'll make a hell of a good reporter...</i>

742
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:03,255
<i>Someday.</i>

743
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,395
<i>Have a good career.</i>
