1
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:03,682
That doesn't look good.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,027
I'm gonna go check it out.

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:11,874
Just stay here.

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,087
I think somebody just went over!

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,870
Honey, be careful!

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,058
Anybody in there?

7
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,164
Oh, God.

8
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:49,278
Call 911!
There's a dead guy down here!

9
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,395
What?

10
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:13,943
The Team Projet-SG

11
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,282
presents:

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,493
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 10
Sleepers (v. 1.00)

13
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,998
Timing by: Arrow, Salomon

14
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:42,100
http://projet-sg.net

15
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,239
I pulled some strings with the cops.
If anyone asks, we're Feds.

16
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,426
- Any special unit?
- Narcotics.

17
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,365
Hold on a second, guys.

18
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,475
Though I doubt drugs has anything
to do with what's in this body bag.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,778
- Don't you mean who?
- Not so much.

20
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,429
Dear God.

21
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:09,680
That's all that's left
of one Thomas Rayburn.

22
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,913
Sliced and diced.

23
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,855
His wife's body
was found over this way.

24
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:34,261
The wound pattern's
the same as her husband's.

25
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,812
The cuts are uneven,
some deep, some superficial.

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,249
The attack was fierce, frenzied.

27
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,329
Doesn't look like she had
much time to put up a fight.

28
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:46,377
Do you think we could spin this
as a wild animal attack?

29
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:49,755
I don't know. There's no tracks
around here, just footprints.

30
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:00,067
Okay, so the way I figure it,
husband and wife spot this wreck,

31
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,847
husband goes to investigate,

32
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,756
and when he doesn't come back,
wife follows.

33
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,818
It was her voice we heard
on the 911 call.

34
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:09,104
She said her husband
found a dead body.

35
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,510
Now, judging from the blood spatter,
I'm guessing major chest wound.

36
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,801
Steering column probably punched
right through the heart.

37
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,876
Death would be instantaneous.

38
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:19,857
So then where's the body?

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,390
<i>You look like you've seen
a ghost, brother.</i>

40
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,461
Did you get that link I emailed you
of the security camera footage

41
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,936
of that parking lot?

42
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,015
Yeah, I just finished watching it.
Is the killer who I think it is?

43
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,578
Henry's facial recognition software
caught a hit,

44
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,679
and I pulled a frame from the video.

45
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,956
Chad Spencer,
our missing car-crash victim.

46
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,681
24 years old
and clearly very much alive.

47
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,012
He's a trust-fund baby
on his fourth Ivy League tour.

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,333
Who walks away
from a crash like that?

49
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:16,213
Actually, what am I saying?
We know a lot of people who does that.

50
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,479
Why hasn't he been in touch
with his family or any of his friends?

51
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:20,604
He has.

52
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,178
This is Darrin Wilson,
the other guy in the footage.

53
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,498
Reported missing two days ago.

54
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,423
Darrin is Chad's roommate.

55
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,820
From another wealthy family,

56
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:32,187
and it's not a kidnapping.
There've been no ransom demands.

57
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:33,562
What've we got?

58
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,908
We got a dead man,
walks away from a crash,

59
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,318
becomes homicidal.

60
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,738
Run the data again. There's obviously
a common denominator we're overlooking.

61
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,153
See if anyone else has disappeared.

62
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:48,650
You know, this would be
a lot easier with Henry's help.

63
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,789
- He's unavailable.
- Why, again?

64
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,622
He's on a mission
of utmost importance.

65
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:56,295
I was sworn to absolute secrecy.

66
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:57,858
Wait a second.

67
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,673
San Diego Comic-Con?

68
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,218
That's the mission
of utmost importance?

69
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,719
You did not hear it from me.

70
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,262
Where's the Big Guy?

71
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,808
- He's with him?
- It's the place he actually blends in.

72
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,832
Great, so they're fan boys.

73
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,313
I'm working with fan boys...

74
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:26,725
Darrin!

75
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,882
What the hell?

76
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,620
I got your text.
Where have you been?

77
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,665
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

78
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,227
Your parents have been calling me.
They're freaking out.

79
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,212
- I'm sure they have. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,530
Take it easy.

81
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,329
This is not...

82
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,788
Chad?

83
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:51,802
Holy crap.

84
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,645
It's nice to see you, too, Laura.

85
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,244
Okay, but I...

86
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,341
I went to your memorial service.

87
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,421
It's a shame I had to miss it.

88
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,311
I heard it was nice.

89
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,231
It was beautiful, buddy.

90
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,599
- You guys are really freaking me out.
- Just relax.

91
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,700
We're all friends here.

92
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,420
What the hell's going on?

93
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,048
That's what I wondered, too, at first,
but then I remembered that week

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,816
that we had spent
at that Mexican clinic.

95
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:27,988
And?

96
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,239
And...

97
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,214
I'm just saying...

98
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:36,986
Then it all made sense.

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,064
Oh, my God.

100
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,131
Welcome to the club.

101
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,439
Any luck so far?

102
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,337
Just had a report
of another missing kid.

103
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:18,377
And?

104
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,845
That common denominator
that Magnus was looking for...

105
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,899
You found it?

106
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:24,327
Out of sheer desperation,
I ran the names

107
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,403
through the North American
Security Institute.

108
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,822
You don't seriously think
they're terrorists?

109
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,589
No, but check this out.

110
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:34,004
The NASI also monitors
customs and immigration,

111
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,694
and it looks like all these missing kids
recently spent time in Mexico.

112
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:38,749
On vacation?

113
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,318
Just the opposite.

114
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,746
So they checked into a drug clinic,

115
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,820
very expensive, very exclusive.

116
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,349
Headed by the noted Viennese scientist
doctor Heinrich Baumschlager.

117
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,754
Never heard of him.

118
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,416
The place is called
<i>La casa de la nueva vida</i>.

119
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,962
The house of new life,

120
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,849
and it appears to be
living up to its name.

121
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,191
I'll tell Dr. Baumschlager
you're here.

122
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,324
Thank you.

123
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,449
<i>Gracias.</i>

124
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,062
Plastic.

125
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,747
Why do I get the feeling we're gonna
sit through a timeshare pitch?

126
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,393
Because there's something a tad dodgy
about all of this.

127
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,953
The crash forensics came up zilch.

128
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,778
Right now we have nothing.

129
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,589
None of this makes any sense.

130
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,992
<i>El</i> doctor will see you now.

131
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,812
On the contrary,
now it makes perfect sense.

132
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,337
<i>Hola, amigos!</i>

133
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,191
And right over here,

134
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,377
we have our friendship Lanai.

135
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:02,254
It's a small, intimate
space for sharing...

136
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,679
Nikola, we're not here for the tour.

137
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,852
I notice you do seem a bit on edge.

138
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,254
Might I suggest
one of our green-tea detox massages?

139
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,132
It makes you feel 100 again.

140
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,755
We know what's going on here.

141
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,571
And I don't like
the tone of your voice.

142
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:17,916
And we don't like
being lied to, so...

143
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:20,893
Why are you people always so ready
to think the worst of me?

144
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,384
You've seen
my facilities for yourself.

145
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:27,649
You don't honestly expect us to believe
that you are running a detox clinic?

146
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,942
You're...

147
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,445
You're not exactly
the philanthropic type.

148
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,822
I never said I wasn't making a profit,
but in return,

149
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:35,824
I provide a public service.

150
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:37,237
I'm waiting.

151
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,927
Wealthy parents
ship their drug-addled teenagers to me.

152
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,612
They arrive,
their poor little bodies wracked

153
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:46,655
by the best designer drugs
trust funds can buy.

154
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,961
It breaks your heart,

155
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,714
but then after one week
of my treatment,

156
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,634
I send them home to mater and pater
completely cured of all addictions.

157
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,427
One week?
That's impossible.

158
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,223
Which part of "I'm a genius"
aren't you getting?

159
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:02,476
- Less ego, more facts, please.
- All right.

160
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,897
Do you remember that weapon I invented
to combat the Cabal's super abnormals?

161
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,207
Yes, all too well.

162
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,519
This may go over your head.
Just try to play along.

163
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,082
Suffice it to say,

164
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:16,207
I redesigned the biotechnology core,
creating a blood matrix scrubber

165
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,575
- with selective protein inhibitors...
- Enough!

166
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,900
Whatever you've done
to these young people,

167
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,829
- they're disappearing.
- As in...

168
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,369
Something's killing them
and stealing their bodies.

169
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,125
You don't say.

170
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:29,878
Come on, out with it.

171
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,674
I want to hear you say the words.

172
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,275
All right.

173
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,299
I may have...

174
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,300
- sort of...
- Spill it, Nikola.

175
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,226
... turned them into vampires.

176
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:15,858
Amazing.

177
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:22,896
Solid.

178
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:31,381
Admittedly, I was too impatient
with my previous experiments.

179
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,391
They were... imperfect.

180
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:36,148
- They were homicidal.
- Semantics.

181
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,072
- This time, it's different.
- How?

182
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,760
You would used your own blood.

183
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,822
Yes, but I programmed
the little tykes' DNA

184
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,934
for a time release
of the vampire gene...

185
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,740
30 years minimum
for the metamorphosis to complete.

186
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:48,790
Time release?

187
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:51,960
We're talking about ancient vampire
blood. It's not cold medication.

188
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,887
Same principle, Junior.

189
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,673
I thought that if I slowed down
the genetic mutation,

190
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:00,469
I'd sidestep the antibody rejection
which was plaguing my former subjects.

191
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,140
- Clearly, something went wrong.
- Clearly.

192
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:06,727
How many subjects
did you treat here?

193
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:08,578
Oh, man...

194
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:12,063
Enough to raise a little hell.

195
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,691
I can smell your blood.

196
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,393
You want to taste me?

197
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,013
Yummy...

198
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:43,678
You gotta see this, man.

199
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:48,838
- Now is not a good time.
- Would you hear me out, please?

200
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:52,401
I hired this hacker to break through
Dr. Frankenstein's firewalls, right,

201
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,065
and most of what we found
were medical journals,

202
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,526
records of his experiments,
that kind of stuff,

203
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,544
but then I also found this.

204
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,163
What is it?

205
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,150
It's a history of vampires, Laura,
but nothing like I've ever heard before.

206
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,328
What does it say?

207
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,124
"Vampires were once the best
and brightest race

208
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:13,837
"on the planet.

209
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,569
"So many of the great minds
were bloodsuckers."

210
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:20,012
The humans bowed down to us?

211
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,080
We were immortals?

212
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,301
Kings.

213
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:31,785
King of the world.

214
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,660
I like the sound of that.

215
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,665
So do I.

216
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:43,276
I think it's time
to rebuild the empire.

217
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,104
I don't know. I don't get it.
I adhered to all the protocols.

218
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,835
Have a look for yourself.

219
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,003
And yet the incubation period
was drastically truncated.

220
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,206
Instant vampires.

221
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,268
Maybe there's some sort of
environmental variable

222
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:07,719
I didn't take into account.

223
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:10,056
What, like weather,
or diet, lifestyle?

224
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:11,269
Death.

225
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,894
Death?

226
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:16,305
Death would be the last thing
that an immortal would think of.

227
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,709
- This first kid died in a car accident.
- And showed up two days later, alive.

228
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:20,775
Chad Spencer.

229
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,652
I remember him.
Alpha-male type.

230
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:26,026
If a human, having undergone
your treatment, dies...

231
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,657
The vampire gene would kick in.

232
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:31,088
It was programmed to survive
at all costs.

233
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:34,773
Okay, so Chad comes back to life,
starts rounding up the other patients.

234
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:37,417
And killing them, thereby triggering
their vampire genetics.

235
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:39,961
The little bastard.

236
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,871
This was supposed to be my party!

237
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:45,269
Nobody hijacks Nikola Tesla!

238
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,374
You guys must be high.

239
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:57,969
Are you using again?

240
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,904
We are clean, my friend.

241
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,580
What's with the eyes?

242
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,192
- They don't do that on <i>True Blood</i>.
- Look, this isn't a TV show.

243
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:07,280
This is real.

244
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,032
So, what do you think?

245
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,207
Are you in?

246
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:14,288
I don't know.

247
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:18,348
I didn't get to do spring break
at the clinic like you guys did.

248
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:19,873
Now's your chance.

249
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,463
Be part of the group.
That is, of course, if you're up for it.

250
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,423
Immortality?

251
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,037
You're serious?

252
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,799
I'm very serious...

253
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,722
But you better be sure about it,

254
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,314
because there's no going back.

255
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,151
What do I need to do?

256
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:50,564
You just leave everything to me.

257
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,634
What's going on?
Why isn't he coming back to life?

258
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,885
- Not cool.
- Oh, my God.

259
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:12,986
I killed him.

260
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,634
- What the hell happened?
- No, I really killed him.

261
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,424
- It's not your fault, okay?
- What do you mean it's not my fault?

262
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,391
I bit him on the neck
and now he's dead!

263
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:22,814
- It's not supposed to happen like this.
- I don't get it.

264
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,925
Everyone knows
that's how you make more vampires.

265
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,051
Yeah, well, clearly they're wrong.

266
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,376
Clearly, Chad.

267
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,449
You know, for the superior race,
we're not doing so hot.

268
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:35,950
- So, what do you want to do now?
- This is ridiculous.

269
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:39,045
Why are we trying
to figure this out on our own?

270
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,553
- We know exactly who did this to us.
- That doctor in Mexico.

271
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:46,046
That's exactly
where we're gonna find the answers.

272
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,298
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling about all this.

273
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,342
Are you gonna bail
because of one screw-up?

274
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,765
That's what you call dead Steve?

275
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,012
Come on, man, okay?

276
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:58,058
That quack down south
did this to us,

277
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,177
but we have a chance now
to take our power back.

278
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:02,896
If we nail this...

279
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,483
There isn't anybody on Earth
that can push us around anymore.

280
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,691
- We're good.
- What about you?

281
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,961
You gonna be okay?

282
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,664
I've never killed anything
in my life,

283
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,499
so how can I feel so sad,

284
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,415
and at the same time, so...

285
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:28,755
hungry?

286
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,788
We are what we are.

287
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,255
Hey there.

288
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,065
How are things in the land
of the 65-cent margarita?

289
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,550
Well, the phrase
"Bloody awful" comes to mind.

290
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,918
We're on our way back.

291
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:53,087
In the meantime,
I've emailed you a list of patients

292
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:55,573
who spent time at the clinic.
Find out all you can about them.

293
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,210
Okay. Am I looking for anything
in particular?

294
00:17:58,335 --> 00:17:59,335
<i>Vampires.</i>

295
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:00,453
Come again?

296
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,373
Yeah, it seems Nikola's
been up to his usual selfish tricks.

297
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,073
- I'm selfish?
- Shocking, I know.

298
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,730
Because I tried to save my race
from extinction?

299
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:12,473
Because you used innocent children
in a potentially deadly experiment.

300
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,994
- There was that.
- Professional jealousy.

301
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,396
You've no idea
what you've unleashed!

302
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:19,681
Let me guess.

303
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:21,725
This must be your graduating class.

304
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,230
Incredible...

305
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:25,729
It worked.

306
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,237
You're coming with us.

307
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:32,381
But you didn't even say please.

308
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:40,910
What are you doing?

309
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,445
Crude, yet magnificent.

310
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:07,761
Dammit!

311
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,400
It's an honor to welcome
the source of our greatness.

312
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,588
You're like our own personal Obama.

313
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,400
What the hell are you playing at?

314
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,839
This isn't a game, okay?
We both know that.

315
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,903
Don't read me the rule book, sonny.

316
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,000
I wrote it.

317
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,791
What's your problem?

318
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,087
This was your idea, remember?

319
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,021
The spontaneous generation
of vampires

320
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,507
decades ahead of schedule
was not my idea.

321
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:39,782
I had a plan,

322
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,389
an intricate, ingenious design,
and, strange as it may sound,

323
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,267
it did not involve you blowing away
your friends and taking over.

324
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,512
Do you have any idea
what you've become?

325
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:54,137
That's why you're here,
to fill in the gaps for us.

326
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,662
<i>Sanguine Vampirus.</i>

327
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,921
The preeminent race on the planet.

328
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,014
Born for greatness,

329
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,289
bred to rule.

330
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,999
Kings and pharaohs.

331
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,321
There was a time when we sighed,

332
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:10,666
and the world trembled.

333
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,711
We know.
We read your journal.

334
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,630
Let's just cut to the chase, okay?

335
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,424
You chose us
not because of who we are,

336
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,005
- but because of who we'll become.
- How astute.

337
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,167
Our parents have
more money than God,

338
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:26,814
and they hold positions of power
and influence all over this world.

339
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:29,718
And in a few decades' time,
you would have stepped into their shoes,

340
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:32,754
creating a new ruling class,
returning us to the old ways.

341
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,107
So let's bring it on.

342
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,490
Now!

343
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,188
And if anyone stands in our way,

344
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:39,645
they'll die.

345
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,507
Nice.

346
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,992
All the subtlety of brain surgery
with a chainsaw.

347
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:47,185
But why wait?

348
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:49,194
We're here right now.

349
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,444
And you think
that your 24 years' experience

350
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,501
has prepped you
for ruling the Earth?

351
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,009
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you'll blow it.

352
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:59,410
You've turned what was supposed
to be a symphony into rock and roll!

353
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,843
French-Canadian rock and roll.

354
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,160
I was hoping
you'd be a little bit more cooperative.

355
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,350
Life's a bitch,
and then you don't die.

356
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,358
What, we're gonna do this old-school?
Is that it?

357
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,028
You're not facing Magnus.
This is me.

358
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,650
Bring it on, kiddies.

359
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,242
I hate them.

360
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:34,716
I hate them...

361
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:51,886
Let's talk.

362
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:56,644
You know, I almost broke a nail
on the way down.

363
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:01,210
This should counteract the sedative
we gave her during transport.

364
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:03,524
Just tell me
the straps are gona hold.

365
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:05,749
Titanium webbing, vampire-proof.

366
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,776
Rise and shine.

367
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:18,455
Where am I?

368
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,006
- I'll be asking the questions now.
- And who the hell are you?

369
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,354
Where have your friends
taken Nikola?

370
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,053
Dr. Baumschlager?

371
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,223
Wouldn't you like to know?

372
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:32,155
I don't have time to play games.

373
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,102
Chad's not gonna be cool with this.

374
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,397
If he finds out where you're holding me,
he's gonna whip some serious

375
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,265
vamp action on your ass.

376
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,534
You have no idea what you've become.

377
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,867
Insolence will only
make things worse.

378
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,885
Why don't you bite me, bitch?

379
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,060
Why don't you go get an Earl Grey
and let me take a shot?

380
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,111
Hey, cute boy.

381
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,970
This is unconscionable,
even by my standards.

382
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:12,977
I wanted to do it the easy way,

383
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,893
- but you forced my hand.
- So you steal my equipment,

384
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:17,896
my research, my blood?

385
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,620
- Hey, Biff!
- Darrin.

386
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,156
Whatever.

387
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:25,445
Take it easy with the centrifuge.
It's not a toy.

388
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,156
- I'm just following your notes.
- It's not paint by numbers.

389
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:31,622
It's a highly sophisticated
biochemical process.

390
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,720
Does this chump even know
what he's doing?

391
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,935
Looking through your data,
I saw that you were able to create

392
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,064
a single strand of recombinant DNA
based on your vampiric genetic pattern,

393
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,488
then using a restriction endonuclease,
you were able to cleave the DNA strands

394
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,884
onto chromosomes number four,
seven, and eight sequentially,

395
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,822
then reintroduced this third strand back
to the separated double-helix matrix

396
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:53,056
and spliced it in,
which, of course, ultimately created

397
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:57,052
a stronger, super-triple DNA helix
within these chromosomes.

398
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:02,126
Darrin was pre-med.

399
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,801
Was?

400
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,152
Dropped out.

401
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,153
Why?

402
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,782
I don't know, the parties were lame?

403
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:19,332
Look, you know that we're only
trying to help you, right?

404
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:28,719
Who's your cute little friend
in the thrift-store wardrobe?

405
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:32,582
We're cool, right?

406
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:36,502
Right?

407
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,154
I get it. You were brought
to that clinic under false pretences,

408
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,336
and you were experimented on
without your consent...

409
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,907
I checked in a meth-head.

410
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,680
I checked out a vampire.

411
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:46,776
Bonus.

412
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:49,374
If you tell us
where the others have taken Tesla,

413
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,750
we might be able
to reverse the process.

414
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,058
That's your pitch?

415
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:56,326
Rat out up my friends,
I get to go back to being an addict?

416
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,915
I'm not telling you anything,

417
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,310
and you can't make me.

418
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,168
Have it your way.

419
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,052
Kill her.

420
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,271
About time.

421
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,321
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

422
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:19,720
I'll just heal again.
I'm immortal.

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,086
If this gun was loaded
with regular bullets,

424
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,197
you'd be right,

425
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:30,107
but these, sweetheart,
are solid silver,

426
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,531
blessed by a priest
with holy water from the Vatican.

427
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:37,387
Yeah, only us sanctified
monster hunters get 'em.

428
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,724
I pump just one of these babies
into your heart...

429
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,286
And wham!

430
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,331
We found out
where they're holding Tesla.

431
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:02,356
Oh, good. So the psychological
approach worked?

432
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:03,477
I had my doubts.

433
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,316
But, hey, result.

434
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,390
Did you find anything interesting
in Laura's blood?

435
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:11,397
Perhaps.

436
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:14,249
Her mutated DNA
shows a triple helix.

437
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,084
Translation, please?

438
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,081
If I can find a way
to break the peptide bond,

439
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,209
I might be able to detach the 3rd strand
and undo Nikola's handiwork.

440
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:24,665
Tesla said he used the biotech developed
for the super abnormal weapon.

441
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,052
- We can adapt it in some way?
- Without Nikola's research,

442
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:29,201
I'd be flying blind.
We can't take that risk.

443
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,087
But you may be able
to reverse the process.

444
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:33,252
"May" being the operative word.

445
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,510
Nikola's really done it this time.

446
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,964
His creations are better, stronger,
even deadlier than he is.

447
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,890
Conventional means of control
are no longer sufficient.

448
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,851
What if we can't put the genie
back in the bottle?

449
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,772
These people know what they are,
and now they have Nikola.

450
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,483
Wait, you think they're gonna start
pumping out vampires?

451
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,277
I do,

452
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,715
and unless we find a way
to stop them immediately,

453
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,873
we could be looking
at a full resurrection

454
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,492
of the deadliest race of abnormals
ever to roam the Earth.

455
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:13,892
I know how Nikola thinks.

456
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:17,266
He would never create something
that he couldn't destroy, or control.

457
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:19,266
So you're saying
there's a failsafe somewhere?

458
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,514
Like a kill-switch
that'll un-vamp the vamps?

459
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,600
It makes sense.
He'd never let his work get compromised.

460
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,519
- Right, but what is it?
- Where is it?

461
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:31,065
Didn't Tesla say the timeline
for the vampires was 30 years?

462
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:34,694
So he'd have to have hidden it somewhere
that would still be around then.

463
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:37,932
Right, someplace solid, secure,
like a... bank.

464
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:39,635
Or a vault.

465
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:41,995
A Sanctuary.

466
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,773
Dammit, that was the last Borges,
and I was positive.

467
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:51,460
Nikola so loves Jorge's
"A new refutation of time".

468
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,398
What about Trollope?

469
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,088
No, it's not his taste.

470
00:27:56,213 --> 00:27:57,311
Try Whitman.

471
00:27:57,436 --> 00:27:59,458
He went through a free-verse phase
for a while.

472
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,735
So that's Curie, Einstein,
and Hawking down.

473
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:04,055
- Nothing?
- No.

474
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,663
No hollowed-out compartments,
no hidden failsafe schematics,

475
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:11,365
just a bunch of wine stains
on the first editions.

476
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,625
Looks like fang-boy's a real slob.

477
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:33,040
Not to be a Debbie Downer,
but isn't this one hell of a long shot?

478
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,665
And the alternative?

479
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:38,545
- I don't know.
- Exactly. Keep looking.

480
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:43,362
- Over here.
- What did you find?

481
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,775
It's what I didn't find.

482
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:47,195
Dust.

483
00:28:47,695 --> 00:28:48,895
Squeaky clean.

484
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,100
The '45 Bordeaux.
Bastard.

485
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:54,175
That was a gift from Winston.

486
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,524
Churchill.

487
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:57,745
D-Day.

488
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:59,105
Long story.

489
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:03,908
Either that's a lot of sediment,
or...

490
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah, baby.

491
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,295
Great.

492
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,475
What is it?

493
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:18,255
Must be some kind of weapon,
knowing Nikola.

494
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,092
- So how do we figure out how to use it?
- Well, that's quite simple.

495
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,095
We ask the inventor.

496
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:33,687
Look, I know that you're pissed
that we messed up your plan,

497
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:36,973
but you gotta give us some credit.

498
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:42,714
You know, thanks to what we've learned
from your blood sample, it...

499
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:44,688
It looks like
we've cracked the code.

500
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:47,113
Well, forgive me if I don't applaud.

501
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,190
You know,
by duplicating your experiment,

502
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:52,965
I could turn anyone I want
into a vampire.

503
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,806
- Unstoppable army, anyone?
- God help us all.

504
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,015
I don't get you.

505
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,078
Isn't this what you wanted,

506
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,030
the preeminent race reborn?

507
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,510
On my terms, not yours.

508
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,020
See, kid, you've stolen
my life's work,

509
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,745
and you've destroyed my dream,

510
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,268
but really, what's worse
than all that, you little punk,

511
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:16,772
is the arrogance to presume that
you even have a clue what you're doing.

512
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,963
You still don't get it, huh, gramps?

513
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,382
- We are your dream.
- No, you're my nightmare.

514
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
You know,

515
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:28,025
I really wanted us to work together.

516
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,285
I did.

517
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:31,505
You'd be my mentor,

518
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,340
teach us the ways of the race,

519
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:36,709
but all you wanna do
is bitch and moan.

520
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,225
You know,

521
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:40,555
you're just like my dad,

522
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:43,835
my coaches, and my profs.

523
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,136
There's no sense of possibility.

524
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:49,722
You may be immortal,

525
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:52,224
but you died a long time ago.

526
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,453
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to here?

527
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:55,478
Right, the...

528
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:58,255
The king of vampires.

529
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:02,067
You're nothing
but a giant pain in the ass.

530
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,285
I'll see you next century.

531
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,579
What do you want?

532
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:21,413
I mean, clearly, you're the man
with the plan, so...

533
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,185
You call this a plan?

534
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:30,938
Whatever happened to the good old
stake through the heart?

535
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,080
Doesn't work.

536
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,490
What about all those movies
like Buffy or...?

537
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:36,565
Misinformation propaganda,

538
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,486
spread by the vampires themselves.

539
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,560
Confuse the enemy,
preserve the race.

540
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:43,049
What about exposing them
to sunlight, or garlic?

541
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:45,050
All you get is tanned vampires
with bad breath.

542
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,821
Besides, we don't want to kill them.
We want to help them.

543
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,699
No, I'm thinking kill them.

544
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:54,250
Trust-fund vampires?
I'm thinking she's right.

545
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,121
Granted, but it wasn't their choice.

546
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,660
They may be rich,
spoiled, insolent children,

547
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,834
but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't save them.

548
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,201
That's a terrible sales pitch.

549
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:11,669
So it's just us against a bunch
of badass blood-sucking immortals, huh?

550
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,016
It's a good thing
we have our magic glass stick

551
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,936
that we don't know how to use,
otherwise, I would be worried.

552
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,095
All right.

553
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:34,220
You ever done this move before?

554
00:32:34,345 --> 00:32:35,520
Are you kidding?

555
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:36,845
I invented it.

556
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:32,665
Bram Stoker?

557
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:34,632
Alcoholic irish hack.

558
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:36,095
Bats, indeed.

559
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:43,565
Struggle, and he'll break your arms.

560
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,100
Look what we found.

561
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,401
Well, well, well,
the appetizers have arrived.

562
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:51,945
This is the last time
I come to your rescue.

563
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:54,145
I'm sorry to say that's true.

564
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:55,515
Tie them up.

565
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,926
And no feeding until I say.

566
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,245
It's good to be king again.

567
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,610
If we ever get out of this alive,
I'll kill him.

568
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:27,773
- Me first.
- Both of you, back of the line.

569
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,435
Well, it's about time!

570
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:33,960
- Before you thank me...
- Thank you?

571
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,320
You're welcome.
I just saved all of your lives.

572
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,076
Really?
You expect us to believe that?

573
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,850
What, you didn't believe
that little display out there, did you?

574
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,160
No, that was just melodrama
for the peanut gallery.

575
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:45,340
Well, then, let's end
this stupidity right now.

576
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:46,667
Yeah, untie us.

577
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,595
What is it with kids these days?

578
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:52,745
All right, where is it?

579
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:56,176
My failsafe? The '45 Bordeaux,
tell me you brought it.

580
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,810
You were taking an awful chance
that we'd actually find it.

581
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:01,530
Yes, but, Helen, we've known each other
for 100-plus years.

582
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:03,350
I think I know your mind by now.

583
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:06,475
Left side.

584
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,705
I've often wondered
what this moment would be like.

585
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,194
Me...

586
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,419
You tied up.

587
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:18,110
It's a shame
you brought the children.

588
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,435
Focus, Nikola.

589
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,160
Okay, so what is that thing?

590
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:28,385
I call it...

591
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,002
The de-vamper!

592
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,595
You're a genius, and that is
the best name you could come up with?

593
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,520
Watch it.

594
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:37,092
If this is some sort of weapon,
what's its power source?

595
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,935
You're looking at him.

596
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,270
Fascinating.

597
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,545
Now untie us.

598
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,560
You're safer tied up here.

599
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,936
What are you gonna do?

600
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,376
I'm gonna teach those kids
some manners.

601
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:54,045
Oh, dear.

602
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:57,029
I think Nikola's about to bite off
more than he can chew.

603
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,091
You know, you have such command

604
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,725
of the Queen's English.

605
00:36:31,215 --> 00:36:33,215
This thing works like a charm.

606
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:39,571
What happened?

607
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,055
You're fired.

608
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:51,265
This is driving me nuts.

609
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:53,415
Okay, look, why don't you...

610
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:55,504
- Why don't you try to reach...
- Don't.

611
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,922
Just reach down...
Can you... Can you feel it?

612
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,508
Oh, crap.

613
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:04,105
I'm trying.

614
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,681
Faster is better.

615
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:12,813
Well done.

616
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,460
So, any time.

617
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:15,585
Right.

618
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:30,831
Unnecessary, but appreciated.

619
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,031
You're welcome.

620
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:46,826
- What the hell did you do to me?
- You'll thank me in the morning.

621
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:48,875
Sit! Stay!

622
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:02,315
You should have stayed
in med school.

623
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:05,574
- Nicely done.
- It's all in the wrist action.

624
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,402
- Toss it over or I'll kill her.
- Not that old chestnut.

625
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:19,212
- Put it down.
- Trust me, this will all end in tears.

626
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,297
Do it!

627
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,427
I'm famished.
You think you could light the barbecue?

628
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,348
Doubtful. They're only tranqs.

629
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,366
Pity. Perhaps I could help?

630
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,885
How very gracious of you.

631
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,287
- Magnus, shoot him!
- Shut up.

632
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,856
Listen to me.
I'll slice her, man.

633
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,345
Chad, my man, my bro.

634
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,110
We can work this out.

635
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:45,747
- It's not too late to hit rewind.
- Don't mess with me.

636
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:47,699
I'm sensing there's some anger here.

637
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,740
We were gonna rule
the world together, huh?

638
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:54,206
See, the thing is,

639
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,041
I'm more of a one-man show.

640
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,890
So this was all some sort of set-up?

641
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:01,065
Well, what can I say?
Never trust anyone over 130.

642
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,399
You little...

643
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,205
I can't...

644
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:33,954
I can't...

645
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:40,794
I can't...

646
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:46,145
Well, I hope you're all happy now.

647
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:51,145
I'm ordinary.

648
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:13,565
Hey, there you are.
I was looking for you.

649
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm sorry, Will.

650
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:17,010
You must be holding dinner for me.

651
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,620
Yeah, except it's 10:00.

652
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,990
You've been in here for six hours.

653
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:25,560
Have you gotten anywhere, at least?

654
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:26,935
I'm afraid not.

655
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,540
I've been trying to splice together
Nikola's normal DNA

656
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:31,586
with the abnormal strands
from Laura.

657
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:33,130
But it's not working.

658
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:34,980
Can't you use his research to help?

659
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,205
I have been.

660
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:39,640
His cells are rejecting
the synthetic vector he created.

661
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:43,370
Quite simply, there's no way to reverse
the effects of his de-vamper,

662
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,245
speaking of which...

663
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,820
He's in the lab with Laura.

664
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,626
He's trying to cobble together
an energy source with enough juice

665
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,199
to power the de-vamper,
now that he can't do it himself.

666
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:55,365
And I'm guessing he figured it out.

667
00:40:57,465 --> 00:40:59,530
Well, I guess I better
break the news to him.

668
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:02,238
- Could you send him to my office?
- Yeah, sure.

669
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,945
Are you okay?

670
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,860
This really bothers you, the fact
that you can't get his powers back?

671
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:11,843
- It's not that.
- Well, I should hope not.

672
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,370
I mean, the guy's been a thorn
in your side for what, a century?

673
00:41:15,495 --> 00:41:18,287
Why are you working so hard
to turn him back into a vampire?

674
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:20,769
Nostalgia, perhaps?

675
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:26,191
With Watson and Griffin dying,
John's departure, and now Nikola...

676
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:30,320
You're the last of the Five.

677
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,720
- So?
- Yes, it's done.

678
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:43,945
Laura is back to her snivelling,

679
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,044
spoiled self.

680
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,235
This may cheer you up.

681
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:53,035
The Premier Cru?
You must be feeling guilty.

682
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:56,012
- You can't seriously blame me for this?
- Forgive me, Helen.

683
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:59,180
It's just my soul-crushing
depression talking.

684
00:41:59,305 --> 00:42:00,400
I'm not myself.

685
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:03,575
On the contrary.
You are your real self again.

686
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:05,395
Human.

687
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,169
- Mortal.
- Watch your language.

688
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:10,652
I'm sorry, Nikola, but it's true.
I've tried everything I can think of.

689
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,460
There's simply no way
to re-vamp you.

690
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:15,574
You see how this puts a crimp
in my plans for world domination?

691
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,201
Not to say I won't keep trying.

692
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,911
I would expect nothing less.

693
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:23,710
Very well. If this is to be a wake,
then let's do it properly.

694
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,041
Join me in a toast.

695
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:27,515
To happier times.

696
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:30,368
To those halcyon days
of bloodlust now gone,

697
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,341
plus you gotta admit,
vampires are just plain cool.

698
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,634
Amen.

699
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:39,285
Here's to the glorious vampire race,
once mighty, now extinct.

700
00:42:58,805 --> 00:42:59,805
Well...

701
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,665
I can work with that.
