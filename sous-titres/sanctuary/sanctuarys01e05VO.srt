1
00:00:02,488 --> 00:00:04,105
I take it
you're feeling much better.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,452
There's nothing like the attentions
of a capable physician

3
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:09,127
- to cure the chronically ill.
- You were never ill. It was simply...

4
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,393
I know. An element of my physiology
as yet undiscovered by medicine.

5
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:14,625
Where to this evening?

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,904
A turn through Piccadilly
to start, please.

7
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,538
You have done so much for me.

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,018
- John, I hardly...
- Let me speak, Doctor.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,613
I've spent my entire life
lost in a void,

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,350
afraid of who I am...

11
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,311
of what I am.

12
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,369
If not for you, I fear
I would have remained lost.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,539
Instead, I can now see that I am
neither a freak of nature nor a devil,

14
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:47,086
but a man...

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,170
very much in love.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,678
And someone who wishes
to spend the rest of his life

17
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:01,226
repaying his savior
for all she's done.

18
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:09,612
I promise

19
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,278
to make you happy, Helen,

20
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,240
for eternity...

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Will!

22
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,044
Will!

23
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,137
You all right?

24
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,702
That was...
That was bad.

25
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,787
Oh, damn!

26
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:05,974
Sylvio!

27
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:07,496
Are you okay?

28
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:09,452
What do you think?

29
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,005
Where the hell are we?

30
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:18,945
To be honest...

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,331
I've no idea.

32
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,529
The Team Projet-SG

33
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,239
presents:

34
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:36,451
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 05
Kush (v. 1.00)

35
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:40,955
Timing by: Golgi,
Linwelin, Salomon.

36
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:00,099
http://projet-sg.net

37
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,527
Allison!

38
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,075
It's okay, it's okay.

39
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,116
That thing!

40
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,778
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Look, it's gone.

41
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,929
It's gone, all right?
Look at me. You're fine.

42
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:30,562
- You're fine, okay?
- Yeah!

43
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,670
That's very helpful.
Tell her she's fine.

44
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,508
Even though we're totally screwed.

45
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,888
- Your arm!
- Don't touch me.

46
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,101
I'll do it.

47
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,192
See?

48
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:57,861
All better.

49
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,229
No, no, go away!

50
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,266
It's all right.
It's all right.

51
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,581
You're alive.

52
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,574
- Did we make it?
- We're down, yes.

53
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,798
Looks like your co-pilot
did most of the work, though.

54
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,226
I was in the washroom
when it happened.

55
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,501
- I heard screams.
- Don't move.

56
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:44,282
Your leg is broken.
I'll tend to it in a moment.

57
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,704
What are you doing?

58
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:52,119
Getting us out of here.

59
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:53,633
I can't get a signal.

60
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:04,260
- Mom? Thank God.
- <i>Ashley. I'm fine.</i>

61
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,888
We lost the pilot,
but the rest of us are okay.

62
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,480
We know. We've been tracking you
the entire time. What happened?

63
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,226
I'll give you the details later!

64
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,937
We have some wounded who need
immediate medical attention!

65
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,063
We got you.

66
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,441
Sat tracking has the crash site
located in the central Hindu Kush.

67
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,860
We already have a rescue team
mobilizing out of Islamabad.

68
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,237
- ETA should be about five hours.
- <i>Good work!</i>

69
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,952
- I'll see you when I get home!
- Mom...

70
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,148
- It's really good to hear your voice.
- It's good to hear yours, too, Ashley.

71
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,060
I have good news.

72
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:42,598
A rescue team will be here
in about five hours.

73
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:43,856
In the meantime,

74
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,636
we'll assess your injuries and try
to keep you all as warm as possible,

75
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,482
and if the Gods are smiling,

76
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,784
I'll find some tea
and make us all a pot.

77
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:53,434
See?

78
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,643
You'll be back in New Delhi
by breakfast.

79
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:58,356
I should've guessed this would be
no match for the great Helen Magnus.

80
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,713
Exactly.
Never doubt the boss.

81
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:02,652
Magnus!

82
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:03,937
Will...

83
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,621
This is definitely
after the punchline.

84
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,922
- You think it survived the crash?
- We did.

85
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,742
I'm still getting paid, right?

86
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:28,803
I did fulfill the contract to find
and capture one bad-ass snow creature.

87
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,347
- What happens after that...
- Give it a rest, all right?

88
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:34,670
Start securing the plane.
Do what you can to block out the cold.

89
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,145
Five hours is a long time
to be exposed to these temperatures.

90
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,160
I'll see what I can dig up.

91
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,404
- I know you wanted this one badly.
- Not like this.

92
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:49,564
At least we know
why no one's captured one before.

93
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,239
They're a hardy breed.

94
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,411
Here we are, stuck on its turf.

95
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:57,684
I'm not sure I like not knowing
whether that thing is alive or dead.

96
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,675
- Can you understand him?
- It's a dialect of Tibetan.

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,687
Wasn't he one of the sherpas
on the expedition?

98
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,377
Yes, he must have
stowed away on the flight.

99
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,692
- Bad move.
- Your name is Tashi, right?

100
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,090
Can you stand?

101
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,496
It's all right. You're safe.
The thing is gone. Let me see your hand.

102
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,236
Look after him.

103
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:43,377
I think you are! I mean,
we have a right to an explanation!

104
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,912
What the hell was that thing?
How did it get in this plane, man?

105
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,216
It was our cargo.

106
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,011
A rare species of snow leopard captured
in Tajikistan, north of Dushanbe.

107
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,926
Never heard of a snow leopard
attacking a group of people before.

108
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,112
It was a rare offshoot
of the species.

109
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:01,569
Its designation is
<i>Cryptid Bipedis Himalaya</i>.

110
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,273
You expect us to believe
that that was a leopard?

111
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,768
That was four times
the size of any cat.

112
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:09,543
Whatever it was,
it brought the plane down.

113
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,241
Who are you people?

114
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,367
We're with a private
research foundation.

115
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,079
The creature we brought back was unique,
and I deeply regret what happened.

116
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,804
Our intention was to transport it

117
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,166
to our facility in New Delhi
run by Dr. Grant here.

118
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,672
I have many such sanctuaries
around the world.

119
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,347
New Delhi was the closest,
and with such dangerous cargo...

120
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,924
Yeah, well, hooray for you
and your safety protocols,

121
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,636
- because they worked like a charm.
- We didn't mean for this to happen.

122
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,552
- We took every precaution possible.
- Really? 'Cause he's dead!

123
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,881
We're stranded here,
and your cargo?

124
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,118
Gone.

125
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,477
Or is it?

126
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,898
- We don't know.
- What does that mean?

127
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,461
That means
we could be attacked at any time...

128
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:50,319
That is extremely unlikely.

129
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,991
These creatures are incredibly shy
and used to their natural habitat.

130
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,257
If it did survive, it would have sought
refuge higher up the mountain.

131
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:58,077
Shy?

132
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,955
That creature, whatever the hell it was,
almost killed every one of us!

133
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,034
- And who the hell is he?
- A stowaway.

134
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,261
A sherpa who helped us
capture the creature.

135
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:10,444
Really? Well, good for you! How about
you go out there and do it again!

136
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,383
- This time make sure it's dead!
- Hey!

137
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,118
You obviously have a problem
knowing when to shut up, man.

138
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,273
He wanted to come back with us.

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,685
He has family in Peshawar
he hasn't seen in years.

140
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,571
Why not just ask for a lift?

141
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,870
He was afraid
that you would refuse him.

142
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,770
He's very sorry that he deceived you,
and he asks for your forgiveness.

143
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:43,050
Well, you certainly picked
the wrong flight.

144
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,314
Even though rescue will be here soon,
we still need to keep warm.

145
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,189
It will help us with the shock
of what we've just endured.

146
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:53,577
Everyone, find some tools
and help seal up the plane.

147
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,309
Yes, ma'am.

148
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:39,676
A storm.

149
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,153
An arctic outflow system
moving into the region really fast.

150
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:44,278
It's huge.

151
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,580
Rescue teams won't be able to get into
the region until the weather clears.

152
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,857
The size of this one,
it could take days.

153
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,476
Grab our winter gear. I'll have Hans get
a plane ready. Wheels up in four hours.

154
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:59,744
I want us leading the rescue team
the second the weather breaks.

155
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,560
All right,
that outta do it.

156
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,919
We're not much better off in here.

157
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,958
This is for a few days,
until the storm passes.

158
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:11,882
Kid, I've been fixing planes
up here for 15 years.

159
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,426
Storms in this part of the world

160
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:16,270
are not like the winter storms
in your part of the world.

161
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,450
They can last a few weeks
before they roll out.

162
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:21,296
- A few weeks?
- Do you know what "Hindu Kush" means?

163
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,280
"Slayer of Hindus".

164
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:27,073
So named by the locals here
because they believe

165
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,384
that the weather and the mountains
were created by God

166
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,959
for the sole purpose
of killing people.

167
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,358
Fun place for a plane crash, huh?

168
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,022
All right.

169
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,812
That'll do it.
Try to find a place to sleep.

170
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,837
I wasn't hiding, you know...

171
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,933
When it happened.

172
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,381
- No one's saying that you were.
- You're thinking it.

173
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,659
Everybody's thinking it.

174
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,393
Everyone was terrified.

175
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,519
You weren't.

176
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,434
It's different for me.
I've been doing this for a long time.

177
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,552
You think we crashed
because I wasn't in the cockpit,

178
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:15,695
that I should have been there,
tried to keep us in the air.

179
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:19,623
- I had to use the restroom, all right?
- Please...

180
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,588
Try to get some sleep, all right?

181
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:30,664
Oh, please tell me that that is tea.

182
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,251
Gods are on vacation.

183
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:34,692
It's coffee.

184
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,767
- Here.
- Pass.

185
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,378
Come on, it'll help you keep warm.

186
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:42,989
I have standards, Will.
Drinking coffee? Well below them.

187
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,362
Man, you are a brit
to the core, aren't you?

188
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:47,737
And proud of it.

189
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,508
So, taking stock of things.

190
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,412
We don't have a lot of food left,
maybe a day or so,

191
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,070
and the heater fuel
won't last much longer either.

192
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
All right.

193
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,052
We'll ration everything
very carefully.

194
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,206
This could be home
for a long while.

195
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,394
You never know.

196
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,803
This place,
a little redecorating...

197
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,792
Probably still feel like
a doomed hellhole.

198
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,253
Is that your way of saying
any port in the storm?

199
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:23,175
It's my way of coping with the fact that
this is the world's worst cup of coffee.

200
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,594
Rule britannia.

201
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:03,864
What do you want?

202
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:16,770
My love.

203
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,450
No!

204
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,516
Magnus, what's happening?

205
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,921
The co-pilot appears
to have committed suicide.

206
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,757
This is crazy.
Why would we he do that?

207
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:45,966
Give some space.

208
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,165
Come on.

209
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:56,018
Looks like he used
a broken piece of glass.

210
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,854
Why would he just
give up like this?

211
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,181
I mean, I know the rescue
is delayed, but still.

212
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,897
Hardly in keeping
with aviation regulations,

213
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,788
plus he abandoned his post
when the creature attacked.

214
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,940
Who knows what other skeletons
he had in his closet?

215
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,013
What if it wasn't a suicide?

216
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,675
No sign of a struggle.

217
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,210
No screams, cries for help,
any of which would have woken us up.

218
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,420
Unless he knew his attacker.

219
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,448
You said Strickland felt
people were angry at him

220
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,802
for not helping fly the plane
when the creature attacked.

221
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,202
What if he was right?

222
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:36,882
Mad enough to kill?

223
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:40,187
With all of us here
and absolutely no place to hide?

224
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:43,731
A bit of a stretch.

225
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:45,499
Sorry,

226
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,195
but you pay me
for my outlandish theories.

227
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,759
Tashi, right?

228
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,588
Toshi?

229
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,116
That's your name?

230
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:53,837
Sylvio.

231
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,762
Did I ever tell you
about my fiancee, Giselle?

232
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,349
She and I got something
real nice going on.

233
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:04,730
I hunt monsters.

234
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,053
I catch 'em and bring 'em back,

235
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,248
alive or dead,

236
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:12,883
for cash.

237
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,428
Cash I'm using to set me
and my girl up real nice,

238
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,218
so if you stowed away on this plane

239
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:21,709
to take a shot at me,

240
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,541
or come between me
and the money I'm owed?

241
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,791
Nothing personal,
sherpa man, but...

242
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,888
I will end you.

243
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,113
- <i>Will, stay where you are.</i>
- No...

244
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,949
- <i>Just stay put.</i>
- Mom?

245
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,317
<i>Will...</i>

246
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,296
I'll be right back.

247
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,562
Come on.
It's getting ugly.

248
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,283
What the hell was that thing,
to take us all out in our sleep?

249
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,460
- You tell me.
- What's going on here?

250
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:23,957
Seems Tashi caught
Mr. Sneaky mechanic here

251
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,728
trying to steal
some of our hardware.

252
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,873
One of my best sellers.

253
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:31,483
Gonna shoot a weapons dealer
with his own gun?

254
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,448
You can see how
the irony is lost on me!

255
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,960
It was for protection, all right?

256
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,576
You don't think I see
that you're all packing weapons?

257
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,761
I'm just trying to level
the playing field here.

258
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,496
It's not even loaded.
Let him go.

259
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,375
Mr. Braun, these cases are our property,
and I'll thank you to remember that

260
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,672
even under these trying circumstances,

261
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,046
and the weapons we carry
are for everyone's protection.

262
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,966
- Then give me a gun.
- That is definitely not happening.

263
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,844
So I'm supposed to sit here
and let one of you kill me in my sleep?

264
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,614
No, I don't think so.
I'm not going down without a fight.

265
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,107
- Someone shut him up?
- Or I could start with you.

266
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,861
Everyone, get some sleep.

267
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,309
John?

268
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,730
I promise

269
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,693
to make you happy, Helen,

270
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:49,192
for all eternity.

271
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Sylvio...

272
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,124
Sylvio...

273
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Giselle?

274
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:34,250
Hey, baby.

275
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:38,751
Are you for real, girl?

276
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:40,829
Kiss me and find out.

277
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,194
I love you, baby.

278
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,431
We've lost a valuable member
of our team.

279
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,773
Severe abdominal laceration,
and he had to have been killed here.

280
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:36,805
There'd be a mess if he were moved.

281
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,610
There are no other injuries.
No defensive wounds.

282
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:41,340
Like he let somebody stab him.

283
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,880
What is wrong with you people?
We know who killed him.

284
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,026
I mean, come on, look!

285
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,487
- Mr. Braun.
- Calm down.

286
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,047
He did it, and I can prove it.

287
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:52,225
Really? How?

288
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,511
Around his neck. Look.

289
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,816
I've seen other sherpas with that,

290
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,488
ones that believe that the yeti
is some kind of god.

291
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,276
The Order of Pangboche.

292
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:08,026
A group of Tibetan mystics
who worship the creature as a protector.

293
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,868
So now we know who let
the damn thing loose in the first place.

294
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:15,012
What more reason would he need
to kill us all?

295
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:19,046
We tried to steal
his people's damn sacred cow.

296
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,718
Hold on. What is he saying?

297
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,606
He says the medallion
was a gift from his cousin,

298
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,463
that he doesn't worship
the creature,

299
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,333
and why would he help
to capture something to free it again?

300
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,900
Revenge. To teach us a lesson
so we don't try and hunt it again...

301
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,400
Hold on, hold on.

302
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,237
Now, Tashi claims that he's not part
of this Pangboche Order, correct?

303
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,652
And, I'm sorry, but having a medallion
is hardly proof of intent to kill.

304
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:50,659
Will's right.

305
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,450
We can't condemn a man
because of his beliefs.

306
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:54,956
Leave him alone.

307
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,667
- I get it.
- Braun...

308
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,838
I get it.

309
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,911
You had sherpa boy kill Strickland,

310
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:05,841
and then you had him murder
the weapons guy.

311
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,626
Why? Because you owed him money?
So you take me out,

312
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:11,495
and there you go, no more witnesses
to your little massacre.

313
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:13,598
You're being completely irrational.

314
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,392
There are still too many questions.

315
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:18,225
No, no, no, see,
I will not go quietly.

316
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,856
No, no.
Go ahead and try,

317
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,064
but I'll fight you.

318
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,365
- I'll go keep an eye on him.
- Take Tashi with you.

319
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,837
All right, what the hell...
What the hell is going on here?

320
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,803
Why would somebody go on a killing spree
in a stranded plane?

321
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,161
They wouldn't.

322
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:45,432
Come here.

323
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:54,806
I need to ask you something,
and it may sound strange.

324
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,009
Believe me,
I'm getting very used to strange.

325
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:01,308
Have you had any dreams,

326
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:02,805
hallucinations?

327
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,312
Incredibly vivid.
Too real to ignore?

328
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:09,803
- People who couldn't possibly be there.
- And you can feel their presence, yes.

329
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,063
It's tricks of the mind.
Post-traumatic stress,

330
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,929
plus the elevation and exhaustion.

331
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,329
I thought so too,
but I'm beginning to have doubts.

332
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,271
Why do you say that?

333
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,155
Describe his wounds.

334
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:31,401
Deep cross-length laceration.

335
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:33,766
Interesting.

336
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,349
I see a diagonal laceration
from palm to forearm.

337
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:42,062
What?
Well, how is that possible?

338
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,648
- One of us has to be right.
- Or we're both wrong.

339
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:48,530
Something is affecting our minds,
clouding our judgment.

340
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,933
What do you mean, like mind control?

341
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:53,698
But there's nobody
on this plane who could...

342
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:57,801
The creature...

343
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,915
- You think it's among us?
- And hiding in plain sight,

344
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,306
using this telepathic power
to conceal itself.

345
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:09,673
- What, by making itself invisible?
- Or by posing as one of us.

346
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:12,467
It can make us see things
that aren't even real.

347
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,761
Why would it hang around?
This is its terrain.

348
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,205
It marked this as its hunting ground.
It sees us as a threat.

349
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,396
Abnormals aren't like humans.

350
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,602
They don't play by the same rules
that we understand.

351
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,745
Clearly it's having an effect on us.
We can't trust anything that we see

352
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,519
or hear or even feel.

353
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,283
But there's got to be some way
of knowing who we can trust.

354
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,080
Wait.

355
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,374
"A hardy breed..."

356
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,921
If its natural habitat
is sub-arctic temperatures,

357
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:48,064
then it would have to have
a pretty special physiology, right?

358
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,005
Even for an abnormal.

359
00:26:08,823 --> 00:26:11,106
How will this show us anything?
We don't have any equipment.

360
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:14,613
- We can't do a proper analysis.
- We have exactly what we need.

361
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,200
This creature thrives in high altitudes
and extremely low temperatures.

362
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:20,802
It would have to have
some sort of protective protein

363
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,703
or antibody in its blood,

364
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:25,722
otherwise it would never be able
to survive the harsh conditions.

365
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:29,567
Now, normal blood will freeze
in temperatures this low in minutes.

366
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,254
The creature's won't.

367
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:34,023
- How can one of us be...
- It's just a theory, Allison,

368
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,277
hopefully one we can rule out.

369
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,404
All right,
10 minutes should be enough time.

370
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,726
I'm sorry.
This situation is just...

371
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,937
- I'm trying to stay calm.
- We all are.

372
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:59,449
Believe me, I've been
in far worse situations than this.

373
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,743
- You have?
- Absolutely.

374
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,157
There was a town of zombies
in Uganda,

375
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:07,874
and of course I ran out of ammunition
just as night fell.

376
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,695
A deep sea capsule I was in

377
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,838
was trapped underneath
a gigantic mutated squid,

378
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,763
and there was an escaped lunatic

379
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,385
who was able to turn himself
into a giant ape.

380
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:20,195
Thanks.

381
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:22,896
You just made all that up,
didn't you?

382
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,306
Only two of them.

383
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,635
My point is,

384
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:28,503
you just have to keep trying,
no matter what.

385
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:30,569
That's how we'll stay alive.

386
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,901
What if your test doesn't work?

387
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,820
- What then?
- We'll try something else.

388
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:40,156
- Well, hurray, Mr. Positive.
- Braun, do me a favor, all right?

389
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,492
Just drop this whole
"I'm angry at the world" routine,

390
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,412
- cause it's getting very old.
- What are you, some kind of a shrink?

391
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:48,829
Yes.

392
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,584
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- So what?

393
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,210
Have you been psychoanalyzing me
the whole time?

394
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,250
What's your prognosis, Doc?

395
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:58,401
Angry at my mommy?
Didn't get enough toys...

396
00:27:58,526 --> 00:27:59,759
You're afraid,

397
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,268
and there's a lot of that going around,
so it doesn't make you so special.

398
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,247
But it does make me human.

399
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:30,877
Braun.

400
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:35,795
I see the same thing.

401
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,212
Just stay calm.

402
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,444
It isn't me.

403
00:28:51,191 --> 00:28:52,942
- It isn't me...
- Just calm down.

404
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,834
I'm not the creature.

405
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,907
Just until the rescue arrives.

406
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:03,656
You don't have to do this.
I'm not a monster, all right?

407
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:06,939
I've been seeing things, yes, okay?

408
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:09,989
I've been seeing things
that I can't explain.

409
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:13,320
But that does not make me a monster.

410
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,857
This is for your own safety
as well as ours.

411
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:18,004
Mr. Braun, please,
we really have no choice.

412
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,459
I can't do small spaces.

413
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,470
Please.

414
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,694
Please...

415
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:37,753
<i>Please, don't.
Please...</i>

416
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,049
<i>I'm not the monster.</i>

417
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:42,837
<i>Please, I'm not the monster, please!</i>

418
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:02,692
<i>I'm not good in...
I'm not good in small spaces.</i>

419
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,767
<i>Oh, please...
I'm human.</i>

420
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,468
<i>I'm human like you.
Please.</i>

421
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,061
<i>Oh, please, help.</i>

422
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:21,638
<i>I'm not a monster.</i>

423
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,633
Oh, my God!

424
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,559
Did he see anything?

425
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:57,441
No, he says he felt like
something overcame him

426
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,701
and made him feel like
he was in a dream,

427
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,483
even though he swears he was awake.

428
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,270
But he was in front of the compartment.

429
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,245
Did he hear anything?
Did Braun call for help?

430
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:21,811
He was back in his village.
He was at a celebration.

431
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:24,752
He was dancing
at his wedding with his wife.

432
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,303
And then he felt like
he was possessed

433
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,347
by something evil.

434
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,808
All right.
Tashi, come with us.

435
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,544
Just to clarify, you're not
seeing a monster, right?

436
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:04,420
Are you?

437
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:05,881
I wish I was.

438
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,425
How does the guy we id as the creature
turn out to be its next victim?

439
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,000
Because he's human.

440
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,972
I've just run the test again.

441
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:23,953
But we both saw it before.

442
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,497
It wasn't frozen.

443
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,916
We saw what the creature
wanted us to see,

444
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,291
in order to throw us off the scent.

445
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,118
I should have anticipated
something like this.

446
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,854
The legends about the creature.

447
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:38,148
Some call it a skinwalker.
Others say it eats your soul.

448
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,270
Add the fact
no one's ever caught one,

449
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,975
I should have realized the initial
capture went down too easily.

450
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,650
Tashi said that he was at his wedding,
dancing with his wife.

451
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:50,941
With each kill, it's like we enter
this vivid dream-like state

452
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,107
that distracts us from the events.

453
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:55,763
It knows exactly what to show us
in order to divert our focus.

454
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,262
But why?

455
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:00,101
I mean, why is it just hanging around,
picking us off one by one?

456
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:02,562
Perhaps it has no choice.

457
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:07,116
It has to be here to survive, too.

458
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:28,831
What do you see?

459
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,215
I see a door off its hinges.

460
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,054
Touch it.

461
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,549
Now, try to see
what's really there.

462
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:51,819
I see a lock.

463
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,083
I don't.

464
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:03,928
There's no lock.

465
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,779
There's no damage.

466
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:13,006
The door was open the entire time?

467
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,982
- The less we use our eyes...
- The more we see.

468
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,997
Okay, okay, so,
what are we not looking for, then?

469
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
There.

470
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,224
These couldn't have been made
by the creature we believe we saw.

471
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,427
It barely had enough room to move in,
and its claws were four times this size.

472
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:32,706
And don't cold weather mammals
molt under stress?

473
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:35,029
There's no sign
of any fur in here.

474
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,407
So there never was
a 400-pound yeti.

475
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,909
These scratches were made
by something much smaller,

476
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,524
almost human sized.

477
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:45,379
It just made us think we were dealing
with something far more intimidating,

478
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:48,754
likely whatever our subconscious
dictated it would be.

479
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:52,052
Okay, so if what we saw before
was just a Jedi mind trick,

480
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,853
what the hell does
this thing look like?

481
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:55,228
I have no idea,

482
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:58,415
but it's a good bet that it's
as vulnerable to the cold as we are,

483
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,890
hence its need to blend in among us
in order to survive.

484
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:03,904
Magnus...

485
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:06,446
- how do I know that...
- I'm me?

486
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,073
- Yeah.
- You don't.

487
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:12,197
Nor am I certain that you're you.
The creature could be any one of us.

488
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,936
I keep thinking there must be
some way of telling, you know?

489
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:17,363
A way of knowing
if the person's really them.

490
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,449
We'll have to rely
on the little things.

491
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,869
Like the fact that the real you wouldn't
insult me by giving me false hope.

492
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,372
Or the fact you keep offering me
that horrible brown sludge to drink.

493
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:34,005
You know, that thing's
never attacked two of us at once,

494
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,548
which means it's only powerful enough
to handle one of us at a time.

495
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,010
So alone, we're vulnerable.

496
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:41,387
We stay close, we live.

497
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:44,994
I'll take first watch.

498
00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:48,898
All right, this is
the last gas canister.

499
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:53,031
It's going to get cold tonight.

500
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:27,781
<i>Will, stay where you are.</i>

501
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:30,457
- <i>Just stay put.</i>
- Mom...

502
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:33,538
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

503
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,596
They're here...
They're here.

504
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:56,087
Hey, they're here!
They're here!

505
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,885
- Heard you were looking for a lift?
- Ashley!

506
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,929
It's good to see you, Big Guy!

507
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,012
Okay, we've only got
a short break in the storm,

508
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,472
so let's get you guys
out of here, pronto!

509
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:11,147
I'll help the others.

510
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,607
Will, come on!

511
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:17,908
Okay!

512
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:31,425
Will, come on, move it!

513
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,879
This isn't real.

514
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,714
Put on your harness!

515
00:37:42,217 --> 00:37:43,217
You're not real!

516
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,657
Allison!

517
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:25,573
No!

518
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,515
<i>Did you ever love me?</i>

519
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,261
I mean, truly love me?

520
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,795
You know I'm just an element
of your subconscious mind,

521
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,270
so feel free
to be completely frank.

522
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:11,417
When I first knew you at Oxford,

523
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:13,849
I loved you with my entire being.

524
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:18,261
Those were passionate times,

525
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,640
gone too quickly...

526
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,312
Followed by very dark days.

527
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:29,490
You destroyed my heart, John.

528
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:34,662
Even though I understood
why you had changed, your ailment,

529
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,313
the hatred you felt towards me,

530
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:40,773
and the way
you would harm our daughter.

531
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,648
Let me make it up to you.

532
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,733
I need you to wake up.

533
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:49,596
<i>Now!</i>

534
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,335
You all right?

535
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:58,769
You look like you were having
a hell of a dream.

536
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:03,274
I must have dozed off.
Is everything...

537
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:05,314
Everything's fine,

538
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:08,360
though you were supposed
to be keeping watch.

539
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,322
I'll take over if you want.

540
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:20,740
Magnus!

541
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:21,865
<i>Will...</i>

542
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:23,753
Stay where you are.

543
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:29,383
Mom?

544
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:31,886
We never got a chance to talk.

545
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,972
Talk with me, Will.

546
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,183
You're not real.

547
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,894
- Does that really matter?
- You died when I was eight!

548
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,782
You don't even know me anymore!

549
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,902
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

550
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:54,950
Stay with me.

551
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:01,989
I can't.

552
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:08,776
I can't!

553
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:14,089
Seriously, you should get some sleep.
I got your back.

554
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:28,563
I'm chilled to the bone.

555
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,436
Could you make me
something hot to drink?

556
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:33,611
Yeah, sure.
I'll make some tea.

557
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:36,363
I'd prefer coffee.

558
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:38,494
Of course.

559
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,932
You finally got one.

560
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,400
The first capture ever.

561
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,411
Hell of a cost.

562
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,681
That's beyond ugly.

563
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,299
How did you know it wasn't me?

564
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:36,114
Like I said,

565
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,226
it's the little things.

566
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:42,335
The less we use our eyes...

567
00:42:45,615 --> 00:42:47,065
Welcome to reality.

568
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,128
I'm happy to be here.
