00:00:00,716 --> 00:00:02,466
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:06,741
There's only one reason
you would have taken this risk,

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:09,223
- to risk her.
- Her life is in your hands, Helen.

4
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:12,027
I don't think you want to lose her
over something as easily accessible

5
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,524
as your own blood.

6
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:16,651
The Cabal started
infiltrating businesses,

7
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,560
military think tanks...
all under their control.

8
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,310
- Holy crap.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:24,482
I mean, these guys are
one James Bond film away

10
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,108
from global domination.

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,152
- So stealing their property...
- No, no, no.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,768
Would not go over well.

13
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,988
I'd be careful what you do next.

14
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:34,533
The people I work for
aren't the forgiving type.

15
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:36,490
The... Five...

16
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:39,571
will... come...

17
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,565
This case study shows
an enlarged hypothalamus...

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,289
nearly twice the size
of a normal human.

19
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:53,597
Such increased scale

20
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,776
is often the first indicator
of abnormal abilities,

21
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,901
which is why detailed
brain-mapping is often

22
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,686
our best recourse
when diagnosing new patients.

23
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:04,292
In this situation,

24
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,565
the patient was able
to lower her body temperature

25
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:10,166
to well below life-sustaing levels
for days at a time.

26
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:15,415
Such examples
of this simple genetic mutation

27
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,996
are part of a larger-scale trend
we're seeing worldwide.

28
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,904
More appearances
of extraordinary genetic abilities

29
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,047
are cropping up
at an ever-increasing rate.

30
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,287
Excuse me.

31
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:29,723
<i>Grazie.</i>

32
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:41,536
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

33
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,800
An urgent matter has come up.

34
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,793
Can we take a short recess?

35
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>Fare una breve pausa?</i>

36
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,958
Kiss me and I'll save your life.

37
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:08,210
And if I don't?

38
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,297
It's been over 60 years.
Just plant one on me already.

39
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,719
Nikola Tesla.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,101
You always did know
how to get attention.

41
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,914
And you're still boring as ever
when it comes to giving a lecture.

42
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,480
But, to business...
Cabal agents are all over the building.

43
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:28,661
If we don't leave now, things
are going to get rather bullet-ridden.

44
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:30,584
And why should I believe you?

45
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,978
I assume you have a plan,
other than kissing me?

46
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,523
Genius, remember?

47
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,291
Beauty before brains.

48
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:54,342
- Charming.
- I know.

49
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:58,136
It's part of a 200-year-old system
of catacombs underneath the city.

50
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,360
- I'm assuming there are other exits?
- Should be.

51
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,542
- My contact said there would be.
- Contact?

52
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,142
Concierge at my hotel.

53
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,765
Don't you love Rome?

54
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,849
Get me thermal imaging
of these tunnels ASAP.

55
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,404
Make sure every possible exit
is covered.

56
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,866
They either surrender, or they die.

57
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,326
The Team Projet-SG

58
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,036
presents:

59
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,248
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 07
The Five (v. 1.00)

60
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,752
Timing by: Arrow,
Golgi, nitrogenc.

61
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,563
http://projet-sg.net

62
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,322
Hey, Big Man.

63
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,146
Didn't we have a staff meeting
scheduled for this morning?

64
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,668
It was canceled.

65
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,055
- When?
- Last night.

66
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,412
- Because?
- Ashley.

67
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,917
Just because Magnus is away
does not mean

68
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,170
we stop going about business
as usual.

69
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:15,760
I mean, she put me in charge,
and I wanna take that very seriously.

70
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:20,031
So, we've got patients to discuss,
possible cases that need investigating,

71
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:22,807
and, you know...
other stuff that needs attention.

72
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,430
Meetings are boring.

73
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,561
They really are, aren't they?

74
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:38,008
Okay. I'm cool with that.
No meeting.

75
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,050
So...

76
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,970
What do you guys do
when you've got the place to yourselves?

77
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:47,661
Poker night?
Maybe a little blackjack?

78
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,947
You blast some tunes
in the main library?

79
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,542
Henry's in the lab,

80
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:54,938
Squid requested a meeting
with Ashley,

81
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,046
and I'm making things look nice.

82
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:05,679
Perhaps you have some work
that needs attending to?

83
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:12,230
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

84
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,605
Shall I look into it?

85
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,933
If you don't mind. Because...

86
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:18,984
I actually do have
some work I need to do.

87
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,174
I'm not really in charge here, am I?

88
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:38,274
Right.

89
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,251
Got you some treats.

90
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,412
I was surprised to get your message.

91
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,537
I thought you said
you didn't have any info for me.

92
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:10,893
You gotta be kidding me.

93
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,403
Through here!

94
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,526
They're really pissed at you.
What did you do?

95
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,556
I stole three witches
from a crypt in Scotland.

96
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,552
Stealing? You?
I'm appalled.

97
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:38,023
- Shut up and help me.
- My God, you look sexy with a gun.

98
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,353
Leave her alone!

99
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,012
That's enough!

100
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,756
Well, that was exciting, huh?

101
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,418
A little too much so.

102
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:07,366
You haven't stopped taking
your medication, have you?

103
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,941
I just...
I just got a little excited.

104
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,005
Come on, Helen.
I don't feed on humans.

105
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,019
I made that vow long ago,
and I intend to keep it.

106
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:35,937
Your favorite parlor trick.

107
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:37,737
This way, m'lady.

108
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:40,209
You haven't lost your touch,
I'll give you that.

109
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:52,693
- Any idea what could have done this?
- Many ideas.

110
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,086
None that make sense.

111
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:58,619
Yeah, I guess none of the abnormals
Magnus allows to roam would do this.

112
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,858
Not if they wish to remain free.

113
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,524
Crap in a bag!
What the hell did that?

114
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,765
Just asking the same question.

115
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,733
Scratch marks on the floor and walls,
plus, damage to the electrical wiring.

116
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,621
Whatever did this took live voltage.

117
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,986
Maybe it's lying in a corner somewhere,
licking its wounds?

118
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:18,125
Problem is, there're lots of corners
in this place.

119
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,684
All our residents accounted for?

120
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,767
The security systems would've gone off
if something got free from the Shoe.

121
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:25,812
Still, let's round up all the abnormals
that are free and interview them.

122
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:29,133
I'll check security logs, see if
anything went goofy with the system.

123
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,614
Plus, if you have surveillance camera
for this floor, that'd be great.

124
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:33,748
On it.

125
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:56,785
Come on.
There'll be more where they came from.

126
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,746
This is fun, isn't it?
Just like old times, back in London.

127
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,621
What was that?
'42? '43?

128
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,622
- I prefer not to think about it.
- Come on, Helen!

129
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,748
Every major spy agency in the world
was looking for me.

130
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,374
I needed your help.

131
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:12,553
And, besides,
what's a faked death among friends?

132
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,632
Whose hair-brained notion was it
to supply every allied government

133
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,347
with plans for
your death-ray weapon?

134
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,739
I thought they'd all share,
and that peace would break out. I did.

135
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:24,104
I did.
I had my Nobel speech all memorized.

136
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,799
This sector's clear.
Let's move on.

137
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,837
How did you know
the Cabal were after me?

138
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,575
I watch them, and they watch me.

139
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:40,600
We've had a few entanglements
over the years, but, you know,

140
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:44,135
I've never done anything so stupid
as to actually steal from them.

141
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,896
I've had my contacts keeping an ear
to the ground for any Cabal movements

142
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,996
since they attacked my Sanctuary.

143
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,260
I would've known beforehand
if they were gonna make a move on me.

144
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:53,442
In fact...

145
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,655
they didn't show up
until after you arrived.

146
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,641
They're not after me, are they?
They want you.

147
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,811
You haven't lost your touch, either.

148
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:20,749
Okay, you can come out and gloat now.
I'm awake.

149
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:23,080
There'll be no gloating.

150
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,651
I find that...

151
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:27,015
extremely ill-mannered.

152
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,335
Well, what's your next move, then?

153
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,502
You gonna teleport me
to the top of the Eiffel Tower

154
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,828
and leave me hanging
by my underpants?

155
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,631
- Or are you going to make it fast?
- Neither.

156
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,006
- Then what do you want from me?
- Honestly?

157
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:44,768
I need your help.

158
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,649
You have a kind of violent way
of asking for help, FYI.

159
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,269
I wish you no harm.

160
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,767
It was urgent that we speak.

161
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,189
And I'm listening.
Let the insanity fly.

162
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:00,993
Of course that's what
you'd think of me.

163
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,315
That I am unstable...
Deranged.

164
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,445
That's pretty much what I call everybody
who feeds me to lizard creatures.

165
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,126
But I can be a bit harsh sometimes.

166
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,279
Ashley, what happened before was...

167
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,146
deeply regrettable.

168
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:19,521
I apologize for my actions,
without reservation.

169
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,391
I can only ask for your forgiveness.

170
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,873
There are things you need to know...

171
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:27,960
about your mother.

172
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,189
She's in grave danger.

173
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,932
Dude, she's my mom.
She's always in grave danger.

174
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:36,174
Please, Ashley!
There's little time.

175
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:40,653
- I need to know where she is.
- Me, handcuffed to a chair.

176
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:44,402
You, babbling about time and danger.

177
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,576
No.
I don't see why I should help you.

178
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,833
I would like nothing more
than to free you...

179
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,657
but you would undoubtedly
try to kill me.

180
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:56,923
Me?

181
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,304
Did your mother not give you some sort
of explanation as to who I was?

182
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,019
She told me you were someone
from her days back in London

183
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,683
before she set up shop here.

184
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,044
And that she was pretty sure
you'd never return because...

185
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:14,691
she'd killed you.

186
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,796
Trust me, I'll be speaking to her
about that...

187
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,656
- Talk about a blown call.
- We don't have time for this.

188
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:26,074
My sole purpose in bringing you here
is for your own benefit as well as hers.

189
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:28,164
You'll have to trust me.

190
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,493
You've always been reckless,

191
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,692
but contacting me
while the Cabal was following you...

192
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:43,621
I know. It's not one of my best ideas,
but, hey, I had no choice.

193
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:47,118
- I needed to see you.
- Then use the proper channels.

194
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:50,014
Contact one of my facilities
and have them arrange a secure location.

195
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,547
Would you rather have me endanger
one of your sanctuaries or you?

196
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,769
How about neither?

197
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:56,815
You disappeard before the end of WWII,
never to be seen or heard from again.

198
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,290
Well, I did die a lonely,
impoverished, pitiful old man.

199
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,280
Thanks for the funeral.
I heard it was nice.

200
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,305
I faked your death to save your life,
so that your work could continue.

201
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,135
I think I'm owed an explanation
as to your whereabouts since then.

202
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,762
Hey, perfecting the use of electricity
and radiowaves?

203
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,583
Hard acts to follow, okay?
But I have kept busy.

204
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,528
At Oxford, what we did
was more than just pushing boundaries.

205
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:20,048
- For me, it was personal.
- As it was for all of us.

206
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:25,859
You all changed.

207
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:28,749
Whereas I found out who I really am.

208
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,050
And the more I embrace that,

209
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,854
the more I realize just
how little I've accomplished.

210
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,693
Your gifts to the world will live on
long after you die...

211
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,484
Whenever you die.

212
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:42,565
You think you can call
this existence living?

213
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,964
The Cabal hunt me at every turn.

214
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:46,407
But why?

215
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,608
You've been underground for decades.

216
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,455
We both know the Cabal only go after
what they perceive to be of value.

217
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:53,999
Or a threat.

218
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,813
Pull our people back.

219
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,090
Get these guys out of here.

220
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:15,483
I want the l-rad down here
and set up in three minutes.

221
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:23,061
Another one?

222
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:26,030
That's the second attack
in two hours.

223
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,856
I never saw what it was.

224
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,868
It came from the ceiling.

225
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,622
Oh, moved way too fast.

226
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,711
What about him?
Did he see anything?

227
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,648
No. I was...

228
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,172
He was meditating when it happened.

229
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,342
- If it's in the elevator system...
- Yeah.

230
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,055
It can get to anywhere
in the Sanctuary.

231
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,968
All right, let's get him
to the infirmary,

232
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,184
and then we'll meet up
at Henry's lab.

233
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,535
Okay, ready?
One... two... three!

234
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,393
Footage of the first
two attacks came up empty...

235
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,543
Likely cause whatever it is shorted out
the power to the surveillance systems

236
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,091
before it struck.

237
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,360
Yeah, we should have caught something
in the camera in the elevator.

238
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,862
I'm having a look.

239
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,454
You okay?

240
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,103
Yeah, it's just a flu going around.
I'm fine.

241
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,324
Whatever it is, it's damn fast.

242
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:40,322
Can you slow it down
and enhance the image?

243
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,787
Yes! But take the safety off first...
What?

244
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,370
I'm fine. I'm...

245
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,201
You have fever.

246
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,085
- You should rest.
- No, I can hack it.

247
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,458
No, no, maybe the Big Guy's right.
You should get some rest.

248
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,312
But, listen, before you go,

249
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,901
can you bring up the footage
of the corridors above and below

250
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:06,103
- where the attack took place?
- Let him rest.

251
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:07,727
He will work later.

252
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,221
- Show me how to access the footage...
- He's going to rest now.

253
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:18,711
Get better.

254
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,140
Why would the Cabal
see you as a threat?

255
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,721
I'm a vampire.
Some people are threatened by that.

256
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:27,277
Only part, Nikola.

257
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,970
Pure-blood vampires
were wiped out centuries ago.

258
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:33,757
Besides, you alone are not enough
to make the Cabal this angry.

259
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,960
What's really going on?

260
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,555
The ancient ones...

261
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,985
they were intelligent, gifted,
powerful...

262
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,211
Until a bunch of church-folk decided
that our race was impure...

263
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,255
evil.

264
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:50,046
So not only did they hunt them down,
kill them off,

265
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,949
but they turned our species
into a cultural joke.

266
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:56,758
Ancient vampires were the Caesars,
the Pharaohs of civilization.

267
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:59,221
Humans were enslaved.
They rose up with good reason.

268
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,501
- If the world knew the truth...
- Humans were conquered

269
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:04,299
because we were smarter
and stronger.

270
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,858
And when vampires ruled the world,
it was a golden age.

271
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:09,795
Science, art, architecture,
all advanced.

272
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,694
And after they killed them off,
what happened?

273
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,199
The dark ages.

274
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,444
Now people think
we're allergic to garlic

275
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,971
and that we can turn into bats
at will.

276
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,914
It's beyond insulting.

277
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,416
This way.

278
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:28,338
- <i>Sir, all teams are in fall-back.</i>
- Good.

279
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,678
Let's clean 'em out.

280
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:41,711
As though a vial of stale water
blessed by some priest

281
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,051
would have any other effect
than a bad taste in my...

282
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:47,232
- Earthquake?
- Worse!

283
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,349
I want to suck your blood.

284
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,313
Get down from there.

285
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:30,576
Irony is...

286
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,970
I once owned the patent
to that weapon.

287
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:36,507
I never should've sold it to Edison,
cheapskate that he was.

288
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,939
Do you think this is funny?

289
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,410
Tricking me into helping you

290
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,935
with whatever game
you're playing with the Cabal?

291
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,772
I don't appreciate
being put in the line of fire.

292
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,168
You've always been like this.

293
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,493
Selfish and arrogant.
Your own desires before everyone else's.

294
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,844
I brought you here for two reasons.

295
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:56,111
Because only you can help me
finish what I'm working on,

296
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,835
- and because I love you.
- Yes, so you keep...

297
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,638
What?

298
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:02,974
I always have.

299
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,068
More than that lunatic Druitt
ever did.

300
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,986
I misled you, and I deeply apologize
for that, but I had to see you.

301
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:18,444
You're serious, aren't you?

302
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,296
We knew each other in London,
your mother and I.

303
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,411
When we were young.

304
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,114
In fact, we were rather close.

305
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:38,096
- See, now I know you're full of crap.
- Because she's 158 years old?

306
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,192
First off, she's 157.

307
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,874
And I get that she's special.

308
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,570
It's some sort of accident
of her genetic make-up.

309
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:49,121
But the chances of two people
having the same defect...

310
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:51,418
Are much higher if it's no accident.

311
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,304
You're sure?

312
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,420
This is tedious.

313
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,331
Should we talk here?

314
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,041
What are you doing?

315
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,565
- Or here?
- Oh, my God!

316
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,632
Stop this!

317
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,389
As I said, there's little time!
I need to know where Helen is!

318
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,989
It knew how to disable
the motion detectors.

319
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,740
Made us blind on purpose.

320
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:38,914
It's that intelligent?

321
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,491
The most dangerous things are.

322
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:44,923
Check this out.

323
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,161
A scale?

324
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,289
Looks almost reptilian.

325
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:55,370
- You think it's still here?
- Unlikely.

326
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,235
Diazepam.

327
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:12,707
It's a garden-variety sedative.

328
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:15,648
Treats everything
from insomnia to seizures.

329
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,312
Looks like whatever did this
wanted some badly.

330
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,822
What kind of abnormal has the ferocity
and power of a wild animal

331
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:34,372
combined with the cunning
and intellect of a human?

332
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,568
Other than,

333
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,007
you know, you.

334
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:44,860
Back at Oxford,

335
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,743
the others used the source
for power and greed, but you...

336
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:52,644
You altered yourself
out of pure desire for knowledge.

337
00:21:58,145 --> 00:21:59,871
You're the only scientist,

338
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,779
perhaps the only person,
I've ever really admired.

339
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,195
Come on.

340
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:09,514
This picture was taken by...

341
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:11,265
Henry Talbot

342
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,460
in Southampton...

343
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:14,874
1880...

344
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,943
- something, I forget the exact date.
- Where did you get this?

345
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:21,630
It was a gift from your mother.

346
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:24,619
While we were both at Oxford.

347
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:29,125
Though she was just
auditing courses in those days.

348
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,641
No women were allowed to enroll.

349
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:35,670
A rule she railed against
with a vengeance, believe me.

350
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,814
You were college buddies
with my mom?

351
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,350
Yes, at first.

352
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:42,620
Things became more serious
between us later.

353
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:46,614
Okay, dude, stop referring to my mom
as your ex, or, I will kill you.

354
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,402
We were part of something...

355
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,861
Something we called "the Five".

356
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:00,586
A small group dedicated to expanding
our knowledge of the physical world...

357
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,924
- by the most unconventional means.
- How can you be old like her?

358
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,573
Unlike what you've been told,
your mother was not born

359
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:09,385
with a genetic abnormality.

360
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,640
She chose to become something different.
We all did.

361
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:17,232
We were so curious to know
what humans could become,

362
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,684
evolve into,

363
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:20,790
given the chance.

364
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,360
- Who were the others?
- Who? Besides your mother and myself?

365
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,318
It was Nigel Griffin,

366
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:30,408
Sir James Watson, and Nikola Tesla.

367
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,995
- As in the...
- Yes.

368
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,164
The same.

369
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:39,822
I still say he leeched off Edison
and cheated Marconi.

370
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,343
But, I digress.

371
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,842
Have you heard of the species
<i>Sanguine Vampiris</i>?

372
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,213
Yeah, a vampire.

373
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:53,105
- They're extinct.
- Not quite.

374
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:57,115
They were all but exterminated
by the church centuries ago.

375
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:00,145
Those few who lived through the purges
were made sterile.

376
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:04,875
Your mother was able to procure
a very rare sample of ancient,

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,784
untainted vampire blood...

378
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:11,081
<i>One collected before the sterilization
of the species was carried out</i>

379
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:14,284
<i>blood that supposedly
possessed miraculous properties.</i>

380
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,332
<i>No one had ever dared inject
pure </i>Sanguine Vampiris<i>...</i>

381
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:23,135
<i>Until your mother derived
a serum from it.</i>

382
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,160
- It's ready.
- You don't have to go first.

383
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:30,327
- John or I could have a go to start.
- He's right.

384
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:32,512
No need for unnecessary heroics.

385
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,283
The side effects
are completely unknown.

386
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,429
Thank you, gentlemen,

387
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,064
but this experiment
was of my design.

388
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:42,973
I shall be the one
to prove its worth.

389
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:45,742
You're certain?

390
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:49,497
We've risked too much
to turn back now.

391
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:51,656
We need to know.

392
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:58,726
You may proceed, Nikola.

393
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:29,431
Wait a minute.

394
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,529
She's part vampire?

395
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:34,716
She's human.

396
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:36,976
And so much more.

397
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:41,207
After each of us was injected,
we received unique...

398
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,832
gifts as a result.

399
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,501
Seen yours in action, thanks.

400
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,587
Griffins's molecules
became photosensitive,

401
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:50,411
Watson's mind grew to new heights,

402
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,259
and Tesla's reaction
was the most dramatic.

403
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:57,629
His genetic disposition
brought forth vampiric traits

404
00:25:57,754 --> 00:25:59,942
which had laid dormant in his genes.

405
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,456
But, your mother...

406
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:05,655
Well...

407
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,973
Her gift was the most simple

408
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,734
and elegant.

409
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:13,863
It's as though whatever's doing this
can just disappear.

410
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,492
Yeah, but there's nothing
like that living here.

411
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:19,011
That we know of.
Could be one of our residents

412
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:21,612
is manifesting a new power.
I don't know.

413
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,981
I thought it was "starve a fever?"

414
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,584
Old wives' tale.

415
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:38,694
You need nourishment.

416
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,961
Oh, is that mushroom?

417
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:42,995
Eat.

418
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:46,977
- So, were you down there recently?
- Where?

419
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,515
Storage.

420
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,194
I don't remember.
I get around a lot in a day.

421
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,430
When did that happen?

422
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:56,332
Oh, that?

423
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,723
Did that yesterday,
moving some equipment in the lab.

424
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,205
Why?

425
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:04,538
Oh, we found some fresh blood
on one of the boxes in the storage.

426
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:08,220
- The creature's?
- I don't know.

427
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:11,773
With you out of commission and Magnus
away, I can't run a detailed analysis.

428
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:15,207
Well, when she gets back,
I'm sure she'll get to the bottom of it.

429
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,995
I'm just thinking, if the blood is
yours, we can eliminate it as evidence.

430
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,789
Listen, dude, seriously,
I don't remember being down there.

431
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:27,270
He must rest.

432
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:31,000
What was the piece of equipment
in your lab that cut you?

433
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,774
I don't know! Something sharp.

434
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,610
Did Magnus order
a restock of diazepam?

435
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,203
- What?
- Will.

436
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:39,545
Go.

437
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:42,835
Sorry.

438
00:27:49,224 --> 00:27:52,284
Bravo and Delta teams,
close in from alternate exit points.

439
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,296
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

440
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:02,221
- I feel so safe when I'm with you.
- Quiet!

441
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:08,394
We have to fight our way out of here.
No killing.

442
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,480
Said the woman with the gun
to the vampire.

443
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:15,737
- Just follow my lead.
- It won't be necessary.

444
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,737
I, for one, don't intend
to get captured or killed.

445
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,780
- You won't.
- What do you mean?

446
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,682
The playing field just got leveled.

447
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:39,395
Bravo teams, check in!

448
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,592
All teams, report!

449
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,751
Oh, my God.

450
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:20,640
What did this?

451
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,394
It's not so much the "what"

452
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:25,820
as the "why" that counts.

453
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:29,333
This is your project, isn't it?

454
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,029
- This is what you've been working on.
- Tonight,

455
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,004
you get to witness the rebirth

456
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:38,234
of the greatest abnormal
that ever walked the Earth.

457
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:47,218
My God, Nikola, what have you done?

458
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:50,735
Welcome to the future.

459
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,081
I realize...

460
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,100
you need time to process all this.

461
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,720
But that isn't a luxury
that we have.

462
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:08,889
I like your story.
It's a nice story.

463
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:12,172
Tesla is intent on making contact
with your mother.

464
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,980
Imminently.

465
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:18,899
Now, whatever you may think of me,
of the Five, he's the most dangerous.

466
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:20,609
Good twist.

467
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:22,445
- Not enough.
- Ashley...

468
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,789
I am not your enemy,

469
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:29,529
not anymore.

470
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:32,649
Baldy, you invaded our house.

471
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:35,957
You fed me to a giant iguana. If that's
not enough to make you my enemy,

472
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:37,251
then what the hell is?

473
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,629
I was wrong to try to reason with you.
You're incapable of seeing the truth.

474
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:42,006
What truth?

475
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:44,605
That you have no concept

476
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,985
of the meaning of your work.

477
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,099
You just shoot,

478
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:52,016
maim, and capture,
whatever mummy tells you,

479
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,809
without a single regard

480
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,606
- for the consequences of your actions.
- That is not true.

481
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,259
You're a killer, all right.

482
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,914
You live for the thrill of the hunt,

483
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,805
the exquisite rush
of that moment of violence.

484
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,528
You find it utterly intoxicating.

485
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,696
I know the feeling very well myself.

486
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,839
I am nothing like you!

487
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,801
Oh, you'd like nothing more
than to kill me,

488
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:22,129
resurrect your wounded pride,

489
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,381
get some blood on your hands.

490
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,811
The only reason
you haven't really tried

491
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,096
is because you aren't sure
if you can pull it off.

492
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:34,975
We don't have time.
We have to go.

493
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,082
I'm appealing to your judgment,

494
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:42,543
to your intuition.

495
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,109
I want you to think,

496
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:45,913
not just act.

497
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:48,712
See, I brought you here
to help you, Ashley,

498
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,471
to give you the chance
to make a choice,

499
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:57,790
to show you a world
your mother has kept hidden from you.

500
00:31:58,365 --> 00:31:59,919
Don't turn away from it.

501
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:02,723
Trust me.
Help me save your mother.

502
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,662
- What the hell are they?
- Well, in a very basic sense,

503
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:13,055
- they're me.
- You found a way to revive the species?

504
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,339
The question...

505
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,114
Could I

506
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,187
use my own altered DNA...

507
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:22,944
to turn

508
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,963
a boring old homo sapien

509
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,982
into a higher, more...

510
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,828
evolved species?

511
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,319
And the answer

512
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,325
is so simple,

513
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,126
it will make you cry.

514
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:46,795
Watch.

515
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:15,034
What does Tesla want with my mom?

516
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,692
Tesla's intent on creating
an army of deadly creatures,

517
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:22,082
topple the Cabal once and for all.

518
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:25,632
Helen will undoubtedly
refuse his offer

519
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:28,933
to join him in his efforts,
and when she does,

520
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:30,888
he...

521
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:32,745
will kill her.

522
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,847
- How do you know all this?
- Because...

523
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,530
he came to me first.

524
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:45,064
My last encounter with your mother
did indeed leave me close to death,

525
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,168
but Tesla found me,

526
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:48,957
revived me,

527
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,514
and when I refused him...

528
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,111
Nothing quite like electroshock therapy
to clear the mind.

529
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:01,246
Oh, my God.

530
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,341
And the rage that once

531
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:05,089
fueled me is gone.

532
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,389
I'm whole once again.

533
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,384
Together,

534
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:17,743
we can save her,

535
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,555
but I need to know where she is.

536
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,026
I am your only hope.

537
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,732
Please...

538
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:31,673
I need to make things right.

539
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:35,489
For you.

540
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:38,865
For her.

541
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,345
Well, thanks for joining the party.

542
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:47,946
Now...

543
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:49,712
Go join the others.

544
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,853
See, the cool thing
about me using my own DNA

545
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:58,687
to reanimate the dead is...
they do...

546
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,077
whatever I say.

547
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,892
- But they're practically mindless.
- I know.

548
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:07,073
They're fast, vicious, strong,

549
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,010
but they're as dumb as tree stumps,

550
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:11,688
which defeats the whole purpose
of the project.

551
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,601
You want me to help you
make them intelligent?

552
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:18,456
This is the culmination of everything
we stood for as the Five,

553
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:19,949
pushing boundaries,

554
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,838
exploring realms of science
that other people were afraid to.

555
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,204
Just imagine...

556
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,384
<i>Sanguine Vampiris</i>...

557
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:34,534
Reborn.

558
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:39,180
- They would only enslave us again.
- Oh, I don't think human beings

559
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,066
are doing such a good job of it
right now, do you?

560
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,270
You and I

561
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:46,817
could usher in a new golden age

562
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:49,140
of thought and culture

563
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,575
and peace.

564
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:54,536
- You're mad, Nikola.
- No!

565
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,147
The Philadelphia experiment was mad,

566
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,002
but this...

567
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:01,899
is progress.

568
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:06,472
Dude, I am not a shape-shifter.

569
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,283
What about the treatments
you've been undergoing?

570
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,432
So secret that
I'm not allowed to know about them?

571
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,631
- That's personal.
- And I respect that,

572
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:16,633
but I need to know what's been
attacking people around here.

573
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:18,302
I just want to rule this out.

574
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,616
Then you'll just have to
take my word for it.

575
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:23,690
Covering this up is only gonna
make it worse. I can help you,

576
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,867
- but if someone else is attacked...
- Get out.

577
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,002
I mean it.

578
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,135
Go.

579
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:36,039
We all know...

580
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,087
the abnormals are on the rise,

581
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:41,949
and now we just need
somebody to lead them.

582
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,660
You?

583
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:48,129
Us.

584
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:53,450
You saw...

585
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:58,020
how my "mini-me"s handled
those trackers earlier tonight.

586
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:00,744
Now, just imagine an army of them,

587
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,645
but massively intelligent!
You and I could give the Cabal...

588
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,201
Get her.

589
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,664
Easy...

590
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,124
Easy...

591
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,168
Why didn't he just tell me?

592
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,029
He didn't want anyone to know,

593
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:29,199
and I promised him no one would.

594
00:38:34,107 --> 00:38:35,387
Just lie still.

595
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:41,672
Can we be certain
they came down here?

596
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,847
- Definitely one of mom's.
- She always carries a gun?

597
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,012
With good reason.

598
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,129
Not yet...

599
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:56,666
Not yet.

600
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:01,077
Back off.

601
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,083
Nice shooting.

602
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:17,020
I thought you loved me.

603
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,168
Did I?

604
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,030
I don't think
it's going to work out.

605
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,042
Well, then...

606
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:33,301
I guess I can tell you
that, at Oxford,

607
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,191
no one liked you.

608
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,166
Was it because I was a genius?

609
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,170
Because you were an obnoxious ass.

610
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:48,844
Guess who's still standing?

611
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:54,746
Hello, Nikola.

612
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:04,830
- What the hell are you doing?
- Saving your life.

613
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:05,963
Why?

614
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:10,588
You've had a long night. I'm simply
glad to see you safe and sound.

615
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,106
The blood I gave you,

616
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,935
it should have crippled you,
or worse.

617
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
It did.

618
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:18,393
Then how...

619
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:25,547
Ashley can explain.

620
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,286
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

621
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,955
Just wanted to let you know we...

622
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,848
We chased that snake creature
to the basement warehouse.

623
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,612
Looks like it hatched inside
one of the artifacts

624
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,907
that Magnus brought back
from the Amazon a few months ago.

625
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,064
It must've escaped and...

626
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:56,953
grown to full maturity
inside the walls here, and...

627
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:03,919
Listen, I was a jerk.

628
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:06,963
I just didn't think

629
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:10,628
what it must be like
to carry this around with you.

630
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:13,237
I'm sorry.

631
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,116
And, hey...

632
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:30,072
Thanks for saving my ass.

633
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:41,068
You're welcome.

634
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,817
He's my father, isn't he?

635
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:21,855
He is.

636
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,511
I've never shown you Rome, have I?

637
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:40,729
There was never time.

638
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:45,997
I have a lot to make up for.

639
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:50,738
Shall we?
