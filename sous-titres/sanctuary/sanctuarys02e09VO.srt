1
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:13,142
It's all clear up here.

2
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,196
Yeah, same here.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,833
Ditto.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,360
Copy that, I'm arriving now.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,872
- It's me, Magnus.
- Over here.

6
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:48,047
- It's good to see you.
- You too, Helen.

7
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:53,135
- I love the hair.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:56,979
- Any problems?
- No, package is safe and sound.

9
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,983
Although I'll be very happy
to be rid of this one.

10
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,846
Little warmer than I'm used to.

11
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:10,168
That's what you get for transporting
a Tunisian fire elemental.

12
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:12,113
I have a cryo-container in the van.

13
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,116
We got company.
Two cars headed your way.

14
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:20,475
I got 'em.

15
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,611
All right, fan out.
They can't be far.

16
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,954
<i>Eight scary-looking dudes.</i>

17
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,226
They're searching the area.

18
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:37,022
- The Duke.
- Who?

19
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,489
Head of the abnormal mob
back in Chicago.

20
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:41,353
Damn.

21
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,724
He hired me
to bring him the elemental.

22
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,354
You stole this from a mob boss?

23
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,405
I wasn't about to let it
fall into his hands.

24
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,480
- How did he find us?
- You tell me.

25
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,112
- Your organization sprung a leak.
- No. Impossible.

26
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,420
Henry, we need a diversion.

27
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,409
<i>I'm on it.</i>

28
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:10,707
This way.

29
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,176
Let's go!

30
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,635
- Get in!
- Go!

31
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,930
Protect the package!
Go!

32
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,099
Please go!

33
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,202
They're on the move, headed north!

34
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay, I'm on it.

35
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,568
Henry, Will, Kate's got Jimmy.

36
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,343
Meet at the rendezvous.

37
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,216
Hell, yeah. Copy that.

38
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,495
Nice work.
I think we lost them.

39
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,269
Where are we headed?

40
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,191
Why are we slowing down?

41
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,792
Crap.

42
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:14,749
The Team Projet-SG

43
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,088
presents:

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,299
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 9
Penance (v. 1.00)

45
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:23,804
Timing by: Arrow, Salomon

46
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,906
http://projet-sg.net

47
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,243
- Any sign of them?
- Not yet.

48
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:50,242
- Maybe they got turned around.
- It's been too long.

49
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,908
Kate, come in.

50
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,543
- Do you read?
- Maybe she dumped her walkie.

51
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,003
Try her cell phone.

52
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,456
I'll call the Big Guy,
see if she showed up at the Sanctuary.

53
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,370
- Who were those guys?
- Abnormals from Chicago.

54
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:12,269
- James stole the elemental from them.
- That's wonderful.

55
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,560
How were they able to track us?

56
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:17,253
- We told no one about this meeting.
- Maybe they followed him.

57
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:20,027
I've worked with James before.
He knows better than to let this happen.

58
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,029
She's not at the Sanctuary either.

59
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,499
All right, go back
and check with our contacts.

60
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,784
Find out if anyone's seen them,
and, Henry,

61
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,827
I want to know
how this Duke found us.

62
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,126
All right.

63
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:14,723
Easy!

64
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:17,274
I'm just looking at the wound.

65
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:24,091
We're gonna have to get
that bullet out.

66
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:26,260
We should get back to the Sanctuary.

67
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,345
No, we'd never make it.

68
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,381
There's a bunch of guys out there
trying to kill us.

69
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,184
Call Magnus, she'll pick us up.

70
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,453
No can do, your walkie's toast.

71
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,353
Besides, we don't know
how those guys found us.

72
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,442
They could be monitoring
our communications.

73
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,791
If you think Magnus tipped them off,
then you're crazy.

74
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,866
Not her, but there is a leak.

75
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,494
Until we find out where it is,

76
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,205
we can't risk
getting in touch with anyone.

77
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,159
I need you...

78
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,109
to stay still.

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,712
Are you nuts?

80
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,925
Come on! If I don't get the bullet out,
you are going to bleed to death.

81
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,300
Is that what you want?

82
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,912
You do me a favor. You take this,
you point this at the door.

83
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:16,435
Anyone comes through,
you blow them away, okay?

84
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,647
Try not to move too much.

85
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,113
It was a gray Sedan.
They shot out a couple of the windows.

86
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,602
If she went to the rendezvous,

87
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,890
she would've turned left
at the first opportunity.

88
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:35,913
Unless she were going to the Sanctuary,
she would've kept going straight.

89
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,668
Why were they shooting at him anyway?
Dangerous way to bring in an abnormal.

90
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,213
It's the container.
He doesn't have to be alive

91
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,031
for them to collect it.

92
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,607
<i>Magnus, come in.</i>

93
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,594
- How's it going, Henry?
- <i>I put the word out about Kate,</i>

94
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,837
but nothing yet.

95
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:55,296
Big Guy's checking to see
if anything got caught on videos.

96
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:59,243
- <i>What about the system scan?</i>
- Still processing, but in the meantime,

97
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:02,068
I did some research
into this abnormal mob.

98
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,434
Turns out their leader's a Diukon.

99
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:06,777
What's a Diukon?

100
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,487
Highly aggressive humanoid offshoot.

101
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,737
They suffer
from uncontrollable bouts of rage

102
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,284
so powerful they literally
can't contain it.

103
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,245
What do you mean,
they can't contain it?

104
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,612
Diukons have special glands
in their hands

105
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,693
that secrete radiation
when they get angry.

106
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,877
If they grab hold of you,
it's very unpleasant.

107
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,533
They cook you from the inside out
like a microwave...

108
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:26,713
Or so I've heard.

109
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:30,038
How is it possible
that a Diukon is leading a street gang?

110
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:32,010
There's no known suppressant
for their anger.

111
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,288
I have no idea,

112
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,763
but somebody's giving this guy
some serious happy pills.

113
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:39,279
Six months ago he was pit-fighting
other abnormals for cash.

114
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,705
Now he's the boss.

115
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,902
How'd it go?

116
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:03,974
We lost him.

117
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,045
He got away
with a member of the Sanctuary,

118
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:08,696
Kate Freelander,

119
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:13,637
but word is that they never made it
back to the Sanctuary.

120
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:17,014
So where are they now?

121
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:22,436
- We don't know.
- What about our monitoring capability?

122
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:27,131
It's still in place, but we have no way
to locate Freelander specifically.

123
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,550
Her radio signal went dead.

124
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,114
Boss, we'll find him.
Don't worry.

125
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm not the one that needs to worry.

126
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,527
Duke...

127
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,532
Get him out of here.

128
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:57,242
Looks like those rage parameters
need a tweak.

129
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,517
I think I lost control for a second.

130
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,269
I'll run a diagnostic.

131
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:11,162
And keep monitoring
the Sanctuary frequency.

132
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,862
As long as Freelander's out there,

133
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,535
I want to keep tabs on them.

134
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,509
I'm gonna need a new one of these.

135
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,101
This is gonna hurt.

136
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,428
Come on...

137
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,556
You've got to stay still.

138
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,434
You got any morphine?

139
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,405
Please, I wish.
I could use some.

140
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,156
Here.

141
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:54,332
Hell of a first date, huh?

142
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,322
I've had worse.

143
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,865
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

144
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,054
"Hi, Jimmy, I'm... "

145
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,708
Where you from, Kate?

146
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,793
I grew up in Chicago.

147
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,546
Chicago, no kidding? Me too.
What part?

148
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:14,976
West Side.

149
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:17,664
Cal City.

150
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,025
Cal City?

151
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:20,721
That's not Chicago.

152
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,389
Says who?

153
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,583
Anyone actually from Chicago.

154
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,644
I'm sorry.
It's in kind of deep.

155
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,356
God... It's still not Chicago.

156
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,255
Want to continue on foot?

157
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,092
If what you say is true,
and Kate really has gone into hiding,

158
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,828
we'll never find her from the car.

159
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:48,544
Any particular direction
you have an affinity for?

160
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,421
You go east, I'll go west.

161
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:53,348
Proceed one block at a time.
Stay in radio contact.

162
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,081
All right.

163
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,479
Easy, I almost got it!

164
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:13,523
There!

165
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:21,327
You can save this one
for your collection.

166
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,511
Come on, West Side,
don't give up on me.

167
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,350
- Go ahead, Henry.
- Destroy your walkie right now.

168
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,606
- Now, tell me why I just did that.
- <i>We got hit with a remote hack.</i>

169
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,187
They're using our radio
frequencies to track us.

170
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,319
- Where's Will?
- He's not with me.

171
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,738
- He's not answering his cell.
- Dammit.

172
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,029
Easy...

173
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,304
Easy, easy...

174
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,230
What happened?

175
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Nothing much.

176
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,437
You... stopped breathing,

177
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,606
so I...

178
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,747
took the opportunity
to make out with you.

179
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,278
Thanks.

180
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,859
Come on,
what are casual acquaintances for?

181
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,849
I'm sorry, doc.

182
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,207
- You had no way of knowing.
- <i>Whoever did this is sophisticated.</i>

183
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,854
I'm gonna have to re-encrypt
all the com frequencies.

184
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,029
Understood.
I'll see you soon.

185
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,541
What's wrong?

186
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,231
Nothing...

187
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,265
Except for this 1,200-degree
abnormal inside of me,

188
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,353
I'm fine.

189
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,980
Why don't you take it out?

190
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,817
We need a cryo-container
to put it into.

191
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,279
See, this pocket of mine,
it acts like a sealed container.

192
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:26,256
Without it,

193
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,742
the vessel would breach
in 20 minutes or so.

194
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,995
Even with him inside there,
we got six hours, eight hours

195
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,195
at the most before I'm gonna have
to get it out of there again.

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,970
That's very reassuring.

197
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:43,322
What do those guys
want with it, anyway?

198
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:45,061
You kidding?

199
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:49,213
This thing represents
a virtually unlimited source of energy.

200
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:54,191
Makes weapons-grade plutonium
look like lamp oil.

201
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,326
The Duke's got this guy...

202
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,964
Ellison, a former Cabal geek,

203
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,984
who figured out a way
to harness the energy and weaponize it.

204
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,229
They were planning on selling it
to the highest bidder.

205
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,281
You should go.

206
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:13,905
You have a better shot at making it
to the Sanctuary on your own.

207
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,280
Yeah, and what?

208
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,124
Just leave you here?

209
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,685
Look, I don't want to be responsible

210
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,718
for that thing getting used
for some crazy weapon.

211
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:25,257
That's very noble, Kate,

212
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,408
but there's got to be
50 guys out there by now.

213
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,220
I wouldn't make it
out the front door.

214
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,868
What are we gonna do?

215
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:34,535
I don't know.

216
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:36,810
We'll wait until dark.

217
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,612
You know, hopefully

218
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,959
things will have cooled off by then.

219
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,337
No pun intended.

220
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,952
Name's Zimmerman.

221
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,476
And the others?

222
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,801
The signal went dead
after we grabbed him.

223
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,252
I know what you guys
are looking for.

224
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:05,204
I can't help you.

225
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,479
Come on...

226
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,904
Don't sell yourself short.

227
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,154
Everyone out there
is looking for Jimmy,

228
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,482
and the first one to find him,

229
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,241
they're gonna have a big advantage.

230
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,084
That's why I need you.

231
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,271
You're my insurance policy.

232
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,655
Put him in the room.

233
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:40,574
Put more men on the street
and widen the net.

234
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,759
There.
The com system's clean.

235
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,220
Any word on Will?

236
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,039
We tried to track his cell,
but they must have ditched it.

237
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:58,266
What are we gonna do?

238
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,810
We have no choice
but to continue looking for James.

239
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,355
We have no leverage at the moment,

240
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,162
which is why we need to find him
before they do.

241
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,569
Besides, the canister he's carrying
has to come out soon or...

242
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,032
Of course.
Henry, thermographic scanners.

243
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,033
We use them to detect the canister.

244
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,495
I thought his pouch was shielded
to prevent that detection.

245
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,789
It is, but after prolonged exposure,

246
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,485
even a sealed chamber
succumbs to the effects of radiant heat.

247
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,418
See if you can calibrate
our scanners.

248
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,254
Yeah, all right, I'm on it.
See you at the van in five?

249
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:31,254
- Actually, you go ahead.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

250
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:32,812
Stall.

251
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:45,378
Come on.

252
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,215
None of that.

253
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:48,877
Here.

254
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,541
This will perk you up.

255
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:09,871
So, Cubs or Sox?

256
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:12,718
Really?

257
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,572
This is what we're gonna talk about?

258
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:18,135
No matter how tough things get,
there is always time for baseball.

259
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,060
Come on, Cubs or Sox?

260
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:24,481
If I wanted to see fat guys
running around, I'd watch reality TV.

261
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,313
And you say you're from Chicago.

262
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,321
Next you'll be telling me
you don't like pizza.

263
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,422
My dad was a Cubs fan.

264
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,663
So I guess that makes me one too.

265
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,166
I knew I should have
left that bullet in.

266
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,021
- I take it you're a Sox fan?
- Oh, yeah.

267
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,856
My dad used to take me
to the games on Sundays.

268
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,761
He died when I was 12.

269
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,633
Mine died when I was eight.

270
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,646
No kidding?
What happened?

271
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:13,710
Who are you, Dr. Phil?

272
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,327
He died, okay?

273
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,740
Okay, I was just, you know...

274
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,299
This stuff tastes like crap.

275
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:31,141
We're shut out
of Sanctuary communications.

276
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,770
What happened?

277
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,924
They neutralized the initial hack
as expected.

278
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,961
- What about the back-up plan?
- Still in play.

279
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:40,086
Good.

280
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,016
Who the hell is this?

281
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,646
<i>Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.</i>

282
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:53,219
If you have touched so much as one hair
on Will Zimmerman's head,

283
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:56,194
there is not enough real estate
on this earth to keep you safe from me.

284
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:02,151
That's awfully tough talk
for someone in your position.

285
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,076
<i>Is it?</i>

286
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,659
- I guess you haven't heard.
- <i>Heard what?</i>

287
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:06,934
I have Jimmy.

288
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,459
- You're lying.
- <i>My team picked him up moments ago.</i>

289
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:14,879
- They're on their way back here.
- <i>They have cell phones, don't they?</i>

290
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,161
Put him on the phone.
Let me talk to him.

291
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:19,542
<i>He's been injured.
He's in no condition to talk.</i>

292
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,803
<i>I will call you once he's stable.</i>

293
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,304
<i>Until then,</i>

294
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,197
get your men off my streets

295
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,522
and keep your hands off my people.

296
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,953
Do you think
she's telling the truth?

297
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,078
Find out.

298
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,288
Is this thing gonna work?

299
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:49,796
Absolutely.

300
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,909
Detecting the heat signature's easy.

301
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,752
Problem is the range,

302
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,671
because we've got to be
within 35 feet.

303
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,259
35 feet?

304
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,683
You know I never have enough time
with these things.

305
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,205
- I guess I'll be walking, then.
- It's good for the heart.

306
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,803
I'll go this way.

307
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:10,101
Stay sharp.

308
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,868
- So who was she?
- What?

309
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,504
Only one reason
to get a tattoo removed.

310
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:25,428
That, or you found out
the Chinese character you picked

311
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:26,868
means "stupid white guy".

312
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:37,712
I used to run with some guys
back in the day.

313
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,831
The Kingtown gang.

314
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:41,966
You ever hear of them?

315
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,561
Sounds familiar.

316
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,511
I fell in with them when I was 16,

317
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,059
after my dad died.

318
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:49,848
Took me years to find my way out.

319
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,906
I know the feeling.

320
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:54,145
See, I was an easy target

321
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,313
because of old Mr. Happy here.

322
00:21:58,124 --> 00:21:59,936
Started out innocent enough...

323
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,494
Drugs across the border,
stuff like that,

324
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,563
and then someone need a gun
for a robbery,

325
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:09,111
and then someone need a gun
for a murder...

326
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:14,140
Yeah, pretty soon I was carrying
just about anything that fit in there.

327
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,077
I did some things I'm not proud of.

328
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,298
When'd you get out?

329
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:23,762
10 years ago.

330
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:26,175
They got me to make

331
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,038
a drop on the L

332
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,313
at rush hour.

333
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
A peridax.

334
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,852
- You know what that is?
- No.

335
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,124
It's this cute thing. It's a cross
between a guinea pig and a koala,

336
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:37,399
but anyway...

337
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,465
They said it was to create a diversion
for a robbery they're pulling.

338
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,840
Fine, so I'm...

339
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,989
I'm on the platform at Lake station,
I'm waiting for the red line,

340
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:49,797
and this woman comes up to me.

341
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,780
Dr. Magnus.

342
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,549
And somehow she knew
everything about me.

343
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:58,835
Who I was, what I was about to do,

344
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,505
and she tells me the gang lied.

345
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:09,235
That when a peridax gets scared,
it releases a spray like a skunk,

346
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,925
really toxic in close quarters,
you know?

347
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,925
I mean, I was that close
to killing...

348
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,500
hundreds of people.

349
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,111
She stopped me.

350
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,204
What?

351
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:38,178
Nothing.

352
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,058
Sorry.

353
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,850
You look really familiar.

354
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,401
Sorry...

355
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,123
Enjoy your meal.

356
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:31,603
<i>Tell the Duke Magnus' people are still
out here looking for something.</i>

357
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,523
I think your boss is lying to me...

358
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,825
Which is very, very bad news

359
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:55,274
for you.

360
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,664
What are you doing?

361
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,615
Ingenious, aren't they?

362
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,029
Built by my second-in-command,
Ellison.

363
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:18,766
Without 'em,
I'm nothing but an animal,

364
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,055
but at half power,

365
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:25,785
I find it to be
a very effective interrogation tool.

366
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:28,950
Okay, just hold on a second.

367
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:31,676
This is a very bad idea.

368
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,407
I disagree.

369
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,124
Where the hell is Jimmy?

370
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,730
Come on, come on...

371
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,006
Don't try to get up.

372
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:53,727
Seriously.

373
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,934
If you die, no one's gonna believe
that I saved you.

374
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,181
I can't stand this.

375
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,831
I need to do something.
We're sitting ducks.

376
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:01,976
Just relax.

377
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,187
It'll be dark in a few hours,
and we'll move then.

378
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:11,194
- So why'd you leave Chicago?
- Nothing to tell. I left, end of story.

379
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,822
Come on, I had my show and tell.
I think it's your turn.

380
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:19,743
You know I'm just gonna be annoying
and keep asking, right?

381
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,569
I left after my father died.

382
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,182
He was a lock-pick.

383
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,648
Could crack a safe
in four minutes flat.

384
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:38,888
He was hired to pull a bank job
by a group of heavy-hitters,

385
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:42,308
and they were impressed, and pretty soon
he was running with them.

386
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:44,174
Sound familiar?

387
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:47,642
What happened?

388
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,325
He was pinched.

389
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,465
When I was eight.

390
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:57,739
I remember because my mom
was pregnant at the time.

391
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,370
We were on our way to post bail.

392
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
He died...

393
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:20,436
Along with a dozen policemen
and three civilians.

394
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,683
The shock sent my mom into labor.

395
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:27,808
We nearly lost my brother too.

396
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,582
We left Chicago a few years later.

397
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,191
Moved around until my mom decided
to go back to Mumbai.

398
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,695
I headed to Montreal.

399
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,125
That's quite a story.

400
00:27:57,295 --> 00:27:58,445
What's wrong?

401
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:01,345
What?
I'm just looking out the window.

402
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:05,683
You're acting all fidgety.

403
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:09,675
No, it's the elemental.
It's making me uncomfortable.

404
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:34,825
What the...

405
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,596
- What is it?
- Are you doing anything on the system?

406
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:45,425
No. Why?

407
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,099
<i>Something's wrong. It's too slow.</i>

408
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:48,675
Oh, man.

409
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,938
- I don't believe this.
- <i>What?</i>

410
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,307
They embedded a sleeper worm
that could only be activated

411
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,610
in the event I re-encrypted
the com frequencies.

412
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,613
They knew that we would find the virus.
They had a back-up plan in place.

413
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:03,345
Wait a minute.
They're monitoring our system right now?

414
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,951
I'm on my way.
I'll take care of it.

415
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,110
If they're so interested
in what we're up to,

416
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:13,685
I say let them see.

417
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:18,495
Where did Freelander take him?

418
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:21,133
How would Magnus
get in touch with them?

419
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,928
I don't know anything.

420
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:25,935
Then you're no good to me.

421
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,350
No, don't do this.

422
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:47,015
Why did you do that?

423
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,005
We just got confirmation.

424
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,788
The Sanctuary does have Jimmy.

425
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,790
What?

426
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:54,955
We were able to access

427
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:56,975
their intake files.

428
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,504
Jimmy's there.

429
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:00,865
Injured,

430
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,633
just like she said.

431
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:12,309
It's the Duke.
You think he bought it?

432
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:13,935
Let's hope so.

433
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:18,627
I thought I told you
to wait for my call.

434
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:20,465
<i>I've waited long enough.</i>

435
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,695
<i>Besides,</i>

436
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:24,315
<i>your friend isn't doing too good.</i>

437
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,567
<i>I've transmitted my location.</i>

438
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:32,580
<i>If you have Jimmy
like you say you do,</i>

439
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,080
<i>you have 30 minutes
to deliver him to me.</i>

440
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,305
<i>Otherwise...</i>

441
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,475
<i>Pretty boy dies.</i>

442
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:47,970
What the hell are we gonna do?

443
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,148
Did you notice that device
on his temple?

444
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,970
- What was that?
- It looked like some sort of electrode.

445
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,436
So he's a Diukon, remember?

446
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,022
- That's what's suppressing his anger?
- It makes sense.

447
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:00,610
A device that taps directly
into the limbic system

448
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,130
would have the desired effect
of keeping his aggression in check.

449
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:05,580
All right, that's all great,
but how does that help us?

450
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:08,741
Diukons' brain chemistry is vastly
different than that of a human.

451
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:11,172
If indeed his rage center
has been suppressed,

452
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:14,640
it's likely that other parts
of his brain are open to manipulation.

453
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:17,765
- What other parts?
- The visual cortex, for one.

454
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:19,765
Come on, I have an idea.

455
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,610
What was the name
of the gang you ran with?

456
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:24,735
Kingtown?

457
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,692
I think I remember
where I heard of them.

458
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,647
Yeah, that's good for you.

459
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,455
Guy by the name of Ernesto Ripelli
used to run with them.

460
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,165
They charged him

461
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:38,604
with the bombing
that killed my father.

462
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:40,905
That was before my time.

463
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,935
He got off
because they couldn't explain

464
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:46,111
how he got past the metal detectors.

465
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:52,355
That's what made the explosion
so shocking.

466
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,372
No one had any idea
how that bomb was planted.

467
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,905
It was you, wasn't it?

468
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:05,175
Kate, you got to understand.
It was my first big job.

469
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,505
I didn't think I had a choice.

470
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:13,268
You know how it works.
Once you're in...

471
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:15,045
You're in.

472
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:30,475
So that's it?

473
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,885
That's all you've got to say?

474
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:42,615
I can't change what I've done.

475
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,441
So my dad was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

476
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,659
Is that it?

477
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:50,861
Kate, what are you talking about?

478
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:53,385
Your dad was the target.

479
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,270
He was trying to cut a deal
with the DA.

480
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:59,495
That's why the gang
wanted him killed.

481
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:04,792
Shut up!

482
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,919
Shut up! You're lying!

483
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,911
I don't wanna be the bearer
of bad news here,

484
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:12,257
but your dad was turning on the guys
he was running with. He knew the risks.

485
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:15,560
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that he's dead.

486
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:18,795
No, it doesn't.

487
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,305
Get down.

488
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:24,075
Get down on your knees.

489
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:37,032
Anything else you want to say?

490
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:40,615
Just that I don't blame you.

491
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:48,305
And go, White Sox.

492
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,392
We have to go.

493
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:04,765
Not now.

494
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,771
Magnus needs our help.

495
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,255
Where's Jimmy?

496
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:25,948
I wanted to make certain
Will was still alive.

497
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:27,565
Now you are.

498
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:29,543
Where's Jimmy?

499
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,291
I don't take kindly to strangers
coming into my town

500
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:34,214
making bull-headed demands.

501
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,759
You'll get James
once you've released Will.

502
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,094
You've got me now.

503
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,929
You don't need both of us.

504
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:43,555
This is not a negotiation.

505
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,244
I was prepared to cut you some slack
because of your considerable reputation,

506
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,064
but now you're just trying
my patience.

507
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,193
So one last time.

508
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,125
Where's Jimmy?

509
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:00,755
Fair enough.

510
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,409
Easy.

511
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,577
Easy!

512
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:06,830
Magnus, don't do it!

513
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,674
Well, now, you've given me some grief
over the last few days, haven't you?

514
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,973
Are we square?

515
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,351
Get out of here.

516
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,647
- Boss, what are you...
- Let him go.

517
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:40,295
Come on.

518
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,157
Let me see the container.

519
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:46,315
- When did you turn into David Blaine?
- Just keep moving.

520
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,429
It's working, Sally.
Keep concentrating.

521
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,849
What the hell is wrong with you?
I said, let me see it.

522
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,048
There's no one there.
Who you talking to?

523
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,937
Let me see the container.

524
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:13,455
Now!

525
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,111
Stop them!

526
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,953
I suppose that was your idea
of a joke!

527
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,254
Stop!
You're looking for me?

528
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,850
Let them go.

529
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:54,605
I'll come quietly,
but you've got to release them first.

530
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,190
How do I know
you have the container?

531
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,194
Why don't you reach in
and see for yourself?

532
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,685
Well, it looks like
we have a deal after all.

533
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,328
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

534
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,299
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,335
It's all I can say.

536
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:31,308
You go. Hurry.

537
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,585
All right, come on, come on,
get in the car.

538
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,228
Tell the others
we'll meet 'em in Chicago.

539
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:04,383
Glad you finally came
to your senses.

540
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,801
Me too.

541
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,096
Let's see the goods.

542
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:10,645
Sure.

543
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,725
What's this doing here?

544
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,475
I don't know.

545
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:27,975
Here you go.

546
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,810
I admit, it was a calculated risk.

547
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:03,850
That's what you call it?
Did you even know it was gonna work?

548
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:05,370
Not positively, no,

549
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:08,476
but I was sure that if Henry were able
to boost Sally's telepathic signal,

550
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:10,565
she could tap
into the Duke's visual cortex.

551
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,190
- And see something that wasn't there.
- Exactly.

552
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:16,460
That's why I'm glad we had a recent
photo of James for her to focus on.

553
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:18,790
Yeah, about James...
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:21,395
He did what he felt he had to do.

555
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,940
He'd been living with the guilt
for so many years,

556
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,686
I suspect it was a relief.

557
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,259
I'm off to see Sally.

558
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,177
What kind of gift
do you get for a mermaid?

559
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,928
She likes it if you swim with her.

560
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:35,005
- I'll get my suit.
- No suit.

561
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:47,265
May I come in?

562
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:52,885
How's the shoulder?

563
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:55,702
Looks like my tennis days are over.

564
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,803
I wanted you to know
that I had no idea

565
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,479
about your family's prior history
with James, otherwise I would...

566
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:05,587
Never would have put me
in that position.

567
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,823
I know. It's okay.

568
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:10,985
Actually, it's not.

569
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,806
I run a very thorough background check
on everyone I work with,

570
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:17,810
and somehow I missed this.

571
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:18,935
I'm sorry.

572
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,104
Well, it's not the kind of thing
you put at the top of your resume.

573
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,704
Well, I appreciate
your understanding.

574
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,193
I'm not sure I'd be as forgiving
if I were in your position.

575
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,625
It's funny.

576
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:39,871
I always wondered what I would do
if I ever figured out who killed my dad.

577
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:44,501
Turns out it's not as black and white
as I thought.

578
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:46,955
Life rarely is.

579
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,555
I could have been Jimmy.

580
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,245
I've done things I'm not proud of.

581
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,846
How are we so different?

582
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:04,075
I've been blaming
the way my life turned out

583
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:06,600
on that one moment

584
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,875
20 years ago.

585
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:14,265
But the truth is,

586
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:17,826
I made my life the way it is.

587
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:21,065
And your life is still unfolding.

588
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,725
I'll let you rest.
