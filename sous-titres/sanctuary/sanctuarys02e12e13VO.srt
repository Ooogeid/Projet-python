1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,794


2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,070


3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,806
Rheka, you must go.

4
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:44,877
I will do what I have to.
Come back and retrieve it later.

5
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,202
It will speak.

6
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,939
There is no other choice.

7
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:51,842
This is my duty.

8
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:54,720
Now, please.

9
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,131
This way.

10
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:55,827


11
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,868
You led us on a merry dance,
didn't you, huh?

12
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,916
- Crap.
- What is it?

13
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,920
It's not in him anymore, is it?
Look at him.

14
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,436
Where'd you put it?

15
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,488
He's not going to answer.

16
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:16,093
When the bug leaves the body,
you die.

17
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:18,970
It's part of the deal, and it's been
in him for a long, long time.

18
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,269


19
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:31,358


20
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,867
Help him out, will you?

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,017
Okay, people, moving on.
Spread out.

22
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:45,626
He must have passed the bug
on to somebody.

23
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,132
Wait.

24
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,044
- The old lady he was running with.
- Find her.

25
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,868
The Team Projet-SG

00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:58,969

Sanctuary - Season 2 Episodes 12-13

30
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,651


31
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,871
Onryuji-san, what happened?

32
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:39,491
Suki's never done
anything like this before.

33
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,512
- Suki?
- Giant lizard creature.

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,521
She's usually so docile.

35
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,628
He can't understand it.

36
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,522


37
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:57,486
No one was hurt, but there was panic.
People were running through the streets.

38
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,373
- It's just like in the movie.
- No.

39
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,356
Nothing like a movie.

40
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:07,371
Where is she?

41
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,167
She's been sedated offshore

42
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,253
while we build an enclosure
on one of our islands.

43
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,435
Last night she was fine,

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,510
this morning all of a sudden,

45
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,678
it's like a switch was turned on.

46
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,442


47
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:28,790


48
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:32,774


49
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:44,450
A giant lizard creature loose in Tokyo.
How we going to spin this?

50
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,553
- So?
- It looks like our spin is holding up.

51
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:57,608
Anyone who saw Suki now thinks it's part
of some big Hollywood blockbuster

52
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,173
shooting down by the harbor.

53
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,322
Good. I'm getting pressure
from New York to keep this story quiet.

54
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,323
Our new head of house there,
Terrance Wexford,

55
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,020
is very keen on making his mark.

56
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,794
You're under pressure?
What's that about?

57
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,819
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

58
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,429
I know you, okay?
I know when something's up.

59
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,176
I promise you,
when the time comes,

60
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,024
you will be the person
that I talk to, all right?

61
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:28,890
<i>Sorry to bother you, doc.
Got some breaking news out of London.</i>

62
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,927
- What is it?
- <i>I'm patching through a video now.</i>

63
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:36,752
What is that?

64
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,337
Dear God.

65
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,220
London calling.

66
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,968


67
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,293
We caught her,

68
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,388
but as you can see,

69
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,177
she's still a little riled up.

70
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,424
We just came back from Tokyo.

71
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,279
They had a similar problem
with Suki.

72
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:06,662
What happened?

73
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:10,026
She went psycho, broke out
of her enclosure for no apparent reason.

74
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:13,032
Now, I've received dispatches
from Sydney, Rio, and Lagos.

75
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,401
All of them are reporting
similar incidents.

76
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:18,231
In each case, one or two abnormals
suddenly started acting up,

77
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:19,780
out of the blue, no warning.

78
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:22,155
- What is causing this?
- No idea,

79
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:24,550
but we'd better figure it out,
and quickly.

80
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:26,896
So far we've been lucky
no one's been seriously hurt,

81
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,762
but that won't be the case forever.

82
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:35,594
<i>It could be a virus,
like Lazarus last year.</i>

83
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,095
Maybe, but this is
a very select group of abnormals,

84
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,566
and the behavior response
is totally different.

85
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:42,533
Lazarus triggered violence.

86
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,194
This, whatever it is,
is causing outright fear.

87
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,981
<i>- A change in atmosphere?
- No way.</i>

88
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,116
<i>Our satellite feeds
would have detected something.</i>

89
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,754
Besides, the Peruvian Seppulus

90
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,161
is incredibly sensitive
to these kind of fluctuations,

91
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,413
and yet Lima's reported no problems.

92
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,462
Which leaves us with sound.
Something sub-sonic?

93
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:04,214
Doubtful. Pterodactyls have
a high tolerance for that.

94
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,905
<i>Can I say that arguing over the cause
at this point in time is useless.</i>

95
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,054
<i>We need to initiate
an immediate global alert.</i>

96
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,223
We're not there yet, Terrance.

97
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,391
Only a handful of abnormals
have been affected so far.

98
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,375
<i>Almost causing a panic
in London and Tokyo.</i>

99
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,938
<i>- Why risk further exposure?
- Dr. Magnus...</i>

100
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,232
<i>I've just received a report.</i>

101
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,480
<i>A giant sand ray has been found
in the desert</i>

102
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,571
<i>a hundred kilometers east of Minya,</i>

103
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,045
<i>dead.</i>

104
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,699
<i>Surfaced inexplicably.</i>

105
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,868
This is the middle
of its hibernation cycle.

106
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,330
All right, everyone,
please, let's not panic.

107
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:38,926
There has to be a reason.

108
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,502
We just have to remain vigilant
until we can figure out what it is.

109
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:45,173
In the meantime,
survey your sentient abnormals,

110
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,548
and keep tabs on the rest.

111
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,718
Report any changes in behavior
to Declan immediately.

112
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,804
<i>Dr. Magnus, I must insist...</i>

113
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,806
That's all. Thank you.

114
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:00,109
- <i>I'm sorry, Dr. Magnus?</i>
- Yes, Ravi, what is it?

115
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,231
<i>I'm not sure if this falls
under our purview,</i>

116
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,850
<i>but I thought
it was worth mentioning.</i>

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,145
<i>A man was found
shot dead in Dharavi.</i>

118
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,237
<i>He had the mark of Kali
on his left leg.</i>

119
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:14,144
Yeah, it's an ancient cult
dating back 5,000 years.

120
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:17,265
Its followers were rumored
to be able to foretell disaster.

121
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,554
- So they're abnormals?
- We've no idea.

122
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,910
We've never actually
made contact with them.

123
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,128
I appreciate it, Ravi.
Thank you.

124
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:25,843
I'll be in touch.

125
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,895
So, what do you think?
You think this Kali thing ties in?

126
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,196
I've no idea.
This situation's so fractured,

127
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,805
anything, no matter
how insignificant, could be a factor.

128
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:39,685
What?

129
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,855
You want me to go to Mumbai?

130
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,148
I have to stay here
and manage this situation.

131
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:46,692
You mean manage Wexford.

132
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,486
- You picked up on that, did you?
- Yeah, just a little.

133
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:53,824
Take Kate with you to Mumbai.
It'll be fun.

134
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,308
"We're going on a trip", he says.

135
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,246
"It'll be fun!", he says.

136
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,258
"Please stop talking
for two minutes", he says.

137
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,875
I have been on a plane for 15 hours.
I am entitled to a little complaining.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,503
Try flying through Tokyo
and London first, and then we'll talk.

139
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,488
Dr. Zimmerman, Miss Freelander.

140
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,999
<i>Namaste.</i>

141
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:23,604
I am Dr. Ganapathiraman.

142
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,879
Hi, Dr...

143
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:26,732
Doctor.
I'm Will.

144
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,313
- Then you must call me Ravi.
- Thank God.

145
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,194
Kate.

146
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
<i>Pavitar.</i>

147
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:34,254
"Pure".

148
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,658
No, just Kate.

149
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,303
I have rooms ready
if you need to rest.

150
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,068
- Absolutely...
- No, actually, we're fine.

151
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,633
- Why don't we just get started?
- Moving fast in Mumbai?

152
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,958
- That's a bad idea.
- What are we, here on vacation?

153
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,181
Bring on the heat.

154
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,808


155
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,002
Female.
You can tell by the markings.

156
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:10,136
Young, too.

157
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,911
Maybe 60, 70 years old?

158
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,452
Damn, there aren't
that many of these left.

159
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,415
I've arranged
for a helicopter transport to Cairo.

160
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,202
We should do a biopsy
on the wings, tail, and cephalic lobe,

161
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:23,762
send them to london.

162
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,140
Declan can do a full work-up,
see if there's any link

163
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,801
to the other abnormals.

164
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,278


165
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,265
Any chance we can get
access to the victim?

166
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,129
We're in good with the authorities.

167
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,732
They've given us the crime scene,
and I've arranged with the coroner

168
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,652
to "borrow" the body
for a window of time.

169
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:48,506
Good.

170
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,882
Should be delivered to the Sanctuary
this afternoon.

171
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,888
- The cops have anything yet?
- Still haven't id'd the body.

172
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,446
They think this was just
another drug deal gone bad.

173
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,739
I don't think so.

174
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,157
Talk to me, William.

175
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,353
The spatter angle seems very long.

176
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:04,133
Do you think slum gangbangers
carry that heavy a caliber?

177
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,498
Doubtful.
Cheaper the gun, smaller the bullet.

178
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:07,948
I'm thinking...

179
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,886
military issue.

180
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,948
These are new treads.
It's a recent acquisition.

181
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,593
Yeah, those kicks cost.

182
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,764
Some dudes with expensive boots

183
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:21,077
and even more expensive guns
were here.

184
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,952
So not a local job, then.

185
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,652
I'm saying no.

186
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,402
Not unless the locals buy their guns
direct from the manufacturer.

187
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,316
Armor-piercing 9 mil.

188
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:40,856
Still jagged.

189
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,207
Russian.

190
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,827
Pricey.

191
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:47,019
You thought I was just a token Indian,
didn't you?

192
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:49,458
Okay, so, all of this points

193
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,426
to a professional,
if not military-style hit.

194
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:53,551
Why?

195
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:56,458
- Who is this guy?
- What did they want from him?

196
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,483
Or this cult he belonged to?

197
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,721
Hey, Ravi, what's this?

198
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:05,275
A shrine to the goddess Durga.

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
They're fairly common.

200
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:14,840
So the witnesses say
that the victim was being chased,

201
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,659
but he had a good head start.

202
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,071
There's lots of ways out of this alley.
Why did he stop here?

203
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,097
'Cause he was headed this way?

204
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,516
What do you make of this?

205
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,123
Nice call.

206
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,235
Will Z. with the score.

207
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,538
You guys are good.

208
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,160
Is that supposed to be there?

209
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,408
Let's get this
back to the Sanctuary.

210
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,266
Helicopter's a half an hour out.

211
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,419
Apparently, they had some problems
with navigations.

212
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,420
That's all right. It's giving me
a chance to study these samples.

213
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,179
What do you make of this?

214
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,612
Evidence of nociception.

215
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,030
Exactly.
This creature was in pain.

216
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,742
Which explains the fear reaction,
but what caused it?

217
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:49,395
I still don't know.

218
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,122
I have to compare results
with Declan when I get back to London.

219
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:54,422
Pili?

220
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,420
You worked with Terrance Wexford
in Berlin, right?

221
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,091
How do you think
he's enjoying his new post?

222
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:09,515
I think he's enjoying
the authority of it immensely.

223
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,309
I see.

224
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,518
Thank you, Pili.

225
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,429
You think this was
hidden by the dead guy?

226
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,954
Or someone else.
Or it means nothing.

227
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,578
We'll run some scans,
see what turns up.

228
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,221
Indian military has no record
of any personnel

229
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,083
operating
during the time of the murder.

230
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,235
So we're looking for career mercenaries,
ex-military.

231
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:43,710
I'll send out a few emails,

232
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:46,735
see if any K&R
or Blackwater guys were in town.

233
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,163
No trace on the casing we found?

234
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,999
None, but we do have
an ID on the victim,

235
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,524
one Ajay Paveljit.

236
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,427
No immediate family.
No fixed address.

237
00:14:57,786 --> 00:15:00,482
The body's downstairs.
We're ready to start the autopsy.

238
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,695
I am... jetlagged.

239
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,990
I think I better turn in,
but why don't you do the autopsy,

240
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,335
and we'll just go over
the results tomorrow?

241
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:19,906
- I thought he was a doctor.
- He is,

242
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,712
just not the kind
that likes autopsies.

243
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:14,882
Wake up!

244
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,740
Don't make me come in there.

245
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,805
No, seriously,
don't make me come in there.

246
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,740
Next time you should actually
try sleeping.

247
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,969
I don't know...

248
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,080
I guess it's the 22 time zones
in two days.

249
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:40,953
Snap out of it.

250
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,126
Ravi's downstairs.
He's got something.

251
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,603
All right, I'll be down in a minute.

252
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,597
Tests on the statue came back clean.

253
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,912
There's nothing unusual about it,
however...

254
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,710
I completed the autopsy
on Mr. Paveljit.

255
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,278
According to his DNA scan,
he's human,

256
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,624
so imagine my surprise
when I examined his internal organs

257
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,799
and found evidence
that he was over 200 years old.

258
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:14,102
What?

259
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,409
But his DNA is normal?

260
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,869
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

261
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,704
He's 100% human.

262
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,623
I ran the test
three times to be sure.

263
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,866
Crafty son of a bitch.

264
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,599
Stares down the barrel of a gun

265
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:36,874
not 20 feet away
from where he hid the bloody thing.

266
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:39,376
That's devotion.

267
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:41,114
So where is it now?

268
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:43,848
Often, that's a good question.

269
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,314
Any sign of the old woman,
or the statue? No?

270
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:49,317
This one said he saw someone
take the statue, a man.

271
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,278
Was he a white man like me?

272
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,168
Competition.

273
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,779
Magnus's people.

274
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,469
It would be so crappy

275
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,956
if they got to the bug before us.

276
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:12,745
Lads, this just got more difficult.

277
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,679
- How was Egypt?
- Tiring,

278
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,677
and what's the other word
I'm looking for? Yes, sandy.

279
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:22,971
- What's been happening here?
- You'll be pleased to hear

280
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:26,049
that most of the affected abnormals
have calmed down substantially.

281
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,733
Whatever was causing the flare-up
seems to have dissipated somewhat.

282
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,816
That's a relief.

283
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,490
These are the locations
where the events took place.

284
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:41,161
London, Tokyo, Sydney,
Rio, Lagos, Cairo.

285
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,163
There doesn't appear
to be a common link.

286
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,831
No pattern that I can discern.

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,553
You're saying all these places
were affected at the same time?

288
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,913
Roughly, why?

289
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:51,540
If it was some kind of trigger,
it would have to be very strong

290
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,881
and moving very quickly.

291
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:55,504
- An EM pulse of some kind.
- Maybe.

292
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,594
That doesn't align
with the symptoms we're seeing.

293
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,806
Exactly. None of the abnormals
we're dealing with

294
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,060
are usually affected by EM spikes.

295
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:05,435
I don't know anything powerful enough
to send a pulse worldwide like that.

296
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,105
Still, I'll have Henry
go over the satellite data.

297
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,351
There must be
something we're missing.

298
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,068
You were right.

299
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:18,049
Chinese weather satellite caught a trace
of a unique energy signature

300
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:20,074
right around the time
the incidents began,

301
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,993
but I followed it to this.

302
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,456
It's an EM pulse originating in Mumbai,
right in the heart of Dharavi.

303
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,334
- Dear God.
- <i>That's pretty much what I said.</i>

304
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,044
What does it mean?

305
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,524
<i>That this is somehow connected
to the cult of Kali.</i>

306
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,614
And voila.
Drink this.

307
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:41,739
Thanks.

308
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,740
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel like I'm dying or something.

309
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,691
Maybe it's something you ate.

310
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,523
The first time I was here,
I had a samosa off the street cart.

311
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,693
I barfed for, like,
two days straight...

312
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,092
Okay, thank you.
That's great.

313
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,808
Maybe you should
go back and lie down.

314
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:06,538
- Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
- Do you want me to come with you?

315
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,165
No, thanks, I'm fine.

316
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,203
Why don't you just keep
asking about the cult?

317
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,713
You sure you're okay?

318
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,489
Yeah, I think I just need to sleep.

319
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,112
Quickly!
They're coming!

320
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,858
They must not find him.

321
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,633
- You lost him?
- No, he wasn't feeling well,

322
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,691
so he headed back
to the Sanctuary early.

323
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:43,121
- Did you check the hospitals?
- Nobody fits his description.

324
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:46,383
- What about his cell phone?
- We tracked it using the GPS.

325
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:48,008
Found it in a ditch.

326
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:50,883
I've organized a search.
We have people going door-to-door.

327
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,797
Don't worry, we'll find him.

328
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,700
Show me this statue you found.

329
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:03,696
He's out there,
which means I am too.

330
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,456
We just found out, sir.
She only landed here 90 minutes ago.

331
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:13,078
Bribe an official.
Get a passenger manifest.

332
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:16,071
You can't just come to me and say,
"guess what, she's suddenly in town."

333
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:18,394
Sir, she flies a private charter
with a bogus flight plan.

334
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,194
- There's no way we could have known...
- Enough, enough.

335
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,401
I mean, this isn't a game.

336
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:28,137
It's a one-shot,
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

337
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:30,832
Some mooks from the local Sanctuary,
one thing.

338
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:31,975
Helen Magnus?

339
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,221
She's another,

340
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,357
and it means if we screw up,
even marginally,

341
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:41,869
we're going to get pinched,

342
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,024
or die,

343
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:45,225
or worse.

344
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,566
No more surprises.

345
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,418
It commemorates
the ceremony of acceptance.

346
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,666
You recognize it?

347
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,671
From a conference in Brazil
about 40 years ago.

348
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:05,633
Markings are similar, signifying a cult
member's initiation as a doot.

349
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,480
"Doot?" I don't know that word.

350
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:10,481
Ancient Urdu dialect
meaning "herald"

351
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,266
or "guardian",
or in some translations, "prophet".

352
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,109
It was believed that the doots
could foretell disaster...

353
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:17,859
Earthquakes, tsunamis,
and the like...

354
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,440
That the advance warning gave
the other members a chance to escape.

355
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:23,484
Seems like someone with that ability
would be worth more alive than dead.

356
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:24,724
Definitely.

357
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,637
- You're sure there was nothing inside?
- They're completely solid.

358
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:31,136
Scans for surface residue
are still pending.

359
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,026
The pattern inside here changes.

360
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,790
The design loses symmetry.

361
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,488
Something's missing.

362
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:01,147


363
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,281


364
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:56,021
Durga,

365
00:24:56,851 --> 00:24:58,353
where have you been?

366
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:01,697
I've been looking for you.

367
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,635
I tried to call,

368
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:07,186
but you didn't answer.

369
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:14,051
What's wrong?

370
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,847
Are you sick?

371
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:23,292
What's happened to you?

372
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:27,165
Why won't you answer me?

373
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,086
Will he survive?

374
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,225
- I don't believe it.
- What?

375
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,299
Tests show surface residue on the statue
came from a Makri.

376
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,661
- I'm not familiar with that.
- You wouldn't be.

377
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:08,071
It's an incredibly rare
species of abnormal spider

378
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:11,194
that requires a warm-blooded host
to survive. I thought they were extinct.

379
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:13,571
Something that rare
would be very valuable...

380
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,755
This isn't about money.

381
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,781
This is about something far worse.

382
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:27,482
The Makri is a subspecies off-shoot
of a marine-dwelling abnormal

383
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,837
known as <i>Gephallis Bertallosso</i>.

384
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:33,549
It's a massive arachnid creature
capable of manipulating tectonic plates

385
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,918
via focused magnetic resonance.

386
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,011
You're talking about Big Bertha.

387
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,734
- The one who makes the earth move.
- And the waters rise.

388
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,809
The Makri is
its tiny genetic cousin.

389
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:48,439
They may well have a link,
a chemical, or even psychic bond

390
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,150
that allows the host
a deeper connection to Big Bertha.

391
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,611
So if anyone finds this Makri...

392
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,978
They could potentially use it

393
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:58,339
to locate the most powerful
abnormal on earth.

394
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,744
Wait, but Big Bertha is dead.
You killed her four years ago, yes?

395
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:03,899
We all know that.

396
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:07,102
Dr. Magnus?

397
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:09,591
Not exactly.

398
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,260
Bertha is alive.

399
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,055
You kept her alive
and lied about it?

400
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,744
Historically, creatures
as powerful as Big Bertha

401
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:24,116
have a symbiotic relationship
with other life forms on this planet.

402
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:27,645
I felt that euthanizing her
would create far greater problems...

403
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,773
Tidal patterns would be altered,
undersea ecological systems

404
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,858
completely destroyed,
massive geological shifts.

405
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,990
The best course of action
was to keep her secure and under watch.

406
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,118
Killing her posed far greater risks
than keeping her alive.

407
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:45,621
Where is she?

408
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,612
A specialized containment field
at the bottom of the Indian ocean.

409
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,338
Which you kept hidden...

410
00:27:54,663 --> 00:27:55,749
It was necessary!

411
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,452
To keep her
and the rest of the world safe.

412
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,016
It was my prerogative, Ravi.

413
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,141
My choice.

414
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,195
Fine.

415
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:13,649
We need to dispatch ships
immediately,

416
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,260
- increase security to the entire area.
- Of course.

417
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,279
I'll get Henry on it.
He'll coordinate,

418
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,265
but we need to find Will.

419
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,010
If the Makri behaves
the way I believe it does,

420
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,953
then it could well be a doorway
into finding Bertha's location,

421
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,451
which is what the mercenaries were after
when they killed Mr. Paveljit.

422
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,525
- What happened to me?
- You went away for a while,

423
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:52,563
but now you're back.

424
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:56,108
- Why did I get sick?
- Because of the Makri,

425
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:58,895
the ancient spider inside you.

426
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,407
The former host, Ajay,
was being chased by bad men.

427
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,951
He hid the Makri
in the shrine of Durga.

428
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:07,415
You found it.

429
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:09,663
You were not supposed to.

430
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:15,169
- But why did it...
- The Makri needs a host.

431
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:16,921
When it doesn't have one,

432
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:20,341
it speaks for all the world to hear.

433
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:22,825
It chose you...

434
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,262
Which is a great honor.

435
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:29,645
- I should get back to the Sanctuary.
- The streets are not safe.

436
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,061
For that matter,

437
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,438
the Sanctuary may not be either.

438
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,915
You must stay hidden
until you get proper training.

439
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:40,055
Trained?

440
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,987
To become a suitable host.

441
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:47,326
It is in the blood of my people
to withstand the trials of the Makri.

442
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,185
You are strong,

443
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:52,957
but you are far from being ready.

444
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,255
<i>News travels fast.</i>

445
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,423
Terrance.

446
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,970
<i>You kept Bertha alive
after all we discussed.</i>

447
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,867
- It was necessary.
- <i>And I appreciate your opinion,</i>

448
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,175
<i>but things have
changed considerably.</i>

449
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:11,680
- <i>Do you have any leads?</i>
- Currently, we're at a disadvantage,

450
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:13,811
but Bertha is secure, I assure you.

451
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,563
<i>And let's hope she stays that way.</i>

452
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,858
- <i>You're certain this Makri is linked?</i>
- We are now.

453
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:22,111
<i>Let me come to Mumbai, help you
analyze everything you've learned.</i>

454
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:25,865
You don't need to do that. Besides,
you've got your hands full in New York.

455
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,616
<i>You have my complete support,</i>

456
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:29,275
<i>you always have,</i>

457
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:32,621
<i>but people are questioning
your judgment.</i>

458
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:34,915
I can handle it.

459
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:36,965
<i>I hope so.</i>

460
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,721
What is the Makri?

461
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,275
It's what gives you your power.

462
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,060
My power?

463
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,021
To be a doot,

464
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:58,645
a prophet.

465
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:02,568
It is through you that the destroyer
of the world communicates with us.

466
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:05,446
Kali...

467
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,324
She is extremely powerful.

468
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,660
Without the Makri
to help us speak to her,

469
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,371
we'll be as helpless
as leaves in the wind.

470
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,795
That's the woman of my visions.

471
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:18,667
That's Kali.

472
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:22,755
You're seeing her already?

473
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,835
Then your connection
must be very strong.

474
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,435
What are we going to do?

475
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,236
Run and hide.
Go, go, go, go, go.

476
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,245
Check in there.

477
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,850
<i>We've got search ships
moving into the area now.</i>

478
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,380
<i>We should be at Bertha's coordinates
in six hours or less.</i>

479
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,645
Good. I want you on a plane immediately
with the weapon.

480
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,655
<i>We'll monitor her sensors from here.</i>

481
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:23,305
About that.

482
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,865
Just so you know,
I went over the sensor logs.

483
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:31,574
You know how she's supposedly
been asleep this whole time?

484
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:35,661
<i>Guess what happened
at roughly the same time</i>

485
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,330
<i>as the Mumbai EM pulse?</i>

486
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,248
She responded to
the call of the Makri.

487
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:43,120
She emitted a magnetic burst
so low in frequency

488
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:45,921
that the sensors didn't detect it
until I did a full scan,

489
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:49,633
but it was powerful enough to briefly
alter the Earth's magnetic field.

490
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:51,445
<i>Magnetic North</i>

491
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:54,715
<i>was shifted by one hundred thousandth
of a degree.</i>

492
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,585
<i>Navigation instruments
all over the world were affected.</i>

493
00:32:57,985 --> 00:32:59,435
<i>Doc, that is power.</i>

494
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:04,455
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.

495
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:09,486
Who said good things
don't happen to good people.

496
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:12,615
Dr. Will Zimmerman?

497
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:19,385
And you...

498
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,999
I've been looking for you for years.

499
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:28,922
If I'm not mistaken, you're the last
surviving member of the Cult of Kali.

500
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,718
You're too old to withstand it,
so the spider's got to be in him.

501
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,511
Please, you must not do this.

502
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:37,348
Are you kidding?

503
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,892
Is she kidding?
Of course I must.

504
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:42,905
This is huge!

505
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,900
I was sure your boss
was going to find you before I did,

506
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,868
so I think this is kismet.

507
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,325
Karma.

508
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:53,395
Fate.

509
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:55,741
All that stuff.

510
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:01,435
Get that set up.

511
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:03,582
Who are you?

512
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:05,935
Me?

513
00:34:06,415 --> 00:34:07,685
Just a guy...

514
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:09,880
With lots of money,

515
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,946
and people.

516
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,051
I like to get my hands on

517
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,475
rare stuff, you know?

518
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:20,349
Why, did you think
I was someone a bit cooler?

519
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,355
An abnormal?

520
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,325
Don't I wish it.

521
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:33,355
But you just wait.

522
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:34,735
What are you...

523
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,125
What are you going to do to me?

524
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,745
You mean
you haven't worked it out yet?

525
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,831
So you know that little thing
inside of you?

526
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,666
It's like a dial-an-earthquake

527
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,734
in a box.

528
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,385
You see, you are...

529
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,714
psychically connected to...

530
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,133
Kali.

531
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,596
I was going to say Big Bertha,
but sure.

532
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:01,515
Big Bertha?

533
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:04,685
Kali...

534
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:07,646
One and the same.
I know, I know,

535
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,805
you thought she was dead.
So did everybody

536
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,442
thanks to Sheriff Magnus,

537
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,935
but she's still alive and kicking,

538
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:17,575
and whoever has that bug
inside of them...

539
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,165
They control her.

540
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:24,079
So, my friend here is going to hit you
with a low-frequency magnetic

541
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,247
pulse,
and I'm not going to lie to you,

542
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:28,775
that little thing
is not going to like it,

543
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:30,815
no, not one little bit...

544
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:36,505
But to tell you the truth,
it's the only way to get the bug out.

545
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,665
So... Sorry, Will.

546
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:43,545
Wait a second.

547
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:45,851
Just hold on a second.

548
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:18,705
Hold it, hold it!

549
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:36,905
What have you done?

550
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:38,935
Relax, he's perfectly okay.

551
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,033
You just need to send your signal out,
don't you, little buddy,

552
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:45,745
before you're ready
for your new home.

553
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:53,415
<i>Henry's en route.</i>

554
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,470
Good.

555
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,530
I need a detailed list
of all naval traffic

556
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,257
within a 500-kilometer radius

557
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,995
of the coordinates around Bertha.

558
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:03,110
What is it?

559
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,285
<i>Satellites just picked up
a disturbance in Mumbai.</i>

560
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:13,615
It's the EM pulse again.

561
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,274
<i>The Makri.</i>

562
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:19,695
It's coming from a warehouse
about six kilometers northeast of here.

563
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,845
We need to let Kate know.

564
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,282
<i>I will.</i>

565
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:27,885
The pulse went global.
They've probably detected it by now.

566
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:29,900
I need a few minutes.

567
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:32,495
- Start packing up.
- Copy that. Start packing up!

568
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,565
You're not prepared for this.

569
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,403
I've been training for years
for this moment.

570
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,015
Rocky on the courthouse steps.

571
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,242
I know all about you people.

572
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,795
I've mimicked your diet,
oxygen levels,

573
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:54,164
nutrients.

574
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,800
I've mastered your meditation.

575
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:58,390
I've opened more chakras
than you can shake a stick at.

576
00:38:58,515 --> 00:38:59,625
Oh, bibi...

577
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,920
I'm prepared.

578
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:04,895
You cannot force the Makri
to take you as a host.

579
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,511
It must choose.

580
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,750
The whole religious bit.

581
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,380
Ceremony of acceptance,

582
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:13,433
commune with the gods,
tinky winky woo-woo.

583
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,769
I've read all about that.

584
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,615
- There's more to it than you know.
- It's a bug!

585
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,925
It needs a host.

586
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,535
It's science.

587
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,525
I have a sensor alert
from Bertha's containment location.

588
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:04,568
What?

589
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:05,845
<i>Movement.</i>

590
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:10,490
I see it. Can you compensate,
flood the area with sedative?

591
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,075
Already done.

592
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,453
Her system's beating it.

593
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,830
<i>Bloody hell, they found her.</i>

594
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,928
Sir, it's happening.

595
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,764
Lock onto her tracking beacon.

596
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,350
Got it.

597
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,144
<i>Is she emitting any magnetic energy?</i>

598
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,814
Are any of our ships close?

599
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:46,370
<i>Nearest vessels
are 29 kilometers out.</i>

600
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:48,820
- It's not good enough.
- They're tracking her.

601
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:50,670
What about their ships?

602
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,824
Two Sanctuary vessels within 30 k.

603
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,635
Watch this.

604
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,130
What's happening?

605
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:18,016
I don't know. I've lost telemetry
on Bertha. I don't have a position.

606
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,226
<i>Neither do i.</i>

607
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:21,520
Magnet burst just scrambled
their system.

608
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,814
Two Sanctuary ships
dead in the water.

609
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,710
- Their homing beacon?
- Disabled.

610
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,692
Could be interference.
Reboot the system.

611
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,735
<i>Kate, what's your position?</i>

612
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:32,915
We're almost there.

613
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,165
Sorry...

614
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:41,895
Really.

615
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,095
It's just business.

616
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,545
Go to hell.

617
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:50,173
Sir, we've got Sanctuary personnel
in the vicinity.

618
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,092
They're closing in.

619
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,302
Okay, people,
let's get the hell out of this hole!

620
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:00,905
Put her in the van.

621
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:04,104
What about him?

622
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:10,105
He's already dead.

623
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,555
Converge on the warehouse.

624
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,855
Converge on the warehouse!

625
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,055
<i>Reboot is complete.</i>

626
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,046
I've lost all satellite data
from the region.

627
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:31,395
Get it back!

628
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:34,315
I can't.

629
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:35,645
Dammit.

630
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,385
They used her to blind us.

631
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,139
They've got Big Bertha.

632
00:42:58,385 --> 00:42:59,485
Call Magnus.

633
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,737
No pulse.

634
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:02,662
Oh, God.

635
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,455
Come on.
Come on, Will.

636
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:15,905
I'm putting his blood sample
into the system now!

637
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:17,065
Come on!

638
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,428
It's going to be okay.

639
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,139
Pulmocardiac tach.

640
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:23,975
Help me hold him!
Will, it's Helen! Can you hear me?

641
00:43:24,825 --> 00:43:27,020
Kali...
She's out there!

642
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,665
God, what the hell
did they do to you?

643
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:32,275
He's in shock.

644
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,573
Oh, my God.

645
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,116
- What?
- His organs are

646
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,201
in failure.

647
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:43,880
His system's been flooded
with toxic antibodies.

648
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:46,331
- Turn him!
- What? He's been poisoned?

649
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,709
The Makri have been removed by force.
It would have released these toxins.

650
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:51,850
I thought the hosts
can't survive without it.

651
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:52,975
They can't!

652
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:16,015
God, he looks terrible.

653
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,105
Unfortunately, the Makri's absence
from his nervous system

654
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,430
is causing a hypersensitive
immune response.

655
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:23,702
I've stabilized him for now,

656
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:26,040
reduced the fevers,
prevented more seizures.

657
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,665
We're running tests.

658
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:31,145
I know of a few treatments
that could slow his decline,

659
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,421
but we simply don't know enough about
the Makri's effects on his physiology.

660
00:44:36,525 --> 00:44:37,975
Any sign of Bertha?

661
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:41,303
All our resources are being diverted
to the search, but it'll take time.

662
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:43,555
She could be thousands of miles away
by now.

663
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:47,705
Don't beat yourself up about it.
You did what you had to do.

664
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:50,115
I wish it were that simple.

665
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:53,455
The truth is, I broke the rule
that I myself set into place.

666
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:55,775
It had to come back and haunt me.

667
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,943
No, doc.

668
00:44:57,285 --> 00:45:00,465
There is a psychic link
to a parasite and an ancient cult.

669
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,456
Abnormals all over the world
are acting crazy.

670
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:07,070
I would say that your hunch about Bertha
connected to the eco-system is good.

671
00:45:07,195 --> 00:45:10,060
- She could destroy millions of lives.
- And by killing her,

672
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,917
she could destroy millions of lives,
so what kind of choice is that?

673
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:15,685
Look, it happened...

674
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,248
So we improvise, we fix it.

675
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:22,865
What else can I do?

676
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:27,432
Find out if Henry's made it
to the lead search ship.

677
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:29,392
Patch him through when he's ready.

678
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,075
Done.

679
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,650
Bertha's magnetic burst
definitely caused a spike in weirdness.

680
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:54,709
I've adjusted our navigation
systems to compensate.

681
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:57,250
<i>Also,
Declan's reporting more incidents</i>

682
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,714
<i>of abnormals appearing in public,
stirring things up.</i>

683
00:46:01,035 --> 00:46:03,510
<i>I've received messages from heads
of Sanctuaries all over the world.</i>

684
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:05,136
Things are getting worse.

685
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:08,473
Doc, listen, about Bertha.
I'm really sorry I wasn't there to help.

686
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:11,601
You were in the air, Henry.
There's nothing you could've done.

687
00:46:11,845 --> 00:46:13,510
Okay, so we lost round one.

688
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:14,813
What's our next move?

689
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,565
We need to re-establish contact
with Bertha's tracking device.

690
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,920
<i>Bad guys have got her
under some sort of a jamming cloak.</i>

691
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,822
- <i>My scans aren't picking anything up.</i>
- Who the hell could've done this?

692
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,616
Someone with major connections
in the abnormal world.

693
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:28,870
It's far more than that.
This is someone

694
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,955
who has gathered pieces of information
that are thousands of years old...

695
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:34,749
The Cult of Kali, the Makri,
its connection to Bertha.

696
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,418
Who everybody believed was dead.

697
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:40,631
<i>You know, this whole cult thing,
that's got to be biblical old, no?</i>

698
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,756
Older, in fact.

699
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,420
There are legends of abnormals
who were movers of Earth,

700
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:47,887
heralds of the great floods, whisperers
who could talk to all creatures.

701
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:51,182
<i>All these predate even the earliest
Egyptian dynasties.</i>

702
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,185
Someone studied this
as though it were all fact, not myth,

703
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,425
and now they have control
of the most dangerous abnormal on Earth.

704
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,045
I want to know who we're dealing with
and where they've taken her.

705
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,694
Get us back in the game.

706
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,365
We're almost in position,
Mr. Forsythe.

707
00:47:58,105 --> 00:47:59,105
Durga...

708
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:04,275
Durga?

709
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:33,655
Durga, find me.

710
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:41,585
Come to me.

711
00:48:51,855 --> 00:48:53,888
Ravi, I need
two milligrams lorazepam!

712
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:56,715
Hold him still,
or he'll lose the IV!

713
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,728
Help me!

714
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:02,595
Help me find her!

715
00:49:06,645 --> 00:49:07,610
Talk to me.

716
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:09,775
Help me find her...

717
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:01,785
Dammit...

718
00:50:03,555 --> 00:50:06,127
You can't see her, can you?

719
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:08,504
Who?

720
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:09,715
Kali.

721
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:11,735
You can't see her.

722
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,590
The Bhagavad Gita says
the herald will see her

723
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,476
as a beautiful enchantress
when the connection is strong,

724
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,854
"with color so vibrant
so as to blind a man."

725
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,147
It does say that.

726
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,095
So why am I seeing nothing
when I'm connected to Bertha?

727
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,570
Come on.

728
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:37,145
I brought you here
as my tech support,

729
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:39,452
and it's my first time as a herald.

730
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:44,905
I'm not going
to get nasty with you...

731
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:47,251
But he might.

732
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:53,845
Kali only comes to the mind's eye

733
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,135
when the Makri wills it so.

734
00:50:56,785 --> 00:51:00,085
You are not its chosen host.

735
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,558
You will never see her mind
inside yours.

736
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,852
So I don't get fries
with my Happy Meal.

737
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:07,689
You're not a herald,

738
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,237
and you never will be.

739
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:12,395
Really?

740
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:16,030
That's funny,
because I thought I was the one

741
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:19,305
who made her crawl 200 miles
across the ocean floor.

742
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,412
I'm the one
with the critter inside of me.

743
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,580
I think Bertha will do
whatever I want.

744
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,748
Such as?

745
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:28,376
What do the ancient texts foretell?

746
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:34,545
The Great Flood will come
and sweep away sins.

747
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:38,375
The earth swallowing up our unclean.

748
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,770
Every single holy man has
predicted Bertha's awakening

749
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:44,465
since the beginning of time,
and guess what?

750
00:51:47,845 --> 00:51:49,045
They're right.

751
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:51,805
They're right.

752
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,527
Bibi...

753
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,415
It's the end of days.

754
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,435
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

755
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,175
Do not do that.

756
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:31,773
- Do what?
- Follow me like that.

757
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:35,067
You're looking for the ones who hurt
the white man. Those who took my bibi.

758
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:36,765
You saw them?

759
00:52:39,065 --> 00:52:40,531
The white guy is pretty sick.

760
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,950
Sick? But he has a Makri inside him.

761
00:52:44,015 --> 00:52:44,911
Not anymore.

762
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:47,965
That's very bad.

763
00:52:51,155 --> 00:52:52,335
You heard from Henry?

764
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,105
Still trying to steal back satellites
to pick up Bertha's trail.

765
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,715
He's going through every ship
in the area at the time she escaped.

766
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:00,125
So far all their stories check out.

767
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,136
He's checking registries,
and companies...

768
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,780
It's all taking too long.

769
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:05,890
Bertha's been gone
more than 12 hours now.

770
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,558
Someone has control of her.

771
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,561
Declan's reporting
more abnormals worldwide wreaking havoc.

772
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,231
Controlling the spin
on that many sightings, not easy.

773
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:18,210
He's speaking more Hindi now
than English when he talks.

774
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:21,050
- He keeps calling out for Kali.
- Quite possibly a side effect

775
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:24,076
- of having the Makri forcibly removed.
- It isn't.

776
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,201
This is Arjuna.

777
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:27,685
He says he's a member of the Cult.

778
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,957
- Tell them what you told me.
- Your friend's still connected to Kali.

779
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,000
Are you certain?

780
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,735
If he still sees her in his dreams,
they can speak.

781
00:53:37,535 --> 00:53:38,589
Kali's an Apsara.

782
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:40,132
A sea spirit.

783
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:46,230
Once the Makri chooses its host,
that bond can't be undone,

784
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:47,765
even when the Makri is gone.

785
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,351
Can he sense this Apsara,
control it?

786
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,811
Not without the Makri.

787
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,481
- He's helpless.
- Unless he call her in a Rapati Sungu.

788
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:57,567
Rapati Sungu?

789
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:00,361
- He must dance for her.
- Dance for her?

790
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,365
If he dances a song for her,
she will hear him. If he dances well,

791
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,243
- she will listen to whatever he says.
- Are you sure about this?

792
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,787
Of course.
I am to be a host when I am older.

793
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:12,445
I've been training
since I was very young.

794
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:17,495
Infirmary, go ahead.

795
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:20,047
You have a visitor.

796
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,055
You took Bertha to the woods to kill her
and you never pulled the trigger.

797
00:54:26,465 --> 00:54:29,415
- The optics on that are...
- To hell with the optics, Terrance.

798
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:31,210
I chose not to kill her.

799
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,800
If I thought it would be popular,
I wouldn't have kept it secret.

800
00:54:33,925 --> 00:54:35,945
The only problem with lying
is getting caught.

801
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:42,028
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that 80...

802
00:54:42,785 --> 00:54:46,285
50 years ago, even, no one
would have challenged you on this,

803
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,285
but things have changed.

804
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,810
I'm sure you did
what you thought was best,

805
00:54:50,935 --> 00:54:52,735
and at the time,
it probably was, but now...

806
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,755
I couldn't have known
about the Makri,

807
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,501
or that someone would have figured out
a way to control Bertha remotely.

808
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,370
And I know you took
every precaution,

809
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:00,630
but it still happened.

810
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,291
This isn't even about credibility.

811
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,285
It's becoming about trust.

812
00:55:08,395 --> 00:55:10,605
You need to contain
this situation quickly.

813
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:14,148
We need to find whoever's controlling
Bertha and sever the connection.

814
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,812
Once I get her back
into containment again...

815
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,080
Containment?

816
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,210
Bertha is a threat to every
living creature on this planet,

817
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:24,990
- and you want to put her back in a box?
- This issue is far larger

818
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:27,015
than you could possibly understand.

819
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:29,265
Killing her is a last resort.

820
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:32,370
The other heads of house agree.
It would be far too reckless.

821
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,515
Some feel that way,

822
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:37,975
but not all...

823
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,295
The tides are turning.

824
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:44,445
We've known each other
for a long time,

825
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,176
and I owe you everything...

826
00:55:49,425 --> 00:55:51,645
But you need to rethink
your stand on this.

827
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:55,267
You're on thinner ice
than you realize.

828
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:02,781
<i>There were about 18 ships
in the vicinity when Bertha was taken.</i>

829
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:04,705
<i>At first blush,
most of them check out.</i>

830
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,565
<i>You got oil tankers, cargo ships,
fishing trawlers.</i>

831
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:10,595
<i>No connective tissue
between any of them.</i>

832
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,420
But you found something.

833
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,300
I hacked into the databases
of a few fortune 500 companies,

834
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:19,542
and I cross-referenced
their boards of directors.

835
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:23,421
You know, those guys make a whole bunch
of money for doing pretty much nothing?

836
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,131
<i>And?</i>

837
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,589
<i>And, well, one of the guys sits
on the board of every company</i>

838
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:31,887
<i>that had ships in the region
where Bertha was hijacked.</i>

839
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,355
<i>Here you go.</i>

840
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,180
<i>This is Edward Forsythe.</i>

841
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,269
<i>Now, he's a big player
in the global geo-mining biz.</i>

842
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,564
<i>This guy owns half of the oil rigs
in the gulf of Mexico</i>

843
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,778
and the North sea oil project.

844
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:45,651
All right, and...

845
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,237
<i>He was in Mumbai
when all this went down.</i>

846
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:50,197
I've met him before.

847
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:52,220
He approached me
at a conference years ago,

848
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:55,911
asked all sorts of questions
about abnormals in ancient mythology.

849
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,204
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

850
00:56:57,934 --> 00:56:59,206
<i>It's a bit rough in here.</i>

851
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:03,294
So I don't know
how he knows what he knows,

852
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:05,205
<i>yet,</i>

853
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:09,270
<i>but he did buy lots of ancient artifacts
from museums over the last few years</i>

854
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:11,260
<i>for, like, insane amounts of money.</i>

855
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:14,096
- What kind of artifacts?
- Totems, scrolls, ancient texts.

856
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,090
<i>It's all shroud-of-turin
indiana-jones stuff.</i>

857
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:19,606
He believes every abnormal can be traced
to a certain region of Pangea,

858
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:21,854
going back, like, millions of years.

859
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:25,357
- The original super-continent?
- Interesting theory, but without proof.

860
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,861
So what does a billionaire art collector
want with an earthquake monster?

861
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,405
Controlling Bertha's like having
the ultimate nuke.

862
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:35,242
<i>He could be using her to leverage
oil rights anywhere in the world.</i>

863
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,620
Political blackmail
for business contracts.

864
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,582
Any coastal city is in jeopardy
if he lets her loose.

865
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,190
That's a lot of risk
for a little gain.

866
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:47,797
I mean, the guy definitely
doesn't need the money.

867
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:50,195
Then what on Earth is he up to?

868
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:55,915
Do you think they're onto me,

869
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,540
Magnus and her crew?

870
00:57:59,155 --> 00:58:00,434
I think they're onto me.

871
00:58:01,696 --> 00:58:03,040
Not that it matters.

872
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:04,954
They have no idea what I'm up to.

873
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:07,334
They're probably digging up
the auction sale

874
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:09,944
from the canopic jar of Shtabi
from the London museum.

875
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:12,947
They should've bought it
from a numbered company.

876
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:17,451
We're never gonna be pals, are we?

877
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:20,145
You're afraid.

878
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,248
You should be.

879
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:26,127
Sorry about the delay, sir.

880
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:29,591
Bertha's proximity is playing havoc
with our navigation.

881
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:31,757
We were about to start
swapping puke stories.

882
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:32,975
What's new?

883
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:37,090
She's made good progress, sir.
She's at the designated coordinates now.

884
00:58:37,215 --> 00:58:39,201
So we're ready for phase two?
Collateral damage?

885
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:42,771
We anticipate major seismic activities
associated with her actions.

886
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:44,562
Coastal areas will be hit very hard.

887
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,625
That's a damn shame.

888
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:50,895
- Let's get it started.
- Right.

889
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:05,045
Come on, girl, let's go to work.

890
00:59:22,465 --> 00:59:23,965
Where have you been?

891
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:42,085
Come.

892
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:18,505
You have been looking for me?

893
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:19,928
That depends

894
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,076
if this is real or not.

895
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:24,515
I am real, Durga.

896
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:27,055
As real as you.

897
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:31,043
Why do you call me that?

898
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:32,325
Durga.

899
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,245
It is your name.

900
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:39,176
Don't tell me
you have forgotten mine as well?

901
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,305
Kali.

902
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:50,115
You should have not disappeared
like that.

903
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:52,356
Where did you go?

904
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:55,442
The thing that connects us
was taken from me.

905
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,005
The Makri?

906
01:00:58,305 --> 01:00:59,530
And you allowed this?

907
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:02,491
I didn't have the choice.

908
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:05,720
But the other one...

909
01:01:05,845 --> 01:01:07,695
that you're connected to...

910
01:01:08,185 --> 01:01:09,635
is not your herald.

911
01:01:11,455 --> 01:01:12,501
He calls me.

912
01:01:16,195 --> 01:01:17,256
You need to stay.

913
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,465
Don't listen to him.

914
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,125
I must go, Durga.

915
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:23,271
I can't stay.

916
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:25,415
No, wait.

917
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:27,611
If you are my true herald,

918
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:29,615
find me.

919
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:30,785
How?

920
01:01:31,162 --> 01:01:32,062
Dance...

921
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,580
the Rapati Sungu.

922
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:38,465
Dance?

923
01:01:39,325 --> 01:01:40,875
And you will find me.

924
01:02:08,535 --> 01:02:10,130
I should have taken
more precautions.

925
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:12,610
His state of mind's been
deteriorating lately.

926
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,820
I've contacted the local authorities,
given his description.

927
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:17,770
I'm sure they'll be a big help.

928
01:02:17,895 --> 01:02:21,180
You'd think a guy wandering the street
screaming about Kali would get noticed.

929
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:22,980
Not really. It's Mumbai.

930
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:26,784
I want all abnormals with psychic
and remote-viewing abilities activated.

931
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,585
If Will's mind is linked to Bertha,

932
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,080
there may be a way to track him
using unconventional means.

933
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,248
On it.

934
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,774
- Not now, Terrance.
- We need to get on a ship,

935
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:38,805
lead the search for Bertha,
and end this.

936
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,210
The search is ongoing.
Finding Will is just as important.

937
01:02:42,335 --> 01:02:44,730
His link to Bertha
may well be the key.

938
01:02:44,855 --> 01:02:46,355
I need five minutes.

939
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,860
- Take over, I'll be right back.
- Got it.

940
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:51,135
Come with me.

941
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:09,325
Are you sure?

942
01:03:15,155 --> 01:03:16,905
Are you sure? Look at it.

943
01:03:23,615 --> 01:03:24,665
Hey, buddy.

944
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:27,505
Thanks for nothing.

945
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:36,955
Come on...

946
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:45,290
God, these people are really,
really unhelpful.

947
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:47,542
No wonder we have no idea
where he's gone.

948
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:49,610
You're not really Indian, are you?

949
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:51,135
Excuse me? Dude...

950
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,942


951
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:55,690
Yeah, but you didn't grow up here,
that's for sure.

952
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,530
So you have no idea
how to talk to these people.

953
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:01,503
They want to help us.
You're just not asking properly.

954
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:03,429
Am I supposed to offer them money?

955
01:04:03,554 --> 01:04:05,450
'cause I have tried that.
It doesn't work.

956
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:09,260
It's entirely inappropriate to offer
money to someone in their own home.

957
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:12,065
You need to show politeness,
gratitude.

958
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:15,660
Would it kill you to have
a cup of tea with them, for God's sake?

959
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,585


960
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,481
They don't like you.
Stop being rude, they'll help us.

961
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:22,167
I know all that.

962
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:25,861
It's just that I've never bought
into that whole...

963
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:27,235
Quiet,

964
01:04:27,555 --> 01:04:29,907
subservient indian girl thing.

965
01:04:30,805 --> 01:04:33,176
Man, you have some serious hangups
about your roots.

966
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:34,620
This is the 21st century.

967
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,956
You don't have to be a servant, a maid,
you just have to show some respect.

968
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,210
You can be likeable, even attractive,
when you let your guard down.

969
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,335
Try that.

970
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:45,175
Did you...

971
01:04:45,345 --> 01:04:46,995
just make a pass at me?

972
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:48,980
Warming up to it,

973
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:51,599
not that my parents
would approve of you, of course.

974
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:54,535
I'm joking. They'd love you.

975
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:56,195
Really?

976
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,840
I know Will is tied into this,

977
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,350
but you're only gonna
dig yourself a bigger hole

978
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:07,360
by taking your eyes off of Bertha.

979
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:10,030
- Believe me, it's the right strategy.
- No, it isn't.

980
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:12,908
- You are way out of line.
- You need to focus on this right now.

981
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,538
Lying about not euthanizing
an extinction-level abnormal

982
01:05:17,815 --> 01:05:20,865
would've gotten any other
head of house suspended,

983
01:05:21,605 --> 01:05:24,350
but because it's you, they're trying
to give you the benefit of the doubt.

984
01:05:24,475 --> 01:05:26,171
- Which they should.
- For how long?

985
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:30,384
And now with this Forsythe character
who can control her by remote,

986
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,731
what would you say
if the shoe were on the other foot?

987
01:05:32,856 --> 01:05:35,156
There are extenuating circumstances.

988
01:05:35,485 --> 01:05:38,100
We don't know enough yet
about her connection to the Earth.

989
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,269
You don't destroy
something that powerful

990
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,560
- without having all the facts.
- The fact is,

991
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:45,550
she can destroy half of Europe
when she's upset!

992
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,438
You've taken us to the brink, Helen.

993
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,778
How did you think
the network would respond?

994
01:05:50,935 --> 01:05:53,085
You taught us to think like this.

995
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:55,455
You said, "question everything".

996
01:05:59,935 --> 01:06:03,135
They're giving you 72 hours
to contain the situation.

997
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,467
It's Henry.

998
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,984
<i>Geosynchronous satellites detected
major magnetic disturbances</i>

999
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:18,398
<i>about four minutes ago.</i>

1000
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:20,350
<i>I'm sending you the data now.</i>

1001
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,936
<i>Based on the resonance pattern,
this has got to be Bertha.</i>

1002
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,022
Redirect all search teams
to the coordinates.

1003
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,291
<i>We're closing in now,</i>

1004
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,775
<i>and I know your next question:
Why would he send Bertha there?</i>

1005
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,987
- Tectonic plates.
- <i>Because the tecton... Yeah, right.</i>

1006
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,489
It's a convergence point
of three major tectonic boundaries

1007
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,492
in the southern hemisphere,
the Indian, African and Arabian plates.

1008
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:40,655
Dear god, he's gonna set her off.

1009
01:06:46,195 --> 01:06:48,345
No change since the recent burst.

1010
01:06:49,035 --> 01:06:52,614
- Nothing?
- No activity. She's just sitting there.

1011
01:06:56,585 --> 01:06:58,055


1012
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:00,405


1013
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:03,050


1014
01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:04,561
You're not strong enough.

1015
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:07,975
You're not worthy
of carrying the Makri,

1016
01:07:08,845 --> 01:07:10,067
and Kali knows it.

1017
01:07:11,815 --> 01:07:12,815
Really?

1018
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,175
Watch this.

1019
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:21,375
Fire the little spider up.

1020
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,918
Magnetic resonance burst,

1021
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,587
half power,
just to get things started.

1022
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,770
- Mr. Forsythe...
- Shut up and do it.

1023
01:08:12,115 --> 01:08:15,015
Seismic readings coming
from Bertha's position.

1024
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,040
She's active. It's starting.

1025
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:20,635
Like I said, end of days.

1026
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:50,059
I've got your chopper at Shivaji airport
prepped and ready to go.

1027
01:08:50,184 --> 01:08:52,710
- <i>Should get you out here in six hours.</i>
- Good. Is the weapon ready?

1028
01:08:52,835 --> 01:08:55,130
<i>Yeah, one VLF Bertha stunner,
ready to go.</i>

1029
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:58,008
You get close enough, the acoustic
bullet should put her back to sleep.

1030
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,427
- Just, the problem is...
- We have to get close enough.

1031
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,931
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- <i>Okay, fly safe.</i>

1032
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:08,268
You're using a long-range
acoustic device against Bertha?

1033
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:09,871
We could knock her out.

1034
01:09:09,996 --> 01:09:11,938
Forsythe can't control
an unconscious creature.

1035
01:09:12,457 --> 01:09:15,442
- You need an alternative.
- I'm hoping it won't come to that.

1036
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,850
- There's too much at stake.
- I agree.

1037
01:09:17,975 --> 01:09:21,676
If there is absolutely no alternative,
then I will destroy her.

1038
01:09:34,366 --> 01:09:36,935


1039
01:09:38,015 --> 01:09:40,425


1040
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:46,181


1041
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:50,935
{\Many blessings upon your house
for your good will.}

1042
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:55,565


1043
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,620
- Suddenly such a delicate flower.
- Bite me.

1044
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:00,895
It's actually quite breathtaking.

1045
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,715
We'll monitor you from here.
Maintain radio contact.

1046
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:08,855
- Do nothing unless I order it.
- Of course.

1047
01:10:16,365 --> 01:10:17,365
Ready!

1048
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:38,425
Kali, what are you doing?

1049
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:45,245
No, you must stop!

1050
01:11:20,845 --> 01:11:21,845
The end...

1051
01:11:22,705 --> 01:11:24,007
The end of days!

1052
01:11:24,895 --> 01:11:26,195
The Great Flood!

1053
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:29,085
The Great Flood is coming!

1054
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:53,224
We're almost at the coordinates.
Anything yet?

1055
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,810
Yeah, reports of seismic activity
in the area,

1056
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:57,646
low-grade, but pretty constant.

1057
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,564
We've got to be getting
pretty close.

1058
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,935
I'm just getting some weird
mapping data here.

1059
01:12:06,915 --> 01:12:08,865
- Okay, that's just crazy.
- What is it?

1060
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:12,243
I'm cross-checking with
our nautical charts. Just hold on.

1061
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,520
Okay, either we're totally
off course, or...

1062
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,867
Doc, I'm reading
a chain of islands dead ahead,

1063
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,475
but there's nothing in the charts
indicating any land mass,

1064
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,850
just open ocean.

1065
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,634
That's because it's new.

1066
01:12:35,486 --> 01:12:38,636
- She's not making earthquakes.
- She's making land.

1067
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:45,190
This is Magnus.
We have a complication.

1068
01:12:45,315 --> 01:12:47,445
- Are you getting these images?
- <i>Yes, we are.</i>

1069
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:50,657
Sonar indicates tectonic plates
are diverging rapidly.

1070
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:55,453
We're also detecting a smaller vessel,
six miles west of your position.

1071
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,997
You wanna bet it's Forsythe?

1072
01:12:57,195 --> 01:12:59,249
This is the Captain.
We're moving to intercept.

1073
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,793
Don't!
He's got control of Bertha.

1074
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,671
If we try taking his ship,
there's no telling what he'll do.

1075
01:13:04,925 --> 01:13:07,590
That's why he's out here alone.
He has the ultimate bodyguard.

1076
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:08,967
If she keeps building...

1077
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:12,262
It'll cause massive destruction
to the entire region, I know.

1078
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,432
We're circling around, trying to get
a better lock on her position.

1079
01:13:17,705 --> 01:13:19,355
Copy that. Standing by.

1080
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,480
Ready deployment
of all depth charges.

1081
01:13:23,235 --> 01:13:25,275
If she can't finish this, we will.

1082
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,319
Yes, sir.

1083
01:13:33,485 --> 01:13:36,528
People are saying there's something
happening a few streets over.

1084
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:50,759
I can't get a shot.

1085
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:54,596
We didn't anticipate her making islands,
and they're kind of in the way.

1086
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:55,597
Dammit.

1087
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,223
What do you want me to do, doc?

1088
01:13:59,205 --> 01:14:00,477
Target Forsythe's ship.

1089
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,354
Forsythe's ship?

1090
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,845
If we can't shoot Bertha,

1091
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,984
we might be able to use the LRAD
to sever his connection to her.

1092
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,361
Oh, man...

1093
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:18,369
Kali, you must stop!
The end of days...

1094
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,205
I must...

1095
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,630
I must find her.

1096
01:14:23,295 --> 01:14:24,745
How can I find her?

1097
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:31,925
Dance...

1098
01:14:37,215 --> 01:14:38,315
I can dance!

1099
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:52,895
I can dance!

1100
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:33,735
Damn, I'm losing her.

1101
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:37,258
We're tracking a lone helicopter
closing in on our position.

1102
01:16:38,275 --> 01:16:39,525
Mr. Forsythe...

1103
01:16:41,975 --> 01:16:43,125
Mr. Forsythe?

1104
01:16:43,705 --> 01:16:45,141
It's Magnus, shoot her down.

1105
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,360
Doc!

1106
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,154
We have a weapons lock
on our position!

1107
01:16:59,355 --> 01:17:00,573
He's got missiles?

1108
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,866
Of course he does.

1109
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,046
Deploying countermeasures.
Hang on!

1110
01:17:22,735 --> 01:17:23,985
Nice move, doc!

1111
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,382
Get ready to fire the weapon!

1112
01:17:28,525 --> 01:17:31,271
<i>We have missed the target.
20 seconds to reload.</i>

1113
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:46,325
<i>Namaskarr</i>, Durga.

1114
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:49,622
<i>Namaskarr</i>, Kali.

1115
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,046
Bertha's slowing down.
Her volcanic activity is decreasing.

1116
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,814
Come on, stay with me.

1117
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,342
- I have a shot!
- Take it!

1118
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:10,925
He was here.
People saw him a few minutes ago.

1119
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,395
I know, I got the same story.

1120
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,231
- Something about a...
- Dancing, and apparently, quite well.

1121
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,549
Will dancing?

1122
01:18:17,245 --> 01:18:18,780
- Pull our people back.
- What?

1123
01:18:18,905 --> 01:18:20,540
The dance, the Rapati Sungu.

1124
01:18:20,665 --> 01:18:22,095
He's trying to reach Bertha.

1125
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,170
Get our people away from him.

1126
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:29,835
It worked.

1127
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,040
You heard me.

1128
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,775
You summoned me.

1129
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:40,785
Please, stop what you're doing.

1130
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,094
The Makri is telling me
that there is danger.

1131
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,430
You said your Makri
was taken from you.

1132
01:18:48,073 --> 01:18:48,973
I know,

1133
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:50,265
but...

1134
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:52,477
I can still feel you.

1135
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:57,565
- What you're doing...
- Is what I am asked to do.

1136
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,133
If you don't stop,

1137
01:18:59,655 --> 01:19:01,486
millions of people will die.

1138
01:19:02,865 --> 01:19:04,315
Then they will die.

1139
01:19:07,885 --> 01:19:08,951
But this herald...

1140
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,340
He doesn't respect you.
He's only using you for his own gain.

1141
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:16,250
- You are different?
- Yes!

1142
01:19:17,315 --> 01:19:18,865
I respect you.

1143
01:19:20,475 --> 01:19:21,990
Your power is incredible,

1144
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:24,670
but killing innocent people
is not what you're meant to do.

1145
01:19:24,795 --> 01:19:27,166
I have heard this
from other heralds in the past,

1146
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:29,347
a request for leniency,

1147
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,432
for mercy.

1148
01:19:32,785 --> 01:19:34,485
People are stronger now.

1149
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:37,155
If you hurt them,

1150
01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:40,015
they'll hurt you back.

1151
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:43,365
I only wish to be left alone.

1152
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,158
What's Bertha doing now?

1153
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,135
Scans indicate...

1154
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:54,145
She's inactive!

1155
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,773
I think it worked!

1156
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,917
- Did you hit her?
- <i>She's quiet.</i>

1157
01:19:58,695 --> 01:20:00,195
But still conscious?

1158
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,132
<i>We should be able to guide her back
to her containment area.</i>

1159
01:20:05,185 --> 01:20:08,750
<i>I'm heading back to the ship.
We'll regroup for the next phase.</i>

1160
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:09,925
Understood.

1161
01:20:11,885 --> 01:20:12,885
Captain...

1162
01:20:13,995 --> 01:20:16,640
Deploy all depth charges
to Bertha's position.

1163
01:20:16,765 --> 01:20:18,688
Target her with everything we have.

1164
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,481
Right now.

1165
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,649
Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,610
Ready all ordnance.
All charges, maximum depth.

1167
01:20:25,015 --> 01:20:27,115
All charges max depth. Aye, sir.

1168
01:20:27,805 --> 01:20:31,355
And cut off all Magnus' communications
with the other ships.

1169
01:20:34,235 --> 01:20:36,185
Why was I asked to make land?

1170
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:37,965
I don't know,

1171
01:20:39,195 --> 01:20:40,835
but you don't have to do
what he says.

1172
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:43,715
Please...

1173
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:48,095
You danced well for me, Durga.

1174
01:20:52,425 --> 01:20:53,931
I didn't have much of a choice.

1175
01:20:54,425 --> 01:20:56,445
I had to get your attention,
didn't I?

1176
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:06,355
Depth charges?

1177
01:21:06,605 --> 01:21:08,789
Terrance,
what the hell are you doing?

1178
01:21:10,641 --> 01:21:11,491
Dammit!

1179
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:30,092
What? What is it?

1180
01:21:31,114 --> 01:21:32,720
You said you would leave me alone!

1181
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,888
What happened?

1182
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,025
You betrayed me!

1183
01:21:53,905 --> 01:21:55,830
What the hell are you playing at?

1184
01:21:55,955 --> 01:21:57,105
She was calm!

1185
01:21:57,405 --> 01:22:00,455
We had a window of opportunity.
It had to be done.

1186
01:22:01,085 --> 01:22:01,916
Captain...

1187
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:05,628
Please escort Mr. Wexford to the brig,
pending my orders.

1188
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,755
With all respect, ma'am, I can't.

1189
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:11,509
I received a coded message
on the secure network frequency.

1190
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:14,227
- Mr. Wexford...
- By unanimous consent,

1191
01:22:14,352 --> 01:22:17,473
you are hereby relieved of your command
of the Sanctuary network,

1192
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,976
- effective immediately.
- Dude, you cannot be serious.

1193
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:22,186
Don't interfere, dude.

1194
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:24,939
I'm in charge of operations now.

1195
01:22:25,405 --> 01:22:28,776
You're remanded to custody,
pending further disciplinary action.

1196
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,613
- You had this planned all along.
- I had to take over if you failed,

1197
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:36,099
and by letting Bertha live yet
once again, you most certainly have.

1198
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,200
I'm sorry, Helen.

1199
01:22:38,325 --> 01:22:39,537
You gave me no choice.

1200
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,515
You have no idea what you've done.

1201
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:00,883
I saved lives.

1202
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:02,883
I did what you refused to do.

1203
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,215
No, Terrance,

1204
01:23:06,555 --> 01:23:08,305
this is what you've done!

1205
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:26,485
Oh, she's mad.

1206
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,145
