1
00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>Previously on </i>Sanctuary.

2
00:00:02,453 --> 00:00:04,211
<i>Pitting humans against abnormals,</i>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,171
<i>deciding who lives and who dies...</i>

4
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,762
The Cabal has to be stopped.
It's why I started this mission

5
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:10,176
more than a century ago.

6
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>Your mother and her colleagues
will no doubt try to stop us.</i>

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,722
They'll fail.

8
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:16,766
<i>You're going to help us
complete our plan.</i>

9
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,934
- <i>What did you do to me?</i>
- <i>See?</i>

10
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,312
I told you
you'd be better than before.

11
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,939
You're Cabal.

12
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,015
You know who we are.
Stop acting like a fool.

13
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,611
- Name!
- Kate Freelander.

14
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,154
<i>For the record, I'm not Cabal.</i>

15
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,114
<i>So you're a freelance operative?</i>

16
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,574
<i>Whoever pays me the most
gets my services.</i>

17
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:40,331
What have they done?

18
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,072
<i>She was waiting for us,
but it wasn't any Ashley you'd know.</i>

19
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,178
<i>They've used
the source blood to change her.</i>

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,805
It's not gonna stop there.

21
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:57,973
There'll be more just like her
very soon.

22
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,031
Six operatives
are now ready for deployment.

23
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,533
Their first mission
will be the most vital

24
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:05,608
to our long-term interests...

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,487
The complete destruction
of the Sanctuary network.

26
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:21,342
Magnus, wait!

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:24,975
What are you gonna do to her?

28
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,096
You know, this isn't bad,

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,941
though I find the peas
are a little overcooked.

30
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,567
The Cabal location you gave us
was a trap.

31
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:44,770
- We barely escaped with our lives.
- I could see how that would suck.

32
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,967
- You set us up.
- Okay, time-out for a second.

33
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,805
I did not set you up.

34
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:52,313
You asked for a location.
That's the only one I know.

35
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:55,489
Don't blame me if the Cabal is one step
ahead of you. It's what they do.

36
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,898
Are you completely incapable
of understanding what's happening here?

37
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,184
They've turned my daughter into a...

38
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,772
I want to talk to your contact
at the Cabal.

39
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,897
Now.

40
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,174
Dana Whitcomb.

41
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,237
<i>Is that your real name, or just the one
we'll put on your headstone?</i>

42
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,445
- Nice of you to call.
- You have my daughter. I want her back.

43
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,281
Before this escalates any further,
I'm willing to listen to your terms.

44
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,254
Actually, they're very simple.

45
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,994
We would happily arrange
for Ashley to be returned to you,

46
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,663
- <i>provided you give us what we want.</i>
- Which is?

47
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,125
Surrender the entire Sanctuary global
network into our hands immediately.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>Your daughter,</i>

49
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,545
<i>or your work.</i>

50
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,598
You choose.

51
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,308
The Team Projet-SG

52
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,018
presents:

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,229
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 2
End of Nights - Part 2 (v. 1.00)

54
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:13,734
Timing by: Arrow,
nitrogenc, Salomon

55
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,544
http://projet-sg.net

56
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:35,798
Tell me you're not considering this.

57
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,970
- It's an impossible choice.
- Is it?

58
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,347
If I did capitulate,
do you honestly believe that the Cabal

59
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,888
- would honor their end of the deal?
- She's our daughter!

60
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,040
Actually, I'm not so sure
about that anymore.

61
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,476
- What is she, then?
- She's exhibited multiple powers.

62
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,562
Teleportation, speed, strength.

63
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,648
Healing powers, super reflexes,
vampiric tendencies.

64
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,066
Sound familiar?

65
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,724
- Multiple powers?
- In one very violent package.

66
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,610
Whatever the Cabal has done to Ashley,
it's obvious that the source blood

67
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,013
is a key element.

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,125
We need to find a way
to interfere with it.

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,368
You mean a weapon?

70
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:07,997
To disable her,

71
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:09,665
neutralize her powers.

72
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,417
I'm totally on board with this,

73
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,337
but we have no idea how much
they've messed with her genetic make-up.

74
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,922
Making a weapon to stop her
kind of feels like a shot in the dark.

75
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:20,099
Not to mention neutralizing the effects
of the source blood,

76
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,970
or any mind-control drugs,
it could kill her outright.

77
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,597
Then make certain it doesn't.

78
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,806
- I'll need two weeks.
- We don't have that.

79
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,670
You'll have
every resource available.

80
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,999
I want a working prototype
ready immediately.

81
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:35,190
- You'll assist.
- We know the Cabal's real agenda now.

82
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,993
They want the entire Sanctuary network
under their control...

83
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,486
- Or destroyed.
- Either way,

84
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,958
Ashley has intimate knowledge
of our security protocols,

85
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,236
communications systems,
defense designs.

86
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,369
We changed all the codes
when Ashley went rogue,

87
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:49,766
but if she's as powerful,
we're gonna have

88
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:51,801
to alter every security protocol
in the network.

89
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,627
I'll speak to the heads,
let them know what to expect.

90
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,041
With Ashley,

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,839
they could bring
this entire network to its knees.

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,552
Which means that
every second is critical!

93
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,556
Work fast, gentlemen.

94
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,060
- Spare me!
- You're intent on going to war,

95
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,757
while I'm pushing for compromise.

96
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,946
So we surrender
every abnormal under our protection?

97
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,587
- I don't think so.
- Only enough to get Ashley back.

98
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:19,212
- Fight another day when we're stronger.
- We both know that day will never come.

99
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,112
- You saw what they've done to her!
- How dare you!

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,116
You think your sentiments come from
some generous place? They do not!

101
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:27,852
It's pure ego!

102
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:29,654
Ego?

103
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:31,830
Try regret.

104
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,042
Ashley and I did fine on our own.
Don't waste your time on the past.

105
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,087
You misunderstand me.
Again.

106
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,456
My regret is not because
I wasn't here to change nappies

107
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,386
or watch her take her first steps.

108
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:50,634
What I gave her...

109
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,720
What the Cabal has summoned
from within her...

110
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,084
are the gifts she inherited from me.

111
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,358
My bloodlust.

112
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:01,917
You weren't always that way, John.

113
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,409
You were changed,

114
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:06,447
and like your condition,
I'm convinced hers can be managed.

115
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,866
And if you're wrong?

116
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,623
What's bred in the bone
can't be undone in the flesh.

117
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,538
You'd think with all the resources
available to her,

118
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,667
she'd have a more updated facility.

119
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,288
This place is as backwards
as Oxford before the war.

120
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:36,613
The first war.

121
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,609
I think Dr. Magnus likes to keep
the old stuff around

122
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,890
for old time's sake.

123
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,292
She trusts it more

124
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,445
than the high-tech stuff
I try to push on her.

125
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,447
And she's incredibly cheap, to boot.

126
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:50,200
- I really can't comment on that.
- What, paycheck that low?

127
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,787
You don't think we can make
a working prototype in time.

128
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:54,997
Not even close.

129
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,232
A weapon to disable, not kill,

130
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,007
someone who possesses the abilities

131
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:02,337
of five of the most powerful abnormals
on Earth.

132
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,630
Ludicrous.

133
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:05,127
Pass me that.

134
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:09,261
So, how do we instantly affect
the viability of Ashley's altered blood?

135
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,265
- Localized radiation burst?
- Obvious. What kind of radiation?

136
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,059
Beta, X, Gamma?

137
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:17,269
- Concentrated, focused exposure.
- Possibly,

138
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,146
but how to modulate
the energy spectrum

139
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,148
so that it has the desired
benign effect?

140
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:23,464
While still taking her out.

141
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,362
The reason I'm asking
is because I don't know the answer.

142
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,569
And I'm me.

143
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:33,729
Excuse me.

144
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,999
Back in five.

145
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,781
I'll be here working...

146
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,944
Trying to save the world.

147
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,369
Single-handedly.

148
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,552
I don't understand
why you can't use what we gave you.

149
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,635
A bedpan?

150
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,072
Dude, I draw the line
at sitting on a metal salad bowl.

151
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,259
- Fine, but the cuffs stay on.
- I can deal.

152
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,266
- Just get me to a powder room.
- Fine.

153
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,543
Patient?

154
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,136
Friend.

155
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,866
You have got to be kidding me.
Is that a...

156
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,360
- For real?
- Do you mind?

157
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,953
Do you know what one of those is worth
on the black market?

158
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:11,128
Seriously...

159
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,992
More than you can make
in 10 years, dummy.

160
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,075
Lazarus virus?

161
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:29,162
But I heard there was a cure.

162
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,471
Let's just keep rolling.

163
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,434
Good.

164
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,346
We're ready for mission start,
on your mark.

165
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,074
Start the clock.

166
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:50,445
You have a go.

167
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,990
I need you to take us there right away.
We need to get into this fight.

168
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,117
- We can't help them.
- Why?

169
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,007
Because the entire facility
fell in 20 minutes.

170
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,746
Tokyo's gone.

171
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,962
<i>Dr. Hiromato refused to evacuate</i>

172
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,798
<i>until his staff were already out.</i>

173
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,435
<i>We found his body in the main lab.</i>

174
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,571
<i>Most of the residents
got out safely,</i>

175
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,729
<i>but if we'd been housing
anything dangerous...</i>

176
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:00,809
We have a much larger problem
on our hands.

177
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,809
<i>Do you know
how they beat the EM shield?</i>

178
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,395
That should have prevented them
from transporting inside.

179
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:09,123
<i>Teleporting within it would disrupt
their structure beyond recognition.</i>

180
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:12,122
<i>They targeted the EM shields
right after the breach.</i>

181
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,945
<i>After that,
we had no hope against them.</i>

182
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,499
<i>All our defensive weapons
were useless.</i>

183
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:17,866
<i>Get in by brute force,</i>

184
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,874
<i>turn off our best defense,
take out the head of the house,</i>

185
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,163
<i>- all in just minutes.
- There's more.</i>

186
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>We detected a remotely-activated
data burst</i>

187
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,811
<i>just before the facility
was set on fire.</i>

188
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:29,528
How much information did they steal?

189
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,190
<i>All of it, Dr. Magnus.</i>

190
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:34,049
<i>The EM shield
is the only thing that can stop them.</i>

191
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,052
<i>If they continue finding ways
to counteract it, we'll have no defense.</i>

192
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,430
Henry is working with his counterparts
at all of your Sanctuaries.

193
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:43,278
He's assembled the list
of new security upgrades,

194
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:46,436
which include modified shield codes
and better perimeter safeguards.

195
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,816
<i>With all respect,</i>

196
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:51,275
<i>Ashley knows every facility,
every security protocol.</i>

197
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,944
I'm aware of that.

198
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,694
Henry's new countermeasures
were designed with Ashley's knowledge.

199
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:59,443
That said,
I've asked each of you to evacuate

200
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,531
all residents and personnel
until this crisis is over.

201
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:05,038
<i>You mentioned a weapon that could
potentially stop these beings.</i>

202
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,534
- <i>When can that come into play?</i>
- Soon, I hope.

203
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:09,125
In the meantime,

204
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,383
we're working on finding out
which of the Sanctuaries

205
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,434
will be the Cabal's next target.

206
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,832
As much as I hate to use
this terminology,

207
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,300
we are at war,

208
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,500
and one
that we are ill prepared for.

209
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,098
<i>Can't we request assistance
from the intelligence community?</i>

210
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,765
Our job is to handle situations
exactly like this one.

211
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,769
It's why governments
allow us to exist.

212
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,865
If we can't deal with this,

213
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,145
there is no other line of defense.

214
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,753
Did you really inject your own blood
into Little Damien here?

215
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,618
We have to see the effects
of the radiation blast

216
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,188
on source blood physiology,

217
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,163
and I'm hardly going to do the test
on myself.

218
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:50,705
I hope it doesn't make him too sick.

219
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,130
Yes, me too.

220
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,319
Stand back.

221
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,975
Dude, it's losing its mind!

222
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,383
Interesting.

223
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,462
Making Ashley crazy-mad is not
in the same category as disabling her.

224
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:19,464
We learn more from failure
than from success.

225
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:20,789
So I've heard.

226
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,752
So basically
we're back at square one.

227
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,284
- That's awesome.
- Listen,

228
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:26,864
the Cabal have been planning this move
for decades.

229
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:29,965
I've had two days, a crappy lab,
and Tiny Tim for an assistant,

230
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,780
so please cut me some slack.

231
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:34,294
If you think working
with you is a party, think again, Vlad!

232
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,281
Good, you finally showed up.

233
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,006
Quit your whining and get to work.

234
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,192
You look happy.

235
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,944
You heard about Tokyo.

236
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:00,946
Sounded rough.

237
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:03,597
Look, you can help stop
this from happening again,

238
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,159
and spare me
the "I don't work for free" speech.

239
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:07,884
You know the Cabal,

240
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,040
their strategies, their methods.

241
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,458
This is a great opportunity for you
to buy yourself some credibility.

242
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,073
The head of the Sanctuary,
plus other key personnel

243
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,672
were targeted in the Tokyo attack.

244
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,924
And they sent a remote data burst
before they torched the place, too.

245
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,848
You're in for a world of hurt,
my friend.

246
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,395
- Their plan?
- The Cabal's been dying

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,700
to cut off the snake's head
of the network for decades.

248
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,740
- But they can't get to Magnus directly.
- But now, thanks to Ashley,

249
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,638
they can work both ends
against the middle.

250
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:41,611
They plan to target
the heads of every house.

251
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,552
And Magnus Junior
knows all the codes,

252
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,907
schematics, and protocols
to get her and her freaky friends

253
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,779
into every Sanctuary
in the world, right?

254
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,484
So they want to isolate us...

255
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,390
Cut us off from each other,

256
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:56,391
knock out the other Sanctuaries
before going after the crown jewel.

257
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,212
This Sanctuary
is the most heavily fortified.

258
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,298
Once they weaken the global network,

259
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,635
I'm betting they'll hit London
as a dry run before coming here.

260
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:11,340
You seem to know a lot about us
for somebody's who's just a hired gun.

261
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,640
You seem to know squat
about the Cabal.

262
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,437
Not good news for your team,
boy scout.

263
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,355
Magnus knows a lot more
than you think.

264
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,735
She should use it.

265
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,495
What about Ashley?

266
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,930
You must know something
about what they've done to her,

267
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,395
how they've changed her.

268
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,985
Like you said,
I'm just a freelancer.

269
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,145
Really?

270
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,970
You seemed important enough

271
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:40,337
for them to want to kill you
if you were compromised.

272
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,470
That doesn't mean I have an inside track
on all things Cabal.

273
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,009
It just means they like
to kill people they don't trust.

274
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:47,915
Honestly,

275
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,723
I'm just here because I'm pretty sure
they'll take this place last,

276
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,125
and I just want to enjoy the last
remaining peaceful hours of my life

277
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:59,231
before I begin my career
as a hunted fugitive.

278
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,255
You should do the same.

279
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,825
Thanks.

280
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,030
Declan...

281
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,968
We've just got word,
Moscow's been hit.

282
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:31,560
- How badly?
- 15 human casualties, 12 abnormal,

283
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,682
- lots of damage.
- Beijing, New Delhi, now Moscow.

284
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,560
None of our new security protocols
are making any difference.

285
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,438
- Did you get the shipment I sent?
- Both species are in a secured area.

286
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,732
I want them ready for deployment
as soon as possible.

287
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,944
If the pattern holds, we have at least
seven hours before the next attack.

288
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:48,822
Welcome to London, gentlemen.

289
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,860
Will, Nikola, this is Declan MacRae,
acting head of the UK facility.

290
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,203
Dr. Tesla, it's an honor.

291
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,832
Is it? Surely James Watson
told you about me before he died.

292
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:00,955
He did indeed,

293
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:02,586
in the most respectful terms.

294
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:06,339
Then the honor is mine.
You have big shoes to fill, Mr. MacRae.

295
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,758
We have a lab set up for you
to continue your work,

296
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,980
all according to the specifications
you sent us...

297
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,955
I'll need wine, the good stuff,
nothing cheap.

298
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,615
Of course.
This way.

299
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,902
- Oh, my God.
- God, I've missed you.

300
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,404
You seem well, Clara.

301
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,405
Mr. Druitt, nice to see you.

302
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,161
I see time in the Empire
has taught you some manners.

303
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,374
Can you guys excuse us for a bit?
I'm gonna...

304
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,544
rip Will's clothes off
before the bad guys attack.

305
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,389
Hold on a second.

306
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,890
What are you still doing here? I thought
you were gonna evacuate with everyone.

307
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:03,390
Will, I didn't join up so I could just
run away when the going got tough.

308
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:06,399
I wanna help defend the place,
and I think I owe Magnus that.

309
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,680
But you heard what happened to the other
Sanctuaries. It's gonna get really bad.

310
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:10,987
Invisible girl?

311
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,755
Really, we need
all the help we can get.

312
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:19,300
They have all these old movies here,
with the old British dudes acting in.

313
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,425
Now,

314
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,995
I don't have any bandages, but...

315
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,879
Okay, that's spooky.

316
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,265
I have control now, Dr. Zimmerman.

317
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,425
We don't have time for this.

318
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:42,460
They are going to be recalibrating
the EM shield for the next two hours,

319
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,685
and I haven't seen you in weeks.

320
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,108
Two hours.

321
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,695
We have a tap
on their security monitors,

322
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,698
we're detecting high-spectrum EM
frequencies covering the whole compound.

323
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,742
They have their shield up.
Very smart.

324
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,930
It essentially takes Druitt
out of play.

325
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:03,123
Make it clear they cannot teleport
until they disable the shield.

326
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,880
Do you have a preferred point
for initial breach?

327
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:07,755
How about the front door?

328
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:24,490
Perimeter cameras show four targets
outside the facility.

329
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,925
EM shield is active and holding.
Initiate countermeasures.

330
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:31,109
The front door.
They're getting bolder.

331
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,995
It's two-inch steel plate.
No way they...

332
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,665
Initial defenses breached.

333
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,445
They're beginning their sweep now.

334
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,208
Priority targets are

335
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,425
Magnus, Druitt, Tesla,

336
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,641
Clara Griffin, and MacRae.

337
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,810
And Zimmerman,
if he gets in the way.

338
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,563
Proceed to the databanks on foot
until we can disengage the EM shield.

339
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,575
Stand down, Ashley.

340
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:37,990
They aren't talking to each other,
but they're operating in sync.

341
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,860
Telepathic communication.

342
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:42,140
They'll head to the main databanks
in the central lab,

343
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:43,718
send their data burst from there.

344
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,320
Then they'll target me.

345
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:47,430
I'm not quite ready
to surrender yet, Declan.

346
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,885
We stick to the plan.

347
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,450
Nikola, how long?

348
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,854
Almost there.
Stop bugging me.

349
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,402
Tag, you're it.

350
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,818
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

351
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,107
That's not cool.

352
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:12,570
- How goes the home invasion?
- Not as well as we'd hoped.

353
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,090
We're moving to plan B, which means
I need the weapon right now.

354
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:17,812
Just finished powering it up,
but you should know it's my best work.

355
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:20,815
It'll have to do.
It's time you got into the fray.

356
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,126
Ashley's approaching
the computer core now.

357
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:38,955
Your mother would be
so disappointed.

358
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:46,235
Am I supposed to be impressed?

359
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,331
Are you okay?

360
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,575
You're kidding, right?

361
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:28,341
- Operation Exxon Valdez is a bust.
- <i>Can you draw them into the main lab?</i>

362
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,710
That shouldn't be a problem, seeing
as they're trying to kill me and all.

363
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,335
<i>Don't take it personally.</i>

364
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:37,855
Get going.

365
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:39,565
I'll give you a head start.

366
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,405
You stay out of sight, okay?

367
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,305
Meet me in the main lab.

368
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,181
Okay, I'm impressed!

369
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,375
Two of them on their way!

370
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,741
Okay, it's officially a party now!

371
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,205
She'll be right along,
despite my best efforts.

372
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,581
Come on!

373
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,715
Sorry, Ashley.

374
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,228
They're down.

375
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,396
Life signs?

376
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:09,655
They're still alive.

377
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,069
Good work, Nikola.

378
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,447
Believe me, I'm moderately shocked
right now.

379
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,616
Quickly, get them into secure cells.

380
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,834
Fall back!

381
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,435
Come on, come on!

382
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,640
So much for plans A to E.

383
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,271
We barely slowed them down.

384
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:53,070
Will! Damn it!

385
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,330
Fire suppression protocols
have been deactivated for the main lab.

386
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:57,698
They're locked in.

387
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,895
Release the elemental.

388
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,965
The EM shield should keep them
from teleporting.

389
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,095
They're under attack!

390
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:20,585
Dear God.

391
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,610
Damage levels are increasing.
We're losing epidermal viability.

392
00:27:26,735 --> 00:27:28,688
- How about the EM shield?
- Still up.

393
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,995
Our jamming device still
hasn't cracked the code.

394
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,401
Abort.

395
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,315
Get them out of there.

396
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,930
There were only three of them
in here.

397
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,915
The fourth one
must have broken them out.

398
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:55,995
We held the line.

399
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:59,135
- That was the objective.
- Though Churchill may have been wrong.

400
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,515
Victory at any cost?

401
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:22,450
- Will, I'm so sorry.
- She wasn't supposed to be here.

402
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:29,165
She wasn't supposed to have
any part of this.

403
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:34,685
What now?

404
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,255
We defend our home.

405
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:19,048
Goodbye, Miss Freelander.
You're free to go.

406
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,025
I heard about London.

407
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,140
I recommend you get yourself
to one of the safe houses.

408
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,445
Things are gonna get
very un-sanctuary-like around here.

409
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,005
Look, I can see
why you don't trust me,

410
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:35,398
but let's face it,
you could use me in this fight.

411
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,916
I know your type.

412
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,760
Greedy, self-interested.

413
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,945
I doubt you even know
the meaning of "loyalty".

414
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,322
We both know when things get rough,
you'll disappear.

415
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,366
If I was gonna disappear,
that was days ago.

416
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,090
Or you're biding your time
to see who wins this war,

417
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:50,465
and you'll offer your services
to the winner.

418
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,115
Either way,

419
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,825
I want you gone.

420
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:05,695
Hey, doc.

421
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,720
EM shield's at max power
on a rotating frequency.

422
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:13,720
The perimeter defenses
are set to long-range,

423
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,538
and I brought a change of underwear
for the night shift.

424
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:18,600
Have all the residents
been evacuated?

425
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:20,905
Everyone's been moved
to secure off-site locations.

426
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,460
Even the shoe's empty now,
which feels crazy.

427
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:24,585
I know.

428
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:27,480
Better news, it looks like
we've broken the pattern.

429
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:30,605
23 hours, still no sign
of the Super Ashley gang.

430
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:32,830
God, I'm sorry.

431
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,655
It's a coping mechanism.

432
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,525
It's fine.

433
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:41,315
You know, a lot of the residents
wanted to stay and fight.

434
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:43,695
I told you,

435
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:46,930
I won't see any more abnormals
hurt or killed by this war.

436
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,005
I know, I'm just saying,
this is their home too.

437
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,795
I understand
this has been rough on all of us,

438
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:57,655
and I haven't been available much,
to you or anyone.

439
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,425
Has he spoken to you?

440
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:07,455
He won't let us move him,
and he still won't take the treatment.

441
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:10,535
He's falling apart in there.

442
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,025
It's like he wants to die, so...

443
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,215
I'll talk to him.

444
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:20,753
Hey, doc...

445
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,756
You're doing what you have to.

446
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,585
We've got your back.

447
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:28,915
Thank you, Henry.

448
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,585
You've looked better.

449
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,925
The others may question
your choices,

450
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,665
your beliefs.

451
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,215
I don't.

452
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,665
We've known each other too long.

453
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:06,095
We've always understood
the need for space,

454
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,435
freedom to live as we want.

455
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,887
It's the very thing that defines us.

456
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:16,235
Once we let go of who we are,

457
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,285
what we believe to be true,

458
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:21,725
who the hell are we, for god's sake?

459
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,215
Chattel for the fates,
like everyone else.

460
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:31,907
I've always held

461
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:35,220
that despite how complex
this world is,

462
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:37,195
compromise is for the weak,

463
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,895
and the cost of that weakness
is too high a price,

464
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,627
no matter how dire
the circumstances.

465
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:50,365
Truth is,

466
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:55,445
I've been wrong all along.

467
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:08,805
I won't be visiting you again.

468
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:25,220
I know, I know, I know.

469
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:28,495
The spectrum settings were totally off.
I'll fix it.

470
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,922
Did I ever tell you why

471
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,590
my father founded the Sanctuary network
all those decades ago?

472
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,765
Because he was a crappy doctor?

473
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,125
Because there was a need,

474
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:42,770
a multitude of beings lost,
in need of help.

475
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:47,075
The Sanctuary was founded
more out of necessity than for science.

476
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:51,885
We protect the two dominant
species of life from one another.

477
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,560
Humans and abnormals.

478
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:57,032
It's a fragile balance
that cannot be compromised.

479
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,840
If we fail,
fear and chaos would reign,

480
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:01,665
and the Cabal would win.

481
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:04,828
You knew the weapon wouldn't work.

482
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:08,003
I asked you to make something
that would only disable Ashley,

483
00:34:09,065 --> 00:34:10,215
not kill her.

484
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:13,717
I realize now
that was an impossible task.

485
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,470
Quite impossible.

486
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,775
This is Ashley's,

487
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,695
before she was changed.

488
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:32,705
You realize if I do this,
the weapon will be completely effective?

489
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:35,685
I mean completely.

490
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,013
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends".

491
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:45,075
"Once more, or close up the wall
with our english dead".

492
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,020
Or we could all just run away.

493
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,295
If only we were that smart.

494
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:54,285
So that's it?

495
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,279
Nikola promises me
it's his finest work.

496
00:35:57,695 --> 00:35:58,945
I'm sure it is.

497
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,840
Maybe somebody else should use it.

498
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:06,365
It has to be me,
and we both know it.

499
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:12,395
She's not Ashley anymore.

500
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:18,169
- That's difficult to accept, but...
- You should leave while you can, Will.

501
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:20,161
You've done more than your share.

502
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:28,195
Yeah, I should.

503
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:34,275
But like you said,
I'm just not that smart.

504
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,277
This is Will.

505
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,531
Bloody hell.

506
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,941
What the hell?

507
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,037
Come on, no way.

508
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,748
We've been hit by a remote hack.

509
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,584
I've lost links to external networks.
It piggy-backed on a cell signal.

510
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,169
What about the EM shield?

511
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,380
Yeah, it's still up.

512
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,635
We lost it.

513
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,445
Which means we're hooped.

514
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,230
<i>Ashley and two friends
appeared in the lab,</i>

515
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:35,483
<i>and sensors indicate three more
on the residential level.</i>

516
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:50,796
Ashley, please, for the love of god.

517
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:06,236
- You think it'll go better this time?
- Wits and courage, dear boy.

518
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:08,026
- We'll be fine.
- I'm not british.

519
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:10,724
You know, all that "Tally ho" crap
doesn't work on me.

520
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,685
<i>Henry, what happened?</i>

521
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:36,880
Someone slid a virus
past our jamming countermeasures,

522
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,520
targeted all of our primary
defensive systems.

523
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:42,538
- <i>Can you get the shield back up?</i>
- That's exactly what I'm trying to do,

524
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:45,980
but I need to get to the mainframe array
to do an override.

525
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,301
It's kind of a slow bitch
without my remote tablet,

526
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,744
which I left in my room.

527
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
<i>Henry, it's Will.</i>

528
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,420
I'm headed your way.
I'll grab your stuff and meet you there.

529
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:55,600
Awesome.
Listen, watch yourself, okay?

530
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:56,725
All right.

531
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:06,915
Sorry I'm late.

532
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,145
Big guy?

533
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:11,306
Get in here before they kill you.

534
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,855
It's good to see you, man.

535
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,165
Run!

536
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,225
I hate you guys.

537
00:39:58,245 --> 00:39:59,245
Nice.

538
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,770
Damage is bad. I gotta defrag
half the commands in here.

539
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:22,169
Well, take your time.

540
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:47,715
Listen to me,

541
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:48,904
please.

542
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:52,605
I don't wanna do this.

543
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:55,744
You don't wanna do this.

544
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:09,633
Do you remember when you were small?

545
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,596
You used to come into my room
in the middle of the night,

546
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:17,390
and you'd crawl into my arms,

547
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,385
and you'd say,

548
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:21,695
"Mummy, I'm afraid".

549
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:33,195
I'm afraid.

550
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,078
Hey, blondie!

551
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:54,010
Henry, get that shield up!

552
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,555
Seriously, dude, anytime!

553
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:11,265
We're good!

554
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:21,246
The EM shield's active again.

555
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,249
- <i>Anyone teleporting will be vaporized.</i>
- We've got to move!

556
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,310
Ashley, please...

557
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:45,945
Mom?
