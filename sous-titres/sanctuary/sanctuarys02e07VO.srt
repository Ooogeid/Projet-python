1
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:05,784
- Where is he?
- Calm down.

2
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:08,541
Don't tell me to calm down.
I want to see him. Where is he?

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:10,771
Come on.

4
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:17,838
- How the hell did this happen?
- We're still piecing it together.

5
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:19,738
They found him last night
in an alley.

6
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:21,738
- And who found him?
- An anonymous tip.

7
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:24,023
- But it was too late.
- When did you get here?

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,449
This morning.
Henry called, I caught the next flight.

9
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,927
- Why wouldn't anyone tell me...
- You were on your way back.

10
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,031
You wouldn't have done any good.

11
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,244
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,357
Do we know who did this?

13
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,261
- I'm still looking into it.
- But you have some idea.

14
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,243
We should talk when you're settled.

15
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,005
Why?

16
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:22,344
What's going on?

17
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:24,865
Who did this?

18
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,934
It's too early to know for sure,

19
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:32,341
but so far all the evidence
I've gathered points to Helen Magnus.

The Team Projet-SG

21
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,223

Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 7

25
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,203
You're out of your mind.

26
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,877
- I didn't believe it either at first.
- At first?

27
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:24,706
We ran ballistics on the bullets
we pulled from the body.

28
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,230
- They came from Magnus' nine mil.
- So?

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,148
She had residue on her coat.

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,400
That proves that she fired the gun
at some point.

31
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,894
And he contacted me.

32
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,964
Who, the Big Guy?

33
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,116
Two nights before he died.
He was concerned about Magnus.

34
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,863
Concerned?
Concerned about what?

35
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,287
He said she'd started to slip.
Mentally.

36
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,418
I never saw any evidence of that.

37
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,878
She was hiding it.

38
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,604
I'm a psychiatrist.

39
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,840
All I can tell you
is what he told me.

40
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:58,028
Apparently,
it's a condition she's had for years.

41
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,471
He found out about it recently,
agreed to let it slide,

42
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,714
but it got to a point where he thought
he had to do something.

43
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,561
This is crazy.
This is Magnus we're talking about.

44
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,793
Why would he make
something like that up?

45
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,400
Will, just so you know...

46
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,987
I have no choice
but to invoke Article 9.

47
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,219
Wait a second.

48
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,702
Where is she?

49
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,038
Level three isolation.

50
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,207
What?

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,386
- She didn't do this!
- Then she has nothing to worry about!

52
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:43,477
Thank God.

53
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:50,584
- Are you okay?
- How could I be?

54
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:53,607
They're telling me that I killed
one of my dearest friends.

55
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,900
What do you mean?

56
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,405
I don't remember what happened.
Honestly, I have...

57
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:02,377
I've absolutely no memory
of the past week.

58
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:06,052
Were you injured?
Were you exposed to something?

59
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:09,290
No, physically I'm fine.
The tox screen was negative.

60
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,585
Someone did this to me.

61
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,713
Someone deliberately
erased my memories.

62
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:19,091
- How?
- I don't know! Aren't you listening?

63
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,045
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I just...

65
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,768
I'm just as confused as you are.

66
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,171
Someone's trying to set me up.

67
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,069
- To make it look like I killed...
- All right, listen to me.

68
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,804
We're gonna get to the bottom of this,
I promise.

69
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,215
He was one of my oldest friends.

70
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:56,116
You have to help me.

71
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,396
Please?

72
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,053
Of course.

73
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,859
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

74
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:51,252
Is he...

75
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,216
We moved him over an hour ago.

76
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,506
He always said he wanted
to be laid to rest here,

77
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:01,881
on the grounds.

78
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,768
It looks nice.

79
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,146
You did a good job.

80
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,421
Will's back.

81
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,585
- He wants to see us.
- You tell him to wait a bit.

82
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,297
He says it's important.
Something about Article 9.

83
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,826
What?

84
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,261
Declan doesn't actually
believe she did it.

85
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:32,636
Doesn't matter.

86
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,300
What's Article 9?

87
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,357
According to the Sanctuary charter,
when there's suspicion of wrongdoing,

88
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,974
they refer the matter to the other heads
of household for review.

89
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,499
It's Magnus' rule.

90
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:48,050
- What are we gonna do?
- We can start by finding out

91
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,796
who's really behind this.

92
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,928
What do you guys know?

93
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,209
Big Guy came to me. He said
he was gonna old city to meet someone.

94
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,045
I went to Magnus' office before bed,
but the door was closed.

95
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,213
Come on...

96
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,590
There's got to be somebody
who knows something,

97
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,150
some proof that she's innocent.

98
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,141
- I'm gonna check out the crime scene.
- I'll go with you.

99
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:18,687
I should try to go through her files,
something indicate who was after her.

100
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,314
Yeah, that's a good idea.

101
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,444
You're the only guy who can do this.

102
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:29,169
No one else can crack
her encryption codes.

103
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,216
Damn...

104
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,103
This is where they found his body.

105
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,373
I should have been here.

106
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,596
It would have helped?

107
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,308
I don't know.

108
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,471
Come on, let's look around.

109
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:01,219
Get those freaky eyeballs
of yours into action.

110
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,073
Have you noticed Magnus
acting strangely lately?

111
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:13,037
You're asking me?

112
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:15,813
I mean, she's a weirdo
pretty much all the time.

113
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,850
Declan said
that the big guy told him

114
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,709
that she was starting to slip.

115
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,336
Like Amy Winehouse slip?

116
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,729
I don't know
if screaming at paparazzi

117
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,304
is quite her speed.

118
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,593
It's more like little things.

119
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:36,102
What?

120
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,141
It's probably nothing.

121
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:42,733
Last week she sends me this email
asking me to pick up a new intake.

122
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,899
I go to the address,
but it wasn't there.

123
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,181
- The abnormal wasn't there?
- No, the whole building wasn't there.

124
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:51,530
The address didn't exist.

125
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,616
It must have been a mistake.
Did you ask her about it?

126
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:57,995
She denied ever having sent the email.
Then the next day, I get another email

127
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,911
with the exact same request.

128
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,912
It was weird...

129
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,506
And you're not
listening to me anymore.

130
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:13,677
What is that?

131
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,188
I knew your freaky eyeballs
would come up with something.

132
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,160
It's a surveillance camera.

133
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,054
The cops set up hundreds
all over the city.

134
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:35,875
This one was pointed
directly at our crime scene.

135
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:42,307
No scheduled maintenance.
There's no reason it should be gone.

136
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,258
So it could have
caught the whole thing.

137
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,995
The footage gets uploaded
to the main server.

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,373
- I can hack in and retrieve it.
- Nice.

139
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,174
- The best news I've had all day.
- I'll put the word out to my contacts.

140
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,393
Maybe somebody knows something.

141
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,233
I managed
to get into the doc's computer.

142
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,353
- Felt like crap doing it, but...
- What'd you get?

143
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,100
I did find these.

144
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:07,064
- Brain scans?
- Yeah, going back six years.

145
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,249
Doc's been scanning
herself regularly.

146
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,579
The most recent one
is two weeks ago.

147
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,073
What is it?

148
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,490
Find that video.

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
All right.

150
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,529
How did you get these?

151
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,358
How do you think?

152
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:32,419
Bloody hell.

153
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:37,135
- Don't tell me you're buying into this.
- What do you mean?

154
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,597
These scans show a pattern
of deterioration lasting years.

155
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,642
None of us
would have noticed anything?

156
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,018
The Big Guy noticed.

157
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,347
Coming clean about it
is probably what got him killed.

158
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,064
Just stop it. Stop it!

159
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,421
Magnus didn't do this!

160
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,011
She's been set up.
Somebody must have planted these.

161
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,136
Who?

162
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,316
Who had access to her computer?

163
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,670
Think about it.

164
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:04,705
Why'd she bring you on board?
She's never need any help before.

165
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,082
She was looking for someone
to replace her.

166
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,827
This is ridiculous.

167
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:11,642
If you can provide me
with an alternate theory that works,

168
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,047
I'm happy to listen.
I got to proceed based on the evidence.

169
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,010
And what does that mean?

170
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:18,455
The other Sanctuary heads
have charged me

171
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,137
with gathering evidence against her.

172
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,018
What is this, a witch hunt?

173
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:24,141
We want to get to the truth,
just like you.

174
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:26,767
After all she's done for you, huh?

175
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:30,644
That's not all.

176
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,359
They've voted to send in a Triad.

177
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:35,861
A Triad?

178
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,798
A team of investigators

179
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,699
uniquely qualified
for situations like this.

180
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,585
<i>And what makes them
so "uniquely qualified"?</i>

181
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,110
<i>They're telepaths.</i>

182
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,289
<i>They're going to get
inside her mind.</i>

183
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,166
I got to admit,

184
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,299
- I feel kind of...
- Invaded, compromised.

185
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,154
It's a common reaction.

186
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
People tend to feel nervous
around our skill set.

187
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,876
Skill set.
That's an interesting way of putting it.

188
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,351
- Listen, can I get you...
- No, we ate on the way here.

189
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:10,405
I'm... sorry.

190
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,053
When we begin an investigation,

191
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,032
it's really very hard
not to read everybody's thoughts.

192
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:18,731
You see, the first emotions we sense
are often the most important.

193
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,259
What am I thinking now?

194
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,371
That you don't even know my name.

195
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,807
Emma Correia.

196
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:31,844
Nice to meet you.

197
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:35,012
I just wish it could have been
under more pleasant circumstances.

198
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,599
I've been an admirer
of Dr. Magnus for years.

199
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,306
- Really? When did you meet?
- We never have.

200
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,425
Her work saved me.

201
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,849
I've never felt at home anywhere
except the Sanctuary network.

202
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:51,224
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,018
How's your investigation going?

204
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,224
Shouldn't you know already?

205
00:12:58,415 --> 00:12:59,565
Actually, no.

206
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,352
It's not an exact science.

207
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:04,417
The mind is tricky,
and to read it takes focus,

208
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,326
concentration, proximity,

209
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,605
and even then, a person's thoughts
aren't always out there in the open.

210
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,565
- That's why there's three of us.
- Doesn't it get noisy with all the...

211
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:18,262
Luckily, we can shield our thoughts
from each other.

212
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:21,216
It helps us to remain objective.

213
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,514
I wish I could get Magnus
to remember what happened.

214
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:29,834
We'll be questioning her
later on this afternoon.

215
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,849
- You're welcome to sit in.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

216
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,075
I'm... flattered, Will.

217
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,493
This is gonna be tough.

218
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,740
- Is this gonna upset me?
- Yeah, it's bad news.

219
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:57,669
That video you wanted me to look at?

220
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,050
It's been deleted
from the police database.

221
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:02,380
So someone on the police force
is gunning for Magnus?

222
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:04,509
That's what I thought, too,
so I did some digging.

223
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,260
It turns out the chief
deleted it himself.

224
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:08,385
The chief?

225
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,224
Why would he do that?
They are old friends.

226
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,392
Exactly.

227
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,895
So...
I hacked into his email account.

228
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,320
- Oh, boy.
- Don't worry,

229
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,715
it's completely untraceable,
but look what I found.

230
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,778
That is an email
requesting the file be deleted.

231
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:28,855
From Magnus.

232
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,135
What?

233
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay, Remy. You got your money.
Now, what have you heard?

234
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,415
Your boss has been very busy lately.

235
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:03,015
Meaning?

236
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,835
I tracked down this dealer,

237
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,905
and he said that she bought
a whack of red-list freaks last week.

238
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,369
Red-list?
Are you sure?

239
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,205
According to him, she was all over

240
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,500
the weird, creepy stuff.

241
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,169
- Stuff nobody else wants.
- What exactly did she buy?

242
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,855
Wouldn't tell me.

243
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:26,026
Didn't want to rat out a client,

244
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:27,800
but whatever it was,

245
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,290
she paid a lot for it.

246
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:30,804
Way over market.

247
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,960
That doesn't make any sense.

248
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,160
What would Magnus want
with a bunch of red-listers?

249
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,565
Nothing legal.

250
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,095
Shall we begin?

251
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,589
We're going to ask you
to open your mind

252
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,257
and allow us inside.

253
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,400
Do you know why we're here?

254
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,022
You're the triad, Emma.

255
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,107
You're here to interrogate me.

256
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,015
We don't want you
to think of it that way.

257
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,535
This is an important matter,

258
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,580
but you are still innocent
until proven otherwise.

259
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,991
Now,

260
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,411
three nights ago,
there was an incident

261
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,679
in old city.

262
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,325
Do you remember it?

263
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:49,475
One of your oldest friends
was killed.

264
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:52,820
I don't remember.

265
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,389
Do you remember going into the alley
and firing your weapon?

266
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,557
I can't...

267
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,144
I don't know what happened.

268
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,740
What is your relationship like
with your staff?

269
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,582
I didn't do this.

270
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,876
Please, just answer the questions.

271
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,339
Why are you treating me
like a common criminal?

272
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,424
This investigation is in accordance

273
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,280
- with your charter...
- Someone did this to me,

274
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:37,445
and you're all just sitting here
instead of trying to find them!

275
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,519
You're all in on this, aren't you?

276
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,276
You've done something to me.

277
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,697
Leave me alone, all of you!

278
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,448
Get out of my house!

279
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,117
Okay, this is over.

280
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,515
We can reconvene later.

281
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,115
Her mind is chaotic, damaged.

282
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,170
I've seen this type of thing before.

283
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:13,840
Symptoms of advanced dementia.

284
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:16,090
It makes it impossible
to read her thoughts,

285
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,972
- even with basic prompts to focus them.
- What does that mean?

286
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,268
Telepathy is our most reliable means
of investigation, but not the only one.

287
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:26,330
We'll need to look over
the existing physical evidence

288
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,815
until we can understand
why we can't read her mind.

289
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,902
I'm sorry. I know you were hoping
for better news.

290
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:40,795
You wanted to see me?

291
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:44,535
Firewall intercepted
an outgoing email.

292
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,545
No way.

293
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,335
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

294
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,350
- Sorry?
- You sent an email

295
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,690
to the heads of household requesting
to be put in charge of this Sanctuary.

296
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,315
- You read my email?
- You're trying to discredit Magnus

297
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,358
before the judgment
because you want her job.

298
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,340
- Watch yourself, you're out of line.
- I'm out of line?

299
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,957
You're making an end run around her,
and it's me who's out of line?

300
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,340
You realize what'll happen
if she's found guilty?

301
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,810
There's a list of candidates
a mile long to take her place.

302
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,455
Let me tell you, none of them
will be as pleasant to work for as me.

303
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,023
For starters, they'll fire
the whole staff, you included.

304
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:32,400
And a year from now,

305
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,580
if her memory clears up
and she's found not guilty,

306
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,460
I'm more than happy to step down,

307
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,290
let her take command again.

308
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,220
That's more than I can say
for anyone else.

309
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,138
You have no idea of the political
landscape you're dealing with.

310
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,391
I want a copy

311
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,280
of all the evidence
you've collected so far.

312
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:50,655
You think I'm fabricating this,
do you?

313
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,441
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

314
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:56,270
I got the video from the alley.
It's downloading now.

315
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,925
Good, we'll be right there.

316
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,866
Turns out the police
maintain a backup database.

317
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,640
It's only updated every three days,

318
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,020
so there's some lag time
between the main system and...

319
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:07,145
I get it.

320
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,865
So, what do you got?

321
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,380
Can you fast forward a bit?

322
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:18,655
Right there.

323
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,347
Looks like he's waiting for someone.

324
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,045
There.

325
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,814
Dammit, who is that?

326
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,080
Come on, turnnaround.

327
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:18,234
Come in.

328
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,170
Scofield.

329
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:24,395
Have a seat.

330
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,181
It's not necessary.

331
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:29,620
I wanted to inform you, my colleagues
and I have gone through the evidence,

332
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:31,365
discussed the issue at length.

333
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,166
Let me guess.

334
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,085
Dr. Magnus has a mental deficiency.

335
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:37,754
She needs treatment.

336
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:39,980
She's a hazard
to herself and others.

337
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:42,258
- She's being set up.
- How can you still believe that?

338
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,010
You've seen the video.

339
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:46,895
I don't care about the video.

340
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:50,308
I don't care what anyone says,
telepathic or otherwise.

341
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:55,580
I see you may not agree
with our methods, Dr. Zimmerman,

342
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:57,398
but I can assure you
they're effective,

343
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,867
and there's a good reason Dr. Magnus
assigned this task to our kind.

344
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,403
So what happens now?

345
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,035
In the interim,

346
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,367
Declan MacRae will be
assuming responsibilities

347
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,935
of this Sanctuary.

348
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,845
I know that you believe
he's somehow connected to Magnus' crime,

349
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,958
but I can assure you
that's not true.

350
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:18,045
I have questioned him fully
and read his mind.

351
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,355
A lot of good that did Magnus.

352
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,255
I'm sorry that
you're disappointed, doctor,

353
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,307
but really, it's for the best.

354
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:34,560
Dr. Magnus will be transported
first thing in the morning.

355
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:38,564
I suggest you take the opportunity
to say goodbye before then.

356
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,080
- You can't let them do.
- We're doing everything we can

357
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,370
to get you out of here.
Henry is pulling out the stops.

358
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,220
- Kate is...
- No, you don't understand.

359
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:49,784
They're all out to get me!

360
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,430
- Who?
- Declan,

361
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:54,414
and the other one,
what's his name, Scofield.

362
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,332
- They work together.
- How do you know?

363
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,850
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,040
Will, they're trying to kill me!

365
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,165
Look.

366
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:03,840
Look at this.
It's poisoned.

367
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,925
Smell it.
Smell it!

368
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:12,570
They're going to destroy everything.
Ashley told me.

369
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,880
Magnus, this has nothing to do
with Ashley.

370
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:16,230
They killed her too!

371
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,229
- They killed my daughter!
- Listen to me.

372
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:21,525
You're exhausted.
You need to rest.

373
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,825
Don't patronize me.

374
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:26,988
- You said you were going to help me.
- I am trying to help you.

375
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:31,385
What?

376
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:34,996
They got to you too.

377
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,410
- Look, I swear, I am fighting for you.
- You're lying!

378
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,435
Why is everyone lying to me?

379
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:25,695
Henry, I need an immediate
perimeter lockdown.

380
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,973
You're too late.

381
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,395
She's already gone.

382
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,650
Fisher, take Collins
and go after her.

383
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:38,005
- What were you doing here, anyway?
- We were just talking.

384
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,858
Where are you on Magnus' files?

385
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,693
Still scratching the surface, why?

386
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,128
There's something in there
that Declan wants.

387
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:53,260
Think about it. He knew exactly
what he had to do to discredit Magnus,

388
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:56,744
and now that she's out of the picture,
he has all time to go through the files.

389
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,512
- But the telepaths would have known?
- Not if one of them's in on it.

390
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:02,959
- You think?
- One of them could be

391
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,467
blocking the other two
from reading his mind.

392
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,089
Telepathic criminal, great.

393
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,215
I know.

394
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,635
Meet me at the pier in 20.

395
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,475
Hello?

396
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,492
I had to get you
out of the range of the telepaths

397
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,260
before I brought you here.

398
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,835
What is this place?

399
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,755
Storage facility.

400
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,711
Part of the university
before they shut it down.

401
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,385
My guy swears

402
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:49,485
he spotted her coming in.

403
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:57,215
Are you down here?

404
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,765
It's Will and Kate.

405
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,800
- Hold on a second!
- Leave me alone!

406
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,105
- Stay back!
- We don't want to hurt you.

407
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,775
We're here to help you.

408
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:11,986
Come on, Magnus.

409
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,515
Now, you already knocked me out
once today.

410
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:17,755
One per day, that's your limit.

411
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:37,325
What's happening to me?

412
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:40,775
Let me help you.

413
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,982
That can't be right.

414
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,663
What the...

415
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,845
Try this one on for size.

416
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:04,865
Come on.

417
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:19,285
Oh, man.

418
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:22,932
We're not leaving her here.

419
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,601
Well, you can't take her back there.

420
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:31,983
Henry, what's going on?

421
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,693
I kind of hit the motherlode here.

422
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,945
- Where are you?
- I'll be right there...

423
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,590
- What?
- Hello, McFly?

424
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,420
You can't go back there.
The amazing kreskins will read your mind

425
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,235
and find out where Magnus is.

426
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:44,335
What's going on?</i>

427
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:46,045
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,749
Henry, can you meet me
at Dead Bridge?

429
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:50,042
Why?

430
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,669
I can't tell you.

431
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,838
Okay, I have no idea
what that means.

432
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,006
Good.

433
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,965
Smooth.

434
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,165
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

435
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:28,618
So I was going through her backup drive
when I stumbled across a ghost directory

436
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:31,797
labeled "Big Bertha".
I tried to open it, and I found this.

437
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,240
What is this?

438
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:36,010
Some sort of encryption cipher.

439
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:38,740
Csis-level coding, so whatever's
in there's got to be important.

440
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,689
You think this is
what Declan's after?

441
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:42,475
I'd say it's a fair bet.

442
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:43,785
"Big Bertha"?

443
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:46,356
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

444
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:49,500
All right, stay on it.
Let me know what you find out.

445
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,975
Yeah, you got it.

446
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,025
How did it go?

447
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,040
Good.

448
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,302
Henry thinks
he's found something, so...

449
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:11,457
Put it down, Miss Freelander.

450
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,666
Right now!

451
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,043
You brought them here?

452
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,421
- No. No, it wasn't me.
- Actually, it was.

453
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,256
- What the hell is this?
- I could ask you the same question.

454
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:22,522
Dr. Magnus, you're hereby
remanded into custody.

455
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:24,845
- You'll come quietly, please.
- No!

456
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,585
- Get your hands off me! Let go of me!
- Hey, take it easy!

457
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,860
Let go of me!

458
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,854
She's becoming more dangerous.

459
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,981
It's time to take extreme measures.

460
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,885
Confine her in the Shoe.
Maximum security.

461
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:49,665
You made a very big mistake, mate.

462
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,555
We're not the enemy.

463
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:57,586
What do you know about Big Bertha?

464
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,217
Your silence won't help you,
Dr. Zimmerman.

465
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,100
- You can't control your thoughts.
- Stop it, Scofield.

466
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,875
You know as well as I do
he knows nothing.

467
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,809
I can assure you
there's no conspiracy here.

468
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,277
How do you know?

469
00:30:14,115 --> 00:30:16,480
You said yourself you can't read
each other's thoughts, so...

470
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,274
We can read his, Dr. Zimmerman.

471
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,625
And yours.

472
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,112
Harboring a fugitive is a serious crime
under the Sanctuary charter, doctor.

473
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,930
So you wanna lock me up, too?

474
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,055
Go ahead.

475
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:32,962
Wait.

476
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,366
I want to apologize
for the way Scofield treated you.

477
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:36,910
You didn't deserve that.

478
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,060
The emergence of information
on Big Bertha has everybody rattled.

479
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:42,006
What the hell is Big Bertha anyway?

480
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,745
I get it.

481
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:52,105
So you get to know
all my inner thoughts,

482
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:55,630
but when it comes to telling me
why I'm being treated like a criminal,

483
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:58,471
- then everything's off limits, huh?
- Look, all right.

484
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:04,760
But what I'm about to tell you
is heavily classified.

485
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:07,985
Only a handful of people
in the world know it.

486
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:09,875
Fine.

487
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,890
As you know, we house many species

488
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,515
of deadly abnormals
within the network.

489
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:21,079
Normally, this isn't a problem,
provided certain precautions are taken.

490
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,089
However, there are certain abnormals

491
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,890
that are so dangerous,
we can't risk keeping them around.

492
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,215
How dangerous?

493
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,210
Earthquakes, mass flooding,
fires, atmospheric toxins,

494
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:36,018
and believe me, the list of what
these abnormals are capable of goes on.

495
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:39,315
Big Bertha was one such abnormal.

496
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:42,856
She could alter
the magnetic resonance in her body

497
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,281
to manipulate tectonic plates.

498
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,404
The destruction she caused
was unimaginable.

499
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,617
Dr. Magnus tracked, captured,

500
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:53,659
and euthanized her
according to protocol,

501
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,246
or so everybody thought,

502
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,830
but now these files indicate that
Big Bertha may still actually be alive.

503
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:03,212
I'm sure you can understand
how unsafe that is.

504
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,710
Whoever controls her

505
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:08,425
has the power to ransom governments,
level entire cities.

506
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,130
Let me explain something to you.

507
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:12,581
I know Magnus.
I work with her every day.

508
00:32:12,706 --> 00:32:14,974
There's no way that she would unleash
something like this.

509
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,838
There was a time when I would have
believed you without question, Will,

510
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:21,397
but now I'm not so sure.

511
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:36,630
- I thought you said you had it.
- Yeah, I did, I just...

512
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,912
It's a lot different with you guys
standing over me like this.

513
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:46,275
There.

514
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,680
There's your Big Bertha file.

515
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:49,855
Oh, my god.

516
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,077
She's alive.

517
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,971
- Not only that, Magnus is moving her.
- Where?

518
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:58,100
She's in a container on the Arabian sea.
Look at the latest AIS data.

519
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,518
What is she thinking?

520
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,062
We need to mobilize
the nearest Sanctuary retrieval team.

521
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:05,316
If she falls into the wrong hands,
it'll be disastrous.

522
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,793
I'll make the arrangements.

523
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,698
Still think she's innocent?

524
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,056
I understand that you're leaving.

525
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:38,895
May I ask why?

526
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,255
Well, you know already.

527
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,740
You feel that remaining here will...

528
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:48,859
put constraints on your ability
to exonerate Dr. Magnus.

529
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,495
Will, I admire your loyalty,

530
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,620
but there comes a time when you have
to put your emotions aside

531
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:57,906
- and face the logic of the situation.
- You think it's logical

532
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,872
that she would shoot
her lifelong friend in cold blood,

533
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,542
that she would lie for years
about harboring a deadly abnormal,

534
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,139
and send it on a pleasure cruise
across the East African coast?

535
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:10,690
- You think that's logical?
- She's sick, Will.

536
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,174
She's not herself.

537
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,642
Right, I forgot.

538
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:16,303
The mysterious degenerative
brain disease.

539
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:18,790
Look, I know you're hurting.

540
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:20,935
I feel the same way.

541
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:25,004
Then why are you leaving?

542
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:29,918
Well, because our work is done.

543
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,112
The evidence speaks for itself,
and...

544
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:39,665
At least we found Big Bertha
before something terrible happened.

545
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,465
Well, goodbye, Will.

546
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,945
I'm sorry that we ended up
on the opposite sides of this.

547
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,467
I don't know if you can hear me.

548
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,005
Or if you even care anymore.

549
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,535
I just came to say goodbye.

550
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:52,228
And I'm sorry this happened,
and I'm sorry I let you down.

551
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:58,402
But I want you to know that I'm gonna
keep searching for the truth

552
00:35:58,527 --> 00:35:59,877
as long as I can.

553
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:01,985
I just...

554
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:05,037
I can't do it from here anymore.

555
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,062
I need some help down here!

556
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:22,471
We put her in a drug-induced coma
to stop the seizures.

557
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,052
I'm afraid her condition
is accelerating.

558
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,015
It doesn't look good.

559
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:31,313
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,500
Now, there's more bad news.

561
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,937
We just got word
from our retrieval team.

562
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,784
The ship we were tracking
was attacked by mercenaries.

563
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:47,595
By the time we boarded it,
the cargo had been stolen.

564
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:50,865
Big Bertha's gone.

565
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:19,225
None of this makes any sense.

566
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,151
<i>They've voted to send in a Triad.</i>

567
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:03,071
<i>When we're beginning an investigation,
it's very hard not to read thoughts.</i>

568
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,225
<i>Telepathic criminal, great.</i>

569
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,076
<i>If Big Bertha falls into
the wrong hands, it'll be disastrous.</i>

570
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,995
<i>So far, all the evidence
I've gathered</i>

571
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,914
<i>points to Helen Magnus.</i>

572
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:14,935
Oh, my god.

573
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:26,011
- Where's the Triad?
- They left hours ago, why?

574
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,038
All right, we've got to run a scan
on Magnus' brain right now.

575
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:30,474
Big Guy's not dead.

576
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:34,940
This can't be right.
Where's the deterioration?

577
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,621
It never existed.
Those other brain scans weren't real.

578
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,485
- Why did she flake out?
- I don't know,

579
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,614
but I'm guessing she did it on purpose
to conceal her thoughts from the Triad.

580
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,124
So you're Magnus,
and you want to create these symptoms.

581
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:49,530
- What do you do?
- I don't follow you.

582
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:52,990
Is there a type of abnormal
that would cause her to act this way?

583
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,040
- Ozone beetle.
- What, are you crazy?

584
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,833
Right there on the scan,
the dark spot.

585
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,280
What's an ozone beetle?

586
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:01,338
It's a bug that crawls into your brain
and nests in your hippocampus,

587
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,256
- but they're...
- Red-listed.

588
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,255
The dealer she met last week.

589
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,410
- What does it do?
- It secretes this fluid

590
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:11,161
that gives you this wicked high,
but if you leave it in there too long...

591
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:14,540
It causes memory loss, paranoia,
increased sensitivity to light.

592
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:16,500
Which is why she hid
in the basement.

593
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,231
- We've got to get it out of her.
- I'll go get a room ready.

594
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,595
Why would she do this?

595
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,950
Do you still have that email
that she sent you last week?

596
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,125
I think so.

597
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:31,565
There.

598
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:35,825
Right there.

599
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,266
She spelled "retrieve" wrong.

600
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,770
So?

601
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:42,541
No, Magnus is a spelling nazi.
She'd never do that.

602
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:46,648
Five minutes ago I would have thought
she'd never put a bug in her head.

603
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:52,775
- What the hell is that?
- Africa.

604
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,535
I think we just found Big Bertha.

605
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,630
We took the ship yesterday.

606
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:28,497
They gave up the cargo
with no resistance.

607
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:31,213
Good. We'll need to move it again
to our more secure location

608
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,340
before the Sanctuary
picks up the trail.

609
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,246
There is a truck standing by.

610
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:41,938
Some things are simply too powerful
to be left in the wrong hands.

611
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,187
It's a tracking device.

612
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,012
Freeze! Hold it!

613
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:08,505
Don't move!

614
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:14,925
Come on, let's go.

615
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:23,063
Can you read my mind now?

616
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:27,615
Big Bertha's dead.

617
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:32,614
I'm sorry we ended up
on opposite sides of this.

618
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,790
Okay, so let me get this straight.

619
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:50,465
You knew Emma was bad news
from Day One?

620
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,370
Day one might be pushing it,

621
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:55,140
but over the past few years,
I'd noticed a series of leaks

622
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:57,013
that couldn't be traced back
to the Cabal.

623
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:00,144
So you came up with this insane plan

624
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,030
to dangle Big Bertha
in front of her.

625
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:04,396
Drop an ozone beetle
to take yourself out of the picture.

626
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,482
Kill the Big Guy, which I'm still not
entirely sure about, by the way.

627
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,985
And not tell any of us,
so that we couldn't blow your cover.

628
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,361
Quite simple.

629
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:14,072
It's totally simple.

630
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,408
Okay, so spill.
What is the gag on the Big Guy?

631
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:19,374
The subcutaneous fascial layer
of his species

632
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:21,440
is four times thicker
than that of humans.

633
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:24,477
- The bullets didn't penetrate.
- But Henry examined him.

634
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:26,793
- I mean, he was dead.
- In a manner of speaking.

635
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,596
I tipped the bullets with the secretion
of a chilean shepherd frog.

636
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:32,465
It slowed his heart
enough to feign death.

637
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,790
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
you're crazy.

638
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,710
You're certifiably crazy.
I should have let them take you away.

639
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,235
Nonsense.
I knew you'd figure it out.

640
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:43,501
Besides, I'd left careful instructions
to call the whole thing off

641
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:45,687
in two days' time
if things went badly.

642
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,955
The Big Guy.

643
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,715
Speaking of which,
shouldn't he be back by now?

644
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:01,820
If you ever do that to me again,

645
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,310
I will shoot you myself.

646
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:04,485
You got it?

647
00:43:05,235 --> 00:43:06,235
Got it.

648
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:12,513
What are you standing there for?
Let's go eat lunch.
