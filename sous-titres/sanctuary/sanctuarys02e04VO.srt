1
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,857
Get down!
Down on the ground now!

2
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm not joking, mate!
Get down!

3
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,082
That's far enough, citizen.

4
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,619
- Who the hell are you?
- The Adjuster.

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,580
And you're about to be adjusted!

6
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,223
Let that be a lesson to you fiends.

7
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,059
The streets of old city
are no longer safe for your kind.

8
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:49,197
Where crime's around...

9
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,694
I'll be found!

10
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:57,950
Let's go.

11
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,459
What in the hell was that?

12
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,303
Mate,

13
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,013
I have no idea.

14
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,216
The Team Projet-SG

15
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,554
presents:

16
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,725
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 4
Hero (v. 1.00)

17
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:26,270
Timing by:
The Great Arrow

18
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,414
http://projet-sg.net

19
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,004
This is my favorite part.

20
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:56,183
You know, I'm so pleased
that my pain amuses you all.

21
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,552
God!
Look at the whiplash on that baby!

22
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,672
I'm checking for broken bones.

23
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,217
If you press any harder,
you'll find some.

24
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,048
How does he manage to fly like that,
without wings?

25
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,549
I've never seen an abnormal
with that ability before.

26
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,050
Yeah, you know,
I thought the same thing

27
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:15,861
when my head bounced off the ground.

28
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,677
- How's the shoulder?
- Nothing I can't handle.

29
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,047
Not exactly the welcome I had in mind
when you volunteered to come aboard.

30
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm just sorry
the guy we were chasing got away.

31
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,867
He's an empath trying
to break free from the mob.

32
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,957
If he's smart, he'll come to us.

33
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,241
As for your flying man,
I'm having Henry look into it.

34
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,366
Keep me posted.

35
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,589
I'm dying for a rematch.
All good, mate.

36
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,926
If anyone needs me,
I'll be coughing up blood.

37
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,709
Actually, I need you.

38
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,095
Get dressed.

39
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,969
Happened around 8:00.

40
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,989
Guys were digging out a corner
when the wall gave way.

41
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,298
They found this.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,499
I called the city inspector
right away.

43
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,924
He took one look at it, called you.

44
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,157
So...

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,716
You guys archaeologists
or something?

46
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,712
Would you mind rounding up
the rest of the crew

47
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,251
that were here at the time?

48
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,276
I'd like to speak with them.

49
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,065
Okay, sure.

50
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,252
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:24,411
Have you seen something
like this before?

52
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:28,434
But whatever it is,
it hatched recently.

53
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,792
These look like claw marks.

54
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,445
You think something dug this hole,
laid the egg,

55
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,170
and then just left it?

56
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,893
It would have to have occurred
years ago,

57
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:42,818
before the city was built.

58
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,492
It's difficult to imagine
something surviving that long.

59
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,911
Not impossible.

60
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:50,535
The real question is
why did it hatch now?

61
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:55,065
This room was probably a vacuum
before the workers broke through.

62
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:58,589
Maybe the introduction of air
kick-started the process?

63
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,825
The men are all outside,

64
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,950
except Joe.

65
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,553
Joe?

66
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:08,013
The backhoe operator,
first guy on the scene. He left.

67
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,671
Said he wasn't feeling well
or something.

68
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,841
Joseph Koster,

69
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,687
38, divorced.

70
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,698
No sign of any abnormal behavior.

71
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,643
You've tried
to get in contact with him?

72
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,269
He's not answering his phone.

73
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,160
He's not at his place, either.

74
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:34,041
- Try putting out word to our contacts.
- I did. Squid just gave us a tip.

75
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,559
There's some guy matching
this description acting very weird

76
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,671
on the top floor
of Saint Canare place.

77
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,256
That's a condemned building.

78
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,384
I know it's a long shot, but Declan
and I figure we ought to check it out.

79
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,085
Absolutely, but be careful.

80
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,335
We don't know what effect this creature
could have had on Mr. Koster.

81
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,410
Any idea what it is, or was?

82
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,054
The shell membrane
would seem to indicate

83
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:55,148
something reptilian, but...

84
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,108
The amniotic fluid
is definitely consistent

85
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,738
with that of an insect.

86
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,217
I'll...

87
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,892
just read the report.

88
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:08,652
River Banshee.

89
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:09,843
Fire shrimp.

90
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,218
Word of advice?

91
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:12,487
Wear gloves.

92
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,218
Shouldn't you be writing
this down or something?

93
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,343
What for?

94
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,627
In case you need
to fill in for me one day.

95
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,043
Yeah, right...

96
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:24,155
- What's in here?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

97
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Why not?

98
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:28,746
Told you.

99
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,688
That sound generally means
you should answer it.

100
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,445
It's me.

101
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,198
- I need to see you.
- I'll call you back.

102
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,025
Everything okay?

103
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,015
Yeah. I gotta go.

104
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,694
What's a guy like Joe
doing in a place like this?

105
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,950
No idea.

106
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,898
- He was definitely here, though.
- Zimmerman...

107
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:23,692
You hungry?

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,271
Not anymore.

109
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,074
You got to be kidding me.

110
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,392
The bloke's chowing down on cats?

111
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,176
Have you found anything?

112
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,801
It looks like your mystery
superhero has been busy.

113
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,113
- Doing what exactly?
- Everything, it seems...

114
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:50,761
Foiling robberies, beating up bad guys,
but the best is this. Look.

115
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,613
What am I looking at?

116
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,489
It's video of a jumper,
taken yesterday.

117
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:55,922
Here, check it out.

118
00:07:58,933 --> 00:07:59,853
Unbelievable.

119
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,116
Except the guy ended up
with four crushed vertebrae

120
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,141
from the force of the catch.

121
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,716
Any information on how we can find
this flying man?

122
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:11,910
So far he's done a really good job
of keeping his secret identity secret.

123
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,810
We need to track him down.
For one thing,

124
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,630
he's getting in the way of our work,
and for another,

125
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:19,620
he keeps this up, and a lot of people
are going to get seriously hurt.

126
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't know if it helps,
but eyewitness reports say

127
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,878
he arrives on the scene right away,
sometimes before the police.

128
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,210
You think he's got some kind of ESP?

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,875
Where...

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,550
Where crime is found,

131
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,065
I'll be around.

132
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:44,286
Where crime is seen,

133
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,359
I'll be on the scene.

134
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,656
Where crime is plotted,

135
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:52,691
I'll be...

136
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,648
spotted?

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Damn!

138
00:08:56,873 --> 00:09:00,330
<i>All available units,
we have a 10-36 in progress.</i>

139
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,079
<i>Three suspects. Shots fired.</i>

140
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,768
<i>All units, 820 Orchid...</i>

141
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:12,843
Right.

142
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,871
- Who are you?
- My name is Helen Magnus,

143
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,640
and we need to talk.

144
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,641
You tricked me.

145
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,510
- This is a trap.
- Yes, but if you'll just listen...

146
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,741
I knew sooner or later
my activities would attract

147
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,248
the wrong kind of people,

148
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:04,144
but you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that to bring me down!

149
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:17,324
Nice shot.

150
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,870
He's kind of hard to miss.

151
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,871
<i>You'll never get away with this.</i>

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,558
<i>You think these puny restraints
can hold me?</i>

153
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:33,834
How's he doing?

154
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,062
He's still convinced
we're super-villains

155
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,734
who have kidnapped him
to conduct experiments.

156
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,252
What'd you find out?

157
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,438
Well, his suit looks homemade,

158
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,877
but it seems to be some sort
of high-grade Kevlar-type material.

159
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:50,002
I had to draw blood
from between his fingers.

160
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,816
- And?
- See for yourself.

161
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,982
- He's not abnormal?
- Not according to his DNA.

162
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,818
But how's that possible?

163
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,744
- The guy was flying.
- I can't explain it,

164
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,789
but it does mean that we're gonna have
to do a far more detailed exam.

165
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:11,003
That doesn't bode well for our whole
"we're not super-villains" case.

166
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:15,136
Try to avoid the topic
of total global domination.

167
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:16,697
Thanks.

168
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,323
You have got a lot of nerve
calling me out of the blue like that.

169
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,425
I haven't heard from you for months!
Mom didn't even know where you were.

170
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,570
It's good to see you, too.

171
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,075
When'd you get here?

172
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,451
- Couple days ago.
- A couple days?

173
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:40,282
Easy! All right, okay.
I meant to call.

174
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,952
- I just... I got tied up.
- With what?

175
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:46,038
I need a favor.

176
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:50,893
Tad, I thought
you were going to give that up!

177
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,086
I did! I've been straight
for six months.

178
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,705
- Right...
- I swear!

179
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,230
So, what happened?

180
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,005
I slipped.

181
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,135
These guys pulled me into a game.

182
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:01,456
How much?

183
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,368
It's not the "how much",
it's the "who to".

184
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,796
A guy named Constantin?

185
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,498
You know him.

186
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,884
Kate, you got to believe me.
I never meant for any of this to happen.

187
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,488
I met this girl.

188
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,685
- We were going to California...
- Save it.

189
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,204
I just need to get clear of this.

190
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:31,213
Please.

191
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:35,702
Now's my chance.

192
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:39,464
So...

193
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,979
Come to face me at last, huh?

194
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,466
Who are you people, anyway?

195
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,390
HYDRA?
League of Assassins?

196
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,392
Circus of Crime?

197
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,829
I just want to talk to you, Walter.

198
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,219
How did you know my name?

199
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:58,151
Your DNA matched some hospital records
we had in our database.

200
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:02,535
- You worked as a claims adjuster?
- Yeah, well, that was before.

201
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,910
Now I'm just...

202
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:05,871
"The Adjuster".

203
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,578
Right...

204
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,035
Right.

205
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,785
Yesterday afternoon you had a run-in
with some guys on some motorbikes.

206
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,486
- Who told you that?
- I was one of those guys.

207
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,381
We were trying to catch
the guy that you... saved.

208
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,750
That's pretty much why I saved him.

209
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:26,809
Right, but what you don't realize is
that we were trying to help him.

210
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,571
We're not the bad guys here,

211
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:30,642
but there are some bad people
who are after him.

212
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:31,726
Why?

213
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,108
- He's an empath.
- Like Psylocke.

214
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,778
From X-Men?

215
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,318
She was killed by Vargas, and then later
resurrected without her tattoo.

216
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,035
Just like Psylocke.

217
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,018
Seriously...

218
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,623
Who are you guys?

219
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,759
We'll get to that,

220
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,588
but first, why don't you tell me
how you got these powers?

221
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:00,913
Never.

222
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,639
What are you working on?

223
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,047
DNA tests on the eggshell

224
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,435
didn't yield anything substantive,

225
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:13,199
but when Will told me
about the cat remains that he found,

226
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:16,588
it reminded me of an encounter
my father had with another abnormal.

227
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:19,501
Coleanthropus.

228
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:23,177
It was discovered
by US federal troops in 1892

229
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:26,227
when they were trying to quell
a miners' uprising in Idaho.

230
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,325
What makes you think
it is the same abnormal?

231
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,667
According to reports,

232
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,331
the soldiers found an egg
inside the mine.

233
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,332
It hatched,

234
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,305
and the creature went
inside the body of one of the soldiers.

235
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,493
The victim ran away,
but shortly thereafter,

236
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:43,173
the others found the carcasses
of several small animals.

237
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,261
It says here the creature
attacked again the following evening,

238
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,979
but its appearance had changed.

239
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,013
It was no longer
inside the body of the soldier.

240
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:52,251
My father suspected
that it had evolved

241
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:54,435
to a further stage
of its life cycle.

242
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,835
By the time he got there,
the creature was long gone,

243
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,480
and most of the survivors had fled.

244
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:00,941
Not much to go on.

245
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,931
However, all the eyewitnesses

246
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:06,355
spoke of the creature's
high-pitched shriek,

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,532
said it was unlike anything
they'd ever heard before.

248
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,784
Perhaps we can use that
to our advantage.

249
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,353
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Absolutely.

250
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:20,628
We've tapped into the city's terrorism
suppression grid.

251
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,566
Your monster makes any noise
over 90 decibels, we'll know about it.

252
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,940
- Excellent work, Henry.
- Thank you.

253
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:28,569
Now, I've calibrated it
to detect high-frequency sounds,

254
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,085
so don't go getting too close
to any ambulances...

255
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,854
Or Christina Aguilera.

256
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,080
No worries about that, mate.

257
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,134
- How's it going with super-dude?
- Pretty good.

258
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,562
I've managed to convince him
we're not evil, that's something.

259
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:50,846
- Big Guy's checking him out now.
- Did he say how he was able to fly?

260
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,990
Three weeks ago,
he was hanging on a friend's yacht

261
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,804
off the coast of Africa
when they got attacked by pirates

262
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,979
called the "Singh Brotherhood."

263
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,348
Somehow in the middle of it all,
he got pushed over the side,

264
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:05,338
and he swam to shore,
and he found a cave,

265
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:07,242
and in the cave
there was this temple,

266
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,426
and in the temple
there was this ruby called...

267
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,294
Crimson Gem of Cyttorak.

268
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,057
How'd you know that?

269
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,482
This guy's good.

270
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:18,351
What are you talking about?

271
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,770
For real?
You never read comic books as a kid?

272
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,434
I mean, yeah, I mean...

273
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,997
I was more of a Sherlock Holmes guy.
Why?

274
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,747
The Crimson Gem of Cyttorak?

275
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,438
That's the stone Cain Marko found
in <i>X-Men #12</i>.

276
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:31,937
It turned him into Juggernaut.

277
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,292
The Singh Brotherhood
is from <i>The Phantom</i>, and the yacht,

278
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,938
if you don't know the Green Arrow,
then there's no hope for you, pal.

279
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,372
Dude, you got played.

280
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,376
Crap...

281
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:52,378
What happened?

282
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:54,192
Super-guy was in the scanner.

283
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,880
I turned my back for a second...

284
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,441
Which way did he go?

285
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,443
Away.

286
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,568
Come on.

287
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,751
You go to the residences,
I'll check the foyer.

288
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:06,486
Like...

289
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,584
He couldn't use a door?

290
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,071
You call that tea?

291
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,009
<i>Declan, it's Will. Anything?</i>

292
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:18,872
No, nothing yet,

293
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,972
although there was a faint...

294
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:22,697
Stand by.

295
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,459
We got something.

296
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:34,014
Is that Joe?

297
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:36,971
Bloody hell.

298
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,454
All right, fella, out you come.

299
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,980
Take it down!

300
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:03,915
Get him!

301
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,462
Where's the bloody flying man
when you need him?

302
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,586
It was more bigger than a man now.

303
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,837
Yeah, the file was right.
The creature evolved.

304
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,688
Yeah, if you can call it that.

305
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,151
Good news is
Henry's sonic scan worked.

306
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,525
- We should be able to track it.
- You know...

307
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,643
What?

308
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,902
Magnus said that the amniotic residue
inside the egg

309
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,760
was similar to that of an insect.

310
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,717
Well, we've already seen three stages,
the egg, Joe,

311
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,942
and that creature that attacked you.

312
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,534
- There might be a fourth stage.
- It makes sense, doesn't it?

313
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,092
I mean, maybe it's looking
for a place to cocoon.

314
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,284
Also means it might go quiet on us.

315
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,422
- We'll have to work fast.
- Let's split up and sweep the area.

316
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,136
Signal if you find anything.

317
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,752
Team two with Will!

318
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,238
Were you able to transfer the data
from Walter's medical scan?

319
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:56,692
Yeah, but it's no use.
Walter corrupted it.

320
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,364
<i>Savage Seven</i>, issue 319.

321
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:01,238
What?

322
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:03,628
Dustin Blake is captured
by a group called The Sentinels.

323
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,379
They perform experiments on him.
He wipes their computer clean

324
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:08,654
while he escapes so they can't...

325
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,094
track him.

326
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:17,655
I've been trying to recompile the image
using raw data.

327
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,909
We're not gonna find anything.
Walter wasn't in there for very long.

328
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,708
- Well, let's see.
- It's right there.

329
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:26,696
You see? That's what I was afraid of.
There's a shadow.

330
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,695
- Do you mind?
- Be my guest.

331
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,572
- I'm just gonna magnify the image.
- You can magnify away, doc,

332
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,631
but I don't think
you're gonna find...

333
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:36,798
What the hell is that?

334
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,802
That is Walter's suit.

335
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,222
Walter's suit is made of bugs?

336
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:45,266
Billions of them.
It makes perfect sense.

337
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:47,899
Walter isn't an abnormal,
he's wearing one,

338
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:50,271
and I'll wager it's what's giving him
his special abilities.

339
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,950
The bugs?

340
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:56,145
Think of them more as a collective
rather than individual beings, and yes,

341
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:59,829
I believe
they're what's allowing him to fly.

342
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:01,449
- How?
- I'm not sure.

343
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,684
He must be controlling them somehow.

344
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:07,426
I need to take another look
at his blood-work.

345
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,179
Hey, boys,

346
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,191
I've got something for Constantin.

347
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,053
Who wants a sentient fungus?

348
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,524
This is not what we agreed.
I have to tell you

349
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,299
I don't like surprises.

350
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,125
Katie Freelander.

351
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:33,620
As I live and breathe.

352
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,968
- You know why I'm here.
- Of course. Your brother's debt.

353
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,570
What terrible luck he has.

354
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,657
- What's this?
- Payment,

355
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,563
in full with interest.

356
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,170
A Steno tusk.

357
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:57,842
I thought they were extinct.

358
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,426
You just got to know
where to look, I guess.

359
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,780
That more than covers his debt,

360
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:05,276
so don't try to pretend
that it doesn't.

361
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,283
You know, this selfless act of yours
is touching,

362
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,138
but I don't want your money.

363
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:16,217
Rumor has it that you have found
a comfy place to sleep

364
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:17,946
at the Sanctuary!

365
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,410
Now, where'd you hear that?

366
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:23,535
Around.

367
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:26,294
I don't judge.

368
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,011
In fact, it makes you
uniquely valuable to me.

369
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,412
What are you talking about?

370
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,851
I don't mind telling you
that the Cabal's demise

371
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:38,790
has opened up
quite a few opportunities for me.

372
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:41,424
There is a huge demand
for abnormals out there,

373
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,010
a demand I find myself

374
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,667
unable to fill.

375
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
However,

376
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,475
with an ally inside the Sanctuary...

377
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,353
- Wait a second, an ally?
- Why not?

378
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,472
You're just staying there.
You're not with them.

379
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,526
You used my brother to get to me.

380
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:03,920
We used to be such
an incredible team together,

381
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:05,045
you and I.

382
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,201
Don't you remember?

383
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,535
I am not 21 anymore.

384
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,265
And I'm not a two-bit banger
fencing counterfeit junk anymore.

385
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,916
This is real.
I urge you to take it seriously.

386
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,270
Those days are gone, Constantin.

387
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,474
You know, it's a really,
really nice offer,

388
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,249
but I'm not interested.

389
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,797
Don't contact me again.

390
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,021
No, we've searched the entire area.
Not a trace.

391
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,146
Dammit.

392
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,645
That thing could be anywhere now.

393
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,821
Are you sure this is
the right sample?

394
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:52,296
Absolutely. Why?
What's the problem?

395
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,630
His CPK-3 and creatinine levels

396
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,078
are through the roof.

397
00:22:56,215 --> 00:23:00,154
- So, what does that mean?
- We need to talk to Walter right away.

398
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,663
<i>All available units,
we have a 4-11 in progress.</i>

399
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:09,137
<i>There're in 13-10 Marines,
suspect is bleeding.</i>

400
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,065
<i>All available units, please advise.</i>

401
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,646
Right.

402
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,033
What the...

403
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,537
How did I end up back here?

404
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:32,533
You'd be amazed
at how much buzz it creates

405
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,658
when a guy in a super-suit
falls off his balcony.

406
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:39,163
Before you go knocking
another hole in my wall, know this...

407
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,975
You are free to leave
whenever you like.

408
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,300
But you might want to hear
what we have to say first.

409
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,596
Your suit's not really a suit,

410
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,990
but you knew that already.

411
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:53,165
What you may not know
is that it's actually a parasite,

412
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,492
and it appears to be feeding on you.

413
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,995
Your latest test results show
the signs of early organ failure.

414
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,070
- Your body's shutting down.
- No. You're lying.

415
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,543
This is just another one of your...

416
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,218
super-villain tricks.

417
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:08,836
Really?

418
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,770
How are you feeling?

419
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,693
You have any dizziness
or shortness of breath?

420
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:18,547
We need to get this suit off you
immediately.

421
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:19,672
But...

422
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,420
- I can't.
- Walter, this isn't...

423
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,783
You don't understand.

424
00:24:26,986 --> 00:24:28,486
I can't take it off.

425
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,362
I'm telling you,
I've tried a dozen times.

426
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:34,632
Nothing works.

427
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:36,432
It's stuck.

428
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:44,565
Which means I'm a dead man.

429
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:47,380
What do you mean "stuck"?

430
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,817
Stuck. Glued.
Impossible to remove.

431
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,936
Hold on. So you've been wearing
this suit since...

432
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:55,069
Since about eight days ago, yes.

433
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:57,545
How have you managed to, you know...

434
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,870
I have no idea.

435
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,921
All I know is
I feel lighter after meals.

436
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:06,921
How did you come by the suit

437
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,511
in the first place?

438
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,736
We need the real story, Walter.

439
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:12,950
Right...

440
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,638
As I mentioned before,
I used to work for an insurance company.

441
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:19,142
By the way,
if you guys need any kind of coverage...

442
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,264
We're good.

443
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:21,389
Right...

444
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:23,138
Every year,

445
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:25,951
the company took us
on a team-building retreat

446
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,346
to this dude ranch in the mountains.

447
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:30,862
I was leading through the forest

448
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,988
on a pretty cutthroat game
of "capture the flag"...

449
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:40,143
Guys?

450
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Guys...

451
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:46,752
I must've slipped

452
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,582
down into a sinkhole or something,
because the next thing I knew,

453
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:52,339
I woke up in a cave,
covered in slime.

454
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:57,967
What?

455
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,972
The shorts and gloves
I added myself.

456
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,777
The chest plate I had from before.
Don't judge.

457
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:16,282
When did you get your...
superpowers?

458
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:17,927
That's the beauty.

459
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,852
I already had them.

460
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:23,164
All I had to do was think "fly",
and I popped out of the hole like that.

461
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:25,123
Telepathic communication, of course.

462
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:29,214
The suit's living off you in exchange
for giving you these powers.

463
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,831
I soon realized

464
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:32,967
that I had speed,

465
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,442
super-strength...

466
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:37,529
X-ray vision.

467
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,348
It was like my greatest wish

468
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,516
come true!

469
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:45,908
Be careful what you wish for.

470
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,833
We'll help you get it off.

471
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,426
We're all ready in here.

472
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,151
All right, here we go.

473
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,807
- Did you manage to...
- It's taken care of.

474
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:55,756
Thank god.

475
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,596
This is the last time,
do you hear me?

476
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,765
Totally.
This was a one-time slip, I promise.

477
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,728
Get out of town.
Take a cab to the bus station.

478
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,028
- I don't need money...
- Just take it.

479
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:16,129
Good luck in Cali.

480
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,862
Thank you, for...

481
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,441
For everything.

482
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:28,748
Don't tell mom, okay?

483
00:28:35,194 --> 00:28:36,644
How's Walter doing?

484
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:38,571
He's stable.

485
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,431
How are things going with you?

486
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,170
Take a look.

487
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,438
- They're dead.
- I believe so.

488
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,110
I was able to create a toxin

489
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,798
that attacks
the suit creatures' specific DNA.

490
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,325
That's... good.

491
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,450
Is it?

492
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,765
I have no idea what kind of impact
this will have on Walter.

493
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,577
At minimum, he'll be sick for weeks
as he undergoes treatment,

494
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:09,202
and there's no guarantee
he'll ever fully recover.

495
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,079
Not to mention
we are killing an abnormal

496
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:12,708
who exhibits untold abilities,

497
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,578
the likes of which
I've never seen before.

498
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:19,303
- We knew that going in.
- Yes, but our job is to be smarter,

499
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,550
to come up with a brilliant, clever way
to save both human and abnormal.

500
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:26,722
Right, but we don't have time for that.
I mean, this thing is killing Walter.

501
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,069
At least we're saving him.

502
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,436
I wanted it off, not kill it!

503
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,773
Come on.

504
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:39,022
It's my suit.
You can't do this to me.

505
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:40,647
You're gonna die, Walter!

506
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,272
Do you realize that?

507
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,610
I don't care.

508
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,611
Do you realize
what this suit has done for me?

509
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,239
My whole life,
I've been scared to do anything,

510
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:55,562
not even hobbies.

511
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,421
Do you realize how many people die
in renaissance fair re-enactments?

512
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,416
The statistics would blow you away,

513
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
but now,

514
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,106
thanks to this suit,

515
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,381
I don't even worry about it.

516
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,184
I fly around saving people!

517
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,920
- It's pretty incredible.
- I realize how exciting it must be,

518
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,150
but is it really worth
risking your life for?

519
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,694
You risk your life every day
doing what you do.

520
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,115
Look, I may not have
a lot of time...

521
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:31,011
So I want to use it
for what I was meant to do,

522
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:35,082
not... sit around
on the sidelines anymore.

523
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:37,674
<i>Magnus, it's Henry.
I heard from Declan.</i>

524
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,489
<i>He tracked the Coleanthropus
to Kennington Row.</i>

525
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:43,138
All right.
Think about it, please.

526
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:56,645
Tell me you're at the bus station.

527
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,564
You should have accepted my offer.

528
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,691
You son of a bitch.
Where's my brother?

529
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,943
He's fine...
For now.

530
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,956
This is between you and me,
Constantin, okay?

531
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,114
Let him go.

532
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,622
No, it was, until you forced me
to bring him back into it.

533
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:12,740
Seems to be the only way
to get your attention.

534
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,909
Now, I'm a fair man, Katie.

535
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,501
You don't want to work with me, fine,
but I need something from you.

536
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:21,000
<i>Now, inside that Sanctuary</i>

537
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,275
<i>is a very rare species of lizard.</i>

538
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,936
I believe he's called "Steve."

539
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:29,512
Now, my client is prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

540
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:33,349
<i>Now, you get me that lizard,
I'll release your brother, debt-free.</i>

541
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,938
I think you'll find that
I'm being more than generous.

542
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:46,403
Fine,

543
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,198
<i>this is gonna burn me with them,
so I'm gonna need a piece of the action.</i>

544
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,006
Plus, I don't transport.
You supply the truck.

545
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:54,581
Bring Tad
and the Steno tusk with you.

546
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,331
I'll call you when it's safe.

547
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,301
- Where is it?
- Far end.

548
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:06,446
I've got a man on each exit,
two more keeping watch.

549
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:08,740
Henry was able to modify these
for subsonic action.

550
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,605
They'll disorient
the creature long enough

551
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,258
and we can get the upper hand.

552
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:33,576
Declan, where are your men?

553
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,051
I left them here.

554
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:42,847
Blood.

555
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,150
Guys?

556
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,415
Bring it down!

557
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,087
Watch your ears, everyone!
Spread out!

558
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,637
To be honest with you,
I'm still just kind of playing with it.

559
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:32,511
Okay, you want to try it on me?

560
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,636
Sure...

561
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:37,681
Where evil lurks,

562
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,389
that's where I work.

563
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,112
What, it's no good?

564
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:47,358
No, it's not bad, it's not bad.
Just... a little sing-songy.

565
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:50,512
- Right.
- Try something along the lines of...

566
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:51,766
"Time to... "

567
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:52,891
You know?

568
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:56,950
"Time to take out the trash."

569
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,072
- Right, right.
- You know? Or like...

570
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,756
- "Time to put the kids to bed."
- <i>Henry, come in!</i>

571
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,711
One sec.
Yeah, go ahead.

572
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:14,023
The stunners aren't working!
We need large containment!

573
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,146
Okay, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

574
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,960
Listen, Walter, man,
we're gonna have to put you...

575
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:20,645
Crap...

576
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,587
Did we kill it?

577
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,674
I'm thinking we just pissed it off.

578
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,583
I got it!

579
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,575
It's coming at you!

580
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,032
Easy, boy...

581
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,013
Easy, now...

582
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,078
Take it easy.

583
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,139
What, this thing?

584
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:27,383
It doesn't work anyway.

585
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,793
Come on, you fiend!

586
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,723
Everyone's out,
but we don't have much time.

587
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:49,151
This is more impressive
than I imagined.

588
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:51,107
This isn't a tour.

589
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,232
Keep up.

590
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:10,626
Oh, my God...

591
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,926
Will you quit gawking?

592
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:30,803
We don't have a lot of time.

593
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:34,336
You're lucky they all got called out
to fight some insecto freak.

594
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,805
Your lizard is over here.

595
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:58,257
- I can't see anything.
- Just tap on the glass.

596
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:15,979
Drop it.

597
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:19,844
Please...

598
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,783
Unless you want to see
your autopsy before you die,

599
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,104
I suggest you get the hell
out of here...

600
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,383
And spread the word...

601
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,165
Kate Freelander is not for sale.

602
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,011
Wait, what is this place?

603
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,651
- I got to get you to the bus station.
- But how did...

604
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,475
Would you have really done it?
Would you have killed that guy?

605
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,488
Absolutely.

606
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,926
No one messes with my family.

607
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,953
- You got a shot?
- Not without help.

608
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,059
What'd I miss?

609
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:30,672
These things don't work?

610
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:31,797
Ish.

611
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:00,652
Fire!

612
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:06,944
Keep firing!

613
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,347
Now!

614
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,124
Go, I've got it!

615
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,027
Hey, buddy.

616
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:31,034
Get him back to the Sanctuary
right away.

617
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,451
I'll take him.

618
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,664
- Come on, boy.
- Here we go...

619
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:44,688
He's breathing.

620
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:48,004
Henry's getting the toxin. We need
to get this suit off him right away.

621
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:49,803
We have no choice.

622
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:53,849
Wait, please.

623
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,140
It's leaving.

624
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:18,790
- What the hell just happened?
- I guess I just...

625
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:21,985
wished it off.

626
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:25,672
I didn't want it to die.

627
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,967
For the first time since I got it,

628
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,539
I truly wanted it off.

629
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:34,139
I guess it was just
granting my wish.

630
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,051
May I?

631
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,107
I'll miss you, little buddy.

632
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:51,364
Live long and prosper.

633
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,583
Get him to the infirmary.

634
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:09,839
It just did that
'cause of the heat of his hand, right?

635
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,530
Right?

636
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,096
Come on...

637
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,023
You asked to see me?

638
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:29,903
Henry said that when he went to feed
the Sorkel tonight, it wasn't hungry.

639
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:33,411
I wondered if you knew
anything about that.

640
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:37,396
Then I guess
you would also have no idea

641
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,579
why all the security cameras
in the main lab

642
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:42,740
suddenly malfunctioned
at exactly 9:14 this evening.

643
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:44,891
No idea.

644
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:46,705
I see.

645
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,471
I've asked Henry to move your things

646
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,965
into more permanent quarters.

647
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,299
You what?

648
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,186
I trust that meets with your agenda?

649
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,692
That would be great.

650
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:31,476
Is there a meeting?

651
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:33,633
What are you guys doing?

652
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:36,389
Walter wrote a comic book.

653
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,556
- What?
- Check it out.

654
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:45,729
"Time to put the kids to bed"?

655
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,612
He totally stole my idea!

656
00:42:54,345 --> 00:42:57,147
I was gonna publish this
when things calmed down around here.

657
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,201
- I was!
- It's too bad.

658
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:02,496
- It's really good.
- Nominated for several awards.

659
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,955
Yeah, and he already sold
the movie rights.

660
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:08,504
That's you.
