00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,334
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,484
I promise to make you happy, Helen,
for all eternity.

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,549
Let me help you
before you make things worse.

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,468
And how is that possible?

5
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:12,552
I've already murdered,
what, seven whores?

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,157
It's amazing to me,
Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes,

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,309
the fact that you two
can sit here together...

8
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,259
Time is a great healer.

9
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,713
Redemption...

10
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,564
That requires a little more.

11
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:26,107
The shield is working.
If it's him, we're safe.

12
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:27,919
It's a modified EM bubble.

13
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,133
It protects outside interference
from jamming devices.

14
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,740
- Is that what she told you it was for?
- What is it for?

15
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,194
Me. Your mother did
indeed leave me close to death.

16
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,177
Forgive me.

17
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,838
Tesla found me, revived me,

18
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,400
and the rage that once
fueled me is gone.

19
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,315
Tesla may have shocked you
into your senses, John,

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,921
but nobody becomes what you were
without a predilection for killing.

21
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:50,257
No doubt you'd return
to your murderous habits one day.

22
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,676
I wasn't asking you out on a date.

23
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,002


24
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:03,838


25
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:07,642
You're doing a great job.

26
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:11,348
How do you say,
"it's all going to be okay" in Zulu?

27
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,191
What she said.

28
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:19,105
That's right, keep it light.

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,372
They're panicked enough
without picking up on our fears.

30
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,942
Remember, they're empaths.
They feel what you're feeling.

31
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,727
- Neomycin?
- The intakes have second-degree burns.

32
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,627
Did you contact
the Mumbai Sanctuary?

33
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,506
Told them the empaths are safe.

34
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,506
Their ship, on the other hand...
How's it looking?

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,255
Not so good. Celine Dion should start
singing about now.

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,317
Sorry. Disaster joke, not funny.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,972
What the hell is keeping him?

38
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:44,404
Fire's spreading, smoke everywhere!

39
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,102


40
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,357
It's okay, just come with me.

41
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,409
- The rest of the crew?
- Dead.

42
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:55,342


43
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:58,949
One of the empaths is still missing.
Did you check the sleeping quarters?

44
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:01,768
Without detailed knowledge
of the vessel, arrivals can be tricky.

45
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,780
- I need a known destination...
- Yes.

46
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:04,905
On my way.

47
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,427
Be careful.

48
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:12,031
- Any idea what happened to the ship?
- Best guess?

49
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:14,378
About two hours out of Maputo,
the boiler exploded,

50
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:15,753
tore a hole in the hull.

51
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:16,944
All right.

52
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,629
I may need your help
bandaging the new intakes.

53
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,690
Come on, doc.
You know about me and blood.

54
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,613
All right,
get the guest quarters ready.

55
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:26,480
- We're going to need beds tonight.
- Check.

56
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,724
- Metal fragment in her abdomen!
- Dear God, her pulse is weak.

57
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,652
Get her to the O.R.
I need to operate immediately.

58
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,061
It's quite a day.

59
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,382
Thank you for answering my call.

60
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,503
It seems business
is never finished with us,

61
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,122
despite our losses.

62
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,559
I couldn't have done it without you.

63
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:07,809
All hands on deck.

64
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,984
Besides, I've missed this place.

65
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,836
Vengeful killing sprees
are good for the soul, but...

66
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:16,770
there's no place like home.

67
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:22,167
Quite a lot of teleportation
for one day.

68
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,774
You feeling any worse for wear?

69
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,644
Right as rain.

70
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,974
In fact, I've...

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,451
I've never felt better.

72
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,606
The Team Projet-SG

73
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:57,945
presents:

74
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,156
Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 11
Haunted (v. 1.00)

75
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:05,661
Timing by: Arrow, Salomon

76
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,763
http://projet-sg.net

77
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,913
I can't imagine what would have happened
to them had John not answered my call.

78
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,644
There was no rescue craft
close enough to have saved any of them.

79
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:35,517
Lucky.

80
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,985
That she is. One more centimeter
to the right, this would have lacerated

81
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,638
her descending aorta.

82
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,360
- Cardiac arrest.
- Dammit! Get the cart!

83
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,104
One milligram epinephrine.

84
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:49,931
One milligram epinephrine.

85
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,819
Alive.

86
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,341
For now.

87
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,710
She's not out of the woods yet.

88
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,546
Let's close her up.

89
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:07,746
Man, Kate needs your help
with the intake database.

90
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,712
- Can't you do it?
- I tried,

91
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,933
but it looks like
the system's fried.

92
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,008
I'm a little busy here.

93
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,204
Tell that to Mumbai.

94
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,858
They're screaming for our rescue
and recovery logs asap.

95
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,932
Molly's primed for a charge.
I can't exactly bail on her right now.

96
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,767
Molly?

97
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,903
Modified o-wave linear expeller.

98
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:31,973
Doesn't that acronym spell "mole"?

99
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,776
Molly's hotter.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,313
Dude, it's a weapon, not a woman.

101
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,082
Clearly you and I
have not dated the same girls.

102
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,627
Are you going to do this thing,
because...

103
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,786
Okay, fine.

104
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:47,288
You're gonna have
to take over for me.

105
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,162
Molly needs to be charged
and assembled

106
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,248
before the seams
on the pulse magazine degrade.

107
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,534
You just made that up.
That means nothing to me.

108
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,636
All you got to do is open the stock,
remove the power core and charge it,

109
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,934
then you re-insert the power core
back into the stock,

110
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,446
you seal the magazine,
vent the shaft,

111
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,008
secure the laser sight,

112
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,133
and presto.

113
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,945
You realize you're talking to a guy
who flunked Allen key, right?

114
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,670
Relax. You'll be fine.

115
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:16,061
Don't overcharge the power core.
You'll blow up the lab.

116
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,424
Okay, so no pressure, then.

117
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:38,564


118
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,822
You're welcome.

119
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,941


120
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,423
I feel nothing for you people.

121
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,269
It was a favor,

122
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,631
a task, nothing more.

123
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:02,489


124
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,749
What did you say?

125
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:22,850


126
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,152
I urge you not to trifle with me.

127
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,202
You should have said nothing.

128
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:37,034
You should have left
well enough alone.

129
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:42,391
Why did you come to me?

130
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,533
It's up to her now.
We've done all we can.

131
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:56,617
- Recovery in the infirmary?
- I want her monitored.

132
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,684
Today could have gone
a lot worse than it did.

133
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:08,762


134
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,564
I'm sorry. I don't speak Zulu.

135
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:14,133


136
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:17,580


137
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,872
Nozipho, one of the other empaths.

138
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,289
She's like you.

139
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,989
You can't...

140
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,628
You can't see her.
Is she lost in the Sanctuary?

141
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,176


142
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,216
God, I'm so sorry,
I don't understand.

143
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,551
You can't...

144
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:31,864
You can't...

145
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,632
You can't sense her anymore.

146
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160


147
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:37,463
Come with me.

148
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,069
What did you do to this thing?

149
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,008
Come on, so now it's my fault?

150
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,104
I'm just saying, you see this?

151
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,641
- Who designed the database?
- It is not the database.

152
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,766
Says you.

153
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:48,509
Are you...

154
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,219
Who does this?

155
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,724
What?

156
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,199
- What is this?
- I use my computer.

157
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:57,889
- <i>The Craven Throng</i>?
- It's experimental garage acid.

158
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:00,949
Come on, you're telling me
that my music screwed up your database?

159
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,293
Your freeware media player created
a conflict in the com port access.

160
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,587
Why is it whenever you talk,
all I hear is, "blah, blah"?

161
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,777
I did not create this
to be your personal stereo system, okay?

162
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,451
Is that...

163
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,339
Blood's fresh,

164
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,068
20, maybe 30 minutes.

165
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,570
Her throat's been cut.

166
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,835
Get the security camera footage.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,449
I want to know everyone who was
on this floor in the last half hour.

168
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,147
All right, you got it.

169
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,987
- Gather our guests.
- I don't get it.

170
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:43,057
These guys are so gentle.
They're no threat to anybody.

171
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,225
Exactly.

172
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,186
They're the perfect target.

173
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,716
Beautiful...

174
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,839
Isn't it?

175
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Turn around

176
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,598
very slowly.

177
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,654
How long?

178
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,750
Long enough.

179
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,179
Habits are...

180
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:13,754
hard to break.

181
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,520
Perhaps you're not
trying hard enough.

182
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:19,549
I am who I am.

183
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,898
It's high time
you did something about it.

184
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,851
I take it the EM shields are up.

185
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,230
Indeed.

186
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,739
I heard shots.

187
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:43,952
Is he...

188
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,215
He's dead.

189
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:59,258
Tell me again why you're trying to bring
a homicidal maniac back to life.

190
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,891
It's more about compulsion
than murder.

191
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,767
I set him up for this,
letting him loose on the Cabal.

192
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,665
He knew I'd find out about
his activities sooner or later.

193
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,261
- He wanted me to kill him.
- No offense,

194
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:12,646
but you guys got a seriously
messed-up relationship.

195
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,232
It's complicated.
Charge the defibrillator.

196
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,068
Second button there to 200,

197
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:18,706
and clear!

198
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:24,135
- Nothing.
- 300.

199
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:27,671
Clear!

200
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,416
360.

201
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,211
Clear!

202
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,256
What the hell?

203
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,024
<i>I'm downstairs.
The lights are flickering.</i>

204
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:45,554
Yeah, I know, I know.

205
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,312
- We took a power surge.
- He's breathing again.

206
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,644
The infirmary.
We got a problem.

207
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,614
The empath on oxygen, Musa.

208
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,657
She's gone offline.
We have to get her back here.

209
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,155
<i>Bring the patient from the infirmary
to the O.R. now.</i>

210
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,160
On it.

211
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,806
I need to do a major system reboot.
Can you live without your med servers?

212
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:12,931
<i>Do it.</i>

213
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,795
We need to check for any breaches
in abnormal containment.

214
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,631
We won't have full security
until Henry's reboot is complete.

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,050
You're cool hanging
with Jack the Ripper?

216
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,553
He's no danger to anyone right now.

217
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,651
I don't know why...

218
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,382
I feel so strange.

219
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,360
I know you wanted this...

220
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,311
to end more quickly.

221
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,877
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

222
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,426
Why did you bring me back?

223
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,059
Main server's
coming back online now.

224
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,479
I'm gonna head to the O.R.
and check on the bio-techs.

225
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,778
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

226
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,424
The EM shield is at full strength.

227
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,324
Attempt to teleport,
and you will die.

228
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,600
I understand.

229
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,501
This is my fault, John.

230
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,715
I should never have believed
that you could change,

231
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,372
that you had changed.

232
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,798
How many have there been since...

233
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,673
Since you let me back in?

234
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,421
Does it matter?

235
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:48,177
You've been killing again,
and not just Cabal remnants.

236
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:52,022
Does it matter that I never
wanted it to begin again,

237
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:53,293
that I tried to stop?

238
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:54,858
Helen, I tried.

239
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,709
This is Whitechapel all over again.

240
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:07,653
You're gonna be okay.

241
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:10,286
You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to get you to the O.R.

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,528


243
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,537
Your lungs are hurt,
but you're gonna be okay.

244
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,207


245
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,285


246
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,654
You need to put this on.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

247
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,824
I'm sorry. I'll get you to Dr. Magnus.
She'll understand you.

248
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,522
You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna get you
going. I don't speak any Zulu, sorry.

249
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,726
So was I right?

250
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,188
You think the boss still has the hots
for tall, bald and deadly?

251
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,762
Man, I thought
I had relationship issues.

252
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,619
What about you, Big Guy?
Anyone special in your life?

253
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,407
I mate every five years.

254
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:51,942
With who?

255
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,352
What the hell happened?

256
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,818
Someone plug the microwave
and the toaster in at the same time?

257
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,709
You got me. I'm still trying to get
all systems back online.

258
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,917
- How's she doing?
- Her life support is fried.

259
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,795
She's on back-up.

260
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,163
Magnus wants to keep her close.

261
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,010
All right, we are back up
and firing on all cylinders.

262
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,185
Now, tell me, who's your daddy?

263
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,746
I'm gonna go
check on the other patients.

264
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:19,871
What?

265
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,995
I'm arranging for your transfer
to a secure facility out of the country.

266
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,610
You are far too dangerous
to ever be free again.

267
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:50,374
What happened now?

268
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,767
Stopped.

269
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,035
Great.

270
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,157
Seriously?

271
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:26,835
I know, I know,

272
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,880
we're in auto lockdown!
I'm getting an override going now.

273
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,254
Come on!

274
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,050
Will, this is not good...

275
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,266
Oh, man.

276
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:40,223
- What was her name again?
- Magnus said something like... Bosa.

277
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,893
Antlers...
Musa!

278
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,463
So just talk to her
and calm her down.

279
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,131
It's very important.

280
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,244
Hey, Musa...

281
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:00,105
What?

282
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,230
No signal?

283
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:02,787
Since when?

284
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,721
Something's jamming it.

285
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,551
Come on.

286
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,345
- This is nuts.
- Stop doing that.

287
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,013
Don't you update
your safety equipment?

288
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,284
Constantly.

289
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:23,350
Yeah, then,
why isn't anything working?

290
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:26,403
Where's the disembodied voice saying,
"chill out. Help's coming?"

291
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,065
I'm that voice.

292
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:32,976
Is help coming?

293
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,076
This shouldn't be happening.

294
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,729
Can we go out the top,
climb up to the next floor?

295
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,455
Yes, we can, but we're not going to.

296
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,165
Not safe.

297
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:51,920
Okay, Biggie,
this whole speaking-in-code thing

298
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,604
is really not working for me.

299
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,006
Something's wrong.

300
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:58,034
Need to know what
before we do anything rash.

301
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,172
Wouldn't want to do that.

302
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,044
That is some old-school radio shack.

303
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,984
Is that an original phone system?

304
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,615
From when this wing was built.

305
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,421
Looks like it hasn't
been used in years.

306
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:14,546
It hasn't.

307
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:18,775
- Do you really think it's gonna work?
- If you stop talking.

308
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,713
Stay exactly where you are.

309
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:37,854
Will, come in.

310
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,305
Do not even think about teleporting.

311
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,496
The EM shield stays active
in lockdown mode.

312
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,723
- I have no intention of escaping.
- Really?

313
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:56,576
I will answer for my actions.

314
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,517
- Don't try me, John.
- I'm quite serious, Helen.

315
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:02,198
Something has changed.

316
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,101
- Stop!
- If you'll let me, I'd like to help.

317
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:06,703
Stop talking.

318
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,333
On your knees,
hands where I can see them.

319
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,447
Better?

320
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,453
Okay, just sit tight.
We're gonna get some help.

321
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,845
Dude, I need help in here.

322
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,391
- But you got to get me in the room.
- Yeah, I know.

323
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:31,127
What the hell is going on?
Dude, I'm completely shut out.

324
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,330
- This is very serious.
- Come on.

325
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,766
I've tried every
override command I can.

326
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,401
I have no control.

327
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,919
What about the...

328
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,024
Hello?

329
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:43,473
Check?

330
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,371
- Nothing?
- I got nothing.

331
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,794
- Yeah, I know.
- Hang on.

332
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,787
Anyone!

333
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,595
You've got to be kidding me.

334
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,933
Surveillance feed.

335
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:07,116
There.

336
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:18,007
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

337
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,943


338
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,329
"Gunama," what's that mean?

339
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,035
I had no idea
you were a techno whiz.

340
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,615
Don't know why.

341
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,011
So how old is this building?

342
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,137
Elevator was new when I moved in.

343
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,762
When was that, 1950?

344
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:41,797
'51.

345
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,001
Here, hold this.

346
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:53,754
<i>Hello?</i>

347
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,417
Big Guy?

348
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,479
Where are you?

349
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,969
<i>In an elevator.</i>

350
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:01,094
No, I know, but where are you?

351
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,965
Will, it's the original
room-to-room intercom.

352
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,480
Man, I can't believe
that thing still works.

353
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,788
What's going on?
The phones are dead. Nothing works.

354
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:19,063
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

355
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:23,798
Henry's locked in the O.R.
with a patient. I'm stuck on med level.

356
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:26,635
<i>We've gone into
some weird lockdown mode.</i>

357
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,412
- What for?
- <i>I was hoping you could tell me.</i>

358
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,168
<i>Something's going down.</i>

359
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,643
Still, it shouldn't kill the phones,
or lock us out of the computers.

360
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,535
At least I can see you.
You're on the surveillance cam.

361
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,044
<i>Magnus is locked in with Druitt.</i>

362
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,232
- Is she all right?
- <i>Yeah, she's fine.</i>

363
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:46,696
<i>He seems quiet for now.</i>

364
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:49,859
Wait. If audio's down,
why is video still running?

365
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,660
I mean, shouldn't
everything be fubar?

366
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:54,270
Why am I talking to you
on the oldest intercom ever made?

367
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:56,038
Good point.

368
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,374
Can you connect with anybody?
We need some help here.

369
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:00,661
All right, I'll give it a shot.

370
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,213
We good?

371
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:14,613
We're still locked out.

372
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:15,738
Come on.

373
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,685
This really is none of my doing.

374
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,629
Otherwise,
why would I still be here?

375
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,117
Accidental or not,

376
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,193
I will shoot you
if you give me reason.

377
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:26,819
That is very clear.

378
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,499
None of this makes any sense.

379
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,731
Lockdown shouldn't cut off
our communications

380
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:37,039
or jam our radio and phone signals.

381
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,415
Henry's overrides
must not be working.

382
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,544
Helen, I know there's no good time,
but I need you to understand something.

383
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:45,825
What is this?

384
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,122
It's as if a part of me

385
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:51,861
has been severed.

386
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,206
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

387
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:55,965
Yes, I can.
Where are you?

388
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:57,749
<i>Elevator.</i>

389
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,456
There's been a malfunction
in the security system.

390
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:03,110
- I need assistance.
- <i>Not the only one.</i>

391
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,943
Try that one, the black wire.

392
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:14,678
- <i>Found her.</i>
- Boost the signal if you can.

393
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:16,352
<i>You're connected.</i>

394
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,189
<i>We got a patient
in major distress here.</i>

395
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:21,690
- Where are you?
- <i>In the O.R. with Henry. It's Musa.</i>

396
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,199
<i>- She's having a seizure.
- Doc, her heart rate is rapid,</i>

397
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:25,861
<i>but her blood pressure's really low.</i>

398
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,857
<i>I don't know about her physiology.
How do we proceed?</i>

399
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:32,468
First priority, stop the seizure.
Can you find a vial of diazepam?

400
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,390
Back cabinets, bottom left.

401
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,319
Two milligrams in an IV.
Can you set that up?

402
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,844
<i>Yeah, we're on it.</i>

403
00:24:40,969 --> 00:24:42,965
Let me know
when that's up and running.

404
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,882
It should calm her convulsions.

405
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:47,572
I'm doing it now.

406
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:51,653
Oh, boy.

407
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:56,889
So, what the hell happened?

408
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,262
<i>I've already tried everything I can
from a remote terminal.</i>

409
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,956
<i>This isn't a glitch, believe me.</i>

410
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,156
We're locked out on purpose.

411
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:05,914
We're all cut off from each other,
but elements from the security system

412
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,178
are still active.
It's got to be a targeted attack.

413
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:11,018
No way. Since we got hacked,
our remote security protocols all have

414
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,242
triple redundancies now,
it's totally not possible.

415
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,740
And no perimeter breach
detected, no data theft,

416
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,713
- and these odd power fluctuations?
- <i>I know.</i>

417
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,828
<i>None of it matches the patterns
of a remote hack.</i>

418
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:22,584
And yet we're all
at a perfect disadvantage.

419
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,456
So we got hit by something.

420
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,255
Any theories on how to undo it?

421
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,351
This all started right after Henry
rebooted the entire system.

422
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,593
- Everything was fine, and...
- <i>The system overloaded.</i>

423
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:34,535
It must've damaged the automated
commands running the Sanctuary.

424
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,265
<i>All the security
cameras are working,</i>

425
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,233
<i>but I can't get into a system
that I created.</i>

426
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,998
<i>It's like someone's running all this
in real time.</i>

427
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:46,776
<i>You think somebody's controlling things
from inside the building?</i>

428
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:49,878
- One of the abnormals we rescued?
- <i>Impossible.</i>

429
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:53,130
They're here seeking asylum,
and it's not their way.

430
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,285
When you revived me...

431
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:00,181
The overload.
A massive energy surge.

432
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:01,526
<i>Yeah, but from what?</i>

433
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,654
I feel different.
I feel...

434
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:05,698
purged,

435
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:07,664
purified.

436
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:10,191
It came from you.

437
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:11,789
I think so.

438
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,195
How's Musa doing?

439
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,843
The convulsions have stopped.
She seems to be stabilizing.

440
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:21,319
<i>Good. Henry, take the defib paddles
and charge them to maximum.</i>

441
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:23,999
All right.

442
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,738
Okay, max power, ready.

443
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,600
<i>Juice the electrical panel.</i>

444
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:01,608
Something just came out...

445
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,018
What the hell was that?

446
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,539
It's not anyone inside the building,
it's the building itself.

447
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,375
What does that mean?

448
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,860
That something very much alive
is in control of the Sanctuary.

449
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,725
What,
like as in an electrical being?

450
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,558
This one appears sentient,
even natively intelligent.

451
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:26,728
It's found a way
to cut us all off from each other.

452
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,061
<i>The fluctuations.</i>

453
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:30,855
- <i>It's testing its new environment.</i>
- Exactly, and it won't be long

454
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,533
<i>before it has full control.</i>

455
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:33,660
Okay, time out.

456
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,759
Are you guys sure
this thing is hostile?

457
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:38,385
It's a trapped creature.
Maybe it'll just...

458
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,865
I don't know, hang out and chill.

459
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:42,908
<i>It's violent,</i>

460
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,820
remorseless, relentless.

461
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,165
It won't give up ground without a fight.
Think of it as facing me.

462
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,753
Once it has full control
of this facility,

463
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,301
it will be unstoppable.

464
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,048
It could easily spread
to the city and beyond.

465
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,017
- <i>So how do we fight it?</i>
- <i>Henry, we need...</i>

466
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:02,060
The defense protocols, you got it, doc.
I just need to feed it into the network.

467
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,347
<i>Which won't be easy.</i>

468
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,552
Fill me in.

469
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:07,377
<i>Energy creatures
often behave like viruses.</i>

470
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,067
They forge a parasitic relationship

471
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,188
with whatever host environment
they can invade.

472
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,442
<i>4 years ago we had something like this
caught in our back-up generators.</i>

473
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,193
It caused a lot of craziness.

474
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:20,127
- How'd you do that?
- This one's got me locked out, but...

475
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,493
If we can restart the main power,
do a cold start, I might gain control.

476
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,746
We've to get into the catacombs,
shut down the power.

477
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:30,206
- Which we can't do, can we?
- <i>Well, we have to find a way.</i>

478
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,482
Can you get out through the top,
climb to a different floor?

479
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:37,907
I've already thought of that,
but opinions are divided.

480
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,802
<i>I don't like it, not with something
monitoring our every move.</i>

481
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,532
It's watching all of us,
which is kind of creepy.

482
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,640
<i>Come on,
it can't know what we're up to.</i>

483
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:48,997
All of you,

484
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:53,064
knock out your security cameras
as politely as possible.

485
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:12,792
All right, done.

486
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,352
<i>Henry, are you able
to log onto the network?</i>

487
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:16,712
<i>Yeah, but I'm locked out.</i>

488
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,090
It's like playing Xbox
without my joystick.

489
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,417
Keep trying to hack in.

490
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,172
As it adjusts to its new environment,
it may give you an opening.

491
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,845
<i>All right, I'm on it.</i>

492
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,931
Will, do you have any access to the old
duct system from where you are?

493
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:31,602
Yeah, I guess there must be.
Why, what are you thinking?

494
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,872
<i>The old heating system's obsolete.
We switched to radiant years ago.</i>

495
00:29:34,997 --> 00:29:37,941
Meaning it's probably outside
of Electro's field of vision. Nice.

496
00:29:38,147 --> 00:29:39,833
Get down there, reboot the system.

497
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,037
It should give us control
of some of the key sections.

498
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:43,122
<i>All right.</i>

499
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,707
<i>One of you should climb up
to the next floor,</i>

500
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,582
<i>see if there's another way
to the catacombs.</i>

501
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:50,937
<i>We're on it.</i>

502
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:56,767
Are you sure?

503
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,008
I can go.

504
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:01,587
I'm lighter.

505
00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:04,343
- I'll get there faster.
- Faster's good.

506
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:14,797
Here, I'll help you.

507
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:18,607
Watch where the hands go, wookiee.

508
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,092
Hey, I think I found a way in.

509
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:31,867
All right, you should go.
Just be careful.

510
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:39,737
See you in a few.

511
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:58,392
You said you feel...

512
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,519
Different.

513
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,245
What do you mean by that?

514
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,377
The darkness within me is...

515
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:06,547
gone...

516
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,406
Completely.

517
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:13,166
Far more than when Tesla shocked me.
That was appeasement, but this...

518
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:16,427
This is...

519
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:18,917
So peaceful.

520
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:25,302
It must have happened
when I restarted your heart.

521
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,718
The creature jumped from you
into the facility itself.

522
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,577
But how did it end up inside me?

523
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,982
I have no recollection
of ever encountering it before.

524
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:33,307
You wouldn't have to.

525
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:36,448
God, it actually makes sense.

526
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:40,104
Every time you teleport, you convert
your molecular structure to pure energy.

527
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:43,525
The creature could have latched onto you
during one of your jumps,

528
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:46,654
integrated into your being
when you re-materialized.

529
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,822
And now...

530
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,607
That its influence is gone...

531
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:55,867
Is it not possible this entity
was the sole cause of my bloodlust?

532
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:59,750
That it's been polluting my soul
since I began using my power?

533
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,627
I want to believe you, John,

534
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:10,718
but it's too easy to blame everything
you've done on something else.

535
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:15,637
You're right.

536
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,937
My mind is so...

537
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:22,707
Clear.

538
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:28,444
As it was when we first met.

539
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,687
That thing was my rage.

540
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:43,294
I'm sure of it.

541
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:56,426
{\There's danger! Can't you feel it?
The darkness is growing}

542
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:58,349
You're okay here. You're okay.

543
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:02,902
{\It's making something...
Poison in the air!}

544
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:05,166
I so don't understand
what you're saying right now,

545
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,241
but I can tell it's not good!

546
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:10,529
Something's bugging you.
You're an empath, and that's...

547
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,615
Oh, god.
Hang on a sec, what the hell is that?

548
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:13,997
Hang on.

549
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,147
It's looking for something!

550
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:21,332
<i>It's scanning
our chemical directory.</i>

551
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,627
How could it actually access
those compounds?

552
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,253
Using the robotic assist mechanism.
It is possible.

553
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,172
What else could it be after?

554
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,861
<i>Well, it could just be doing
an inventory diagnostic.</i>

555
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,755
<i>I don't know, I'm still scanning.
I'm trying to find a way to break in.</i>

556
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,630
<i>If it shifts focus for...</i>

557
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,243
We lost the intercom!

558
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,196
So fix it!

559
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,117
John, what's its agenda?

560
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:02,246
Chaos, death, suffering.
Sound familiar?

561
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,757
Once it learns everything it can
about its environment,

562
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,696
the violence will escalate.

563
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,396
Come out to the coast,
we'll get together,

564
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,021
have a few laughs...

565
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:21,957
Right is east...

566
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,077
Right?

567
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,742
All right, fine.

568
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,817
You want to play, let's play.

569
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,117
Here we go.

570
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,257
You...

571
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,842
zap me again,

572
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,678
And I'll kill you...
Somehow.

573
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:01,367
Hallelujah!

574
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:06,644
Oh, man...

575
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,398
Found the furnace.

576
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,467
Thought these were
out of commission.

577
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,883
Defunct, my ass.

578
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,024
Oh, crap.

579
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:02,571


580
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,621
Come on.

581
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,946
Elevator, too?

582
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,117
A little slack, please!

583
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,572
Oh, not good.

584
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,387
- Dammit.
- Get down here!

585
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,128
Get out of the way!

586
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:29,647
- We've got power again.
- Yes, but no control.

587
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,690
It's always something, isn't it?

588
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,538
I'm writing a damn symphony here.

589
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,540
Come on.

590
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:51,847
Just a tiny little command.

591
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,169
Nothing to threaten you.
Come on...

592
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,797
Come on!

593
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,945
Suck it, Electro!
This is my town!

594
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:33,624
- This thing has brakes, right?
- Used to!

595
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,872
Next, elevators.

596
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:40,647
Right, emergency brakes are...

597
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:43,657
Active! Okay!

598
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,458
See? See? What'd I say?

599
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:56,063
Okay, what else you got for me?

600
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,567
It's gonna kill us all.

601
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,251
Did I mention I hate rides?

602
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,018
Really?

603
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,532
It's stripping the emergency brakes.

604
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:50,660
And taking us higher,
so that when we reach the top...

605
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,376
We drop.

606
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:07,171
You son of a...

607
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,681
Come on, Will, cut the power.

608
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,290
<i>Yebo</i>, damn right!

609
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:05,366
- They have risen to the occasion.
- Of course they have.

610
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:06,946
<i>Hey, doc, it's Henry.</i>

611
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,113
<i>Will did it.</i>

612
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,164
Communications are back,
so's most of the rest.

613
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:12,242
- <i>Most?</i>
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

614
00:40:12,991 --> 00:40:14,661
<i>Doc, the toxins it was scanning?</i>

615
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,056
It's making something very bad,
very fast.

616
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,623
It's using the automated assist.

617
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:21,168
- Can you override it?
- <i>Yeah, that's the problem.</i>

618
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,336
I've reclaimed everything else,
but I'm locked out of the main lab.

619
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,011
I can't make it stop.

620
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,091
Mr. Foss, can you open the door?

621
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,270
- It's all right, Henry.
- <i>All right, hang on.</i>

622
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,401
Nice.

623
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:01,792
Sarin gas nerve agent.
We've got about 90 seconds.

624
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:03,816
It'll release the compound
into the vents.

625
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,804
It won't end here. It will grow,

626
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,506
consuming whatever it can

627
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:09,376
and never stop killing.

628
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,384
- Henry, we need more time.
- We don't have it.

629
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,678
Okay, power's been reset.
We should be good.

630
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,061
What's happening now?

631
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,748
My entire body is geared
to being its home.

632
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:24,773
Let me go.

633
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,943
- Don't do this. We could find a way...
- I love you.

634
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,671
Remember that...

635
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,561
Always.

636
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,536
Would you be so kind as to...

637
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:41,411
deactivate the EM shield?

638
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:53,385
For all eternity.

639
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,341
I need a med kit right away!

640
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,051
Get away from me!

641
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:37,137
Let me help you!

642
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:39,281
I don't need your help!

643
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,769
It would have killed a lot more
if it weren't for you.

644
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,681
You kept it at bay.

645
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:51,151
- I need to leave now.
- Where are you going?

646
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:57,431
I have no destination in mind.

647
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,995
Wait.
