1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,700
<i>Sanctuary One to Lophelia,
do you copy?</i>

2
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:07,536
<i>Still no answer, mom.</i>

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,859
<i>Take us down.</i>

4
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,595
- You see anybody?
- Let's hope they're below.

5
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:32,519
What did the message say exactly?

6
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:36,660
Just that Eric was bringing back
something we'd never seen before,

7
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:39,411
and we were to meet him
in the harbor.

8
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,541
Only they never made it to the dock.

9
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,626
It's Eric.

10
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,693
Make sure Will is covered.

11
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:02,315
Come on.

12
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:29,675
Six dead.

13
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,048
They weren't just killed.

14
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:34,139
They were half devoured.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,633
Whatever it was, it was powerful.

16
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:09,010
Whatever specimens
were in these are long gone.

17
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:16,075
Makes you wonder
what was in these cages.

18
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,127
You think they could've
broken their way out?

19
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,363
Looks more like something
clawed or chewed its way in.

20
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,100
Mom,
come check this out.

21
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,117
- Tranquilizer rounds only.
- Are you sure?

22
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,015
Eric paid with his life
to bring it back.

23
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,893
- We owe it to him to preserve it.
- I think we owe it to him to kill it.

24
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,468
The Team Projet-SG

25
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,844
presents:

26
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,055
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 06
Nubbins (v. 1.00)

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,560
Timing by: Arrow, nitrogenc,
Ricana, Salomon.

28
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,670
http://projet-sg.net

29
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:21,048
Now I know why Eric was
so excited about these creatures.

30
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,604
Their hyper camouflage
makes them all but invisible.

31
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,887
Plus the fact that it's present in both
the predator and the smaller abnormal.

32
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,099
The Nubbins.

33
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:33,229
- You gonna make me ask?
- Ashley's name for them.

34
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:37,347
Scientific name <i>Nubina Atelerix</i>,
according to Eric's log.

35
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,717
Do we know
what triggers this camouflage?

36
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,197
It seems to be a function
of both fear and aggression.

37
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,933
That makes sense.

38
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,458
Hide to avoid being stalked,
and as an aid to the hunt.

39
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,320
So obviously it was the predator who was
responsible for killing Eric's crew.

40
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:54,291
Track wounds of each of the victims show
biological evidence of both species.

41
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,462
Come on, there's no way those adorable
things could have attacked anybody.

42
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,996
I'm not saying that they did.

43
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,254
So how could they have left
trace on the bodies?

44
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,112
I'm theorizing that some of
the Nubbins might've escaped

45
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,699
and survived by feeding
on the dead crew members,

46
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:08,754
hence the mingling of the DNA.

47
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,940
Well, that's creepy.

48
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,835
What's creepy
is that a bunch of them

49
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,112
were eaten by
that nasty-ass monster.

50
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:16,962
All but our two little survivors,

51
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,609
probably on their way to becoming
the carnivore's next meal.

52
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,848
I'm gonna go see how they're doing.

53
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:31,537
You okay?

54
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,952
Eric was one of the world's
great hunters of abnormals.

55
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:40,713
He called them
"evolution's experiments".

56
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:44,259
Am I reading
a personal relationship?

57
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:47,804
I don't want to see
his sacrifice go to waste.

58
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,944
Have you had a chance
to check out my Nubbins?

59
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,334
Oh, you mean the...

60
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,617
No, but I would like to.

61
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,367
Oh, guys, come on,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

62
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,756
Oh, man, I think I'm allergic.

63
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:27,093
You better get used to them. They're
the coolest thing we ever brought back.

64
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,769
I got to admit,
your Nubbins are pretty amazing.

65
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,022
Don't you just want to squeeze them?

66
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:45,809
You find anything out
about our predator?

67
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:47,656
I'm still running the DNA.

68
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,974
It'll take a few days before
we can complete the analysis.

69
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,160
So what's going on?

70
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,788
We have a rather odd situation
on our hands.

71
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,030
Isn't "rather odd"
sort of your stock in trade?

72
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:04,178
A gentleman by the name of
Maurice McRae, recently deceased,

73
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:07,884
stipulated in his will that I perform
the autopsy on his remains.

74
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,311
Why?

75
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,496
He spent the last years of his life
in a psychiatric institution,

76
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,140
convinced he was an abnormal.

77
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,685
- And how did he know about you?
- That's a question I have as well.

78
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,146
Well, I guess
it's too late to ask him.

79
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,005
True, but his granddaughter, Sophie,
has accompanied his body.

80
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:27,101
I was hoping you could talk to her,
put her at ease,

81
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:29,130
while I examine her grandfather.

82
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,698
What does she know about us?

83
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,159
Only the rumors that
her grandfather passed along.

84
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,372
Everyone was convinced that he was
a few cups shy of a tea service.

85
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,846
Everyone but Sophie.

86
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:43,252
- You're gonna go with the postmortem?
- Of course.

87
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,302
If his claims are unfounded, well...

88
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,509
there's no harm in fulfilling
the man's final request.

89
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,433
You must be Sophie.

90
00:07:58,247 --> 00:07:59,597
I'm Dr. Zimmerman.

91
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,772
You work with Dr. Magnus?

92
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,235
I do.

93
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,732
My condolences.

94
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,402
Thank you, Doctor.

95
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,828
- You mind if I ask you some questions?
- I already know what you're gonna say,

96
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,577
that my grandfather was
an eccentric old man.

97
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,956
Actually, no,
I don't know anything about him.

98
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:21,524
Sorry.

99
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:25,084
It's just, all the doctors said
he was suffering

100
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,121
from advanced dementia,

101
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,300
and my parents, it's all my relatives
think he was crazy.

102
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,219
But you didn't.

103
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,792
He just felt so strongly.

104
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:38,641
I loved him very much.

105
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:45,022
How did he come to this decision?

106
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,455
Well, he always talked about

107
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,760
a private research facility.

108
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,111
He called it "the Sanctuary",

109
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,622
a place where what he called...

110
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,927
"abnormals", were given refuge.

111
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,454
'course, no one took him seriously.

112
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:04,250
Is that what goes on here?

113
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,668
Well, we are
a private research facility.

114
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:13,634
Research into what, exactly?

115
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,013
A range of things.

116
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
A "range"?

117
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,300
Why don't you tell me more
about your grandfather?

118
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,479
My grandfather could see things

119
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,552
that other people didn't,

120
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,037
that other people couldn't.

121
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:33,924
When we spent time together,
it was...

122
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,633
it was like the world would open up.

123
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,413
Sounds like an inspiring man.

124
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,866
I mean, he showed me
what people were thinking,

125
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:48,878
what they were feeling.

126
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,629
So he actually imparted...

127
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,926
these thoughts or sensations?

128
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,385
Are you humoring me?

129
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,015
- I'm not. I'm just asking questions.
- It's fine. I'm used to it.

130
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:05,712
Dr. Zimmerman, look, I'm sorry,
if you're going to be so evasive,

131
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:08,856
I really don't see any reason
to tell you more than I have.

132
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,919
Dr. Magnus has made arrangements
for you to stay here,

133
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:18,532
as long as you're comfortable with that,
until the autopsy results come in.

134
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,583
Thank you.

135
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:30,124
You have something
against sleep, don't you?

136
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,899
Just doing some reading.

137
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:33,665
There's a recurring legend

138
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,782
amongst equatorial rainforest cultures
about Nubbins.

139
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,585
Nubbins?
I thought Ashley made that name up.

140
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:41,815
She did.

141
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,326
They're most often called "Amoratas".

142
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,247
Apparently the species
is highly prized

143
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,881
as harbingers of fertility
and a bountiful harvest.

144
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,232
In some societies,
they were a common wedding gift,

145
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:53,442
to promote connubial bliss.

146
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,195
Before the age of self-help books.

147
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,047
When they vanish,
it's considered a portent of discord.

148
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:04,924
How did the...

149
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,169
the autopsy go...

150
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,910
on Sophie's grandfather?

151
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:12,128
Sorry?

152
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,082
The autopsy?

153
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,513
There was a...

154
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:22,230
significant anomaly
to the frontal lobe.

155
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,914
I'll need to do more tests to determine
if it's a tumor or...

156
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:27,815
something else.

157
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,023
So it's...

158
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,440
it's possible that he's an abnormal?

159
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:34,900
Too early to tell, really.

160
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,451
I'm...

161
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:49,415
I'm gonna go to bed.

162
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,749
Sweet dreams.

163
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:55,796
Don't forget to put out the fire.

164
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:57,918
I never do.

165
00:11:58,896 --> 00:11:59,896
All right.

166
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:18,336
Are they okay?

167
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,607
He said the female kept going
in and out of camo mode,

168
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,667
and then swelled up like a blimp.

169
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,575
She gave birth just after dawn.

170
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,965
They're all fine,
all 14 of them.

171
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:31,082
It took them only minutes
to adapt their camouflage.

172
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,857
The juveniles are
putting on weight so fast

173
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm projecting they'll reach
maturation within a day.

174
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:53,447
That rate of metabolic growth
is scary.

175
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:55,571
We should find a way
to discourage their mating.

176
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,546
Not yet.

177
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,000
I want to document
a full reproductive cycle first.

178
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,852
I'm keeping this one as a pet,
just so you know.

179
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,376
In the throes of a breeding cycle,
they may not be as docile as they look.

180
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,424
Oh, come on, I can handle
a baby Nubbin, mom.

181
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,663
Right, little guy?
You're so cute.

182
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:12,498
What about the predator?

183
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,681
He showed marked signs of agitation
throughout the night.

184
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:18,759
Only came out of camouflage
for all but a few moments.

185
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:22,661
I don't think he likes the Nubbins.

186
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,908
But you can't say for sure?

187
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:29,307
No, not yet,

188
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,062
but I can say

189
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,978
that I've never seen brain structures
quite like your grandfather's.

190
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,775
Sophie, the blood I took from you
as a control sample,

191
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:41,429
I should tell you,

192
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,280
I found similar biochemical
anomalies to your grandfather's.

193
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,398
Oh, my God.

194
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,899
It would be premature
to read anything into it.

195
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,181
Yeah, but if he was an abnormal...

196
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,889
In 24 hours,
all this will be much clearer.

197
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,602
Okay, well, look,
since I've gotten here,

198
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,295
no one has told me squat
about what this place actually does,

199
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,440
and now you're telling me
I'm some kind of freak of nature, too?

200
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:05,009
You guys are hiding
something from me,

201
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,225
both of you!

202
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,723
Why should I believe
a single thing you tell me?

203
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,646
Sophie, we find ourselves
in a very rare situation.

204
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,109
I'm about to do something
that I normally wouldn't even consider.

205
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,488
I don't understand.
What?

206
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,680
You will shortly.

207
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:32,709
Will, would you be so kind
as to show our guest around?

208
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:38,979
Yeah, sure.

209
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,508
Watch yourself there, Big Guy.

210
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,467
You don't want to get between them and
their breakfast. You could lose a digit.

211
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,224
I've never seen
an animal with such...

212
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,012
a big appetite.

213
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:57,103
It's not just food.

214
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,633
They're not pairing up
for square-dancing.

215
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:01,943
Oh, man.

216
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,663
Maybe you shouldn't be
exposing yourself unnecessarily.

217
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,847
Yeah, the allergy pills
aren't working.

218
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,908
I just hope these little dudes
aren't permanent guests.

219
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,654
You look as queasy as I did
when I first walked this floor.

220
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,815
Actually, you're taking it
better than I did.

221
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:33,374
I sensed all of this

222
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:37,350
before I got here.
I mean, not the specifics, but...

223
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,449
Even though your granddad was gone.

224
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,816
Maybe...

225
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,824
he passed on his gift.

226
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,045
Or maybe the feelings that
you always saw as coming from him

227
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,802
were coming from you.

228
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:57,990
You okay?

229
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah, just light-headed.

230
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,869
It's all.
I tend to get these dizzy spells.

231
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,129
- Why don't you sit down?
- I'm all right.

232
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,248
You might be having
a mild panic attack or something.

233
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:10,759
I just get like this.

234
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,096
Well, we'll be sure to have
Dr. Magnus check it out.

235
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:19,776
What is it?

236
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,161
The new creatures...

237
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:24,901
They're upset.

238
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,954
I know it may be hard to believe,
but those aren't tricks of the eye.

239
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,256
Those are flesh and blood creatures.

240
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,106
Of course they are.

241
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:44,885
It's okay.

242
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,982
They seem to be drawn to you.

243
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:06,398
You okay?

244
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,410
Is it coming back?

245
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,362
I think I should lie down
for a while.

246
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,075
Come in.

247
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,510
The Nubbins came out of camo-mode,

248
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:37,096
and we did a head count,
and one of them was missing.

249
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,575
Yeah, I just couldn't stop myself.

250
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,665
What time is it?

251
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:51,211
It's almost 2:00.

252
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:53,094
Weird.

253
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,698
I must have fallen asleep
or something.

254
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,913
That is not very nice.
Will is a friend.

255
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:04,785
Co-worker...

256
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,854
slash... friend.
That's all.

257
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:10,754
Maybe you should...
Maybe you should put him back,

258
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,299
- just to be on the safe side.
- Okay, little buddy, let's go.

259
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:18,863
- Oh! Oh, man!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

260
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,432
Get back in here...

261
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,560
Oh, let me...

262
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,503
let me get that for you.

263
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,615
This...
Here.

264
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,040
Just... toss it in here.

265
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,506
Let me...

266
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,229
do that.

267
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:01,013
You wouldn't have a...
man's shirt lying around, would you?

268
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:02,848
Medium, right?

269
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,775
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,281
Have you been feeling...

271
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,671
I don't know, odd?

272
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:24,720
- How do you mean?
- Well, I'm not sure,

273
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:27,100
but ever since we got back
from the ship, I've felt...

274
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,450
- Woozy?
- Is that how you're feeling?

275
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:33,045
Yeah, kinda.

276
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,662
I think sometimes I can...

277
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:38,050
be a little stand-offish.

278
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,943
I mean, I know I can be snippy.

279
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,847
No.
No, not at all.

280
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,690
I don't want you to think
that I'm...

281
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:49,061
unappreciative,

282
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:51,480
or unapproachable.

283
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,099
I've been accused of that by guys.

284
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,996
Yeah, me too.

285
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,219
Not by guys, but...

286
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:02,968
You know what I mean.

287
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,515
Are you okay?

288
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,542
Yeah, it's just these new contacts.
I'm just getting used to them.

289
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,794
I really like you...

290
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:15,129
Really?

291
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,107
Without glasses.

292
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,475
Where's my Nubbin?

293
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,860
At first I thought
they were just camouflaging,

294
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:01,832
but I swept the entire cell
feeling for them.

295
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,691
Don't tell me they've escaped?

296
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,184
Something gnawed
through the ventilation grate

297
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,452
from the outside.

298
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Mayday.

299
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,575
I'm going to err on the side of caution.
I want the building sealed.

300
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,840
- Nobody goes in or out.
- Threat level "holy crap". Check.

301
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,549
These creatures
escape the Sanctuary,

302
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:32,394
and we'll have much more than
a pest control problem on our hands.

303
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,083
Can we not turn this
into a planetary crisis just yet?

304
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,137
- They're 14 little furballs.
- Invisible furballs.

305
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,813
We'll round them up, okay?

306
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:43,050
If they reach sexual maturity
as fast as they've reached full size...

307
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,587
Do the math.

308
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,877
But they haven't overrun
their native habitat, right?

309
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:49,488
Camouflaged or not,
they wouldn't be much of a secret

310
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:52,404
and that's the one saving grace.
Something must control their number.

311
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,261
What about the predator
Eric brought back?

312
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,413
That's one of a number of theories
I'm working on.

313
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,184
Though their shared
trait of camouflage

314
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,673
doesn't necessarily define
their relationship on the food chain.

315
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:02,192
We could try to draw them out,

316
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:04,696
if we could just figure out
what they crave. You know,

317
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,519
besides other Nubbins.

318
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,338
We know
they're hungry little suckers.

319
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll make sure
our food stores are protected.

320
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,380
Too late for that.

321
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:14,665
They've already wiped out the pantry

322
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:16,592
and the walk-in.

323
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:19,042
What?
There's nothing left?

324
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,468
Right.
We go floor by floor.

325
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,306
Snares, tranquilizers,
whatever it takes.

326
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,600
Hey, little guy, it's okay.

327
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:17,779
Here you go.

328
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:19,408
That's gouda.

329
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,287
Nobody's going to
hurt you, little fella.

330
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:24,768
Nobody's gonna...

331
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,409
I lied! I'm going to hurt you!

332
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:39,182
Your mother was a sewer rat!

333
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,837
I'm going to schedule
a full rabies series,

334
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,798
unless we can confirm its absence

335
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,765
in every Nubbin out there.

336
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:51,595
Isn't that, like, super painful?

337
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:53,530
I'm not going to lie to you.

338
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:55,425
No, it's okay, please.
You can lie to me.

339
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,977
Those poor things
must've been pushed to the limits.

340
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:00,287
Listen,
I know you're all about

341
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:02,878
saving the whales and everything,
but these guys just happen to be

342
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:05,609
a pack of vicious, over-sexed,
hyperthyroid, invisi-rodents.

343
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,690
Stop demonizing them.
They were just afraid!

344
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,284
We have no history
with this species.

345
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:13,603
We cannot take this attack lightly.

346
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,692
Now, how many have we
re-captured so far?

347
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:19,035
Three,

348
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,114
- Or so.
- Three?

349
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,292
Almost four.

350
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:23,582
Out of 14?

351
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:25,837
Actually, I'd go up about five...

352
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:27,839
Times.

353
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,360
What did you see?

354
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:34,354
I'm not sure "see" is the right word,
but by the way they rippled,

355
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,083
I'd say we're looking at
several litters of newborns,

356
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,793
but, they won't be doing
the horizontal tango for, like, hours.

357
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,250
We need to corral them all
as quickly as possible.

358
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,258
I'm taking you off the front lines.

359
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,860
I want you working on a more...

360
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,040
- technological solution.
- I'm good with that.

361
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,189
Tell me you're not talking
about exterminating them.

362
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:54,228
I'd like nothing more than to see them
all back in their cell unharmed.

363
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:58,036
We wouldn't be having this discussion
had you shown better judgment.

364
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,124
Come in.

365
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:16,045
- Could you give us a moment?
- Yeah,

366
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:17,806
- sure.
- Thank you.

367
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,053
Dr. Magnus...

368
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,689
Hello, Sophie.

369
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,108
Will said you might
be able to help me.

370
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,974
Please, have a seat.

371
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:35,066
He told you about the headaches,

372
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,533
and the spins and all that?

373
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:41,913
If it's all right with you, I'd like...
to conduct a few simple tests.

374
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,000
Simple, like brain scans?

375
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:48,253
Probably prudent
under the circumstances.

376
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,946
I know you have
more important things to deal with.

377
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:53,547
You're in the middle of a crisis.

378
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:57,053
Actually, by Sanctuary standards,
this is just another day at the office.

379
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,893
What did my grandfather die of?

380
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:06,396
A brain aneurysm.

381
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:12,527
And you said that
we have similar anomalies.

382
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:16,907
Let's just see what's happens
before we anticipate, all right?

383
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:19,626
Okay.

384
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,965
It's going to be okay, Sophie.

385
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,782
Okay, here's my idea.

386
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:33,830
We capture a male Nubbin,

387
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:36,663
use it as bait
and wait for the females to swarm.

388
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:40,717
Or we use a female as bait
and watch the males swarm.

389
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:44,166
Well, want as many of the child-bearers
back in captivity as possible.

390
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:47,914
As if the girls are going to go all
weak-kneed over the right Nubbin.

391
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:52,848
- I'm sorry, the "right Nubbin?"
- You know, smart, handsome,

392
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:57,614
good sense of humor, go-getter,
dedicated to the same things you are,

393
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,882
loves long walks on the beach...

394
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:02,613
Are you okay?

395
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,232
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:12,585
Johnny Nub in the crosshairs.

397
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:20,637
There's nothing that threatens
your health. You're fine, Sophie.

398
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:24,516
- But you did find something.
- It's completely benign,

399
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,955
similar to what we found
in your grandfather's brain,

400
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,608
a tissue structure that bridges
your frontal lobes.

401
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,856
- Like a tumor!
- No, no, nothing like that.

402
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:35,819
There's a nerve bundle that links
this unusual organ to the thalamus.

403
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:38,858
I think it may be used
in pre-verbal communication.

404
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,927
Oh, this is unbelievable.

405
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,535
I suspect it's some sort of
empathic ability.

406
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:46,446
In my world,
it's a genetic expression

407
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:48,999
that may well preview
an evolutionary advance.

408
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,927
I just always
attributed it to Maurice.

409
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,010
It only ever happened
when I was with him.

410
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,269
He wanted to bring out
your gifts, no doubt.

411
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:58,883
- That's what the will was about.
- This condition that I have,

412
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,033
assuming that you're right, what...

413
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:03,430
what does that mean I can do?

414
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,055
That's for you to explore.

415
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,060
With our help, if you'll trust us.

416
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,456
Maybe this isn't going to be
as tough as we thought.

417
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,420
I'm not so sure about that.

418
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:50,477
Well, I'm telling you, we have
a Nubbins explosion on our hands.

419
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:53,960
I've found something that may explain
their popularity as a wedding gift.

420
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:56,066
Wait, don't tell me.
They can be returned?

421
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:00,195
Actually, they have scent glands
that emit powerful pheromones.

422
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:04,157
It explains their
overactive mating instinct.

423
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,035
In fact, it may well extend
beyond their own species.

424
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,747
You're not saying
that they're affecting us?

425
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,533
Haven't you noticed it?

426
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,447
Are you asking me
if I've been feeling...

427
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:18,630
Randy?

428
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,008
- I've made you uncomfortable.
- No, as a matter of fact,

429
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,178
you've...

430
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:25,887
you've aroused my curiosity.

431
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:29,974
Turnabout is fair play.

432
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:35,230
Awkward.

433
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:37,196
Poor thing.

434
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:39,904
What the hey?

435
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,074
What's going on?

436
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:43,821
We've got problems.

437
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:47,495
You mean plus the fact these things are
spilling out like popcorn at a matinee?

438
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:51,075
Our systems are degrading.
We got surges, reboots...

439
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,854
Must be the step-down transformer.

440
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:57,364
Well, clearly that wasn't good.

441
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,506
All right, is it me,
or does it smell like fried Nubbin?

443
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:05,442
Dude, I haven't been able to smell
anything since they got here.

444
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,602
Oh, man...

445
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:19,524
We have Nubbins in four
out of five infrastructure systems.

446
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:22,616
Computer, cooling,
electrical, air purification.

447
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,518
They're not in the water. Yet.

448
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:27,217
I don't think it was an accident
they brought down the computer system.

449
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,386
Come on, they're smart,
but not that smart.

450
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:30,600
I don't know.

451
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:34,247
A couple get sacrificed to bring down
the entire server? Air vents clogged?

452
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,129
Drones sent out to protect
the survival of the hive.

453
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,594
These aren't bees.

454
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,337
- They just reproduce as fast.
- Hive mentality

455
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,353
means tradeoffs between individual
survival and that of the group.

456
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,259
We've seen it in higher orders.

457
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,428
Like every time soldiers
go into battle.

458
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,449
What does that tell us
about what they'll do?

459
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:53,266
Everything they can
to ensure inter-species domination.

460
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:56,269
You know, this "catching them
one at a time" is not working.

461
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:59,245
The more I watch our predator,
the more I begin to think

462
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,649
that it is what controls the Nubbins
in their native habitat.

463
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:03,858
You're not talking about
turning that killer loose?

464
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:04,944
Not loose.

465
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,989
We can implant it with a device
so we could track it and control it.

466
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:11,313
The vast majority of the Nubbins
would be stampeded into the open,

467
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:14,161
- and we could herd them to safety.
- It's just not fair.

468
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:17,128
I mean, Nubbins are only doing
what their instincts tell them.

469
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,543
All we'd be doing is replicating the
predator-prey dynamic already exists.

470
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,795
Of course.
Like the lions and the Christians.

471
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,089
We have them contained right now,
but if they get out

472
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,008
and this expands
beyond the Sanctuary,

473
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:30,258
we could be Ground Zero
for a plague of furry locusts.

474
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,867
We have to act, and quickly.

475
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,114
Tracking device is active.

476
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,442
It's all right, Henry.
He's quite sedated.

477
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,896
- Would you rather I do it?
- No. It's okay, I just...

478
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:58,081
Much better with computer bytes
than animal bites.

479
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
There.

480
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:06,639
See? What'd I tell you?
Easy peasy.

481
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:25,401
- Wanted to see how you were feeling.
- Did Dr. Magnus tell you?

482
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:28,779
- I told her it was okay if she did.
- Yeah.

483
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:30,487
Yeah, she did.

484
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:32,877
She...

485
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,785
gave me this bio-feedback device

486
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,621
to use so I know when the supposed

487
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,999
powers are working, and...

488
00:32:42,985 --> 00:32:45,253
I guess you're pretty used
to dealing with freaks.

489
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,049
That's... not how I see you.

490
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:53,127
I guess I'm just feeling sorry
for myself.

491
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,528
Well, I'm sorry
that you're stuck here

492
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:59,620
in the middle of
a level-three bio-hazard.

493
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,124
The beast...

494
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,849
The one the Nubbins are afraid of.

495
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,076
It's waking up.

496
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:19,647
How do you know that?

497
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:21,904
I don't know, I just...

498
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,669
I don't know.

499
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,645
Listen, Sophie...

500
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,283
These feelings that you're having,
the connections with the creatures,

501
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,602
you should trust them.

502
00:33:37,137 --> 00:33:38,137
It's a...

503
00:33:38,468 --> 00:33:39,891
It's a very special thing.

504
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,810
Well, I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
I don't...

505
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,969
feel special.

506
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,071
I feel like
I should be in a sideshow.

507
00:33:50,386 --> 00:33:51,453
This sense,

508
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,364
it doesn't happen to tell you
where the Nubbins are, does it?

509
00:33:56,926 --> 00:33:57,926
But...

510
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:00,922
I can...

511
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:03,081
feel their hearts racing.

512
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:05,541
Their fear...

513
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,572
Their desire.

514
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,609
Nature abhors a vacuum.

515
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:34,501
That's because
she's never seen mine.

516
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:40,098
Easy there, little Nubbin...

517
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,394
I've got suction,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

518
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,071
Releasing the predator...

519
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,694
Look at him go.

520
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:17,564
Team One,
predator moving from Utility Five,

521
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,116
herding Nubbins toward
residential corridor.

522
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,305
- Shut down air vents.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

523
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,514
Predator 3, Nubbins 0.

524
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,597
Where's he gone?

525
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,215
I'm not seeing him.

526
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,605
Track the device.

527
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,891
Level 5, north corridor.
He's moving fast!

528
00:35:56,277 --> 00:35:59,447
Checking level 5, north corridor,
primary and secondary cameras.

529
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:02,120
Nothing on the primary corridor.

530
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,240
Negative on B and C.

531
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,540
Nubbins on the move.

532
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,279
Wait a second.
Predator's stopped.

533
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,695
- A dead stop.
- Where?

534
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:16,413
Just outside the library.

535
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:22,345
- We're losing power on the main grid.
- Go to auxiliary.

536
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,937
And we have lost auxiliary.

537
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:34,790
Okay, women and geeks first.
Oh, no, wait, that's all of us.

538
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:37,390
See what you can do, Henry.
Will, let's go.

539
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:48,700
They're tranquilizer rounds.
One shot won't do it.

540
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:11,343
Looks like our predator
just became prey.

541
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,860
Why do I have the feeling
that we're next?

542
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:18,842
I guess we can skip
the midnight feeding.

543
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:27,617
So we were wrong

544
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,049
about our predator keeping the Nubbins
in check in the rainforest?

545
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,351
Not necessarily.

546
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,061
I mean, sometimes
predator becomes prey.

547
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:37,855
Hyenas, for example,
have been known to kill lions.

548
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,740
Apparently we underestimated
the Nubbins' strength in numbers.

549
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:43,160
Can you imagine what ten times
the number of Nubbins will do?

550
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,631
- Or a hundred times?
- If they can rip a creature the size

551
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,658
and strength of the predator to shreds,
I've no doubt they'd give us no quarter.

552
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,494
We may have sealed ourselves in
with our executioners.

553
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:53,871
Their hive behavior
isn't just intelligent,

554
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,414
it's strategic.

555
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,750
Sooner or later,
they're gonna find a way out.

556
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,795
And they're reproducing faster
than we can capture or eradicate them.

557
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:04,507
- Doesn't anybody have some good news?
- I've got wood.

558
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,032
You know...

559
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,349
For the fire.

560
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:19,230
When we were aboard the Lophelia,
do you remember the hold

561
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,146
- where we found the Nubbins?
- The refrigerated dry hold.

562
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:24,738
Although it was either turned off
or malfunctioning.

563
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:28,155
A cryogenic transport's fairly common
for a bioresearch vessel.

564
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:30,491
Yeah, but the thing is, is...

565
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,342
<i>The setting on the control panel...</i>

566
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:38,582
<i>It was for 50 degrees,</i>

567
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:40,960
which is cold,
but well above freezing.

568
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:44,547
So maybe it was their intention
to slow their metabolism,

569
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,966
moderate their growth
and mating cycles.

570
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:50,720
Ashley, you and Henry round up
as many fire extinguishers as you can.

571
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,890
On it.

572
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:57,018
Still, even if we are right about
the cold, unless we can drive them

573
00:39:57,213 --> 00:40:00,604
into the open, I don't see how that
by itself will do the trick.

574
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,525
You are right about the cold.

575
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,778
They don't like it.

576
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:10,415
Can you tell
what they're feeling now?

577
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,419
Crowded...

578
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:16,792
Afraid...

579
00:40:17,463 --> 00:40:18,487
Threatened...

580
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:21,306
They're sending warnings.

581
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,252
They're sounding an alarm?

582
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,371
What are you thinking?

583
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:30,760
That we try and mimic the frequency
of their distress call.

584
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:34,347
If we're successful,
we could strategically place emitters

585
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,114
powerful enough to flush them out,

586
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,267
stampede them,
and funnel them towards capture.

587
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:43,419
- What are you getting, Henry?
- Just over 19 kilohertz.

588
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,221
Ultrasonic. Beyond the range
of human hearing.

589
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,781
19.5...

590
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:50,184
20...

591
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:52,903
21.5...

592
00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:54,474
and stabilizing.

593
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:57,850
There's your distress call,
21.5 kilohertz.

594
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:01,546
Time to chill, guys.

595
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:27,209
So what'll happen
to the Nubbins now?

596
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,100
Now that low temperature has slowed
their reproductive cycle to a crawl,

597
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,368
they can live out
their days in relative peace.

598
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:35,134
- They're not thrilled about the cold.
- Thrilled Nubbins is

599
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,857
what got us into this mess.

600
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:39,472
It was very brave of you
to share your gift.

601
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,723
In the end, Henry's allergies
were a better detector

602
00:42:42,848 --> 00:42:45,436
than any of my paranormal abilities.

603
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,981
The difference is, is that you can sense
a lot more than Nubbins.

604
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,026
I'm still not sure
how I feel about that.

605
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:55,571
I think we know
what your grandfather wanted for you.

606
00:42:56,846 --> 00:43:00,074
Yeah. I guess, in a way,
he'll always be guiding me.

607
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,705
And so will we.
