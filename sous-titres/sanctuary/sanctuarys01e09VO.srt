1
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:04,065
Come on...

2
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:07,675
It's working.

3
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,407
Come on.

4
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,892
Oh, no, you don't.

5
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:38,805
What?

6
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:47,797
Don't do this.

7
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:49,595
Please!

8
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:51,665
You can't do this!

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,051
<i>Please!</i>

10
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:09,944
<i>Let me out!</i>

11
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:12,445
Please!

12
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,268
The Team Projet-SG

13
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,978
presents:

14
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,189
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 09
Requiem (v. 1.00)

15
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,694
Timing by: Arrow,
Kujathemas, nitrogenc, Salomon.

16
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,753
http://projet-sg.net

17
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:24,903
- H.G. Wells?
- Yes.

18
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,475
Then, Jules Verne...

19
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,426
Obviously, hence the name
of my submarine.

20
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:35,005
- Louis Pasteur?
- He was my godfather.

21
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,225
He and my father were good friends.

22
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:39,908
Roosevelt?

23
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,077
Both of them.
Teddy was much more fun than Frank.

24
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,100
And I'm guessing
all the presidents in between?

25
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,123
Most of them.

26
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:49,450
Hoover was a complete imbecile,
and Harding, well, sadly,

27
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,837
he couldn't stay in human form
for much longer than he did.

28
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:54,495
Harding...

29
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,460
was an abnormal?

30
00:02:56,585 --> 00:03:00,113
You don't think a normal person
would choose a job that impossible?

31
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,730
Don't be ridiculous.

32
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,265
The people
that you've met,

33
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,957
the history
that you've witnessed,

34
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,856
how do you relate to anybody?

35
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:09,420
Dinner parties must be hell.

36
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,282
History is just that, Will.

37
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,590
It's history.

38
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:15,894
We've all experienced it. I just have
more under my belt than most people.

39
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:19,639
You were in Rheims
the day the Nazis surrendered.

40
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,992
You were right there
in the room when it happened.

41
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,162
Only because Eisenhower refused to be
in the same room as General Jodl,

42
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:28,902
and asked that I accompany General Smith
to ensure the process went smoothly.

43
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:32,586
I guess Ike didn't want to breathe
the same air as the Nazi high command.

44
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,463
Some of them
didn't even breathe air.

45
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,725
That'll be Henry.

46
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,054
<i>Ahoy, mateys!</i>

47
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,016
<i>It's because you're at sea.</i>

48
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,144
Henry, are you certain
these are the proper coordinates?

49
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,605
<i>Absolutely. I traced
the psychic signal Sally received</i>

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,440
<i>to where you are right now,</i>

51
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,676
<i>but she says that,
since you left port,</i>

52
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,669
<i>there's been no further communication
from her people.</i>

53
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,030
Did you say Sally?

54
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,573
<i>That was his idea.</i>

55
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,868
It's our nickname
for the Sanctuary mermaid.

56
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,163
- She has a proper name, you know.
- Which is unpronounceable.

57
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,665
<i>It's a true fact.</i>

58
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,918
Besides, it beats calling her
something obvious, like... Ariel.

59
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,198
- <i>Marina.</i>
- Oceana.

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,547
- <i>Ursula.</i>
- If you two are finished?

61
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,050
<i>So are you guys there?
In the middle of it, right now?</i>

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,885
It's not that exciting, Henry.

63
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,877
<i>Come on, are you kidding me? Doc, you're
in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle!</i>

64
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,557
<i>People have speculated about
that part of the ocean for centuries.</i>

65
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>Missing ships, planes disappearing.</i>

66
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,353
- <i>Come on!</i>
- He's right.

67
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,606
There's been reports of lost time
and doors to other dimensions...

68
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,360
<i>Alien abductions?</i>

69
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,220
It's the ocean.
Seriously.

70
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:43,140
Henry, we'll call you when we've made
contact with the merfolk.

71
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,695
<i>Okay, but if you find
those missing airmen from WW II...</i>

72
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:52,350
You know, I got to admit,
it is kind of cool

73
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,305
you know, to be in such a...

74
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:56,075
legendary place.

75
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,380
Other than a high concentration
of abnormal sea life,

76
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,620
there's nothing particularly special
about this place.

77
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:03,900
Then why do all the mer-folk
choose to live here?

78
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,830
Why does any species live anywhere?

79
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,139
Food supply,
temperate climate, safety.

80
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,480
So it's not, like...

81
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:12,645
magnetic waves, or a time portal,
or something like that?

82
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:16,800
- You've seen too many B-movies.
- Hey, our whole life is a B-movie.

83
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,484
It's a classic,
don't get me wrong, but still...

84
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:27,033
We are significantly deeper
than their usual home depth.

85
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,910
But she was sure she heard
a psychic distress signal, right?

86
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,570
Yeah, she described it as a series
of remotely viewed images.

87
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:36,293
Flashes of anger, violence,
and then nothing at all.

88
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,245
That's scary.

89
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,588
Radio silence from your home town.

90
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:48,840
Hey, I thought the mer-folk
were supposed to be a peaceful species.

91
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:49,965
They are.

92
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,333
Well, some thing's changed.
Check this out.

93
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,595
Some kind of massacre.

94
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,315
It was.

95
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:16,166
Scans are indicating
no life-signs at all.

96
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:21,550
Look at this, it's like they've been
torn to shreds or something.

97
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,844
Maybe it's a new type of species,

98
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,217
a predator that's claimed this
as its feeding ground.

99
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,945
Like a giant shark...
or a sea creature? Maybe a Kraken?

100
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,074
Kraken?

101
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,285
Please, that's a complete myth.

102
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,760
Glad I didn't say "Sharktopus".

103
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,200
I can't think of anything

104
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,178
that would cause this sort
of widespread devastation,

105
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:43,651
not to these people.

106
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,663
Torso severed below the breastplate.

107
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:01,100
Without decomposition, it's hard to tell
how long she's been dead.

108
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,480
You know, these aren't teeth marks,

109
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,174
which rules out our predator theory.

110
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,624
They may be a peaceful species,

111
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,089
but they aren't without
resources or resolve.

112
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,745
They know how to
fight back when provoked.

113
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,310
Okay, so it wasn't a feeding
by another creature,

114
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,185
it was an all-out attack.

115
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,801
You think it could have been humans?

116
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:23,926
Possibly.

117
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:26,986
Considering the number of dead,
it may well be genocide.

118
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,909
What if it was an accident?

119
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:32,245
A military maneuver,
a depth charge, or a floating mine?

120
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,495
There would have been heat damage,
shrapnel. I see neither.

121
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,085
Excuse me.

122
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,699
Well, I'm just saying,
for the record,

123
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,087
Bermuda triangle equals mystery.

124
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,310
Look.

125
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:49,445
There's this fluid I can't identify
behind the cranial wall.

126
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,472
Perhaps analysis will give us
a better idea of what's happened here.

127
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,355
Can you see any reason for these people
to go to war with themselves?

128
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,151
They rely on each other greatly
for survival.

129
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,356
Their society's
incredibly benevolent.

130
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,350
How many you think died?

131
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,276
By my count, over a hundred.

132
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,446
Considering how rare they are
as a species, it's catastrophic.

133
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,406
All right, we are all packed up.

134
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,753
Hey, listen, are you sure
you want to head home?

135
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,682
I keep thinking there must be
some evidence down here

136
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,327
that could tell us what happened.

137
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,553
We've run several sweeps of the area.
So far there's nothing else out there.

138
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,259
The sooner we get these samples back
for a detailed analysis,

139
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,723
the more we'll know
about this event.

140
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,436
Though I'm glad you're so keen to stay.
Ashley said you were dreading this trip.

141
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,962
Well, truthfully,
trapped 10 hours in a tin can

142
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,007
is not my idea
of the most appealing mission.

143
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,807
But it's 10 hours trapped
in a tin can with me,

144
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:52,582
and all your questions.

145
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:54,448
That's true.

146
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:57,268
We should be back in San Juan
inside of six hours.

147
00:08:57,393 --> 00:08:59,462
I'm going to get some shut-eye
before we get to port.

148
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,587
All right.

149
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,915
You okay?

150
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,416
Something's wrong.

151
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,299
- My head!
- You're bleeding.

152
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,529
- The pressure! You don't feel it?
- No, I'm fine.

153
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,031
- We have to stop it.
- What?

154
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:59,725
- We have to stop rising!
- Wait, what's going on?

155
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,100
I have no idea!

156
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,642
All I know is it's getting worse
the shallower we go!

157
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,753
How could you be suffering
the bends?

158
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,775
We have to go deeper!

159
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,193
No, listen, I think you need
medical attention.

160
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,610
Extra-cranial bleeding
isn't usually a good thing. 

161
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,863
I don't think I'd survive another
ascent. We have to go back down again.

162
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,199
- No, that could make you worse.
- I know! But...

163
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,157
What are you doing?

164
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,239
Taking us back down to our original
depth so we can understand this better.

165
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,958
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I have no choice!

166
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,300
We're back at our original depth.

167
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,075
Normally, the shoe's
on the other foot.

168
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:51,802
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say
you suffered some sort of mild seizure.

169
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:55,656
Your blood pressure's through the roof.
Reaction times are sluggish.

170
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:59,157
Still, you were right about
going to a lower depth.

171
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:01,021
It seems to have relieved the pain.

172
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:02,821
But only I was affected, not you.

173
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,814
Maybe it's your unique physiology,

174
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,893
something about it
reacts to depth pressure.

175
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,880
I've done hundreds of dives before.
Nothing like this has ever happened,

176
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,712
and as you said, the atmosphere in here
is regulated to near sea level.

177
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,551
Neither of us should
feel anything as we surface.

178
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,314
But still, bleeding from the ear
and nose, disorientation, dizziness...

179
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,097
- If it's not the bends, what is it?
- Something else.

180
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:26,085
If we had
a cat scan on board, we'd know more.

181
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,395
I'd like to do some blood work,
see how high my nitrogen levels are,

182
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:33,725
rule out any infections or diseases
that could have triggered this.

183
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,130
Give it time. I've asked it to look for
a lot of different things.

184
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:45,369
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

185
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,119
Are you sure?

186
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,893
I'm sure.

187
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,427
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to follow you around.

188
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,470
If you want to be alone while we wait,
I can hang in the back or something.

189
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,722
Don't be ridiculous.

190
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:10,826
If you have more questions to ask,
now would be the time.

191
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:15,378
- Come on, now you're humoring me.
- No, nothing better to do

192
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,944
while the computer
analyzes my blood.

193
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:33,775
So I'm guessing by how quiet
Ashley's been that she knows

194
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:35,724
Druitt is her father.

195
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:37,095
She does.

196
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:41,145
And?

197
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:42,467
And what?

198
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,200
Well, she just found out
that her dad...

199
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,389
is the actual Jack the Ripper.

200
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,999
That's got to put some strain
on your relationship.

201
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,603
She's fine. We talked.

202
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,146
Case closed.

203
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,487
I know my daughter, Dr. Zimmerman.

204
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,174
She will come around,

205
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:08,255
once she understands
why I kept the truth from her.

206
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,840
You see? You did it.

207
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:15,345
Right there.

208
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,773
You invite questions, and
when you don't like where they lead,

209
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,422
- you just walk away.
- That's hardly fair.

210
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,300
You just called me
"Dr. Zimmerman" and left the room.

211
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:30,891
- I'm frustrated.
- Why?

212
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,769
- Because we can't surface?
- Because I can't relate to Ashley.

213
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:38,065
Well, she's 23. No species on Earth
can relate to people that age.

214
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,276
Spare me the platitudes.
You've no idea what it's been like.

215
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,430
Which is why I ask
the questions that I do.

216
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:48,241
Why? Because you see me
as some sort of curiosity?

217
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:52,033
Some perverse form of
entertainment for you to enjoy?

218
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,540
No, not at all.

219
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:56,041
It's because I've never
had this before...

220
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:58,004
A challenge,

221
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,504
a mentor that I could
really believe in.

222
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,294
You know, Magnus,

223
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,968
working at the Sanctuary
is more than just a job to me.

224
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,250
What?

225
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,723
It's the only family I've ever had.

226
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,953
When you've been alive
for as long as I have...

227
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,198
You learn not to get
too close to people.

228
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:34,355
I've buried a lot of friends,
colleagues, lovers.

229
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,331
More than you can imagine.

230
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,502
You asked me earlier
how I could relate to people?

231
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,713
Dinner parties are hell.

232
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,386
Is that your way of saying
that I'm boring?

233
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,511
Far from it.

234
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,122
In fact, you're the first
protege I've had in decades

235
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,011
who's shown any real promise.

236
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,769
You're doing brilliantly,
and I should say it more often.

237
00:14:58,655 --> 00:14:59,521
Really?

238
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,544
I know that if anything
should happen to me,

239
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,195
you'll be there to continue my work.

240
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:09,990
Come on, Magnus,
it's way too early to start...

241
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,075
You are ready,
you just don't know it yet.

242
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,451
Magnus...

243
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:17,738
- Dammit.
- We've got to get you to a hospital.

244
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:20,314
We don't have the proper medical
supplies aboard to deal with...

245
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,794
- Go deeper!
- We can't!

246
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,919
Just do it!

247
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,540
Okay, you got to tell me what to do.

248
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,190
Navigation, minus 30 feet.

249
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,319
Navigation.
You mean this command here?

250
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,020
Joystick, 20 degrees starboard.

251
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:55,952
Cool?

252
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,500
Negative for nitrogen narcosis.

253
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,945
No toxins found.

254
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,430
No sign of meningitis,
your T-cell count is good...

255
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:10,545
Which leaves us squarely in the dark
as to my condition,

256
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,612
except that it's getting worse.

257
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,590
Don't worry. It's just the hull
adjusting to the new depth.

258
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:19,971
Perfectly normal.

259
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,995
- How deep can the Nautilus go?
- Deeper.

260
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:29,160
It's built for mid-range submersion,
not deep-sea exploration.

261
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:32,322
Crush-depth is 2,400 feet,
and we are sitting at...

262
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,449
Just below 1,600 right now.

263
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,409
What about our oxygen?

264
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:37,955
Day and a half.

265
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,624
Okay, so...

266
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,270
As long as we stay low
and conserve our air,

267
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:48,715
we should have time
to figure this out.

268
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,217
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

269
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,385
What do you mean?

270
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:59,515
We asked the computer to screen
your blood for signs of the bends,

271
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,800
infections that cause
swelling in the brain,

272
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:04,055
indicators of specific diseases.

273
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,423
What if this is an element
we haven't seen before?

274
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,859
Something new to cross
the blood-brain barrier?

275
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,986
- A parasite of some kind?
- Yeah.

276
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,305
You mentioned...

277
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,585
an unidentified fluid
in the cranial wall of that mermaid.

278
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:20,161
I'm changing the parameters
of the analysis.

279
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,830
- What do you search?
- Any elements in my system

280
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,320
that can't be identified.

281
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,259
I'm including cerebrospinal fluid
in the search.

282
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:33,841
Dear God.

283
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:37,715
What the hell is that?

284
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,359
A microscopic parasite
in the pyramidal tract of my brain stem.

285
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:47,860
It's multiplying.

286
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,398
At an alarming rate.

287
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:52,863
It's taking over.

288
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,820
I hate being right.

289
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,695
I don't like the sound of that.

290
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,593
The limbic system
is all but destroyed.

291
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,755
Brain's logic center
has been degraded beyond recognition.

292
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,945
Any idea how it got passed to you?

293
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,921
We wore protective clothing
the whole time.

294
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,475
Actually, yes.

295
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,689
Near-invisible perforations
in the gloves

296
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,944
I used during the first examination.

297
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,735
Our new lifeform
has aggressive abilities,

298
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:36,815
even at the microscopic level.

299
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,533
Your gloves were intact, and your blood
work came back clean, so I'm guessing

300
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,613
as long as we don't exchange
bodily fluids,

301
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,417
you shouldn't get infected.

302
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,378
Listen, do you want anything,
while you work?

303
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,048
A snack?

304
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,805
Some music?

305
00:18:58,775 --> 00:18:59,864
Lower depth?

306
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm fine.

307
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:26,348
Any idea why it chose to attack the
brain as opposed to the other organs?

308
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:30,157
I mean, aren't there
more nutrients in say, the stomach ling?

309
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,155
Perhaps it feeds on adrenaline,

310
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,605
cranial fluid.

311
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,256
Whatever it is, we're dealing with
something entirely new here.

312
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:40,216
Well, if that's true,
we know what happened to the mer-folk.

313
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:43,471
The limbic system...

314
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,140
includes the hippocampus
and amygdala.

315
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:49,643
Controls for fear, emotion, rage.

316
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,375
If something was negatively impacting
their behavioral centers, then...

317
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,939
They tore each other apart.

318
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:57,905
Then that's why there was no evidence of
any other species or humans in the area.

319
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,772
- Magnus, how long do you think...
- I don't know.

320
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,620
It could be hours or days
before it affects me,

321
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,484
but it will affect me.

322
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,735
So we surface, it kills you.

323
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,060
We stay down here,

324
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,243
you potentially turn into a killer.

325
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,879
Unless we run out of air first.

326
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,431
I for one don't like
any of those scenarios.

327
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:33,729
- Did you find anything that might work?
- I don't have any anti-parasitic drugs,

328
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:37,316
per se, but a massive cocktail
of antiviral

329
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:40,944
- and antibiotic solutions may help.
- Sure you want to mix these drinks?

330
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:43,146
At worst, they'll make me very ill.

331
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,796
At best, they'll make my body
a rather inhospitable host.

332
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,584
It may take a few doses
and some time

333
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,753
before we feel its...
No...

334
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,921
- Deeper.
- No.

335
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:07,763
- Take us deeper.
- We're almost at maximum depth.

336
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,503
Okay, okay...

337
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,446
We'll go deeper.

338
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,150
I want to apologize.

339
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,363
I would never have deliberately
infected you. I just...

340
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,242
I needed to convince you.

341
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:11,824
Was it the pain?

342
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:17,541
- Or just because you lost control?
- It was the pain, I promise you.

343
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:19,948
You are the most measured,

344
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:23,595
rational person
that I've ever met,

345
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:25,850
and now I'm seeing
heightened emotions,

346
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:26,975
rage,

347
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:28,719
threatening actions.

348
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:31,631
This is all behavior
driven by the limbic system.

349
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:35,017
- None of this is in your nature.
- You don't trust me anymore.

350
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,595
- Should I?
- I'm still me, Will.

351
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:42,190
Yeah, but for how long?

352
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:44,435
For as long as I can keep it at bay.

353
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,262
I just don't understand
why it's reacting this way.

354
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,905
I mean, if we go too deep, the sub
will implode, and you'll die, and

355
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:52,868
the parasite will lose you his host.

356
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,836
I don't think it's a rational,
thinking lifeform, Will.

357
00:22:56,415 --> 00:23:00,000
It likely invades a host, lives in it
for as long as it can, then moves on.

358
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:04,129
I doubt it's as intelligent as a virus
or a virulent bacterial strain.

359
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:05,885
So, what do we do?

360
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:10,135
For the moment, we try to stop it
from affecting me as best we can.

361
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:14,053
At least until I can find a way
to have it reject me as a host.

362
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:15,815
Which means

363
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,425
we go deeper still.

364
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,937
It seems to be the only thing
that's keeping you pain-free.

365
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:22,480
And rational.

366
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:25,942
How deep can this thing actually go
beyond 2,400 feet?

367
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,202
I don't know. I've never taken her
past maximum depth.

368
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,800
But we can adjust the nitrogen,
co2, and oxygen levels

369
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,523
to accommodate for
the increasing pressure, right?

370
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:37,829
Yes, but that will only last
for so long.

371
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,373
Then we'll take it slow.

372
00:23:46,515 --> 00:23:49,670
Can't we just drug you?
Knock you out, and make the ascent?

373
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,552
Every sedative I've tried,
the parasite counteracts.

374
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:56,230
Now, assuming that it's taken root
in my primal neurologic centers,

375
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:00,060
the damage it would do as we surfaced
would likely leave me brain dead.

376
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,857
I hate when it does that.

377
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,464
We've not passed
the safety threshold yet.

378
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,447
Will, there's another scenario
we need to discuss.

379
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:15,909
- Magnus...
- Just listen to me, please.

380
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:17,439
In the event

381
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:20,038
that you believe that my judgment
is no longer sound,

382
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,796
or that your life
is in direct peril,

383
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,379
I am depending on you to take care
of things in a decisive manner.

384
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,590
- It's not going to come to that.
- This parasite

385
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:34,260
caused an intelligent, peaceful species
to tear itself apart.

386
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:37,677
I can only assume
that it will do the same to me.

387
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:41,142
I'm counting on you to do the proper
thing if the situation requires it.

388
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,853
- Magnus, you can't expect me to...
- Dammit, Will!

389
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:49,254
I have lived longer than any human
has a right to.

390
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:51,286
In the end,

391
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,905
all I can hope
is to choose how it ends.

392
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,743
Being taken over by an undersea
parasite is not on the list.

393
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:01,121
And what is?

394
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:06,578
Just be creative,
if the time comes.

395
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,571
Do I have your word?

396
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,956
I'm going to see if we have
any more medical supplies in storage.

397
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,388
What's going on?

398
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,410
Ballast and drive systems
aren't responding!

399
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:47,310
We're at 2,450 and falling!

400
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:49,281
- That's past max depth!
- I know!

401
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:52,523
I've lost navigation control!
I can't stop our descent!

402
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:10,715
How are we gonna take it slow?

403
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:14,688
The ballast systems must've been
destroyed by the increased pressure!

404
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,089
We'll have to reset
the system manually!

405
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,317
- How do we do that?
- In the aft!

406
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,887
- Close the valve, there!
- Where?

407
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,012
There!

408
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,608
Come on!

409
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:45,660
- I need a tool kit!
- Okay!

410
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:01,133
You think you can fix it?

411
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:02,605
I don't know!

412
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:36,836
What happened?

413
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,091
We've stopped.

414
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,675
Engine room has been flooded.
Same with lower cargo area.

415
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:03,060
Oxygen supply has been damaged.
We're down to 50%.

416
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:05,070
The CO2 scrubbers
are working at full capacity.

417
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,436
How much is left?

418
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,023
Less than three hours.

419
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:11,206
What about our engines?

420
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,503
They're unresponsive.

421
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:17,459
Remote system must have been damaged
when the engine room flooded.

422
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:19,884
Where are we?

423
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,785
On a shelf
above the Puerto Rican trench.

424
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:27,561
It must have stopped our descent.

425
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,181
That's lucky.

426
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:36,935
Very.

427
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,135
It's okay.

428
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,260
You're okay.

429
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:53,705
We're fine.

430
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:55,835
It's okay.

431
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:00,692
What's going on?

432
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:02,564
I think you know.

433
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:04,642
Don't you feel it?

434
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:07,612
Feel what?

435
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:10,235
Liar! You bloody liar!

436
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,807
Okay, I can feel it.

437
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,185
It's incredible, isn't it?

438
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,365
It's like sunshine.

439
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:22,205
It's like a drug.

440
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,736
- Magnus, listen to me.
- "You're not yourself, Helen.

441
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,330
"That thing's got control of you.

442
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:30,465
"I can help you, Helen."

443
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:34,911
I know what you're trying to do.

444
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,377
You're trying to profile me,
aren't you?

445
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:39,949
Like a common criminal.

446
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:43,507
Here's a little secret
for your box...

447
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,055
I'm not so common.

448
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:55,057
No, you're not.

449
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,566
I've figured you out, young William.

450
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,845
You think
you need to cure me of this.

451
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:03,445
Truth is,

452
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,440
you're the one who needs saving,

453
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:08,366
from a life of mediocrity, shame?

454
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,447
I've saved you once,
I can do it again.

455
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,699
You did this.

456
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,493
You flooded the ballasts.

457
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:19,163
- You made us lose control.
- You gave me no choice!

458
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:21,375
I know you want to kill me,

459
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,961
and don't tell me
it's because I asked you to,

460
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:27,297
because that's not
what friends do to each other!

461
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,875
I wanted to kill you.

462
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:58,734
I wanted to kill you, but now I see
that's not such a good idea.

463
00:31:58,995 --> 00:32:01,163
- Why?
- Because...

464
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,495
you're the only one
who can control this sub.

465
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:08,175
- There's no sense in both of us dying.
- You see?

466
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,068
You see how good it feels
when you talk sensibly?

467
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:14,975
Still...

468
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:21,017
- I think I should kill you now.
- I don't think you mean that.

469
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:22,509
Really?

470
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:24,555
You want me to feel it.

471
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:30,315
- The sunshine?
- Yes...

472
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:31,855
The drug?

473
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:34,906
Well, then, we...
We have to go deeper.

474
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,665
We have to go deeper

475
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:43,540
so that we both
can feel it together.

476
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:44,915
So much deeper.

477
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,294
We can't stay here.

478
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,246
You're right.

479
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:57,775
- We have to go someplace else.
- Yeah.

480
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:01,195
Good boy.

481
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:06,345
Stay.

482
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:42,238
Very clever.

483
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,132
Best protege ever.

484
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,775
I was just coming
to find you anyway.

485
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:52,610
I can't repair the ballast control
unless we open up a panel.

486
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,465
I kinda need your help.

487
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:57,931
Unless you think
you can get to that gun first.

488
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,887
After you! Water's lovely.

489
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,868
It's freezing!

490
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:18,030
- I can't stay out here...
- Look at me!

491
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:21,491
I need you to pull these bars back
so I can access the control panel.

492
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,949
- Do it!
- Okay! Okay...

493
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:31,425
Almost there.

494
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:34,085
- It's too cold, I can't...
- Pull harder, dammit!

495
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,365
That should do it.
Yes, we have control now.

496
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:47,865
We're good?

497
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:52,655
You're not.

498
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:10,203
Not too creative.

499
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:13,635
Don't miss.

500
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:26,790
What are you waiting for?

501
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,805
- Do it!
- Fight it, Magnus.

502
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,195
Fight it!

503
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:34,505
The parasite doesn't care
whether you live or die!

504
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:38,106
It'll just move on to another host
and do it all again!

505
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,915
Shoot me, you coward.

506
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,465
- Shoot me!
- Give me a reason not to!

507
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,906
You weak, pathetic little bastard.

508
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:49,345
Do you think this is what I wanted?
This life?

509
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,515
I have suffered

510
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:54,955
for so long,

511
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,555
totally alone,

512
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,855
and, honestly, Will...

513
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:04,906
no one lives forever.

514
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:15,625
Time we were on our way.

515
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,655
Come on...

516
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,315
That's more like it.

517
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,010
Come on...

518
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,135
No, you don't.

519
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,175
What?

520
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,175
Don't do this!

521
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:35,675
Please!

522
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,315
You can't do this!

523
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:39,603
Please!

524
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,038
Let me out!

525
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:00,540
Please!

526
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:32,915
You're going to be okay, all right?

527
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:42,895
Come on, come on...

528
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,795
Stay with me, Magnus!

529
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:58,765
Come on.

530
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:01,446
Stay with me!

531
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:12,205
Come on.

532
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,299
Magnus! Don't do this.

533
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,682
Thank you, Will.
That'll be quite enough.

534
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,235
Well done.

535
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:53,055
You all right?

536
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:54,925
Me?

537
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:58,154
What about you?

538
00:41:58,825 --> 00:42:00,565
Feeling much more myself.

539
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,435
Thank you.

540
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:07,945
- I can't believe I did what I did.
- You had to.

541
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:11,647
We both know it would never have left me
while I was still alive.

542
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,194
As deaths go,
it was... very creative.

543
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:20,195
Magnus, never, ever...

544
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:22,075
ask me to kill you again.

545
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:26,412
It was an impossible decision.

546
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:29,475
You did the right thing, Will.

547
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,685
You know,

548
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,115
I know you've been alive
a long time,

549
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:40,867
but maybe you need to accept
that there's a reason for that.

550
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:43,429
Your work isn't done.

551
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,205
My work will never be done,

552
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:49,685
which means that you have to accept
the fact that one day,

553
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:52,505
you may have to carry on without me.

554
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:54,715
Fine.

555
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:57,484
Just not today.

556
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:00,200
Not today.
