1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,610
we've got to be careful.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,310
Don't worry.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,170
I'm committed to a gentle approach.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,030
I'm serious.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,790
I mean about us,about anyone finding out.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,510
The jury's been impaneled for your mom's case.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,090
If nick finds out about-- don't think about nick.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,140
You think about you and me.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,150
I've just got a bad feeling.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,890
And I am gonna kiss it and make it better.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,930
Jeremy,listen.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,140
This isn't a game.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,220
If it gets out that I've gotten sexually involved with the son of a defendant,

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,370
I won't just lose this trial.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,940
I will lose everything.

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,930
It won't get out.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,670
Trust me.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,320
Okay.I'm just saying that we need to be more careful.

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,240
We cnot give nick anytng to put before a judge.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,700
No more phone calls,no more e-mails and no witnesses.

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,400
I agree.

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,540
Close your eyes.

23
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,990
No witnesses.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,620
I see it,but I don't believe you did it.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,020
Well,I-- congratulations.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,090
I haven't done anything yet.

27
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,800
I-I still need the show to open tonight.

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,770
I need the right people to come.

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,950
I need to sell a few paintings.

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,850
Well,all I know is I'm a lucky guy to be married

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,830
to the owner of the coolest new gallery in town.

32
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm proud of you.

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,900
Thank you.

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,190
All right,I gotta go to court.

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,230
I'll see you tonight.

36
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,410
6:00 P.M.Sharp.Remember.

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,530
I know,I know.

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,780
It's my first opening night.

39
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,770
Oh,lisa,believe me,after the last time I was late for a date with you,

40
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,560
I understand how it's in my best interest to be punctual.

41
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,190
Nick,jeremy darling is no longer a subject of conversation in our marriage.

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,180
He's out of my life.

43
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,630
That's how I like him.

44
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,880
ooh,mama,that was close.

45
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,820
Jeremy!

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,400
Too close.

47
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,260
Why I ever thought you being my secret partner was a good idea.

48
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,600
because it got you this gallery.

49
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,180
And because of me,you get to have it all-- great career,great marriage.

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,300
Face it,lisa.

51
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,460
Sometimes things actually work out.

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,740
my favorite couple.

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,140
Why don't you tell me what we're doing in chambers on such a beautiful day?

54
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,550
Your honor,it's come to my attention that mr.George 

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
flew to france and counseled my key witness

56
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,860
to disregard my subpoena and blow off a murder trial.

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,060
There is nothing preventing me from talking to a witness,

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,650
especially when she's my mother.

59
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,670
Talking to a witness?

60
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,470
No.Tampering?It starts getting dicey.

61
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,590
What am I looking at?

62
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,940
Phone records between letitia darling and clare george.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,890
This proves they spoke,

64
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,200
meaning we should be allowed to introduce the witness'

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,160
earlier statement as to the contents of those phone calls.

66
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,330
Your honor,what ms.Lyons is asking for is hearsay.

67
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,350
Totally inadmissible.

68
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,940
Ordinarily,she would know that.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,030
You're a little off your game.

70
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,220
Is there something,I don't know,distracting you from your work?

71
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,160
Nothing besides my impending gloating over your denied motion.

72
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,410
Counselors.

73
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,400
Mr. George.

74
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,950
for some reason known only to her and perhaps to you,

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,740
your mother has chosen to make herself unavailable for the trial.

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,710
I'll admit her statement.

77
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,590
Thank you,your honor.

78
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,070
You're amazing.

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,300
I hear that a lot.

80
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,710
Seriously,you drag me down here and accuse me of witness

81
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,610
tampering when you're involved with the defendant's son?

82
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,380
Excuse me?

83
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,090
You heard me.

84
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,790
There's something going on between you and jeremy darling.

85
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
You're sure of that?

86
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,670
You sure I'm not?

87
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,500
So tell it to thjudge.

88
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,030
Let me guess.

89
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,860
You have no proof.

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,230
Ciao,counselor.

91
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,080
Hey,hey.

92
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,560
The new senator for new york.

93
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,610
Hi,paddy.

94
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,830
What can i do for you,dad?

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,100
Well,I was just wondering if you'd put together

96
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,650
a short list for candidates for your chief of staff.

97
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,310
Not yet.

98
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,620
I've been kinda busy hunting down the woman I love,since you drove her away.

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,610
Not me.

100
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,790
Carmelita left of her own volition.

101
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,390
She would've found out how ellen died eventually.

102
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,980
You would've told her.

103
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,130
So it's better to let her go now.

104
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,920
Dad,I don't want to argue with you today.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,770
One heart attack per month,right?

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,890
yeah.

107
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,750
What's that?

108
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh,just some thoughts I had for your chief of staff.

109
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,220
Those are four excellent men.

110
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,220
john mccormick is retired.

111
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,460
Well,semi.

112
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,420
I spoke with him.

113
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,950
He'd be more than willing to serve.

114
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,770
Ray simon is quite interested.

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,010
I spoke to him at the club last week.

116
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,990
Dad,I think I want to meet with some fresh faces,you know?

117
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Up-and-comers?

118
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,940
People without colostomy bags.

119
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,250
But what y need as a first-term senator is someone with experience,someone loyal.

120
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,630
Loyal.

121
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,370
to you.

122
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,580
To you.

123
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,720
All right.

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,050
I'll meet with 'em.

125
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,350
guess what?

126
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm marrying simon.

127
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,950
I love him,nick.

128
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,020
I do.

129
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,420
And after four-- four--failed marriages and pining over you all these years,

130
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,270
I have fally.

131
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,440
found the right man.

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,950
You sure about that?

133
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,220
Yep.

134
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
And you were all wrong about him.

135
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,270
all that conspiracy stuff about

136
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,010
"he just wants me for my shares so he can take over the company".

137
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,780
which he said to me,word-for-word.

138
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,380
Mnh-mnh,no.

139
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,390
He's not like that,nick.

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,320
You know,when he found out I was spying on him for daddy,

141
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,440
he didn't even get mad.

142
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,770
- Karen.- Yeah?

143
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,620
If you don't trust me,why do you keep coming back here for my help?

144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,930
well,nick,because.

145
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,090
in a world full of simons and daddies,you're all I have.

146
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,610
I'm not asking you to walk me down the aisle,okay?

147
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,740
But I need-- what?

148
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,700
I need you to tell daddy.

149
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,500
Just talk to him and,you know,get his blessing.

150
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,530
I don't want to lose my whole family over this.

151
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,370
And if daddy's not on ard,that is exactly what's gonna happen.

152
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,610
what a foul business this is.

153
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,720
You're really sure his marriage to karen is part of his takeover plan?

154
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,620
That's what simon told me.

155
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,260
And obviously,he anticipated how that would sound to her--

156
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,850
if it were coming from you.

157
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,850
Yeah.

158
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,200
Wh a son of a bitch.

159
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,620
He really knows our karen,doesn't he?

160
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,210
The first thing he'll do once they're married

161
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:28,980
is move quickly and commingle their assets.

162
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,690
He'll own everything she owns,including all her shares in darling enterprises.

163
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,560
Add to that whatever shares he's acquired

164
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,630
through the shell corporations he's hiding behind--

165
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,600
and darling enterprises will have a new majority shareholder.

166
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,390
So what do we do?

167
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,140
I have an idea,but you're not gonna want to hear it.

168
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,290
you let me be the judge of that.

169
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,930
Cut her out.

170
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,550
Oh,no.

171
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,050
Nick-- you pay me for my honest counsel,tripp.

172
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,230
I would not be doing my job if I said anything else.

173
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,840
Nick-- 

174
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,170
strip her of all current and future holdings of darling enterprises.

175
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,460
The company and the family.

176
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,270
Cut her out.

177
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,930
Okay.

178
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,370
Cut her out.

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,360
Yeah,but I had marzipan glaze for my second--

183
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,170
well,my se--my second and my fourth wedding,

184
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,600
so maybe it's time to try something a little different.

185
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,070
Ooh,coconut.

186
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,200
- Hey,babe.- HeY.

187
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,430
Hey,mind if I take your mind off the wedding for a second?

188
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,340
oh,yeah,please.

189
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,410
What's that?

190
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,890
It is the guest list for our engagement party.

191
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,510
It's tomorrow night,and none of your siblings have rsvp'D.

192
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,840
well,does that surprise you?

193
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,530
No.

194
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,850
Juliet's not gonna interrupt her year-long orgasm in the south pacific,

195
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
and--and you know the ys.

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,870
I'm sure they're jut too scared of daddy to come.

197
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,630
Well,I hope they conquer that fear.

198
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,550
You know,occasions like these are oftentimes great opportunities to cement alliances.

199
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,630
Alliances?

200
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,820
Yeah,family alliances.

201
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,560
Thank you.

202
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,520
You know,tripp might not feel so free to knock you guys

203
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,500
around individually if he knew you stuck together.

204
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,590
That one.

205
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,690
You know,strength in numbers.

206
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,030
Here,it's for you.

207
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,150
It's from nick's office.

208
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,580
It's probably him rsvp'ing no.

209
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,870
- oh,my god.- What?

210
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,830
Oh,my god,simon.

211
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,620
Daddy's rescinding all of my--

212
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,860
all of my shares of darling enterprises,and he'S.

213
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,920
yeah.

214
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,560
and he's revoking my inheritance,too.

215
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,460
Wait a minute.

216
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,760
Let me see.You know,let me.

217
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,850
he's cutting you off.

218
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,100
Yeah.

219
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,710
Taking away everything you own and.

220
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,160
- oh,my god.- Everything you're entitled to.

221
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,200
What a loving father.

222
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,670
See?That's what I'm saying.

223
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,520
Family alliances.

224
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,590
Listen,you want to reclaim what's rightfully yours?

225
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,090
Get your brothers to our engagement party,here,tomorrow night.

226
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,730
- And let me take it from there.
- Okay.

227
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,420
- All right?
- Okay.

228
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,920
I'll handle it.

229
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,030
I'll handle it.

230
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,130
open wide.

231
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,290
Oh,my.

232
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,320
That's quite a red throat you have there.

233
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,100
All right.That does it.

234
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,090
You're not flying my son back to brazil tonight.

235
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,470
Brian,let's just wait and talk to the doctor.

236
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,150
You can't hold us hostage here over a sore throat.

237
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,360
Hostage?

238
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,640
That's what you call staying at the largest private residence

239
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,290
in manhattan with a staff that waits on you hand and foot?

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,160
I wasn't talking about the staff.

241
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,060
how is everybody?

242
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,080
We're peachy.

243
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,190
How's my son?

244
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,120
It might just be the flu,but I am concerned,given the fact that brian jr.

245
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,860
Has spent the last six months in brazil,that he may have picked up a parasite.

246
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,810
See?There's another hidden benefit of life in the southern hemisphere.

247
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,790
As a matter of fact,since the two of you have spent time down there,

248
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,630
I'd like to check you both as well.

249
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,490
Absolutely.

250
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,500
Whatever you need.

251
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,160
Good.

252
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,270
I'll send my nurse up to collect some stool samples.

253
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,260
Boy,life with you just keeps getting better.

254
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,980
First you move my son th a soumerica,and now you've got me pooping in a cup.

255
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,520
Kudos.

256
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,180
you busy?

257
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,280
No.

258
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,300
Just doing the trial prep on letitia darling's murder case in

259
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,380
between cleaning up all the messes you left behind when you got promoted above me.

260
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,020
Never too busy for you,sir.

261
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,540
Does the name chase alexander mean anything to you?

262
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,380
No.

263
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,090
Should it?

264
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,650
He's the brother of ellen darling.

265
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,780
Patrick darling's wife,the one who got burned up in their family's country house.

266
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,710
What about him?

267
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,420
He gave a statement to one of our deputies.

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,570
He,um,seems to think that the darlings killed ellen,dumped her there,

269
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,550
and then torched the place to make it seem like an accident.

270
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,440
Not exactly beyond the realm of possibilities,given the darlings.

271
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,250
Agreed.

272
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,920
We tried to follow up with chase,but suddenly he's-- 

273
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,660
- gone.- Right.

274
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,860
Dutch george,ellen darling and now this alexander guy.

275
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,120
you think there's a connection.

276
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,810
I think,from where I sit in my plush corner office down the hall,

277
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,610
that it's your job to find out.

278
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,290
do I really look that sad?

279
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,740
Kinda,yeah.

280
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,970
Nick george.

281
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Joel madden.

282
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,670
So you,uh,you know the artist?

283
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,970
Nah,the gallery owner asked me to pose.

284
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,740
Thought it might help make a splash or something.

285
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,370
I owed him some poker money,so.

286
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,310
him?

287
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,620
Yeah.

288
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,390
Who owns this gallery?

289
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,530
Jeremy darling.

290
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,330
Guess he's running late.

291
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,450
Excuse me for a second.

292
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,450
I-I don't want to pigeonhole the work we show.

293
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,080
Painting or photography,I'm just looking for the freshest artists we can find.

294
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,500
Excuse me.

295
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,260
Thank you.

296
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,170
Of course.

297
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,660
- Isn't this amazing?- Amazing.

298
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,350
And it's too bad your partner isn't here to enjoy all the attention.

299
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
What partner?

300
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,540
I know that you didn't get this place on your own.

301
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,460
I know you lied to me about-- I know all about jeremy.

302
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,920
- Nick,I couldn't have gotten it wthout him cosigning
- save it for the art critic.

303
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,490
I'm outta here.

304
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,950
Nick.

305
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,610
nick.

306
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,130
What?

307
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,370
Are we gonna talk about this?

308
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,300
Talk about what?

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,270
The gallery.

310
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,870
Well,we did talk about it,lisa.

311
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,660
I said no.

312
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,570
You did it anyway.

313
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,520
So obviously talking about it doesn't help.

314
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,050
nick.

315
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,090
Nick!

316
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,210
okay,so listen,it would really mean a lot to me

317
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,520
if you guys could come to my party tomorrow night,

318
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,500
especially given the fact that my fiance this time is so much more.

319
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,250
black.

320
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Controversial.

321
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,910
Karen,I would love to come,really,but I've made some...

322
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,530
wait,wait,wait.I thought you were gonna start standing up to daddy.

323
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,960
I am.

324
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,960
I just turned down his top two choices for my chief of staff.

325
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,120
You know,one battleground at a time,please.

326
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,240
Patrick,you of all people should know what it's like

327
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,340
to be in love with someone that daddy disapproves of.

328
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,170
Well,yes,karen,

329
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,460
but he also didn't choose to fall in love with daddy's mortal enemy.

330
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,380
Look,I never ask you guys for anything,ever.

331
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm asking you now.

332
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,630
Please.

333
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,440
Oh,come on.

334
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,300
Please,jeremy.

335
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,480
Well.

336
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,990
love's a wild beast,man.

337
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,140
You can't tame it.

338
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,710
You can't control it.

339
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,090
No one knows this more than me.

340
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm in.

341
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,890
thank you.

342
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,550
Uh,I'm guessing tripp's gonna die long before you.

343
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,580
Might as well play the long game.

344
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm in.

345
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,190
Okay.Patrick?

346
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,700
all right.

347
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,310
I'll be there.

348
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Really?

349
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,110
But nobody tells dad.

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,800
- Are you kidding?
- Of course not.right?

351
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,430
Mr.Senator-elect.

352
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,170
Congratulations.

353
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,400
I'd love to chat,ms.Lyons,

354
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,800
but I'm in the process of assembling a transition team.

355
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,770
Yes,I read about your short list for chief of staff.

356
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,850
Geriatric,but meeting daddy's approval,I'm sure.

357
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,320
ms.Lyons,I'm not sure what brings you or your winning personality to the state office,

358
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,720
but I've already told you everything I know about my mother's case in my deposition.

359
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,360
Well,I'm not here to talk about the murder of dutch george.

360
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm here to talk about the night your family's country home burned down,

361
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,720
the night your wife died.

362
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,930
Plane crashes,fires-- ratio fun family dinners

363
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,480
to suspicious deaths runs pretty high in your family,don't you think?

364
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,550
We are not the luckiest crew,that's for sure.

365
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,870
What can you tell me about chase alexander?

366
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,970
I can tell you that he's my dear,dead wife's brother,

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,900
and that this little impromptu inquisition of yours is over.

368
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,210
Do you know where I might be able to find him?

369
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,910
No idea.

370
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,740
He's kind of run off.

371
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,710
Perhaps you should follow his lead.

372
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,030
Thank you for your time.

373
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,820
round one.

374
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,990
fight!

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Eat it,dad!

376
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,310
Like the taste of leather?

377
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,060
Why don't you save that trash talk for somebody

378
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,560
who can't spank you with the hand of impunity?

379
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,130
ms.Andrea is back.

380
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,120
Okay,quick,hit the sheets.
 Look how beautiful this is.

381
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,460
Look at the beauty.

382
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,190
And I marinate the asparagus,and I brush this.

383
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,210
what's going on in here?

384
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
Nothing.

385
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,220
Just,uh.

386
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,230
watching the boob tube.

387
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,910
brian.

388
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,340
he's covered in sweat.

389
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,600
Oh,well,maybe his fever is breaking.

390
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm okay.

391
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,750
hey,dr.Little,what's up?

392
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,690
No,it'S.

393
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,220
As soon as possible?

394
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah.

395
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,110
Okay,thanks.

396
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,520
what did the doctor say?

397
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,460
Nothing.He just wants us to go down to his office downtown.

398
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,510
Well,your son will be thrilled to finally get out of the house.

399
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,030
No,he said not to bring the dwarf.

400
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,130
He just wants to see the two of us.

401
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,950
hey,nick.

402
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,730
Nice ride.

403
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,590
Yep.

404
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,360
It's one-of-a-kind,just arrived from napoli.

405
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,130
Designed by gianni depp.

406
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,920
No relation.

407
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,680
What the hl?

408
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,840
So I guess putting my fist in your face didn't get the message across.

409
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,980
It did!I swear!

410
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,870
What-- what was the message again?

411
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,430
To stay away from my wife.

412
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,030
I am!

413
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,170
I did!

414
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,860
get your hands off me.

415
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,660
You don't have to go all jet li on me.

416
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,590
Jeremy,I asked you to steer clear of lisa,

417
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,110
now I find out you're bankrolling her gallery.

418
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm just helping her out as a friend.

419
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,650
- Yeah.- It's true,nick.

420
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,770
I am in love with.

421
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,680
someone,but not lisa.

422
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,540
Yeah?Then with who?

423
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,400
No one you know.

424
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,700
You sure?'Cause I think I do.

425
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,180
Easy,miss cleo.

426
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,850
Nola lyons.

427
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,770
Who's that?

428
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,560
Come on.

429
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,940
You're seeing nola lyons.

430
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,390
What if I am?

431
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,400
Oh,so it's the truth?

432
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,180
No.

433
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,730
Just I don't know.

434
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,820
Jeremy,I need you to admit that you are having a sexual relationship

435
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,790
with the woman who is prosecuting your mother for murder.

436
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,690
Own up to it,jeremy!

437
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,730
Come on!Or I'm gonna kick your ass up and down park avenue.

438
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,670
Your mother could go to jail for the rest of her life!

439
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,500
Okay!

440
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,890
Okay.I'm hahi a tng with nola.

441
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,310
But.

442
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,990
but you don't understand.

443
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,150
But it doesn't matter what I understand.

444
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,130
What matters is that you'll swear to it in court.

445
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,460
You suck,nick.

446
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,590
Okay.

447
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,310
Okay,I'll do it.

448
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,970
Smart choice.

449
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,370
for a change.

450
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,430
What's this?

451
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,170
It's a sworn affidavit from jeremy darling attesting to his extremely active,

452
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,810
highly unusual sexual relationship with ms.Lyons.

453
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,490
Your honor,I'd like--

454
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,640
ms.Lyons,thank you.

455
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,520
My god,this reads like something out "penthouse forum."

456
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,610
Or how I imagine that would read.

457
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,180
We move for an immediate dismissal of all charges.

458
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,760
When a prosecutor's misconduct rises to the level where it shocks the conscience--

459
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,130
yes,I'm familiar with the penal code.

460
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,110
Ms.Lyons,is this true?

461
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,510
Are you having a sexual relationship with the son of the defendant?

462
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
Your honor,my personal life has nothing to do with this case.

463
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,300
Well,if these allegations are true,it does.

464
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,340
So I'll ask you again,

465
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,400
and if you don't respond,you'll be held in contempt of court.

466
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,720
We've been seeing each other.

467
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,500
Excuse me?

468
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,240
Yes.

469
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,290
I'm sorry.I can't hear you.

470
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,970
Yes,I'm sleeping with jeremy darling,the defendant's son.

471
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,890
Happy?

472
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,780
Happy doesn't quite do it justice somehow,but.

473
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,790
well,then,I'm sorry to say this,

474
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,910
but all charges against letitia darling are hereby dismissed.

475
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,840
Dismissed?

476
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,860
Got a hearing problem?

477
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,700
Yes,completely.

478
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,490
With this gree of procutorial misconduct,I don't see any other way.

479
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,540
So this is it?

480
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
A rich woman in a fit of pique deposits her lover

481
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,480
on the bottom of the long island sound,and she walks?

482
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,630
Is it really that easy to get away with murder?

483
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,790
I me-- ms.Lyons,

484
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,780
if this case is on a fast train out of town,

485
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,180
it's because you bought it a first-class ticket.

486
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,660
Don't you dare get self-righteous with me.

487
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,010
My apologies.

488
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,300
Good day,your honor.

489
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,130
Ms.Lyons,hang back.

490
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,220
We're not done.

491
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,390
You're not bringing a gift?

492
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,570
My presence is my present.

493
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,590
Karen's lucky she's getting that.

494
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,690
What's in the box?

495
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,990
His-and-her defibrillator paddles.

496
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,860
What for?

497
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,160
The honeymoon.

498
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
Bro,if you have to ask,you don't want to know.

499
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,210
Jeremy,brian.

500
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,480
You going out?

501
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,480
No.

502
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,110
Yeah.

503
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,960
We.

504
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,110
were.

505
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,330
just going out.

506
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,290
Yeah.

507
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,690
Uh,your-- your mother and I were hoping I could persuade you to play a round of bridge.

508
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,150
bridge.

509
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,040
Maximum.

510
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
I would so dig that in.

511
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,050
but-- 

512
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,030
levine's conucting tannhauser at the met tonight.

513
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,980
Right,and we promised that we'd meet both of them after for.

514
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,880
nachos.

515
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,510
What's in the box?

516
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,840
A puppy.

517
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,750
Gotta run,dad.

518
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,150
The little fella's on the clock.

519
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,580
werie so fggin' dead.

520
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,300
Scotch.

521
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,290
Someone's unhappy.

522
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,750
Did you speak with jeremy and brian about attending karen's fete?

523
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,810
Oh,we didn't discuss it,but if they'd asked,I'd have encouraged it.

524
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,570
Really?

525
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,060
I'd be there myself if the state of new york

526
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,170
didn't have me penned inside their invisible fence.

527
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,890
she's not your little girl.

528
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,150
Tripp,she's grown-up.

529
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,840
Let her go.

530
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,050
Let them all go.

531
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,250
when we were little,karen had this rule that she could hit me whenever she wanted to,

532
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,780
and I was never allowed to hit her back.

533
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,200
Little did she know she would be preparing me for a life in politics 

534
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,180
seriously.

535
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,080
I love you,tipsy.

536
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,440
An simon,you take care of her.

537
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,470
She's a real pistol,that one.

538
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,550
And,karen.

539
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,500
let's just all hope this one sticks.

540
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,940
Oh,hear,hear.

541
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,910
thank you,patrick.

542
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,390
and brian,jeremy.

543
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,680
It was brave of you three to come here tonight despite the fear,

544
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,170
and let's face it,the very real possibility of paternal retribution.

545
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,190
You'll never know how much we both appreciate it.

546
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,690
It is a testimony to your love for karen and to your openness as human beings.

547
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,740
Thank you.

548
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,760
You know,if you read the business section,

549
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,810
you might--you might think this pending marriage is some sort of corporate merger.

550
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,660
But it's not.

551
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,830
Far from it.

552
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,240
Karen and I are.

553
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,270
setting off to,uh,hopefully with all of you by our sid,

554
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,740
to form a new kind of family-- 

555
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,130
one that operates without intimidation and authoritarian control,

556
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,760
a-a family that supports each other without coercion.

557
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:32,660
Just imagine a family with no secrets,no loyalty tests,no.

558
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,420
no traditions,just freedom,mutuity.

559
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,600
and respect.

560
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,720
Well,I know we're ready.

561
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,500
And we hope you are,too.

562
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,380
Good evening.

563
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,620
it's fine.

564
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm expecting this.

565
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,760
Karen.

566
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,320
I know why you're doing what you're doing.

567
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:25,560
And I hope you understand,if not today,then someday,why I did what iid.

568
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,690
It was just money.

569
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,560
And when it comes to that,I'm sure that you will be well taken care of in this place.

570
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,700
But please know thathen it comes to what really matters,

571
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,620
I would never,ever.do anything to hurt you.

572
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,400
You're my little girl.

573
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,430
and you always will be.

574
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,690
Thank you,daddy.

575
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,640
As for you three.

576
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,740
clearly you felt the need to sneak around behind my back.

577
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,070
That was unfortunate.

578
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,160
patrick.

579
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,530
Patrick.

580
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,930
Patrick.

581
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,130
sorry,sis.

582
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,700
brian.

583
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,810
Hey,thanks for the punch.

584
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,780
no.

585
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,040
Jeremy,it's-- you can stay.

586
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,670
Peace out.

587
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm sorry.

588
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,310
Me,too.

589
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,960
The party is over.

590
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,880
I'll say.

591
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,900
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

592
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,900
Are you having second thoughts?

593
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,220
No.

594
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,630
I got through those a couple hundred thoughts ago.

595
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,710
Listen,honey,if you want to go home and beg your father to take you back,
if you think this is all a huge mistake,it's okay,go.

596
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,700
*********

597
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,270
*****

598
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,660
No,no,no,I mean it.I want you to be happy.

599
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,820
That's all I have wanted ever since we met,for you to be happy.

600
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,200
Well,I want to be happy,too,but,um.

601
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,260
right now,it just seems impossible.

602
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,340
Hey,hey.

603
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,040
What?

604
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,980
Look at me.

605
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,430
It's okay.

606
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,530
Karen,you grab on to me.

607
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,250
I'm here.

608
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,960
And we will be alone.

609
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,250
together.

610
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,230
HeY.

611
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,130
I got your message.

612
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,300
Isn't this a little,uh.

613
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,880
ke?

614
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,330
You know,I thought we were supposed to be keeping ourselves on the d-low.

615
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,020
No,it's over.

616
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,880
What is?

617
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,100
New york vs.Letitia darling for one thing.

618
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,840
You haven't heard?

619
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,280
Yo mother's a free woman.

620
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,110
Since when?

621
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,450
Since the judge threw out the case on account of prosecutorial misconduct.

622
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,210
Congratulations.

623
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,410
You told nick about us.

624
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,010
I had to.

625
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,620
After I begged you,I asked you,I told you that it was gonna be--

626
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,800
I didn't think it would upset the whole friggin' apple cart.

627
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,460
Okay,I'm sorry.

628
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,460
It was a moment of weakness.

629
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,050
A moment?

630
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,760
A-a moment.

631
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,330
Okay,yeah.

632
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,230
Try a lifetime.

633
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,880
Wait.

634
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,030
It can't end like this.

635
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,030
No,you know what?

636
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,690
You're right.

637
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,550
You're right.

638
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,530
It ge,wors because still have to appear before the new york bar ethics committee

639
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,390
and sit there and squirm while they decide whether or not to have me disbarred.

640
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,360
Okay,20 years,everything that I've worked for?

641
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,770
Worthless.

642
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,380
My perfect conviction record?

643
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,230
Oke.

644
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,160
I didn't have a choice.

645
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,700
No!

646
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,600
No!

647
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,050
Don't kid yourself.

648
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,990
You had a choice.

649
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,750
but you don't have one now.

650
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,930
Andrea,brian.

651
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,440
How's brian jr.This morning?

652
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,290
Yeah,he's great.

653
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,780
The,uh,herbal compresses and jungle twig tea are really doing the trick.

654
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,590
He does actually seem better.

655
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,600
Good,good.

656
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,960
Glad to hear it.

657
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,760
Let's all take a seat.

658
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,950
And how are you both doing today?

659
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,660
Fine.

660
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,800
Is our son okay?

661
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,660
Except for his flu,yes.

662
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,920
Brian jr.Is fine.

663
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,790
His labs came back completely normal.

664
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,920
Is there something else?

665
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,440
As we discussed,I also ran both of your bloods,

666
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,790
and,uh,I have some difficult news.

667
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,720
What's wrong?

668
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,810
Andrea.

669
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,520
you have cancer.

670
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,250
I know.

671
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,680
**********

672
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,890
and my doctor said that if I started chemotherapy that day.

673
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:22,160
if I took his poison,that I'd have a 1-in-3 shot of making it 5 years.

674
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,520
I couldn't live with those odds.

675
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,950
I needed more--more choices and more time.

676
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,740
Wait a minute.

677
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,540
That's why you went to brazil?

678
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,200
yeah.

679
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:42,970
after six months of holistic treatment there,my cancer went into remission.

680
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,030
And I've been disease-free for over a year now.

681
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,270
till today.

682
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,900
So,um,what are you gonna do now?

683
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,450
Brian jr.And I are gonnafly back to sao paulo,and I'm gonna restart treatments.

684
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,580
Sure,why not?

685
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,760
I mean,they seemed to work wonders.

686
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,720
Brian,I know that you don't want brian jr.To leave-- 

687
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,860
andrea,this is about you.

688
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,710
Okay?

689
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,980
Don't be a moron.

690
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
The twigs and tea won't work.

691
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,120
So would you just stay here and let me take care of you?

692
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,270
We need to spend some time apart.

693
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,310
I can't be with you right now.

694
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,980
Nick.

695
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,050
lisa,you lied to me.

696
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,400
You lied to me about kissing jeremy,and then you lied to me about the gallery.

697
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,000
I was going to tell you about that.

698
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,680
I was.

699
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,010
But you didn'T.

700
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,790
And I can't be married to somebody who lies to me.

701
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,260
I get enough of that from the darlings.

702
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,110
I thought we were trying to make things work.

703
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,500
Well,I thought we were,too.

704
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,920
I did.

705
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,550
But they're not.

706
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,140
And we're holding on to this thing like our lives depend on it,

707
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,900
but it's killing us.

708
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,630
Are you leaving me?

709
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,650
I just need to spend some time away froyou,from us.

710
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,700
That's all that this is.

711
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,730
Just for a little while,that's all.

712
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,530
I always wanteus to give kiki this picture-perfect american life.

713
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,990
and now we've got the picture-perfect american problems.

714
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,390
I'm gonna miss you.

715
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,300
Lisa.

716
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,290
I am.

717
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,240
I'm gonna miss you so much.

718
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,310
Lisa,come here.

719
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,610
I'm gonna miss you,too.

720
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,190
I am gonna miss you,too.

721
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,040
here's to this nightmare being lifted,

722
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,380
here's to the dawn-- 

723
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,660
enough about the dawn.To nick.

724
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,600
I never doubted you'd get them to see the truth.

725
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,130
Well,we still don't know the truth.

726
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,040
we do know that you're innocent,letitia.

727
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,210
That's enough for now.

728
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,690
To letitia.

729
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,020
and her innocence.

730
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,620
mom.

731
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,460
What are you doing out here?

732
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,140
I've been looking all over for you.

733
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,490
I'm just breathing.

734
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,610
I feel like all the nastiness that's been hanging over us has lifted.

735
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,070
Do you feel it?

736
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,460
Yeah,it's totally fabu.

737
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,820
Come,dear.

738
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,330
Keep me company.

739
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,580
good job.

740
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,700
with that.

741
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,110
nola woman.

742
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,840
Thanks.

743
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,600
I'M.

744
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,010
I'm glad I could help out.

745
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,320
What's the matter?

746
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,250
I'm in love with her,mom.

747
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,330
I know I'm not supposed to be,but-- oh,my.

748
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,960
That wasn't part of the plan.

749
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,330
Oh,no.

750
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,500
That wasn't part of the plan.

751
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,880
Oh,no.

752
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,650
My poor baby.

753
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,930
Well.

754
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,800
I hope you're happy,mr.Senator-elect.

755
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,790
They forced me to resign.

756
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,080
I had nothing to do with that.

757
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,290
That's between you and the judge and,uh,my brother.

758
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,680
But you're happy about it.

759
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,390
No.

760
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,200
You're a brilliant lawyer,a force of nature,almost.

761
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,330
I can't say I always agree with your tactics or your choice of targets,

762
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,330
but u've been a real credit to the manhattan office.

763
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,410
Good luck.

764
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,710
and you're still here.

765
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,930
I was just wondering.

766
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,950
c?

767
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,050
we've got a few names.

768
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,030
Any of them younger than the woolworth building or not in tripp darling's pocket?

769
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,110
Why do you ask?

770
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,350
Because you're gonna need protection.

771
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,690
A freshman senator is in a very exposed position.

772
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,020
I mean,somebody could dig up all kinds of stuff.

773
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,190
Say,for example,that there's a local police department

774
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,650
covering up a possible arson case in the senator's family home.

775
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,910
Say there's a woman,a woman of mystery,

776
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,630
as in it's a mystery whether she's a man or a woman,

777
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,370
and she could have something to do with the senator's wife's untimely demise.

778
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,690
Would you get to the point?

779
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,920
I want the job.

780
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,810
You want to be my chief of staff?

781
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,940
Yes.

782
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,550
You maliciously prosecute my mother for a crime she didn't commit,

783
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,230
indulge in an inappropriate relationship with my brother,

784
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,990
and then you waltz in here,and you basically blackmail me.

785
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,750
Why the hell would I ever want to make you my chief of staff?

786
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,440
Because you're gonna be so busy fighting for your political life once you get to washington,

787
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,290
that you're gonna need more than a chief of staff.

788
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,410
You're gonna need an attack dog.

789
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,350
I'd be good for you,and you know it.

790
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,210
karen.

791
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,800
What are you dng here?

792
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,410
Don't marry simon.

793
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,300
It's a mistake.

794
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,910
Look,you did your job,smart guy.

795
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,850
You saved the company.

796
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,360
I don't care about the company.

797
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,040
At least,it's not my first concern.

798
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,120
Well,then what is?

799
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,900
You.

800
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,870
And me.

801
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,780
Did something happen with lisa?

802
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,370
I don't know.

803
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,180
yes.

804
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,910
Nick,don't do this to me.

805
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,970
Karen-- don't do this to me.

806
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,690
I moved on.

807
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,000
I made--I made plans.

808
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,970
Your plans,if they include marrying a guy who wants you just

809
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,330
so he can take over your family's company,are insane.

810
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,670
You can't just show up here whenever you want and screw with my head,nick.

812
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,370
I know.

813
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,830
I'm sorry.

814
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,310
I'm sorry,okay?

815
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,540
I just.

816
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,220
I don't want to see you make a huge mistake.

817
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,370
Then step up.

818
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,660
What do you mean?

819
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,710
Don't ask me.

820
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,390
to give up everything for nothing.

821
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,000
Don't ask me to derail my life if you're not gonna derail yours,

822
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,730
because I can't leave simon for an abstraction,nick.

823
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,830
I can only-- I can only leave him for you.

824
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,060
what's it gonna be?

825
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:07,670
I gave you a very simple task and a chance--a promise--

826
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,650
to be a partof something remarkable,

827
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,310
and now,thanks to you,to your lack of control,the project has been crippled.

828
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm sorry.

829
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,040
I made a mistake.

830
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,880
But it wasn't all a waste.

831
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,240
The case isover!

832
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,430
And we both know that the evidence didn't point to her.

833
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,580
Our case was crumbling anyway.

834
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,250
I found another way in.

835
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,780
I'm listening.

836
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,360
I've been invited to go to washington with a certain freshman senator.

837
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,180
Say hello to patrick darling's chief of staff.

838
