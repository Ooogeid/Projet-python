1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,159
Where the hell is he?

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,137
Nick.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,644
What the hell is going on here?

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,738
lt's under control, Nick.

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,085
Nola, put the knife down.

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,715
- lt's a letter opener.
- Jeremy.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,591
Not until he tells me
where my brother is.

8
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,059
- Your brother?
- Yeah, Simon's holding him hostage.

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:38,560
- Nola, listen to me. Just step back.
- You step back, Nick.

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,041
Jeremy, stay out of this.
You were never here.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,009
Look, Nola,
l am gonna have to call the police.

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,980
- No. No police. No hospitals.
- All right.

13
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,779
So, we'll just stand here
until he bleeds to death

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,943
and you're arrested for murder.

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,317
Tell me where he is.

16
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,553
All right, look.
We all want something here.

17
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,150
She wants her brother
and you wanna live.

18
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,991
So tell her where her brother is.

19
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,690
- l will cut your throat.
- Now.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,130
Go to hell.

21
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,863
All right. Fine.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,271
We'll just stand here
and watch you die.

23
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,510
Tell me where he is.

24
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,582
Lausanne. Lausanne, Switzerland.

25
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,054
The address is taped
to the top of the safe. lt's open.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,918
Untie me.

27
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,294
l said we all want something here,
and that includes me.

28
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,265
- l'm listening.
- Here's the deal.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,927
l'll get you medical attention.

30
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,096
l'll save your life,
if you stay out of Karen's.

31
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,969
Karen's?

32
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,172
- She's carrying my baby.
- Yeah, l know.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,838
And l'm asking you to stay away
from both of them, you understand?

34
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,643
l am not the bad guy here.
lf you just untie me...

35
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,651
Just say you understand,
and l will listen to your story later.

36
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,585
The address. l got it.

37
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,693
- l understand. l'll stay away.
- All right.

38
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,660
l'll stay...

39
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,801
You did the right thing,
bringing him here.

40
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,938
We have so many questions
to be answered.

41
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,848
Like how it just so happens
your biggest rival,

42
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,250
the man who used your daughter
to force his way into the company,

43
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,720
is in league with Nola Lyons,

44
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,723
the woman who prosecuted your wife
for murder?

45
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,920
And who now serves
as my son's chief of staff.

46
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,419
Exactly.

47
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,158
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

48
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,893
lf you two would be
so kind as to excuse me,

49
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,833
l need to change the dressing
on Mr. Elder's wound.

50
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,995
- Certainly.
- Yes, of course.

51
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,337
Let's go have a chat
with our little troublemaker, shall we?

52
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,838
You can't keep me here
against my will.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,643
NlCK: No, we can't.

54
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,047
But l can call the air marshals

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,675
and let them know
you're fleeing to Switzerland

56
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,882
just hours after an attempted murder
and have you sent away for 1 0 to 20.

57
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,892
What have you and Mr. Elder
been up to, Ms. Lyons?

58
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,394
- Ask him, lnspector.
- Nola.

59
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,520
l didn't have a choice.

60
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,157
l stopped having a choice
the day Simon took my brother.

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,760
So this was all Simon's idea,
your becoming Patrick's chief of staff?

62
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,292
Yes.

63
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,100
And your prosecution of my wife?

64
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,132
My entire involvement with this
lunatic family was Simon Elder's idea.

65
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,201
l told you, you need to talk to him.

66
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,406
Ms. Lyons, if you've misled us,

67
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,780
if you've misrepresented yourself
in any way,

68
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,614
you'll pay a very steep price.

69
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,713
l told you everything that l know.
Let me go see my brother. Please.

70
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,992
- How'd the inquisition go?
- As expected.

71
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,793
Thankfully, they let me go
before rolling out the rack.

72
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,322
Where are you motoring off to?

73
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,733
Well, l've gotta go pick up my brother
now, and then...

74
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,933
Maximum. Maria packed me, l'm all set.
We can take the jet.

75
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,434
Jeremy, you're not coming with me.
l have to do this on my own.

76
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,814
Okay, but when you come back,

77
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:14,650
you and me are going on a Simon- free,
murder- free, amnesia- free vacation.

78
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,750
l'm not coming back.

79
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,422
l'm taking Justin home to Shanghai,
and l'm staying there.

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,331
You can't just leave.

81
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,094
l can and l am.

82
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,071
l'm sorry.

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,689
Goodbye.

84
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,040
- Any change?
- Vitals are weak, but steady.

85
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,978
Apparently, the letter opener
almost pierced his lung.

86
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,810
Doctor said he could come to
at any time.

87
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,279
Everywhere we turn
there are wolves at the doors.

88
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,652
- We have yet another pressing matter.
- Yeah, what's that?

89
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,026
l got a call from Richard Gorda
over at Random House.

90
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:34,329
He said that Smith and Shepard
have signed a contract

91
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,768
commissioning an unauthorized book
on the Darling family.

92
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,295
lt's likely just gossip, Tripp.
Shouldn't be a problem.

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,140
l'm afraid this is probably
not just gossip.

94
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,044
Richard described it as a tell- all book.

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,448
And the author, in this instance,

96
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:57,289
may well be the first person
actually equipped to do just that.

97
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,984
Who's the author?

98
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,758
Your soon- to- be ex- wife, Lisa.

99
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,606
This is the third in the series.

100
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,079
The first two went
to Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed,

101
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,743
- so this is yours if you want it.
- Great.

102
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,910
Lisa?

103
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,388
l'll be with you in just a moment, okay?

104
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,290
Nick, l was wondering
how long it would take you to show up.

105
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,818
- What are you doing, Lisa?
- l'm working. What are you doing?

106
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,195
Let's not play any games.
l know about the book.

107
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,030
So, what'd you tell the editors
to get them to sign on?

108
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,697
- Must have been juicy.
- Just the truth. How sad is that?

109
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,137
lf this is about money...

110
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,840
Why? You planning on bribing me
out of writing the book?

111
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,349
ls there anything you think
the Darlings' money won't buy?

112
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,816
lf you want to get back at me...

113
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,184
l'm not trying to get back at anybody,
l am taking care of myself.

114
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,586
The standard of living for most women

115
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,250
after a divorce
goes down considerably,

116
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,318
and l won't let that happen to me.
l won't let it happen to Kiki.

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,424
Do you realize what you're becoming?
l'm just curious.

118
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,630
You know what, unless you want to
buy a painting, l think you should go.

119
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,643
Oh, my. You are something else.

120
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,978
Mmm.

121
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,484
That was one hell of a lunch meeting.

122
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:38,452
l told you l could make you happy.
Over and over again.

123
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,658
You've made me more than happy.

124
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,291
You've reminded me that happiness
is something that l can still feel.

125
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,928
- Thank you.
- Well, hold onto that feeling.

126
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:58,608
- Where do you think you're going?
- l'm sorry.

127
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,102
l have a parent- teacher conference
at my kids' school.

128
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,442
Okay.

129
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,782
Can l see you later?

130
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,918
Patrick, this is just sex, remember?
l mean, l have to go home.

131
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,592
l'm not talking about sex.
l want us to have a date.

132
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,829
- A date?
- Yes, we can hang out and talk.

133
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,398
And after we're done,
if you want to go home, you go home.

134
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,932
l just wanna spend time with you.

135
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,381
Well, there's an exhibit
at the Logan Gallery l want to see.

136
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,114
l love the Logan. Let's do it.

137
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,757
Okay. Then it's a date.

138
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,557
How'd it go with my wife?
You two have a good time?

139
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,598
- When?
- Last night.

140
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,336
l know she had a good time.

141
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,504
She was still gushing when l saw her
at breakfast this morning.

142
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,413
Yeah, she had some fun.

143
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,114
What's the matter, Senator?

144
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,449
You think just because
my shoes match my belt

145
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,581
that l can't appreciate my own wife
as a woman?

146
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,215
Come on. You can say it.

147
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,791
Say, ''Congressman,
your wife is a fine piece of...''

148
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,458
ls it all right
if we don't talk about this right here?

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,661
However you want to play it.

150
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,402
Look, l gotta go.
Sorry to cut this short. l'm running late.

151
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,501
No worries. But, you know,

152
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,206
we never did talk
all the details of your biofuel project.

153
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,339
What do you say
we have dinner tonight?

154
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,147
Sorry, can't. Booked. Some other time.

155
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,916
- Some other time soon, Senator.
- Definitely.

156
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,355
- Brian?
- l'm in the kitchen, Mom.

157
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,367
- And the kitchen would be...
- lt's here, Mom.

158
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,202
Oh, my. This is the kitchen? Really?

159
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,779
- Oh, well, it's...
- A dump.

160
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,547
Yeah, l was going to say
it's sort of charmingly intime.

161
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,988
lt's breakfast cereal.

162
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,358
The little brat, Kiki,
scatters it all around like land mines.

163
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,598
Yeah, and don't ask me what that is.

164
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:39,731
l think it's what failed hope smells like,
with a dash of lowered expectations.

165
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,876
l'd open the window, but then we'd let
the sounds of the third world in.

166
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,475
So, how's Andrea?

167
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:00,124
Well, she's not quite ready
to welcome you back.

168
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,123
How am l gonna stick this out?

169
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:11,069
l mean, one week is fine, but after that
it just becomes a five- star sty.

170
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:20,679
Well, we could spruce it up a bit.
l have some ideas.

171
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,423
l have something to give you.

172
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,088
- What are you doing?
- Nola Lyons.

173
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,828
Don't say those next four words.

174
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,563
Will you marry me?

175
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,073
l love you.

176
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,178
Come on, let's do it. All of it.

177
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,646
The white picket fence,
the mixed- breed spawn.

178
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,722
l don't know how to barbecue,
but l could learn.

179
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:13,393
Jeremy, l have spent the last five years
trying to reunite my family.

180
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,459
l can be a part of your family, too.
Bring me along to the reunion. l'll pay.

181
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,561
No.

182
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,004
l love you. l do.

183
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,610
But l have to leave. This life isn't real.

184
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,639
But l'm real. We're real.

185
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,346
Okay, granted,
we started out a little fake,

186
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,253
but we turned the corner
somewhere along the way.

187
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,722
We got real.

188
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,091
Just let me go.

189
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,531
Please.

190
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,625
He looks so peaceful, doesn't he?

191
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,622
Maybe he's dead.

192
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,633
A girl can dream, can't she?
Hey, way to go.

193
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,661
Karen.

194
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,729
You said you would keep Simon away
from me and the baby,

195
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,934
and now he lives here.

196
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,203
Come on, Karen.

197
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,803
l agreed to bring him here,
saved his life, essentially,

198
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,212
to get a promise from him
to leave you and the baby alone.

199
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,045
And you believed him?

200
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,611
This is one time that Simon Elder
is gonna live up to his word, l promise.

201
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,518
Look, Karen,
eventually the guy's gonna want

202
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,492
to have contact with his child,
but as of right now,

203
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,222
he is out of the picture, l promise.

204
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,825
Okay.

205
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,801
- Good, because this baby...
- Yeah?

206
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,205
- ...l kind of love it.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

207
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,472
- Mr. George? Mr. Elder's awake.
- Thank you.

208
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,780
Everything is gonna be okay. Promise.

209
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,155
- Where am l?
- You're at the lmperial.

210
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,294
Nicely played.

211
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,170
How long have l been out?

212
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,071
Long enough
for me to do a little research.

213
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,210
Jeremy told me how you
were gonna fake your own death.

214
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,611
Said you were planning a getaway.
Why?

215
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,606
- Why what, precisely?
- Why the need to disappear?

216
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,846
Why Nola? Why her brother?
Why the Darlings?

217
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,720
You can start wherever you like.

218
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,951
Look, you don't want to tell me,
l'm sure the police will listen.

219
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,552
Nick, l did. l told you.

220
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,056
l'm not the bad guy here.

221
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,066
Yeah, you keep saying that, Simon,
but you're not telling me who is.

222
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,229
All right. l'll tell you.

223
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,138
- Simon.
- Now, what is this new invention?

224
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,747
lt is a fuel.
Just the seed of an idea at this point.

225
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,342
- A prototype.
- Right.

226
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,652
l'm still seeking economical means
of production.

227
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,090
But in the meantime, here it is.

228
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,028
Look, it is completely organic. Watch.

229
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,160
Non- toxic.

230
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,192
And it works in any
traditional internal combustion engine

231
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,400
with a little minor alteration.

232
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,275
- That is amazing.
- Yeah.

233
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,174
There she is, my little girl.

234
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,717
Hey, Justin. What do you have there?

235
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,718
Wow.

236
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,960
Nola, this is Simon,
one of my old students from Moscow.

237
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,836
Nola is an attorney in New York,
just like you, Simon.

238
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,899
- She's going straight to the top.
- Well, we'll see about that.

239
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,743
lt's a shame your mother
did not live to see this day.

240
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,409
Well, l've heard a lot about you,
Mr. Elder. You're my father's star pupil.

241
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,976
Oh, well, whatever he says,
don't believe him.

242
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,284
This man is not to be trusted.

243
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,490
Excuse me.

244
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,425
- What's happening?
- l don't know.

245
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,833
- Nick, get the doctor. Please.
- Simon?

246
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,632
What's going on?

247
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,333
He was fine, he was talking,
and then all of a sudden...

248
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,001
Get a syringe and an oxygen bag.

249
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,067
- Doctor, what's going on?
- His lungs collapsed.

250
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,510
How serious is that?

251
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,107
Look, l need you to leave and let me
do my job or this man is gonna die.

252
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,357
Look at you. Creep- wad.

253
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,895
She should've killed you
when she had the chance.

254
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,660
l wish she had.

255
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,900
You could kill him right now
if you want.

256
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,170
- What?
- He almost crashed three hours ago.

257
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,074
The doctor had to come in
and stabilize him.

258
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,478
lf he flat- lined now,
no one would think twice.

259
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,643
This is the morphine drip.
All you do is this.

260
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,253
- What the hell are you doing?
- Give him five minutes,

261
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,919
and he'll sink like the Titanic.

262
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,121
Just stop it. Stop that right now.

263
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,596
- Put that back!
- You said you hated him.

264
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,191
All right. All right. Are you happy?

265
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,564
l can't believe you just did that.

266
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,866
Look, it's okay.
lt's not morphine, it's saline.

267
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,635
lt's harmless. l was joking.

268
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,641
l'm sorry. You seemed sad.

269
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,510
You looked like you could use
a little entertainment.

270
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:07,679
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome.

271
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,948
And if you want
some more entertainment later,

272
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,925
my shift ends at 1 0:00.

273
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,795
l like his more mature works,

274
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,965
when you get the feeling he wasn't
trying to impress anybody anymore.

275
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,974
He was just doing it for himself.

276
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:34,342
- You really know your stuff, Pat.
- l know what l like.

277
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,778
Nice thing
about growing up with money

278
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,750
is you get to spend your life around
a lot of beautiful things.

279
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,379
- Thanks for coming out like this.
- l'm glad l did.

280
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,024
It's not good.

281
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,867
Someone from the publishers
of Lisa's upcoming expose

282
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,840
has leaked a bit of her quote- unquote
''insider content.''

283
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,039
- Which includes what exactly?
- Details of Patrick's marriage.

284
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,513
His affair. Letitia's trial.

285
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,952
Her payment of money to your mother.
Karen and Simon.

286
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,011
l know.

287
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,082
lt's very disappointing,

288
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:23,060
but l'd like you to get hold of
the family's public- relations person,

289
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,119
Rebecca Colfax...

290
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,358
- No, Tripp, l'll handle it.
- No, Nick.

291
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,494
This is not press releases
and newspaper interviews.

292
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,060
We're gonna need people
on television.

293
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,129
Even so, l think it's best if l handle it.

294
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,574
l want that book neutralized,
but l don't want Lisa attacked,

295
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,406
so l'll do it.

296
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,606
Okay.

297
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,117
Nick George.

298
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,517
l'll be right there.

299
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,522
He's awake.

300
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,322
You okay now?

301
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,258
Nick George cares.

302
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,862
The only reason l care
is because you have a story to finish.

303
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,395
Nola's father had just shown you
his prototype for the biofuel

304
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,965
- you claim to have invented.
- Right.

305
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,308
So, how did you wind up taking
the credit and the money for that?

306
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:19,716
Well, Shien's luck took a bad turn.

307
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,448
- You must be very proud.
- l am.

308
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,050
But even more so, Simon, l think,

309
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:32,223
with your prominence in the
world marketplace and my invention...

310
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,995
What are you saying?

311
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:40,100
lf you are ready to sign,
l am ready to share this with you.

312
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,540
Fifty- fifty.

313
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,706
That sounds like a risk worth taking.

314
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,248
Tsung Shien Chun?

315
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,642
What's going on here?

316
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,157
Simon, l don't know what this is about,
but you have to help me.

317
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,257
No, l'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
We'll figure it out.

318
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,528
Go to my son, please?
See if he's okay? Please?

319
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,435
l will. Don't worry.
l'll take care of everything.

320
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,615
NlCK: So, you set him up

321
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,681
and conveniently forgot
to mention him ever again.

322
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,249
Look, Nick, if l had to do it
all over again,

323
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,492
l would have left those vials
on the table and never looked back.

324
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,056
That is where all my trouble began.

325
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,799
What does that mean?

326
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,338
So, you could give him his
last dose of antibiotics in 40 minutes.

327
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,466
Okay.

328
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,569
Excuse us.
We need to give Mr. Elder his bath.

329
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,914
- We'll finish this later.
- You know where to find me.

330
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,402
Alcohol's a depressant, Chief.
Step away from the bottle.

331
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,773
ls that your professional opinion?

332
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,609
Nope. lt's personal,
empirical and anecdotal.

333
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,915
Gathered from my many years
of hard living.

334
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,749
- You need a change of scenery.
- l wouldn't know where to go.

335
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,492
l used to.
Back when l was Jeremy Darling.

336
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,262
But then my mother got arrested
for murder and everything went to hell.

337
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:53,204
l fell in love, hit my head,
faked amnesia, and here l am.

338
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,468
Drinking your way back to amnesia.

339
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,440
l'll call you when l get there.

340
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,848
What?

341
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,082
When you're ready to leave
this pity party of yours, l have an idea.

342
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,059
- Viva Las Vegas!
- Viva Las Vegas!

343
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,768
To great ideas!

344
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,377
What you reading?

345
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:45,379
A book about,
you know, giving birth, with pictures.

346
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,819
- Hey.
- Hey.

347
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,261
l wanna do it.

348
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,889
Okay. Get in.

349
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,765
No, Karen. You and me, together.

350
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,301
- And the baby?
- And the baby. All of us.

351
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,040
Together.

352
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,508
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

353
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
lt's just
when l think about all the surprises

354
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,383
we've gotten from all the people
we thought we knew...

355
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,817
- Like your ex.
- And yours.

356
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,082
- We can pick them, can't we?
- Yeah, we sure can.

357
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,892
But we know everything
about each other.

358
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,090
The good, the bad, the ugly.

359
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:34,071
And l'm not just okay with who you are,
l love who you are.

360
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,242
lt's just...
From the first day that l saw you

361
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,603
in your little
orange one- piece bathing suit

362
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,411
and your bucket of frogs
and your shovel...

363
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,685
Man.

364
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,115
l just knew you were the girl for me.

365
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,548
l loved that one- piece bathing suit.

366
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,855
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

367
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,918
Yeah.

368
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,131
So, you and me. What do you think?

369
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,826
l think it's about time.

370
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,686
- Brian?
- l'm in the bathroom!

371
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:31,592
Or what has historically been
the bathroom.

372
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,295
- What is it now?
- lt's gonna be a sauna.

373
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,562
Sauna?

374
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,034
Yeah, the kitchen's gonna
become the bathroom,

375
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,200
and Kiki's room's gonna
become the kitchen.

376
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,438
- Are you insane?
- No, no.

377
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,142
Kiki's gonna sleep in this little loft

378
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,173
that we're gonna build
above the wine locker.

379
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,415
- Who said you could do this?
- No, look... Listen.

380
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,581
Hey, look,
if the landlord's got a problem with it,

381
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,922
we just buy the building.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,087
No, l'm the one
with the problem, Brian. Me.

383
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,097
- Yeah, obviously.
- Hey.

384
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,194
You're my guest.

385
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,693
So why don't you just be
a gracious host and make way?

386
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,474
l mean, come on,
we're both miserable here.

387
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,635
l'm just trying to do something about it.

388
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,338
Put it all back.

389
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,773
Now.

390
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,218
A moment of your time, Senator?

391
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,163
- What can l do for you, Congressman?
- This has got to stop. Right now.

392
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,688
Your little affair with my wife.

393
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,133
Do you understand me, Senator?

394
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,669
l'm still trying to get over the fact
that you followed us to the gallery.

395
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,641
How did you know?

396
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,610
Called your office.
Told them it was urgent.

397
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,242
- Am l missing something here?
- We had a deal. The deal was simple.

398
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,915
You're supposed to have sex
with my wife and only sex.

399
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,753
But from what l saw,

400
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,760
the two of you seemed
to have feelings for one another.

401
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,763
Both of you. And l'll not stand for that.

402
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,732
Well, you may very well have to,

403
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:20,329
because l like her,
and you, my friend, are gay.

404
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,805
l mean, it's not like
you can call this a marriage.

405
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:28,336
No. Stop it. Stop it right now.
Don't go there.

406
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,281
lnstead, why don't you
take a look at that?

407
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,880
Go on.

408
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,064
Dana and me at the hotel.

409
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,656
lt's a little insurance policy, Senator.

410
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,999
You see, whenever my wife
gets together with someone

411
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:56,804
to have her needs met,
l take a couple of pictures,

412
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,103
make sure things don't get out of hand,

413
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:02,477
because men have a tendency,
a nasty, nasty tendency, to fall for her.

414
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:06,108
What do you want, Charles?

415
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,587
l want you to stay away from my wife.

416
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,586
l offered you friendship, Patrick.

417
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:16,287
l offered you... How can l put this?
Unprecedented access.

418
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,653
But you, you got hungry.

419
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,660
And you forgot your manners.

420
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,402
lt's over, Senator.

421
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,603
Right.

422
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,245
Please welcome Mr. Nick George,

423
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,913
personal legal counsel
to the Darling family.

424
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,320
- Nice to have you with us, Mr. George.
- Thanks for having me.

425
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:49,884
First, tell us, do the leaks coming out
about the Darling tell- all

426
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,156
contain any truth?

427
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,222
l mean, are the Darlings
as out of control as we've heard?

428
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,062
No, no, of course not.

429
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,002
lt may be hard to believe,
but they're really a family like any other,

430
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,700
using the resources they have
to try to enjoy life,

431
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,833
make the world a better place.

432
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,469
So, the author's claims
that there is trouble...

433
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,742
Before we grace
the author's claims with any attention,

434
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,908
let's consider
that the author's motivation

435
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,578
included a six- figure cash advance
to peddle this trash.

436
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,782
All right, now the author,
you mean your ex- wife?

437
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,380
Yes, that's correct, Bob.

438
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,723
But l'm not really interested in pursuing
that particular thread of the story.

439
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,527
You might not be, but the people
of New York are very interested

440
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:30,591
in the way that your family drama
has turned into tabloid fodder,

441
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,967
which is why
we have a surprise guest today.

442
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,062
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

443
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,836
Someone who is ready to share some
more juicy details about this first family.

444
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,709
So, let's bring her in.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

445
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,646
Mr. George's ex- wife
and the author of the book in question,

446
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,376
Mrs. Lisa George.

447
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,211
- Hi.
- Hello.

448
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,221
- Hi.
- Thank you.

449
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,264
Now, before we went to break,

450
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,459
there was a point
you wanted to clear up, Mr. George?

451
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,264
Yes, l just wanted
to remind your audience that,

452
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,171
despite Lisa's accusations,
the Darlings, as a family,

453
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,335
have done an enormous amount
of good for this country.

454
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,710
They're not perfect. They're human.
Just like you and me.

455
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,011
Not exactly like you and me.

456
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,677
l mean,
most people don't find ourselves

457
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,050
so entitled as to run for public office

458
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,884
while blatantly cheating on our wives.

459
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,756
Or throwing parties
that close down the Brooklyn Bridge.

460
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,192
Well, that was a charity event,
for your information,

461
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,856
the proceeds of which
exceeded over $2 million.

462
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,024
Charity event? lt was a birthday party.

463
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,795
And l'm sure that the commuters
trying to get home

464
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,099
to their families that night
were very impressed.

465
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,970
Yeah, you know,
isn't this a little hypocritical?

466
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,497
Seeing as how you have a business
relationship with one of the Darlings?

467
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,204
Jeremy Darling is an investor
in her art gallery.

468
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,769
l bought him out
when l got my advance,

469
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,145
but while we're on the subject
of credibility,

470
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,674
don't you think it's a little difficult
to trust a man defending the Darlings,

471
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,552
when he's, in fact,
in love with one of them?

472
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:02,185
l forgot to mention that Nick is currently
in a relationship with Karen Darling.

473
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,695
Really? What a tangled web.

474
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,026
l know.

475
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,255
Don't worry,
l won't give out the sordid details now,

476
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,927
but it will all be in the book.

477
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,027
All right, hold it right there.

478
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,594
With that bombshell,
we're gonna take a break.

479
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,731
We'll be back in 90 seconds.

480
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,507
Nice work.

481
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,612
Two- minute segment
and you managed to humiliate yourself

482
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,480
and your daughter
in front of the entire city.

483
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,381
You must be so proud.

484
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,420
- You have a lot of great ideas.
- Thank you.

485
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,994
l'm really glad we came. l mean...

486
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,063
- You know what l mean.
- Yeah.

487
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,138
l actually forgot about her for a minute.

488
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,275
What?

489
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,246
Well, since you love
my ideas so much...

490
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,414
Yeah?

491
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:11,427
...l have another one.
lt's kind of crazy, but you might like it.

492
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,902
Come in.

493
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,770
Hey, look who it is.

494
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,377
l watched the throw- down with the wife.

495
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:32,748
Now, l gotta say, l'm not one
for daytime television, but that was hot.

496
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,481
Yeah, well,
l'm not here to talk about me.

497
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,421
Right. Right.

498
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,187
So, you stole the biofuel
from Nola's father and then what?

499
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,425
He was arrested? Arrested for what?

500
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,263
Your father's being charged
with sedition.

501
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,566
Some editorial he wrote in which he
denounced the Chinese government,

502
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,798
or appeared to do so.

503
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,204
l never heard a thing about that.

504
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,901
Yeah, well,
l don't have all the details right now,

505
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,705
and they're unimportant at this point.

506
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,006
Where's my brother?

507
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,912
- l have him.
- What do you mean, you have him?

508
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,382
- l took him to a safe place.
- Where?

509
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,215
Listen, you're gonna have to trust me.

510
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:14,452
From now on, l'll be the gateway for all
contact between you and your brother.

511
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:20,124
And in exchange for his safety,
l'll get your help, your cooperation.

512
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,659
You're holding him hostage?

513
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,431
Since you've become assistant DA,

514
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:32,000
you're in a unique position
to help me in ways l can't help myself.

515
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,568
Now, by the way,
if you tell anyone about this,

516
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,670
you'll never see him again.

517
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,011
That means no police,
no private investigators, nothing.

518
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,950
Do you understand that?
But if you cooperate,

519
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:48,826
l'll get your father released from prison,
and in time, you'll see your brother.

520
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,988
So, that's how you forced Nola

521
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,124
to prosecute Letitia Darling
for a crime she didn't commit?

522
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,827
- Essentially.
- Why?

523
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,695
Come.

524
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,739
Hi. Nick, can we
talk for a minute, please?

525
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,138
Please, go ahead.

526
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,805
- We're not done here.
- l'm well aware.

527
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,580
Lisa, what are you doing here?
ls Kiki all right?

528
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,955
Kiki's fine. lt's about us.

529
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,620
Well, l don't want to talk about us.
There's no us anymore to talk about.

530
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,152
Nick, please, just listen to me.

531
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,291
l couldn't believe what that turned into
today at the studio.

532
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,858
Well, Lisa, you made that happen.

533
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,337
You made the book deal.
You agreed to appear on the show.

534
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,863
That's... Now, don't get dainty
this late in the game.

535
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,341
You know me.

536
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,209
That's not who l was when we met.
lt's not who l want to be.

537
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,111
Well, then stop being it.

538
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,107
Start taking some responsibility
for what happened between us.

539
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,881
- l am.
- Lisa.

540
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,786
l'm going to. Nick.

541
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,252
We can do this.

542
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,557
- We can start over. We can do this.
- Lise.

543
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,554
Don't you think it's worth a try,
for Kiki, if nothing else?

544
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,028
Lisa.

545
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,370
- lt's too late.
- Don't say that.

546
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,038
- lt is, Lisa. l'm sorry.
- Just think about it.

547
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,513
Think about what we had
before the Darlings.

548
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,815
We had such a good thing.

549
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,081
l know.

550
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:33,394
Just go back there for one minute.
Go back.

551
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,525
Lise. Lise.

552
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,196
- Karen.
- No, no, no, you're...

553
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,795
- Karen, wait a minute.
- You're obviously in the middle

554
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,567
of something
very complicated right now.

555
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,268
And so...

556
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,969
lt's not complicated.
Karen, you don't understand.

557
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,034
l don't need to understand, Nick.

558
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,104
That's the fun part.
l just don't need to understand.

559
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,342
Karen!

560
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,983
Karen. Karen?
Can somebody get a doctor?

561
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,857
- Hey.
- Hey.

562
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,798
How you feeling?

563
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,304
A little empty,
but aside from that, l'm right as rain.

564
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,244
- l'm sorry.
- lt's not your fault.

565
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,614
l should have looked
where l was going,

566
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,414
you know, in general.

567
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:33,515
Well, just so you know,
the doctor said you can try again soon

568
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,492
to get pregnant, if you want to.

569
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,426
lf l want to.

570
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,329
Okay, well, l guess l'll have to
see how l feel about that.

571
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,925
- l'd be willing to try.
- With Lisa?

572
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,300
No, with you when you're ready.

573
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,173
- How does Lisa feel about that?
- Doesn't matter.

574
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,670
Look, Karen,
she's always going to be Kiki's mom,

575
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,943
she's always gonna be in my life,

576
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,744
but l wanna be with you.

577
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,652
- For keeps?
- For keeps.

578
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,785
Wow.

579
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,420
Our long national nightmare is over.

580
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,105
Why did you call?

581
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,906
l thought you
already spoke with Charles.

582
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,871
Do you love him, Dana?

583
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,916
Just tell me, Dana, do you love him?

584
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,619
He's my husband.
We have an arrangement.

585
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,678
lt's been working.

586
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,213
But when l asked you to come here,
behind his back, you said yes.

587
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,885
So, what's the truth?

588
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,791
Patrick.

589
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,764
Look, l need to know
if you think that there's a chance

590
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:51,962
that you and l could ever
have something real.

591
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,169
More than just sex?

592
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,640
More than just sex.

593
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,342
Yes.

594
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,679
- That's all l need to know.
- Patrick, what are you going to do?

595
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,121
Charles can be dangerous.
Don't underestimate him.

596
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,318
Don't underestimate me.

597
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,123
You deserve to be with a man
who wants you, all of you.

598
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,499
This little arrangement the two of you
had might have worked for a while,

599
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,527
but l'm going to make sure
that he understands one thing,

600
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,301
that there's gonna
be a new arrangement.

601
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,011
Jeremy!

602
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,615
- Nola. What are you doing here?
- Hi.

603
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,118
l found my brother in Lausanne

604
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,023
and then my father took him back
to Shanghai with him.

605
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,221
- And l just...
- Yeah?

606
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,963
l love you
and l don't want to be without you.

607
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,226
l can't.

608
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,936
Okay. This is...

609
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,829
This is interesting.

610
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,240
Listen, l want to marry you.

611
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:11,011
l am ready
to become Mrs. Jeremy Darling.

612
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:21,382
There's just one small,
very small problem.

613
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,887
Yeah?

614
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,725
l kind of already got married.

615
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,993
He's a great catch, isn't he?

616
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,831
Are you serious?

617
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,044
- Hey, welcome home.
- Hey.

618
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,016
Well, l see everything
is back to normal.

619
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,888
Before you get your boxers in a twist,
just give it a second.

620
00:39:55,593 --> 00:40:00,030
- That's a rug. People walk on it.
- Really?

621
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,531
- What's all that?
- lt's gold leaf.

622
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,809
lt's nice.

623
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,442
- Did you have a rough day?
- You have no idea.

624
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,973
Well, then.

625
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,550
What the hell is that thing?

626
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,455
lt's an ltalian wine- dispensing system
for drunks.

627
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,388
Fancy.

628
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,901
- A little change is good, huh?
- lt's not entirely bad.

629
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,531
Thanks.

630
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,567
- Don't thank me. Thank Letitia.
- Letitia?

631
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,375
Yeah, this was all her idea.

632
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,213
Letitia.

633
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,789
Wake up.

634
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,053
What's going on?

635
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,222
There's still one question
you haven't answered.

636
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,630
What?

637
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,965
Of all the things
that you forced Nola to do,

638
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,664
why did you have her
prosecute Letitia?

639
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,997
lf you wanted to
take down the Darlings,

640
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,737
Tripp would have been
a much more effective target.

641
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,371
Yeah, that's exactly what l thought.

642
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,777
Nick, l keep telling you,
l'm not the bad guy.

643
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,843
You've confessed to kidnapping,
extortion, conspiracy to murder,

644
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,082
how are you not the bad guy?

645
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:40,953
Your father,
digging up dirt on me for Tripp,

646
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:45,128
found out l stole the biofuel,
among other things.

647
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,329
He never stopped holding that
over my head.

648
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,102
He was the one
who wanted me to punish Letitia.

649
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,575
But why?

650
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,781
By the time Letitia had been arrested,
he was...

651
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:01,944
Dead?

652
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,053
Afraid not.

653
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,087
What are you saying?

654
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:15,491
- That my father is alive?
- Alive and well,

655
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,467
and still one hell of a bastard.
