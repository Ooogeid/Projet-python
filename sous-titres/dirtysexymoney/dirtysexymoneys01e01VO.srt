1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,850
The "Love of Money" is
the "Root of all Evil".

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
That's what they say, anyway.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,790
Money makes everything go wrong.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,360
That's certainly what I always thought.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,840
When I was a kid, my dad worked
for the richest family in New York City
- the Darlings.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,840
It's my job, Clare.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,250
If they' gonna buy an entire island, I
have to at least see it first.

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,680
Yeah, right, and I get
to sit here and rot!

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,330
You want me to quit?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,210
Do you want me to quit?
I quit. Fine.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,700
No, Devlin, take care of the Darlings,

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,520
Because obviously they
need you more than we do.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,130
Working for the Darlings
was hard on my dad,

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,270
but it was even harder on my mom.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,790
At some point,
you’ll come to your senses

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,770
I've already come to my
senses, Dutch. I'm not coming back.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,450
Nicky... it's not your fault.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,860
Mommy just has to go.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,570
Good-bye, sweetheart.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,500
And it was hard for me, too, as I grew
up in the shadow of my father...

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,390
and the immensely wealthy
family he worked for.

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,870
Nicky, you wait out here, all right?

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,000
I have to take care of a few things, and I'll
be back in ten minutes, then we'll go home.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,770
- Okay?
- Okay.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,250
I hate you.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,770
I love you.

27
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,720
And so I promised myself
that when I grew up,

28
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,070
I would never be anything like my dad,

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,490
and I would never work for the darlings.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,850
- Your dad called.
- Great. Who else?

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,860
Uh, let them eat-food-bake,
and Judge Campbell called...
um, completely off-the-record as usual.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,420
Yeah? What does she have to say?

33
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,420
Well, legally speaking, the sisters of
Eternal mercy can keep their little playground...

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,035
oh, that's good.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,110
If they can find a
Million dollars to buy it.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,340
- A million?
- Yep.

37
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,570
Oh, god. Why does the world
have to be so miserable?

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,230
- That coffee's from yesterday.
- oh! Daisy!

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,570
And your dad called...

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
- yeah, you told me that already.
- Again.

41
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,330
He really wants to have lunch next week.

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,170
Well, I'm not gonna be able to do that.

43
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,340
Nick, it's been over two
months since you talked to him.

44
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,940
Look, daisy, just call him and tell him
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy, I really am.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,880
And then two weeks ago, my father's
plane crashed and everything changed.

46
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,330
Is everyone here for grandpa's funeral?

47
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,900
yeah, they sure are.

48
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,120
It's weird. Yeah, it is.

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,810
excuse me.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,750
Excuse me, officer?

51
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,530
Officer, can we, uh, can
we get through here?

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,110
I'm sorry, who are you... Justin Timberlake
or k-fed? l’ve heard 'em all today.

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,150
No, it's my father's funeral. Oh.

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,490
It's everybody's father's funeral today.

55
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,160
you've gotta be kidding me.

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,390
God, here they come.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,460
Daddy, who? Who is it?

58
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,290
It's grandpa's friends, honey.

59
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,460
It's the darlings.

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Tripp!

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,830
Oh, my god, I wanna die.

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,700
Tish, you can do this, sweetheart.

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,930
hey, Freddy! Freddy!

64
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,290
How's it feel to leave the
PGA to be Mr. Karen Darling?

65
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,630
Don't answer them, baby.
They're idiots.

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,870
Marry me, Karen!

67
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,980
when will you formally announce
your candidacy for the senate?

68
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,480
Please, folks, no
politics. It's a sad day.

69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,580
Sad day for everybody.

70
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,570
Juliet!

71
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,960
Juliet!

72
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,800
Juliet, over here!

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,580
How are rehearsals going
for "Wait until dark"?

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,770
Oh, they're going really good.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,780
...I never want to be blind, but
playing blind is really fun!

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,660
- Good to see ya.
- Yeah!

77
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,790
Well, the rumor is you can't act at all.

78
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,280
well, you’re poor!

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,720
Juliet, is it true you're
designing a new line of lingerie?

80
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,390
When did you get back from tahiti?

81
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,070
Uh, 30 minutes and 6
double espressos ago.

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,590
Kelly Slater says hi.

83
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,620
- Kelly.
- Hi!

84
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,710
what's your reaction to the
stories about you in the tabloids?

85
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,110
Listen, I spend enough of my time
dealing with reputable media, okay?

86
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,420
Patrick, were you close
with Devlin George?

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,730
Are you kidding me? He taught me
how to ride my bike and fly-fish.

88
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,750
He helped me pass the New York bar.

89
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,620
He was so much more
than just our lawyer.

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,830
He was like a father to us.

91
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,520
Patrick.

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,050
If you'll excuse me.

93
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,400
Nick, what are you doing out here?

94
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,660
Just, you know, watching the parade.

95
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,050
Officer, he's with us.

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,490
Thanks. Special.

97
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,380
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

98
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm very sorry.

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,270
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

100
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,820
I'm so sorry for your loss.

101
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,810
Thank you.

102
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,120
And even if your dad did insert himself
a little too much into our family.

103
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,270
But he felt that's
what his job was, right?

104
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,030
To insinuate himself into everything, no?

105
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,670
So that he could suck as much
money out of us as possible?

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,460
You know, Brian. Kiki's right here.

107
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,010
I'm sorry, Nick. You're right.
Let's not fight. I hate you.

109
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm sorry, Grandpa's dead.

110
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,270
Please, god, tell me we'll never
have to see these people ever again.

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,980
Done.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,410
Dirty Sex
Money Season 1 Episode 1

113
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,720
Why are you having a
drink with Tripp Darling?

114
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,340
You told me we'd never have
to see these people again.

115
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,190
Well, he wants to start this
charitable fund in dad's name.

116
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm gonna do the paperwork
for him, and then we're done.

117
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,170
Okay?

118
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,010
I promise.

119
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,650
Okay.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,320
Don't turn into a pumpkin.

121
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,870
I'm not gonna turn into anything.

122
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,220
why the hell is Nick George coming over?

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
This is the worst idea in the
history of the western world.

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,950
Well, I think that's a
little melodramatic, Brian.

125
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,000
Nick George should not be our
family lawyer, pure and simple.

126
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,830
It's what dad wants, Brian.

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,500
yeah.

128
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,620
And besides, Nick grew up with us.

129
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,480
No, Nick didn't grow up with us, pat.

130
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,120
He was the offspring of an employee.

131
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,840
Maybe we should let Maria’s little
panchito manage your campaign.

132
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,130
- Brian, your father feels that-
- we all know how dad feels.

133
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,710
He loves Nick George, but he's wrong.

134
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,640
Since when is loving someone ever wrong?

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Nick's wet. He's the
brother I always wanted.

136
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
Hey... Ignatz.

137
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,190
Other... other brother.
Other brother.

138
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,360
Jeremy, how many times do I have to
tell you? Get Midas off the couch.

139
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,220
Maria, get Midas off the couch.

140
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,960
What I don't understand is why
we don't just let the market work.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,910
The market?

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,740
Freddy, you’re not a part of this
family yet, so just stay out of it.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,040
what he's saying is that we should
shop around, which I think is a huge
mistake, by the way.

144
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,330
Look, your father and I have
had an extensive conversation...

145
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,190
but there are better
lawyers than Nick George

146
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,430
who would do a lot more
for us for a lot less money,

147
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,620
and who wouldn't bring this massive
attitude of entitlement to the table.

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,460
Nick has never felt entitled to anything.

149
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,580
Karen, you’re drunk and in love
with him, so shut the hell up.

150
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,250
Hey! I have had a scotch, okay? One.

151
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,780
Nick George is just like his dad.

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,980
He's a glorified parasite.

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,380
I want a fresh start as much as anybody.

154
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,440
But nick is your father's choice.

155
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,090
And that's that.

156
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,250
Is that the '90? Give that a try.

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,090
It's a little vineyard we
just bought in Bordeaux.

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,260
It's amazing.

159
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,610
You still take an interest?

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,430
I do. I don't get to taste things this
too often. Not in my line of work, you know?

161
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeah, well... maybe your line
of work is about to change, huh?

162
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,790
What do you mean by that?

163
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,440
I need your help, Nicky.

164
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,120
With what?

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,920
With the family.

166
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,650
You know, daily affairs.

167
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,200
Since your dad's gone... whew... the
paperwork alone's eating me alive.

168
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,390
Tripp, certainly there are better equipped
lawyers than me to deal with the family affairs.

169
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,840
Yeah, I know.

170
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,960
And I contemplated bringing some
hotshot in to take the reins.

171
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,650
No one seems right.

172
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,040
I considered Johnnie Cochran.

173
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,040
- He's dead, Tripp.
- Yeah, I know. I found out.

174
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,790
he was a bit of a grandstander anyway.

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,910
Loudmouth.

176
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,560
I spoke with bill.

177
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,170
- Bill Clinton?
- Uh-huh.

178
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,280
You asked Bill Clinton if he
wanted to represent the family?

179
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,890
Took my shot.

180
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,510
I mean, you know me, Nicky.

181
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,650
The thing is, when I really
stopped and thought about it...

182
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,320
you're the guy.

183
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, god.

184
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,750
You know us, Nicky. You're the guy.

185
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm flattered, Tripp, but...

186
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,320
what Patrick said at the
funeral the other day is true.

187
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,250
I really did have to share dad with you
guys when I was growing up, and I didn't like it.

188
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,950
I won't do that to my wife, and I
certainly won't do that to my daughter.

189
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,590
- You want to be a good dad.
- I do.

190
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,260
So did Dutch, and look at you, Nicky.

191
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,250
You're a successful lawyer.

192
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,970
You're a family man.

193
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,740
And best of all, you’ve
got a moral center.

194
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,130
So you tell me who did wrong.

195
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,570
If I had one kid like you, l’d be lucky.

196
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,760
I don’t.

197
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,340
Tripp, I just don't
think it's a good fit.

198
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,530
I'm gonna put my nuts on the table.

199
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,370
Okay, if you have to.

200
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,020
I'll give you $5 million a
year... on top of what I pay you...

201
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,490
to do all your good works around
town, all your little charitable projects.

202
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,500
You... you keep your practice, keep
everybody on salary, keep everything as is.

203
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,770
Why would you do that?

204
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,860
Because... I miss your dad.

205
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,100
I miss having that solid citizen by
my side to tell me which way is up.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,990
And I trust ya.

207
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,940
I'd have to do it my own way.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Hey, what man wouldn't?

209
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,930
I'd have to keep regular hours.

210
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,110
You keep whatever hours you want.

211
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,520
Have to be able to say no if I felt I was
participating in anything questionable.

212
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,820
No one forces your hand, Nicky.

213
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,230
And I'd never lie for the family.

214
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,970
We would never ask you to.

215
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,090
$10 million.

216
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,270
Done.

217
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,700
Thank you for an amazing night.

218
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Did we just win the lottery?

219
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,700
What do you mean?

220
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,220
Well, you just took me to a $500 dinner.

221
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,450
And you bought these tickets to A.B.T.

222
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,850
Last time I checked, you’re a
lawyer who basically works for free.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,420
I took the job working for the family.

224
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,360
What?

225
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,200
Lisa, Lisa, this is a good
thing. It's a good thing.

226
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,870
Are you sure?

227
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,930
Yes, this is a really...
really good thing.

228
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,580
Tripp is giving me $10 million a year to
start a charitable foundation in dad's name,

229
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,520
on top of my salary, which
is gna be pretty impressive.

230
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,850
He's giving you $10 million
a year to just give away?

231
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,810
Yeah.

232
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,710
I don't know. l-l... are you
sure you really want to do this?

233
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,280
- I mean, your dad was a mess.
He was... - hey, wait a minute.

234
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,210
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, I am not my dad.

235
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,360
I know that, but if you're taking
the job to prove that you know it,

236
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,670
it's not the right
reason to take the job.

237
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,610
That's not the reason I'm doing this.

238
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,240
This is a great opportunity.

239
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,470
Okay? And I'm gonna do it my way.

240
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,900
I like the way you do things.

241
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,670
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

242
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,780
So, uh, I guess that could work.

243
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,430
Think it's gonna work?

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,790
Hello.

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,820
hey, Nick. It's me.

246
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,900
Me who? Jeremy. Jeremy Darling.

247
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,750
Who is it? Its... it's
Jeremy Darling.

248
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,600
Oh, my god.

249
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,680
Uh, listen, Jeremy,
can you call me later?

250
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,160
No. l’m... I'm playing poker over
at... over at Ethan Hawke’s place.

251
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,490
I just won a yacht.

252
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,460
Yeah, well, winning's a great
feeling, Jeremy, but listen...

253
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,490
it's wet. Are you kidding
me? It's totally wet.

254
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,210
uh, Jeremy, what exactly do you
need, besides maybe some toilet paper?

255
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,650
Well, this guy Francois I
won it from, he says that

256
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,920
the title is on the yacht at Chelsea piers in-
- in the galley, and I can just take it.

257
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,080
Is it really that simple?

258
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,300
No, no, no. It's... it's not that
simple. Where is it registered?

259
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,560
France, probably? Or
Germany? I don't know.

260
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,110
This is why... this is
why I need help, Nick.

261
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,170
Would you knock it off?

262
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,110
Um, hey, listen, here's what
you're gonna have to do.

263
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,000
You have to get the title and
bring it to my office later today,

264
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,590
and we'll be sure everything's okay.

265
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,690
Thank you, Nick. You're the wettest!

266
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,400
daisy.

267
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,360
Can you put the family's phone
numbers into this thing for me, please?

268
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,280
And don't let me forget, l’m
picking up Kiki after school.

269
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,110
Hey, I am sorry I'm late.

270
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,890
I got trapped on a phone
call with your brother Brian.

271
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,890
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick. What was it about?

272
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,630
Oh, god, I don't know.

273
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,110
He wanted my help getting some parishioner's
kid into the maple grove academy?

274
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,150
Not my job.

275
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,040
Nick deflowered me.

276
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,000
- Really? That's great.
- What? Nick, it's just the truth.

277
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,090
Karen, do you have a check for me?

278
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,870
Yep, here it is.

279
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,270
$10 million from the Darling family
foundation for you to do all kinds of food with.

280
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,790
Well, actually, before the day is over,

281
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm gonna use $1 million of it to
save a playground for some orphans.

282
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,190
Oh, orphans!

283
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,830
Nick used to read me poetry
out loud. It was so sweet.

284
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,670
Do you remember, Nick? Remember?

285
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,200
Karen, I really...

286
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,070
I always thought we'd
be married. Didn't you?

287
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,670
- Karen, I think
Freddy... - I did.

288
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,350
Instead I married three... well, it’s
gonna be four other people.

289
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,670
it's weird. Weird, isn’t it?

290
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,330
Life's so weird.

291
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,700
So I have your prenups
here for you to soon...

292
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,350
If you're ready. Yeah, let's do that.

293
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,400
This is so exciting.

294
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,540
Well, I hope you
two enjoy being to...

295
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,090
are you coming to mommy and
Daddy’s anniversary party tonight?

296
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,440
Yeah, with, uh, with Lisa, my wife.

297
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,600
Uh, we'll both be there.

298
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,830
- Bye.
- Bye.

299
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,440
She's, uh, still in love with you, huh?

300
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,610
She's in love with everybody.

301
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,030
Oh, uh, here's your phone, armed and ready.

302
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,270
Thank you.

303
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,310
nice.

304
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,210
Brian, I told you, I am not going
to the maple grove academy.

305
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,890
I'll give you $40,000,just let him in.

306
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,100
This is an academic
institution, reverend, not an auction...

307
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,130
Don’t lecture me, bozo, or I'll have
somebody come up here and beat you up.

308
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,250
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where the hell have you been?

309
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,280
What's going on?

310
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,930
This is Nick George, our family lawyer.

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,120
You better do what
he says, or else...

312
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,560
or else you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and find your tires slashed or something.

313
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,600
It won't be good. I promise.

314
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,090
Where the hell are you going?

315
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,250
I have to go do a baptism.

316
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,560
Mr. George, I'll be frank.

317
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,340
If the child was legally a Darling,
there would not be a problem here.

318
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,340
He could come to maple grove for free.

319
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,760
Wait, what do you
mean, ” legally a Darling"?

320
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I mean as long as the Reverend Darling
refuses to claim the boy as his son,

321
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,900
there is no place for
him here at maple grove.

322
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm really sorry.

323
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,730
Wait. Wait a minute.
This kid is Brian’s?

324
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,720
He didn't tell you that?

325
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,790
Pardon me one second.

326
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,630
hey, Juliet, what’s up?

327
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,200
If am so terrible, Duncan
mcdoorknob, then why did you cast me?

328
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,090
Because your dad's financing
the whole production.

329
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,900
- Daddy paid for this?
- Of course.

330
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,540
You don't think you can act, do ya?

331
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,270
I mean haven't you seen
the looks on everyone's mugs

332
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,540
when you squeak and squawk
your way through your lines,

333
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,760
you dirty, wee twig, or
are you blind as well?

334
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,410
You're a nightmare!

335
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,810
But daddy said he wasn't
gonna do that anymore.

336
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,660
I thought I earned this part!

337
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,820
- Juliet, there are lotsf ways...
- oh, I wish I was dead!

338
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,270
To earn the part.

339
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,540
What, uh, exactly went wrong here?

340
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,030
She stepped on the
stage, that's what went wrong.

341
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,100
She couldn't act her way out of
a paper bag, mate, let alone a play.

342
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,310
She's, uh... se's not good.

343
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,800
god help me.

344
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,620
Hello?

345
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,990
I won it in a friggin' poker game, dude.

346
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,440
They came with the boat.

347
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,030
They're illegals, Mr. Darling.
Your name's on the title.

348
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,510
Yeah, but look, officer, he just wrote
his name in, just now, in crayon.

349
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,990
I don't re if he drew it with his little
pee-pee in the snow, shyster, we're taking him in.

350
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,640
Look, he doesn't even know these guys.

351
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,840
It's true! I've never met those
guys before in my life. Right, guys?

352
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,580
okay, Captain Jeremy.
Captain Jeremy, okay.

353
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,920
Did you teach 'em how to do that?

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,030
I was just having a little fun.

355
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,480
get him outta here.

356
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,640
You gotta bail me out, Nick.

357
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,580
If I miss mom and dad's anniversary
party tonight, dad is gonna kill me.

358
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,210
- Be right there.
- He'll kill me.

359
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
Right there.

360
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,410
Look, I don't think this
is gonna... damn it.

361
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,960
What's the matter?

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,670
I forgot to pick up my daughter!

363
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,000
You are the most important thing
in the world to your father.

364
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,290
I know.

365
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,130
And he has gone out of his way
to give you this opportunity.

366
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,110
But I don't want it.

367
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,520
it makes me feel so stupid and lame to
have everything taken care of all the time.

368
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,960
I want to be a human being.

369
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,390
And someday you'll be one.

370
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,910
Someday you'll walk out of this house

371
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,830
and do everything just the way
you want... on your own, free.

372
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,450
But not today.

373
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,990
oh, I hate that thing.

374
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,870
Oh, as a favor to your father
and me on our anniversary,

375
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,350
no extravagant gestures of, uh, protest.

376
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,000
- IghsÓÒ tout a I'heure.
- Tout a I'heure.

377
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,560
Jeremy, did your brother Patrick use his
influence as attorney general to get you released?

378
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,300
All right, listen, this has been
a massive misunderstanding...

379
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,570
- are you planning to do this anymore?
- And I can assure you that my client...

380
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,690
are you getting back
together with Kylie Minogue?

381
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,960
Is gonna be found innocent of
all charges brought against him.

382
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,170
So there's no story
here. Please excuse us.

383
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,240
Is it true you won the
yacht in a poker game, Jeremy?

384
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,740
Jeremy, how long have you been
smuggling people into the country?

385
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,450
I don't know...
Don’t answer that.

386
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,320
is it true you were planning
to harvest their organs?

387
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,030
You know, that is just dumb.

388
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,020
Why say things like that?

389
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,790
No further questions.

390
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,140
- dad's gonna kill me.
- He's not gonna kill you.

391
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,390
Then he'll have me killed.

392
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,530
Can you just give us a minute, please?

393
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,860
I'll talk to him. It's
gonna be all right.

394
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,570
It's not gonna do any good, all right?

395
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,950
He thinks I'm a loser, and he's right.

396
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,430
I mean, look at me. I can't even win
a yacht without getting arrested.

397
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,150
I have the worst life in the world.

398
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,120
Jeremy.

399
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,810
- What? I do, Nick-
- Jeremy, shut up.

400
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,400
What?

401
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,020
You have all the money
you're ever gonna need.

402
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,050
You're never gonna have
to work a day in your life.

403
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,350
30,000 people die of
starvation every day.

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
Did you know that? Every day.

405
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah, but out of
7 billion people...

406
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,040
look, the point is that life for
most people is a living hell.

407
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,750
So your life is not the worst life in the
world by any stretch of the imagination, any.

408
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,400
what?

409
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,460
You wouldn't understand.

410
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,960
give that to Kiki.

411
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,280
Tell her I'm sorry I made you late.

412
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,760
Where'd you learn how to do that?

413
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,790
My coke dealer.

414
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,880
Happy anniversary.

415
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

416
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,750
- hi.
- Hi.

417
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,780
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

418
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,420
- Sorry about kiki.
- It's okay. I got her.

419
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,300
This party is amazing.

420
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,100
These guys are from the philharmonic,

421
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,760
and someone said that Josh
Groban might be singing later.

422
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,430
Yeah, well, this is what
these guys do best.

423
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,170
You know, they spend money.

424
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,290
Yeah, uh, the wedding has
to be the 18th, because, uh,

425
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,090
Nick’s playing in the U.S.
Open, and tiger woods said...

426
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,660
Freddy.

427
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,510
What?

428
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,330
You said, "Nick." I'm Freddy.
I'm there playing in the open.

429
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,380
That’s right.

430
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,740
He's the one.

431
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,270
He's... he's playing
in the U.S. Open.

432
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,150
we'll take them home then.

433
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,250
Have you seen Juliet?

434
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,500
Come on. Put on something
nice before mom sees you.

435
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,280
Brian, this shirt cost
1,000 bucks, okay? Chill.

436
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,220
Hey, no fun.

437
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:25,180
And Tripp had Doug Henning
flown in from Vegas.

438
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,540
Oh, there were hot air balloon rides,
ponies... you know, typical birthday party.

439
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,060
But when it came time to
leave, we couldn't find Nicky.

440
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,710
He'd vanished.

441
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,020
For two hours, we searched for him.

442
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,250
- Where was he?
- In the wine cellar.

443
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,950
He was down there
sobbing, didn't want to go home.

444
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,300
But Dutch... was so good
with you that night...

445
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,770
the way he carried you to the car.

446
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,620
He was so... so tender.

447
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
- It's okay, Tish.
- No, no, it's not.

448
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,450
I mean, how many men do
we know today, really,

449
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,310
Who could raise a child like
that all alone and do it so well?

450
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,090
Sometimes it seems the whole
Cosmos is in a state of decay.

451
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,620
It's still a little tough around here.

452
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,420
You know how it is.

453
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,230
Well, that’s true, actually, what
mom just said about the cosmos.

454
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:33,450
I mean, space is friggin'...
it's coming apart.

455
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,820
true story.

456
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,370
What are you talking about?

457
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,900
Jeremy.

458
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,520
- Less than... - have
you seen Juliet?

459
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,020
And how do you think that makes me feel?

460
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,200
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake.

461
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,580
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

462
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
I mean, do you have a thing for this guy?

463
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,340
Sure.

464
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,940
- What?
- No. l... he's taken.

465
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,500
Nick... nick
is my past.

466
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,230
And you, buddy, you're my future, okay?

467
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,290
That's right. That's right.

468
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,680
Oh, I wanted to tell you. I met
one of the Kennedys earlier.

469
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,920
Oh, jeez, I don't know which one,
but he owns a private course outside of Glasgow,

470
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,090
And he really wants me to play it.

471
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,940
Oh, yeah?

472
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so i told him we
could take the family jet next week.

473
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,450
Is, uh, is that cool?

474
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,340
Of course.

475
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,590
So word's out you're
headed for the Senate, Pat.

476
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,850
really?

477
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,490
You know, that’s news to me, Dan.

478
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,900
So you won't be running?

479
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,570
Ready to put that on the record?

480
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,850
Let's just say I'm happy
being attorney general,

481
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,490
and as you know, I would
miss New York so much.

482
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,580
After all, it is the
great American city, right?

483
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,900
Excuse me.
There's a woman to see you.

484
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,920
if, uh, you'll excuse me for a moment.

485
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,870
Of course.

486
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,140
I'll be right back.

487
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,870
So he is running, isn’t he?

488
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,140
He doesn't have a choice.

489
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,640
I've got it, Dover.

490
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,930
Thank you.

491
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,040
Yes, sir.

492
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,300
What are you doing here?

493
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,020
I missed you.

494
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,760
You haven't called.

495
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,810
It’s not good for you to be here.

496
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,930
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?

497
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,650
You can't tell me you love me then
Disappear for weeks at a time.

498
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,930
You can't do that.

499
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,620
Please, don’t raise your voice, honey, okay?

500
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,610
Don't be mad.

501
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,140
Just do me a favor. Go to
the Ashley square, get a room.

502
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,230
I'll come when the party's over, okay?

503
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,570
Oh, yes, you will.

504
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,410
go.

505
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:53,790
it makes me so sad that it all
has to end someday,

506
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,520
this... this pageant, this beautiful.

507
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,910
Beautiful adventure.

508
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,690
You truly are, in flesh and blood,

509
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,040
the great. great love of my life.

510
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,820
And I thank you for that.

511
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,370
I love you.

512
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,730
This year, it was, uh, me and Juliet's turn to
pick out the gift from the children,

513
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,380
So, uh, in honor of the day that you two
first met at the Saratoga racecourse.

514
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,250
Go ahead, Leopold.

515
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,550
this is Irish ice.

516
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,630
He won the breeders' cup last year.

517
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,800
I guess. Something like that.

518
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,720
And, uh, tonight he's ridden by
Saratoga’s very own...

519
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,890
Tommy Crenshaw!

520
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,730
oh, I love you.

521
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,810
patrick daring

522
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,180
Meet me in the Library now.
"Code pink".

523
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,510
Juliet?

524
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,410
Where is she?

525
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,320
Thank you.

526
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,750
Thank you, Jeremy.

527
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,350
Now get that thing out of here before it
does something unseemly, all right?

528
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,350
okay, head 'em up, move 'em out.

529
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,090
Nick.

530
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,510
What are you doing up here?

531
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,130
I was just looking for Patrick.

532
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,050
He sent me this thing, and I. you okay?

533
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,010
yeah, I'm fine.

534
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,180
I'm fine.

535
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,530
What's going on?

536
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,080
It's Freddy and me.

537
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,180
I don't know, Nick.

538
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,970
I don't know.

539
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,050
I just. I pick these guys.

540
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,170
It's so hard.

541
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,630
Seems better than the last one.

542
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,970
Oh, yeah.

543
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,450
All they see is the money, nick.

544
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,290
All they see is...

545
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,330
is my name and my money,

546
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,380
and nobody... nobody sees me.

547
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,530
I can't imagine that's true.

548
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,710
You can't imagine that's true because
you would never be that way.

549
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,400
I think you're the only guy I ever
dated who actually really saw. me,

550
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,280
you know, just. Just me.

551
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,090
Karen, listen, I don't know what
happened between you and Freddy,

552
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,590
and I don't want to know.

553
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,560
But if you don't want to marry this guy, don’t.

554
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,330
Life is short.

555
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,410
And you, uh. And you deserve to be loved.

556
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,820
You're sweet.

557
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,330
You're so sweet.

558
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,910
nick?

559
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,070
Uh. Patrick’s looking for you.

560
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,890
I know. He...

561
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,120
Sorry to interrupt.

562
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,370
Oh, that's okay.

563
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,090
Damn it.

564
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,620
Uh, excuse me.

565
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,970
Did my wife just come by here?

566
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,650
Short hair, black gown, pissed?

567
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,690
What happened at maple grove?

568
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,860
Brian, I cannot deal with this right now.

569
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,250
Oh, but you can show up here like you belong?

570
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,080
You're on the clock, Nick.
Answer my question.

571
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,600
Okay, okay.

572
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,820
If you'll admit the kid is yours, Brian,

573
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,220
if you're willing to stick your
Family’s proud name on him,

574
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,960
then he can go to maple grove.

575
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,180
If not, the little bastard's out of luck.

576
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,060
Yeah, go ahead.

577
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,300
Run away.

578
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,850
you know, you are just like your stupid dad.

579
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,420
You stand around all day with your hand out,
taking our money,

580
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,780
but when it comes time to actually getting things
done, you're worthless!

581
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,170
I hate you.

582
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,300
Don’t you ever. ow!

583
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,170
- Talk about my father like that again.
- Get off me!

584
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,310
You little son of a bitch!

585
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,080
What the hell's going on here?

586
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,190
He started it!

587
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,350
Shut up!

588
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,000
Get a doctor!

589
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,720
What’s the matter?

590
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,760
It's Juliet!

591
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,400
Get a doctor!

592
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,330
Here we go.

593
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,180
Looks like she took somewhere
between 10 and 20,

594
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,840
but she expelled quite a few of
them into her pillow.

595
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,390
I think she'll be fine, Tripp.

596
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,750
She just needs some rest.

597
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,990
Thanks, Doc.

598
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,310
You have any idea why she'd do this,
Nick, any clue?

599
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,820
She knows you bought her the part.

600
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,510
Oh, well, guess we're gonna have to be a
little more tricky about

601
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,160
how we lay the train tracks ahead of her,

602
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,270
huh, out in the world?

603
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,690
What?

604
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,580
Speak, Nick. l’m all ears.

605
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,770
I quit.

606
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,600
Tough day, huh?

607
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,950
I'm serious.
This isn't me, Tripp, this job.

608
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,500
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

609
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,580
Nicky.

610
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,630
Look, I can't talk right now, Pat.
I'm sorry.

611
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,120
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah.

612
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,130
- At the party?
- Yeah, I did.

613
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,660
"Code pink"?
What the hell is that?

614
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,980
Come on. Get in. l’ll tell you.

615
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,350
No, pat. I just told your dad I quit. Sorry.

616
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,320
Nick, please. It’s life and death.

617
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,510
Just go up to the room and
explain to her that it's over.

618
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,120
Her?

619
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,860
Yeah.

620
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,410
No, you do it. He’s your girlfriend...

621
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,270
she.

622
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,950
I can't, Nick. I tried. She gets so emotional.

623
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,170
It... it kills me.

624
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,470
Please tell me you never asked
my dad to do anything like this.

625
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,940
A few times.

626
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,790
S-seven.

627
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,880
Well, l’m not doing it for you.

628
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,740
Oh, Nicky, please, please.

629
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,030
You gotta do it. Please.

630
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,090
And hey, could you give her this check for me?

631
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,370
No, I'm not gonna go into a hotel
and give a tranny hooker a check.

632
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,160
She's not a hooker.

633
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,250
you make it sound so dirty, Nick.

634
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,140
Well, what the hell is it, Pat, if it's not dirty?

635
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,260
Different.

636
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,430
Look, that’s... stop the car.

637
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,290
Don't stop the car. Okay?

638
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,840
Wait, where... where you going?

639
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,450
Whoa, Nick. Hey, hey!

640
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,330
Come here. Please.

641
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,090
Come on, man.

642
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,360
l-l-I really... I really can't do it.

643
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,750
Patrick, listen to me.

644
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,620
You are going to be a United States senator.

645
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,460
You're gonna occupy one of the
highest offices in the land.

646
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,100
Don't you, as a future U.S. Senator,

647
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,170
at least have to have enough courage,
enough integrity,

648
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,840
to walk into a hotel room on your
own and give a tranny hooker a check?

649
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,400
She's not a hooker.

650
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,760
I know she's not a hooker, okay?

651
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,640
But is she more of a man than you are?

652
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,370
You're right.

653
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,630
Okay.

654
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Thanks, Nick.

655
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,890
The Ashley Square.

656
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,930
Let's go, baby.

657
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,710
And just for the record, that was
not life and death!

658
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,840
I know you two had a thing once.

659
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,890
So what was it, Nick?

660
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,600
She was upset about Freddy,

661
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,200
and l-I said some things to be nice,

662
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,510
and she was just... it was friendly.

663
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,380
It looked like a lot more than friendly to me.

664
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,770
Well, look, she's about to get married.

665
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,910
That means a lot!

666
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,480
You know, and anyway I told youl quit.

667
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,480
Who’s that? Whose ring is that?

668
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,550
It’s. It’s Karen’s.

669
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,370
Iook, it’s not what you think.

670
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,080
It's Daisy's idea of a joke, okay?

671
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,460
And it’s. Oddly helpful.

672
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,250
Thank you.

673
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,280
You're welcome.

674
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,950
Karen, do not call me on the home
phone number.

675
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,510
we have to talk, Nick.

676
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,080
It's about your dad.

677
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,620
Freddy asked me for $100,000 at the
party tonight to join some golf club.

678
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,870
Don’t.

679
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,960
Please, I know.

680
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,260
So I went up to the office to write a check,

681
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,970
and when I got there, I found
a new requisition on my desk.

682
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,330
Yeah, from who?

683
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,780
Brian.

684
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,480
The last gift Brian requisitioned from
the foundation was for a man named Norman Exley.

685
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,720
Well, who’s that?

686
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,140
Brian said he was just some guy who was
down on his luck and came into the church.

687
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,630
He wanted to settle some debts,

688
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,650
so I sent him a check for $10,0003 months ago.

689
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,760
And now he's asking for more?

690
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,630
Yeah, only this time it's for $90,000 and.

691
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,330
- What?
- Nick, he’s an airplane mechanic.

692
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,240
Karen, what the hell are you saying?

693
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,190
I don't know... I don't know.

694
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,900
Brian. Well, he never was very
happy about the affair.

695
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,410
What affair?

696
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,050
The one your dad and my mom had
for the past 40 years.

697
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,210
Oh, god. Nick.

698
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,620
I thought you knew.

699
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,890
Two days later,

700
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,090
My father's plane was finally recovered
from the bottom of long island sound.

701
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,430
Without him in it.

702
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,150
It could've been explosives.

703
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,260
Could've been?

704
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,520
Look, that plane's been bouncing around
the ocean floor for the past two weeks now.

705
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,400
That's why there's no body in it, that’s
why there's no real proof.

706
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,920
I'm sorry.

707
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,410
I'd be happy to get a warrant for Exley,
see where it leads.

708
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,210
But the D.A. I s probably gonna want to know

709
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,600
Where you're getting your information from.

710
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,450
I'll be in touch.

711
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,700
Thank you.

712
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,830
Hey, Mr. George.

713
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,430
There was a watertight lockbox on the plane.

714
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,970
Found this in there.

715
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,330
Personal effects.

716
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,140
Thank you.

717
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,950
What are you doing here, Tripp?

718
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,380
Karen called me.

719
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,100
I got concerned.

720
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,730
Well, there's, uh.
A lot to be concerned about, I guess.

721
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,890
Maybe.

722
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,030
Might all amount to nothing, though.

723
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,750
Sometimes, you know, you...

724
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,170
you're just looking for answers,

725
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,380
and. and there aren't any.

726
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,340
Either way.

727
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,960
Oh, god.

728
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,060
Come here.

729
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,370
A hell of a way to lose him.

730
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,750
Whatever you want to do,
Nicky, we're on your side,

731
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,390
Whether you're working for us or not.

732
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,510
Is that you're way of asking if I still
want to work for you or not, Tripp?

733
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,110
Oh, you know me.

734
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,860
I can't help putting it out there.

735
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,800
I thought he took that with him.

736
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,870
Well, he did.

737
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,610
It was in a... in a waterproof box.

738
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,590
Okay.

739
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,870
Listen, I gotta go.

740
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,150
My family's waiting.

741
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, you t-take the helicopter.

742
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,170
I mean, traffic’s demonic.

743
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,250
You'll never get there.

744
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,200
Call your car service;
tell 'em to go home.

745
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,190
I want to stay here for a minute.

746
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,790
The police will take me back.

747
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,650
Take the helicopter.

748
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,040
I'll see you in the morning.

749
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,630
I'll see you in the morning.

750
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,960
Good.

751
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,580
I love you, Nicky.

752
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,860
So. is the love of money really
the root of all evil?

753
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,390
Or is it something else?

754
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,170
Vamanos!

755
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,130
Is it the love of freedom?

756
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,670
cupcake, wait a second.

757
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,170
- Leave me alone, daddy.
- Why are you doing this?

758
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,060
I only get one life,
and I have to make it mine.

759
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,810
Someday is today.

760
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,830
Let her go.

761
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,830
She'll be all right.

762
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,770
Okay.

763
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,210
Go for it, kiddo.

764
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,190
I love you.

765
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,440
I love you.

766
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,910
The love of fame?

767
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,440
No, seriously, Ethan, you should
come down and check it out.

768
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,260
Well, because I value your opinion.

769
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm trying to figure out what to do with
this thing before my dad makes me sell it.

770
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,570
Hey, we... we should hit the Bahamas, maybe?

771
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,200
But l-I got to get back, though,
before I go to space camp.

772
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,110
Ethan?

773
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,360
Dude?

774
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,600
Is it the love of virtue?

775
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,310
it's not about the money, you idiot!

776
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,760
I want our son to go to the school
that he would go to if we were together!

777
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,280
Well, they won't take him at the school
if he's not mine.

778
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,330
Fine, then he's yours.

779
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,980
Congratulations, baby, you're royalty.

780
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,100
Andrea.

781
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,390
Wait, I can't just bring him home
to my wife and kids.

782
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,670
The love of vice?

783
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,650
Please don't leave me, Patty.

784
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,480
I'll do something terrible.

785
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,270
I know it.

786
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,140
It’s okay.

787
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,650
I'm here.

788
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,570
Is it the love of romance?

789
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,500
They're gonna make a whole line of kids'
golf videos to start.

790
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,490
And if that goes really well, they’re
gonna do the same thing, only in Japanese.

791
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,450
And I'm gonna be the spokesperson,
kinda, you know, the...

792
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,360
The face of the whole thing.

793
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,430
It'll just cost $1 million up front to start.

794
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,820
It's a good idea, right?

795
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,290
Yes. Yeah, it's a good idea.

796
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,690
Or is it having too much of anything?

797
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,810
Is that the "Problem"?

798
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,060
I don't know.

799
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,520
I just know I'm gonna find out
who killed my father.

800
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,290
And when i do, they're gonna pay...
