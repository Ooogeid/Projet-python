1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:03,328
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:05,775
until his plane went down
in Long Island sound.

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,940
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,663
Tripp, the empire builder, Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite,

5
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,381
Karen, the
professional divorcée...

6
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,259
- I want to marry Nick.
- Let me help you.

7
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:16,404
Brian, the man of God...

8
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:18,965
- What about Brian jr.?
- I'm taking him back to Brazil.

9
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:21,197
You can't just uproot him.
He has a life here now.

10
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,910
Patrick, the
principled politician...

11
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,416
The three of us are gonna sit down
together and set some ground rules.

12
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,185
- You, me and who?
- Carmelita.

13
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,307
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

14
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,170
- I want a job.
- What can you do?

15
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:34,363
You will not believe the
girl whose car I'm parking.

16
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,133
Darling Plaza was our
first home in Manhattan.

17
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:40,053
Convince Tripp to throw
Darling Plaza into the pot.

18
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:43,491
It is Simon Elder.
He has stolen my son.

19
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,323
I want to destroy him.

20
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,660
- Good morning.
- Hey.

21
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:59,102
You ready to paint
the living room?

22
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:01,850
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,392
Yeah, I love painting.
I love the mess, I love the smell.

24
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,101
Okay, which one?

25
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,180
All right, let me see.

26
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,283
- Crème brûlée or flan?
- Yeah, it's a custard theme.

27
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,641
Are you sure you're going
to be able to finish this

28
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,981
before Thanksgiving at my parents'?
It's only two days.

29
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,953
Yeah. Yeah,
I have very little to do today.

30
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:26,910
I just have to meet with Tripp briefly
and help Brian with his custody hearing,

31
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:30,021
and then I am free for the
entire holiday weekend.

32
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,550
Five days without
Nick George...

33
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:35,940
Won't the Darling dynasty
crumble into dust without you?

34
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,341
It just might.

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,020
But it would be very
expensive dust.

36
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:49,023
- Anything going on with Darling Plaza?
- Not yet.

37
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,572
We transferred the deed over
to Simon Elder two weeks ago.

38
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,291
He's given me no
indication of his plans.

39
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:59,842
Is that it, then? He just wanted
to steal my soul, rob me of...

40
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:02,562
the building where
my kids were raised,

41
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,102
rob me of my son? My son, Nick.

42
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:06,890
Have you heard from
Patrick lately?

43
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:11,790
Not since the wedding.
He hasn't returned any of my calls.

44
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:17,593
You can't imagine what
it's like, Nicky.

45
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,980
You come tthe end
of your life--

46
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:26,112
so many years of work,
so many years of achievement--

47
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:28,653
and then right in
front of your face,

48
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:34,362
it's all being spirited away by this...
capricious man.

49
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,331
Patrick is still
your son, Tripp.

50
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,711
No matter what kind
of political alliance

51
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:43,762
he forms with Simon Elder for
whatever reason, he's still your son.

52
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:50,350
Yeah. Arrange a sit-down with Patrick
and Simon Elder for me, will you?

53
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,113
A sit-down? Okay.

54
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:56,980
The sooner, the better.
Tomorrow evening, up at Valhalla.

55
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,582
Wait, Tripp. You expect him to leave
the city the day before Thanksgiving

56
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:03,693
and go 60 miles up the Hudson
river valley for a sit-down?

57
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:08,133
You handed him the deed to Darling
Plaza to gain influence with him, right?

58
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:09,571
Yeah.

59
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:13,600
So use your influence.
Cash it in.

60
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,320
All right. I'm on it.

61
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:20,851
You'll be there
at my side, okay?

62
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:26,263
Tripp, it's-- it's Thanksgiving weekend.
I made plans with the family.

63
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:30,462
I'll get you out really early
thursday morning. Promise.

64
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,133
What do you want me
to tell Patrick to--

65
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,743
Just tell him Simon
Elder will be there.

66
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,200
That'll make him feel safe.
You leave the rest up to his vanity.

67
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:43,060
How much longer are we gonna
be staying at this hotel?

68
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,023
Living out of a suitcase,
eating room service all the time,

69
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:47,563
it's a little tiresome.

70
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,652
Thank you for being so patient.

71
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,803
Have you set up the
meeting with Carmelita yet?

72
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:59,823
Um... I'm not sure this
is the best time for her.

73
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:02,081
Uh, she's got finals coming up.

74
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,662
Oh, she's in school.
What school?

75
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:07,423
Uh... uh, cosmetology.

76
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,152
Well, it's always something,
isn't it?

77
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,213
When would be a good time...
for her?

78
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,613
Uh, what is it you
want to talk about?

79
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,062
Just make it happen.

80
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,653
If you want to stay
married to me,

81
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,413
quit stalling and
make it happen.

82
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,100
- I understand--
- Today.

83
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:23,983
Okay.

84
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,653
Thank you for coming on
such short notice, Giorgio.

85
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,371
Anytime you get divorced,
Karen, I'm here for you.

86
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:41,181
But, you know, we don't have to do
this only after you get divorced.

87
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,613
Yeah, actually, we kinda do.

88
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,141
Was that Giorgio?

89
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,972
What a trooper,
always being there for you like that.

90
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,743
- It's really, like, inspiring.
- Mm, it takes a village.

91
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,540
Something was off last night, though.
It wasn't the same.

92
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,181
Do tell.

93
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,661
Well, usually when
Giorgio and I have...

94
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:11,513
meaningless post-divorce sex,
it feels a little less meaningless,

95
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,000
like we're somehow...

96
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:17,103
Planets whose orbits
intersect every ten years?

97
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:20,443
No. Just... hornier.

98
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,952
- You gonna eat those?
- No. Replenish.

99
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,803
- What's the matter with you?
- I miss my son.

100
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,373
Brian jr. left? Where'd he go?

101
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,760
His mother came and took
him away a week ago, Karen.

102
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,733
I'm fighting for custody.

103
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:40,822
Brian, hey, look,
you know how the justice system works.

104
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,503
Whoever has the most
money wins, right?

105
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:47,403
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Well, thanks for the advice.

106
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,812
Thanks for the pancakes.

107
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,911
Was Brian wearing Clive
Christian number 1?

108
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:00,622
Nah, that's me. And it's number 2,
unreleased to the public.

109
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:02,183
Oh. Why are you
wearing cologne?

110
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,032
There's this girl who
parks at the garage.

111
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,400
She won't go out with me.
She thinks I'm, like, just a valet.

112
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:08,701
Oh, so you're gonna knock her
unconscious with your cologne,

113
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,471
and then, what, shanghai her?
Just tell her you're Jeremy Darling.

114
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:14,742
No. Natalie pretended to be
pregnant just to get my money.

115
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,522
I want this girl
to like me for me.

116
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,770
Honey, that's not gonna happen.
You're a Darling.

117
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:23,211
As soon as she finds that out,
things are never gonna be the same,

118
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:24,890
trust me.

119
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,091
I guess she can
never find out then.

120
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:29,812
That is a good plan.

121
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,700
Good plan, my friend.

122
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,542
He's not asking you
to move back in.

123
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:38,592
He's not asking you to do
anything except sit down with him

124
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,743
and Simon and talk.

125
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:44,533
Nick, that's the last thing on
earth I would ever consider doing.

126
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:48,292
I know, but, Patrick,
he is your father.

127
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,680
It's taken me over 30 years to muster
the courage to break free from him.

128
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,550
I'm not about to go ruing
back into shooting range.

129
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:55,723
Okay.

130
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,580
But I'll do it.

131
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,893
I'll do it, okay?
I just need one... little favor.

132
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,462
She just wants to talk.

133
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:11,600
I can't do it.
I can't face her.

134
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:14,101
I'm sorry. Tell Patrick no.

135
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,843
Carmelita, just put yourself in
Ellen's shoes, just for a second.

136
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:18,940
She's not asking patrick
to end the affair.

137
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,480
She's not asking you to vanish.
She just wants to talk.

138
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,301
You know, who knows?
Maybe the three of you can somehow,

139
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:28,861
- I don't know, complete each other.
- You really think that's possible?

140
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:32,633
Well, I think that life is
very creative and surprising,

141
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:36,781
and sometimes we find solutions
where we thought there weren't any.

142
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,221
Patrick is so lucky to have
someone like you in his life.

143
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,100
I'll do it.

144
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,366
Good.

145
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,435
- A sit-down?
- That's what he called it.

146
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:51,727
- Wait. And what are the terms?
- Ah, no terms.

147
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:55,841
Well, because it sounds so old-world,
I figured there must be terms.

148
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,811
Nope, just the three of you
sitting down to talk, and me.

149
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,560
Okay, does this have anything
to do with Darling Plaza?

150
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,381
I don't think so I think it has
to do with the fact he feels

151
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:08,441
he's lost his son to you, that's
what he's troubled about right now.

152
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:12,403
Okay, so you're being straight with
me about this little... sit-down?

153
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,642
You promise me that I'm
not gonna be walking into

154
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,993
some sort of classic
Tripp Darling ambush?

155
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,331
Uh, yeah, I promise.

156
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:24,130
Yeah. Okay. I'll go. Actually,
I think it could be beneficial.

157
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:25,822
- Good.
- It's not every day

158
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:29,870
two men like us sit down and break bread
together. It should be interesting.

159
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,450
Done.

160
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:46,763
I think we can all agree it's
in everyone's best interest

161
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:49,231
to settle this without
going to the judge tomorrow.

162
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,583
What you think, Mr.
George, is beside the point.

163
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:55,562
My client's settling for nothing less
than sole physical and legal custody.

164
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:59,282
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- I know what's best for my child.

165
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,921
Says the tramp who slept with
me last week to get him back.

166
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:04,403
- Brian, let me handle this.
- Then handle it!

167
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,563
Given Brian jr.'s
feelings for his father,

168
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,760
do you think that moving to Brazil
is really what's best for him?

169
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:12,672
These two have bonded since you
first deposited your son with Brian

170
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,651
and then
subsequently disappeared.

171
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:18,283
Was this before or after he
deposited the child with you?

172
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,242
Beat it,
you prissy little creep.

173
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,402
Brian, let's just cool it.
Okay? Let's just stop.

174
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:27,873
I think I have come up with what is a
very fair proposal for joint custody.

175
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,460
You will be well-compensated
provided you stay in the city,

176
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,710
and it puts your son's
best interests first.

177
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,680
I'll give you $1 million to get up
and walk out of here right now.

178
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:36,701
Excuse me?

179
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,820
Hey, that's not what we're here to do,
Brian. Let me finish.

180
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:41,592
- $2 million.
- Are you trying to buy my son?

181
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:44,701
- I'm trying to buy our son.
- Nobody is buying anybody.

182
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:46,382
This is ridiculous.
We're leaving.

183
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,351
$3 million.

184
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,032
We both know it's all about
the money with you anyway.

185
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:54,172
Now I remember why it
didn't work with us.

186
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,650
You are not a human being.

187
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,543
Don't look at me like that.

188
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,613
$3 million was more than fair.

189
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

190
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,500
How you doing, baby?

191
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,762
This better not be your way of
saying you're missing Thanksgiving.

192
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,190
I am not missing Thanksgiving.

193
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:20,472
Good.

194
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,481
I just have to postpone the
painting until the weekend.

195
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,251
And I'm gonna catch up with
you and Kiki at your parents'.

196
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,821
I have to go up to the Darlings'
country house tomorrow.

197
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:32,293
Tripp is having a sit-down
with Patrick and Simon Elder.

198
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,630
He wants me there. I'm sorry.

199
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:36,260
- You know what? It's okay.
- Okay.

200
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,093
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't get to it,
so maybe I'll start painting,

201
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,880
'cause I'd like it done
before the holidays.

202
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,653
Because, you know,
I actually care.

203
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,873
Hey, Lisa, you know what?
Why don't you come with me.

204
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,371
We'll drop Kiki off
at your folks' first,

205
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,322
and then this weekend,
we'll all paint together.

206
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,550
I am not going to stay in the
same house as the Darlings.

207
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,303
- Italy was bad enough.
- Oh, come on, Lisa.

208
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,973
I am not gonna stay the night at
the same place you and Karen Darling

209
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,690
spent a dozen magical
summers together.

210
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:59,723
You know what? How about you go,
you enjoy a nice, long weekend with her,

211
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:01,270
and I will stay here
and I will paint?

212
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,372
Lisa, I don't particularly want to go,
but I have to.

213
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,800
And since I have to,
I would like you to come with me.

214
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,920
- Coming right up.
- Actually...

215
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,970
Is it possible to leave
my car here overnight?

216
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,033
I think I drank a little
too much wine at dinner.

217
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,892
I'm so on board with that.
Both myself and the garage encourage

218
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,012
responsible, yet
heavy drinking.

219
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:31,292
Okay, wonderful. Thank you.
I'll just go and take a catnap.

220
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,441
Let me...
let me help you out there.

221
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:40,611
What do you got
going on in there?

222
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,912
French fries with truffle oil.

223
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,881
You know,
I could just drive you home.

224
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,852
That way you have your
car in the morning.

225
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,161
I don't think so.

226
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:51,271
Come on. I'll cab it home.
No muss, no fuss. In and out. Boom.

227
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,842
That's so sweet of you.
It would help me out a lot.

228
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,022
Well, I will go
fetch your chariot.

229
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,490
Why do I have to come to
Valhalla for Thanksgiving?

230
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,133
Brian's not gonna be there.

231
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,052
Your brother Brian
has a custody hearing.

232
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,553
He's presiding over two
funerals this weekend.

233
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:12,120
The holiday season
die-off has commenced.

234
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:16,832
Uh, I told you I'd help you with Nick.
So trust me. Just come.

235
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:21,551
What if daddy sends me and Nick
to India-- or, no, wait, Bali--

236
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:24,330
to set up an orphanage for
the really starving children?

237
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:28,461
And we'd have to live alone
in a grass hut on the beach.

238
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,431
Well, as wonderful
as that sounds,

239
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,581
coming to Valhalla is all
you really need to do.

240
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,170
But she'll be there. Won't she?

241
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,713
I haven't the faintest idea.

242
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:41,621
Oh, she will. Of course she will.
She's his wife.

243
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,351
It's so her to come along,
isn't it?

244
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:48,860
Just relax, my dear.
Everything is gonna work itself out.

245
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,402
Door-to-door service
with a smile.

246
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:55,973
Thank you for this.

247
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,073
Boy, Brooklyn is, uh, far away.

248
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,191
I mean--
I forgot how far it is.

249
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:08,531
It's like...
it's like a whole other world.

250
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:12,313
Are you gonna be all
right getting home?

251
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:14,380
Yeah, yeah, like I said,
I'll--I'll call a cab.

252
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:18,083
Maybe I'll hobo
and hop a boxcar.

253
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:21,843
- The subway is two blocks away.
- Right, yeah. The subway.

254
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:23,811
There you go.

255
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:27,661
- Listen, Sofia...
- The answer is yes.

256
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:31,423
- To what?
- I will go out with you.

257
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,563
But I don't even
know your last name.

258
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,343
Well-- I don't--
I don't even know your last name.

259
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,620
I'm Sofia Montoya,
and you're Jeremy...

260
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,631
I'm cool with just
Jeremy, babe.

261
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:47,503
- Eson-- Jeremy Babeson.
- Babeson?

262
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:50,422
Yeah, well, you know,
it's a common american last name.

263
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:55,802
It's right on all those lists
beside Smith, Wong and White.

264
00:13:55,896 --> 00:14:01,182
Well, thank you again for the ride,
and I'll see you tomorrow,

265
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:07,000
- Jeremy... Babeson.
- Yes. Yes, you will.

266
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,641
Hey, hey, Clark, um,
do you mind coming to get me?

267
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:26,603
I am, uh,
I am somewhere in Brooklyn.

268
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,621
You're sure about this, right?

269
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,973
What are you gonna do,
not answer the door?

270
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:45,763
Well... isn't this something?

271
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:49,683
- Ellen... I've heard a lot about you.
- I wish I could say the same.

272
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:52,250
Unfortunately, I've been
kept completely in the dark.

273
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:56,140
I have, too, in a sense.

274
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:58,150
Come in.

275
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:04,970
Please.

276
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,460
You can have one
saturday night a month,

277
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:21,330
but the rest of the
weekends are ours.

278
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:23,971
You can have one tuesday or
wednesday night every other week

279
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,613
to do whatever it is
that the two of you do

280
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,480
as long as he is home in time to put
the kids to bed before he does it.

281
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:33,291
That's less than I get him now,
so why exactly would I do this?

282
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,653
Because it's more than
you'll ever have otherwise.

283
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:40,443
Trust me.
Starting now, this is the new normal.

284
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:41,650
Sweetheart...

285
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:46,602
- are you sure you want to--
- Please, Pat, stay out of it.

286
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:49,800
Don't you think I should
participate in this conversation?

287
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,963
Patrick, maybe you
should take a walk.

288
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:54,070
Um... okay.

289
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,702
Okay.

290
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:08,190
He'll spend holidays with us,
family birthdays and

291
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,283
obviously all campaign-related
events are completely off-limits.

292
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,733
The only way that
this is gonna work

293
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,272
is if I get him two
nights every week.

294
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,623
Or Patrick's gonna
end up sneaking out,

295
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:23,392
and neither one of us wants that,
do we?

296
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,051
Family is the only thing
that matters to me.

297
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,301
And as the arbitrator in this case,
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

298
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:33,933
And that's why I believe,
as a father and a minister,

299
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,842
that I should share
custody with Brian jr.

300
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,652
And she should not be able to
whisk him away to friggin' Brazil.

301
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:43,232
Thank you, reverend Darling,
for your forthrightness.

302
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,242
Mr. Mitchell?

303
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:50,491
Reverend Darling,
who is Gustav?

304
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,203
Go ahead, tell him.

305
00:16:55,567 --> 00:17:00,900
Gustav is my, uh, pet name for Brian jr.
It's a nickname, kind of.

306
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,583
- Nickname, really?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:07,813
It's a rather unremarkable
occurrence between a father and son.

308
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:10,541
Is it true you forced Brian jr.
to lie to your wife and

309
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,941
pretend he was a swedish orphan
whose parents died in a car accident?

310
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,001
- No.
- No?

311
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,292
It was a bullet train accident,
not a car. Get your facts straight.

312
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,071
- But you did make him lie.
- No.

313
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:26,101
I offered him an
opportunity to work with me

314
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,210
to smooth the way towards
building a new family structure

315
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,551
by soft-pedaling, as it were,
the nature of his involvement with me,

316
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,380
and by making it a fun game.

317
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,143
Isn't it also true, reverend Darling,
that you kept Brian jr.

318
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:41,210
on a diet of swedish foods,
including fermented milk and reindeer?

319
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,081
It was once.
It was a 1-day thing.

320
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,952
And didn't you forbid him to
tell the truth to your wife

321
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,201
until he was so paralyzed by fear
and guilt of hellfire and damnation

322
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,412
that he had to confess
the truth himself?

323
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,302
I need help.

324
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:58,163
I've got this little romantic
rendezvous tonight, and, uh,

325
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,551
I was wondering if you could
hook me up with a place to eat.

326
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:02,721
A restaurant?

327
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,840
This girl I like,
she doesn't know who I am.

328
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:07,781
You know, she thinks I'm this
normal parking attendant,

329
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:10,601
and, uh, you know, I just--
I wanna keep it that way.

330
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,101
- Ah.
- So...

331
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:18,901
- Where do people like you go out?
- People like me?

332
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:24,991
Yeah, you know, like poor people.
Where do you eat when you go out?

333
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:26,440
You know, Jeremy,

334
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,193
I actually make a pretty decent
living working for your family.

335
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,802
I've seen you eating your bag lunch,
and, you know,

336
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,911
I don't know what's going on with the
whole silent-movie-star moustache,

337
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:38,440
but it seems
pretty... poverty-related.

338
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,983
You're right, Jeremy. I...

339
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,933
- can't actually afford a beard.
- Oh. that's a good one.

340
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:52,473
In the interest of full poor disclosure,
uh, Maureen and I do enjoy,

341
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:58,460
occasionally, going out for pizza or
a walk down the Brooklyn promenade.

342
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:02,281
That's sweet and simple.
I like it.

343
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:07,333
Sometimes, after, we'll take a
bottle of wine up on the roof and...

344
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:12,700
if the stars are out and
the mood hits us, well...

345
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,420
you know us poor people.

346
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,631
You do the deed Alfresco?

347
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:19,820
Yep.

348
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:21,272
Clarksdale!

349
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,262
You're like the fountain of
middle class romance-formation.

350
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,020
I been called that before.

351
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:33,400
You should prepare yourself, Brian.
We may lose.

352
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:36,231
Do you think? You're the worst.

353
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,380
- Did you even go to law school?
- What did you want me to do?

354
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:42,503
You've lied about this kid from day one,
Brian, and everybody knows it.

355
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:45,761
- I'm sorry I can't change reality.
- Well, then you suck.

356
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,390
I had a plan, and you sabotaged
me every step of the way.

357
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,393
Just go out there and
get them back in here

358
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:52,572
and get a retrial or a
mistrial or something.

359
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,820
This isn't a trial. The arbitrator
makes her recommendation to the judge

360
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,650
based on testimony, and your little
performance in here didn't help.

361
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:01,531
The fact is,
Andrea raised Brian for seven years,

362
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,830
and you had him for two months.
And you made him pretend to be swedish.

363
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,960
So why don't you let me
worry about the law?

364
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,272
Go see Andrea alone,
reason with her,

365
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,303
make her understand how
you feel about Brian.

366
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:15,531
She's his mother.
She wants him to be happy. Good luck.

367
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:22,300
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hey. I don't think

368
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,221
there is an article of clothing Kiki
owns that she is not taking with her.

369
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:29,790
- Taking where?
- To my parents'. We'll drop her off.

370
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,701
I'm going with you to
the country house.

371
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:33,481
You decided to come with me?

372
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,031
- You sure?
- Yes.

373
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,092
I am not going to let the
Darling drama rob me of a chance

374
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,203
to breathe some clean
air with my husband.

375
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,412
Good.

376
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:03,250
Wow.

377
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,690
Yeah, and they only use it,
like, four times a year.

378
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:10,083
Buon giorno, Cari. Oh, leave those.
Albert will get them.

379
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,872
- Told you she'd come.
- It'll be fine.

380
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:13,423
- Told you she'd come.
- It'll be fine.

381
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:15,373
- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

382
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,981
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

383
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,052
Lovely to have you here.

384
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:25,700
Wow. Would you look at that?

385
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:29,992
Oh. Here we go.

386
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,332
Oh, hello.

387
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:40,880
- Well, you must be Simon.
- It is a pleasure to meet you.

388
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,211
- Patrick. Oh-ho.
- Hello, mother.

389
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,710
Simon, how are you?
This is my wife Lisa.

390
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:50,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,711
And this is Karen Darling.

392
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,202
- Karen.
- Hi.

393
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:56,602
- The Karen?
- Yes. Karen.

394
00:21:56,886 --> 00:22:00,132
I'm sure everybody could
use a little drinky-poo.

395
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,233
Hey, you're just in time.

396
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,303
So what are we hunting?

397
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,461
Quail. Might get
a pheasant or two.

398
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,623
- This late in the season?
- Sure.

399
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,883
You're not planning on shooting him,
are you?

400
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,571
Come on, Nick.

401
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,461
You know me better than that.

402
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:34,402
The country makes
everyone so ravenous.

403
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:38,873
Everything's just terrific, mother.
Thank you.

404
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,442
- You're not liking that quail?
- I'm all for sport hunting

405
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,603
and responsible wildlife management,
but actually...

406
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,932
I don't eat meat.

407
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:50,071
Oh, but that's all
the yummy stuff.

408
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,231
Do you eat anything yummy?

409
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,161
- Down, girl.
- Shut up.

410
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:56,961
Well, we can have them cook you
something else. There's trout.

411
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,523
No, no, no,
the salad is enough.

412
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,641
- Everything's wonderful.
- Thank you.

413
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:04,221
Lisa, you must come with me
after dinner to the east wing.

414
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,170
I've been meaning to
show you something.

415
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:11,692
- A little art collection.
- Okay. Sounds great.

416
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,911
It's an hour-and-a-half wait.
Should we just go?

417
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:20,773
- Nah, let me see what I can do.
- Jeremy, it's okay.

418
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:23,313
No, no, hold on.
I can be charming.

419
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:30,062
Excuse me. Could you please
double-check about a table for two?

420
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,772
Actually, it looks like I might
have a table, Mr. Darling.

421
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:38,712
Oh, uh... one more thing.

422
00:23:44,286 --> 00:23:46,870
- Should just be a few.
- Really?

423
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:49,760
Babeson, party of two?

424
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,290
- You got us a table.
- I told a teeny lie.

425
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,502
Happy birthday to you!

426
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:06,062
That was so embarrassing.
My birthday is in march.

427
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:09,352
It was the only way I could get a table.
Just, you know, pretend.

428
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,633
- I'm having a great time tonight.
- Me, too.

429
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,650
You know, it's, uh,
kinda nice going out on a normal date.

430
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,662
And how does this
normal date ends?

431
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:27,040
How about a walk
on the promenade?

432
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,172
How about we go
back to your place?

433
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,091
Uh, that--
that is a much better idea.

434
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,343
Except I can't.

435
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:40,452
I got a friend crashing at my
place for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

436
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:45,643
You know, he's, uh, he's a little
down on his luck, kinda poor, so...

437
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:48,383
Too bad.

438
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:51,420
There is another option.

439
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,631
Isn't there some
way that we can...

440
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:57,110
work something out,
just between us?

441
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,411
Brian, it's too late for that.

442
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:02,701
When that arbitrator delivers
her recommendation to the judge,

443
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:05,672
it's all over,
and I'll abide by that.

444
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,080
Well, of course you will,
'cause it's all gonna go your way.

445
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:09,472
Not his and not mine, yours.

446
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,653
Brian, that first day
that I met you at church,

447
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:16,713
you sat and talked with me for
hours about faith and solace.

448
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:18,542
Yeah, so what about it?

449
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:23,013
So you are the one who taught me to
bring my problems in life to God.

450
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,653
Have you thought
about doing that?

451
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:40,040
I know this whole get-together may
seem a little old-fashioned, but...

452
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:44,953
I thought it was time to cut
through the haze of go-betweens

453
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,620
- and talk in person.
- Hey, I couldn't agree more.

454
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:52,453
Paddy... I'm glad you came.
Thank you.

455
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,040
As long as everything's moving forward,
dad, I'm happy.

456
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:57,530
No hard feelings.

457
00:25:57,818 --> 00:26:01,063
So... what are you
doing with my son?

458
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:03,033
- Doing?
- What?

459
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,673
No, what is the nature
of your alliance?

460
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:07,453
Hold on a second.
Are you kidding?

461
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:10,592
This is none of your business anymore,
dad. You don't have to answer that.

462
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:12,632
No, no, no, I'm happy to.
I'm ecstatic.

463
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,830
I've simply offered myself
to Patrick as an advisor and

464
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:18,602
a friend during this
time of transition.

465
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:24,031
So you're not using him as a pawn
to enact revenge against me, huh?

466
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,713
Um, I think...
that Patrick's pedigree

467
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:30,301
combined with his passion
for social justice

468
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:32,652
is going to make him a
very effective senator.

469
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,671
I'm excited to be on his team,
that's all.

470
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:37,252
Dad, try not to make a
fool of yourself, okay?

471
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:39,653
What's this all about, Tripp?

472
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:46,331
It's about the chilling heartlessness
of a man determined to tear asunder

473
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:51,991
the long-standing family ties
in the course of his vendetta.

474
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:56,230
Do you want to tell them why you want
to destroy my family, or shall I?

475
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,043
You know, Lisa, I, um...

476
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:03,940
I've been meaning to apologize to you,
but I keep putting it off.

477
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:08,562
You know, for the wedding,
for Karen's... behavior.

478
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:12,102
She can be so rash and
thoughtless sometimes.

479
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:15,923
And I know how proud she is,
and she'd never come to you herself.

480
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,702
What are you talking about?

481
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:21,472
You present yourself as a--
some sort of modern-day saint.

482
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:26,473
But that's not who you are at all.
You're not motivated by benevolence.

483
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,632
You're driven from
your very core

484
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:31,982
by an obsessive malevolence
against me and my family--

485
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:35,840
- I've gotta get going.
- Paddy, hear this out.

486
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,850
Tripp, none of this is personal.
It's business.

487
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:46,262
So... your family's history with my
family has nothing to do with it?

488
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,182
What are you talking
about, Tripp?

489
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,431
I didn't know what his
real name was before.

490
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,721
But as soon as I found out,
everything fell into place.

491
00:27:56,096 --> 00:28:00,153
His parents used to work for our family,
for a long time.

492
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:03,200
Do you want to continue,
or shall I?

493
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:05,011
What happened?

494
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:09,670
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I'm sorry. I, uh...

495
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:14,122
Well, I assumed you knew. Um...

496
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:16,702
you and Karen have
been so chilly that--

497
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:18,153
What happened?

498
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:21,173
I would love to hear
what you think you know.

499
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,893
Your father was my
mother's lover.

500
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:27,663
Well, that was the rumor, and my father
couldn't live with those rumors,

501
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:30,950
true or false,
so he dismissed his parents,

502
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:35,142
and they fled to the Soviet
Union with the belief that

503
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:39,383
communism spoke more clearly to
the plight of african-americans.

504
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:42,763
But it wasn't so rosy over there,
was it?

505
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:46,812
His family ended up in
a siberian work camp,

506
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,103
and they died there,

507
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:52,252
leaving you an orphan.

508
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:55,231
Is that true?

509
00:28:57,788 --> 00:28:59,861
It touches on the truth.

510
00:29:00,187 --> 00:29:01,121
Well...

511
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:06,070
you know, Karen was in a bit of a
depression, you know, post-divorce,

512
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,490
and a little intoxicated,
and she...

513
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:18,322
she apparently kissed Nick and
declared her undying love for him.

514
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:22,853
- She can be so impulsive.
- No, it is the truth.

515
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,771
And it's the truth that you
hold me personally responsible

516
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,502
for the death of your parents.

517
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:31,700
See, I don't need some desiccated
old man to tell me my history.

518
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,080
- Desiccated?
- Especially one who gets it all wrong.

519
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,572
My parents didn't go
to Russia by choice.

520
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:40,531
- Your family forced them there.
- No. You've got it all wrong.

521
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,401
I'm not dried meat,

522
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:47,543
and your parents were not deported
from this country, and you know it.

523
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:51,221
No, no. But once their names had been
handed over to the state department,

524
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:54,512
they were, for all intents and purposes,
hounded out of this country,

525
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,852
so, yeah, their deaths lie at the
feet of your family, completely.

526
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,642
All right, I've heard enough.

527
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:03,141
Look, I don't know who's
telling the truth here, okay?

528
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,101
But the fact that you
lured all of us up here

529
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:07,281
for this little
performance of yours

530
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:09,561
and then get everyone else
involved with your game,

531
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,981
that arrogance is precisely why
I stopped trusting you years ago,

532
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:16,372
and why I will never trust you again.
Do you understand?

533
00:30:16,976 --> 00:30:19,900
If you see Ellen,
tell her I've gone out.

534
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:28,793
I'll head home as well.
I wish this had ended differently.

535
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:34,022
Well, it ended exactly as I expected
it to end, with a crafty denial.

536
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,280
- Night, Tripp.
- Good night.

537
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,853
Well, at least it's out
there for everyone to know.

538
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:41,021
Excuse me.

539
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:46,251
It's so sick.

540
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:48,403
Simon. Simon.

541
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,310
- You told me this wasn't an ambush.
- I didn't know anything about it.

542
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:54,582
You need to stop lying to me.
I will not be played.

543
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:57,482
- No one is playing you.
- If that fossil wants a war,

544
00:30:57,715 --> 00:31:00,071
that's exactly what he'll get.
That's what you'll both get.

545
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,572
Simon. Simon.

546
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:07,251
Simon, this was all Tripp.
I had nothing too with it.

547
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,030
- That's the truth.
- The tru-- oh, the truth.

548
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,421
Oh, the truth is pretty
malleable around here.

549
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:16,313
All right, all right.
All right. Just...

550
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:18,012
listen, if we're
gonna go any further,

551
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,912
I need to know one last time
whether you're with me or not.

552
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:23,972
Well, if all you're doing is
exacting revenge, then no, I'm not.

553
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:27,102
Nick, I'm not exacting revenge.
But Tripp Darling owning half the city

554
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,763
is not good for the people of New York.
He is a dangerous man.

555
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:33,050
I know that Tripp has made some
shady business deals, but dangerous?

556
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,350
Yes. Do you remember Kenneth Darling,
Tripp's brother?

557
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:39,420
Simon, come on. The only people who
think that Tripp had anything to do

558
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:42,520
with Kenneth Darling's assassination
are crackpot conspiracy theorists

559
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:45,810
on the internet and two people who
are actually suspects in the killing,

560
00:31:46,098 --> 00:31:48,732
both of whom have since been
completely discredited.

561
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,642
Yeah, you're probably right.
Because bad things don't really happen.

562
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:57,730
It's all just a story. Right?

563
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:14,551
- Where's Nick?
- I'm not sure. Scotch?

564
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:17,000
Uh-oh. It's empty. Sorry.

565
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,073
Were you this drunk when
you kissed my husband

566
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:21,422
and told him that you
loved him at your wedding?

567
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:24,191
Actually, no.
I was sober, and so was he.

568
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,833
- Hey, there you are.
- Be careful.

569
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,272
She just found out about
our kiss at the wedding.

570
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:33,461
- It was not "our kiss," Karen.
- Unbelievable. You are unbelievable.

571
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:39,700
- Why do you do that?
- I didn't tell her, Nick.

572
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:43,003
I thought it was gonna
be our little secret.

573
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,050
How did you think to
come up to this place?

574
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:57,572
Oh, my dad works for them. He told
me they're all out of town, so...

575
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,751
So what does mr. Babeson do?

576
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:05,762
- Who?
- Your dad, silly. Mr. Babeson.

577
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,202
Oh, right.

578
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:10,961
Um, he's the limo driver for
this family, the Darlings.

579
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:19,433
- You've never heard of them?
- No, should I have?

580
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:22,903
No, no. You--
no, you absolutely shouldn't have.

581
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,103
You know what's so
amazing about you?

582
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:31,832
- What?
- Being with you...

583
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:37,263
I feel like it doesn't matter how
much money I have or don't have.

584
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,913
It's like it's just you and me,
you know?

585
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:49,892
Dear God...

586
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:53,961
I don't ask you for much.

587
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:57,201
Well, 'cause I know
I don't deserve much.

588
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:03,540
But please help the arbitrator to
understand that I love my son.

589
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:07,420
Oh! I'm so sorry.

590
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,631
And please give her
the good sense...

591
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,643
I think this is yours.

592
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:14,080
- No, it fell out of your--
- From reverend Darling.

593
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,152
To accept my generous donation.

594
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:22,813
Thank you. Amen.

595
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,693
So you're just gonna
leave right now?

596
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:27,641
I'm going to my parents' house.
I need some time to regroup.

597
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:29,581
Lisa, the only reason
that I didn't tell you

598
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:32,232
was that I didn't want to waste
our time arguing over nothing.

599
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:34,743
It was basically a peck on the cheek--
her lips, my cheek.

600
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:37,292
How many times does she have to kiss
you before you put a stop to it?

601
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,601
I can't control
what Karen does.

602
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,040
Is that going to be your excuse
when you two sleep together?

603
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:43,062
She's delusional, Lisa.
I've told her over and over

604
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:45,361
there will never be anything between us.
But she lives in this world

605
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,050
where she thinks she can
have anything she wants.

606
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,693
Yeah, well,
there is a pattern here, Nick.

607
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:51,082
And for the first time,
I feel like you are taking part in it,

608
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:52,710
whether you believe it or not.
You know what?

609
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,960
I have been pissed offt Karen,
but I have never worried about you.

610
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:56,071
Now I am.

611
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,882
Hey, baby.
What are you working on?

612
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:00,860
You went to see her,
didn't you?

613
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:03,842
Where is she?

614
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:07,433
In a motel...

615
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,043
a few miles from here.

616
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:15,753
Could you at least
take a shower?

617
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:19,470
We didn't... do anything.
It just-- I...

618
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:22,762
look, it's been a rough night,
and I needed to talk to someone.

619
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:28,410
I... I can...
I can tell her things.

620
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:35,560
What-- I... Ellen.

621
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,911
Simon left so abruptly.

622
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,081
How was the meeting?

623
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,051
Ultimately?

624
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,433
Wearying.

625
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:59,501
Sometimes I think I'm almost
ready to leave, you know...

626
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:02,161
this life.

627
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:11,680
I'm glad I married you.

628
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,583
I'm glad I married you.

629
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,203
What the hell was that?

630
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,220
So this was not an assassination
attempt on Patrick Darling?

631
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:30,503
No, this was a simple,
run-of-the-mill hunting accident.

632
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:31,900
Where are the wounds?

633
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:34,903
Mr. Darling sustained injuries--
minor injuries-- to his leg,

634
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:37,300
and he is expected to make
a full and speedy recovery.

635
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:40,223
- Who shot him?
- Nobody shot him, per se.

636
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,651
- This was an accident.
- Fine. Who pulled the trigger?

637
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,673
Charlie Mickelson--
a longtime Darling family friend.

638
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:47,691
He is devastated
by the incident,

639
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:50,141
and we obviously request that
you respect his privacy.

640
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,770
Where is Ellen Darling?
Why hasn't she been here to see him?

641
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:56,361
Ellen is resting at the Imperial,
and she's also quite devastated.

642
00:36:56,595 --> 00:37:00,132
And we all hope that we can just
put this unfortunate episode

643
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,581
behind us and enjoy the
holiday as best we can.

644
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:04,790
Why was the attorney
general hunting at night?

645
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,501
No further questions.

646
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,133
- Jeremy.
- Clark.

647
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,482
Looking forward to the turkey
festivities this evening?

648
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:11,492
I am, I am.

649
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:15,072
I don't know how festive it's gonna
be with Patrick's leg in a sling,

650
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:18,422
but I finally have something to
be thankful for. Let's go, Clark.

651
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,431
- Jeremy?
- Sofia.

652
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,061
I didn't--I didn't know you
were gonna be here today.

653
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,603
You know, the--
Thanksgiving and all.

654
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,073
- What's all this?
- Uh, this? This is--

655
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,041
Oh, of course.
That's your father.

656
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,771
How sweet of him to pick
you up from your work.

657
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,550
Yeah, he is the sweetest.

658
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,801
You are--you-- thank you.
Thank you, pops.

659
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:42,960
- What the hell's going on here?
- Be cool, Clark.

660
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:45,360
Just know you're my father
and our last name is Babeson.

661
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,042
Got it.

662
00:37:46,328 --> 00:37:49,292
Sofia... this is my dad.

663
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:51,053
Mucho gusto.

664
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:53,472
Ah, Babesons don't shake.

665
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:58,081
- Babesons hug.
- Okay. How are you?

666
00:37:58,316 --> 00:37:59,490
I'm good.

667
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:05,701
- Thank you for doing this, Charlie.
- Happy to help out, Tripp.

668
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:10,203
- What did I shoot him with again?
- Double-barreled shotgun.

669
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:13,831
Purdy, 20-gauge, birdshot--
both barrels.

670
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:14,760
Right.

671
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:17,981
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You, too.

672
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,102
Tell Helen we'd love
to see you sometime.

673
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:21,172
Will do.

674
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:23,833
- Thank you.
- You bet.

675
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:29,991
- How's Patrick doing?
- Doped up on sedatives.

676
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:34,400
- Ellen?
- Also doped up on sedatives.

677
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:37,800
You know, this could be...
well, you know...

678
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:39,773
I mean,
it's not going to get out, is it?

679
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,841
I'm just thinking of
Patrick's campaign.

680
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:43,812
Shouldn't be a problem.

681
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:46,980
He's my son.

682
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:49,643
You okay?

683
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:54,241
I said I'd never lie for the family,
and all of a sudden

684
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:57,403
I'm making up stories for the
press about hunting accidents.

685
00:38:57,595 --> 00:38:59,512
Doesn't seem like a step
in the right direction.

686
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:04,892
Hey, you told Dutch you were too
busy to see him, and you weren't.

687
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:05,922
Come on.

688
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,312
Come on, Nick.

689
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,181
Life's messy.

690
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:12,671
Why didn't you tell me that Elder's
parents worked for the family?

691
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,503
The whole point of this
is for him to trust me.

692
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:18,023
I didn't want to put you in a
position where you would have to lie.

693
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,270
And I could not take a chance

694
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:24,173
that his faith in you would
be in any way diminished.

695
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:26,653
So all that was true,
about Elder's parents?

696
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:30,132
Yeah. I mean,
he got it wrong about my parents

697
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,042
reporting his parent to the authorities.
That wasn't them.

698
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:41,500
- It was my father.
- Yeah.

699
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:44,493
That was Dutch.

700
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:48,540
My dad, he was fit to be tied.
If he'd had his way...

701
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,510
I mean, you know, it was the '50s.
They were different times.

702
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:56,601
Dutch got into it,
got them safely put on a boat to Russia.

703
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:02,773
You know...
if you're looking for a motive for...

704
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,871
who killed your dad,

705
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,163
I mean, if Simon Elder knew that
it was Dutch who did that...

706
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,950
- What?
- Isn't that Darling Plaza?

707
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:18,800
Oh, god. That's the third
time I've seen it today.

708
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,593
It doesn't get any easier.

709
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:23,170
Darling Plaza was demolished
today as part of billionaire

710
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:26,801
Simon Elder's redevelopment plan
for a new, greener Manhattan.

711
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:35,102
There is nothing that that
man is not capable of doing.

712
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:41,563
I was hoping it'd be you.

713
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:44,861
- Hi.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

714
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,560
Such as it is.

715
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:49,810
I'm sorry I left, Nick,

716
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,041
but sometimes it is really hard to
deal with this whole situation.

717
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:55,723
Well, I'll quit.
Why don't I quit?

718
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:58,060
I don't want you to quit.

719
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,710
But I feel like
you're slipping away,

720
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:03,671
like things are just spiraling
out of control, for both of us.

721
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,152
Why don't I drive
up there right now?

722
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:09,451
No. We're just about
to sit down and eat.

723
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:12,131
Just take the night, relax.
We'll still be here tomorrow.

724
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,781
All right.
Well, I'll drive up in the morning.

725
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:22,590
I love you, Nick. And I'm...

726
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,361
I'm really-- I'm trying.
You know that, right?

727
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah, I know.

728
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:33,070
I'm trying, too, Lise.
We'll get through this.

729
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,770
I know we will.

730
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:41,220
All right. I love you.

731
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,630
I love you, too.

732
