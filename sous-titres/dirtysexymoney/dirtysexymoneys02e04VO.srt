1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,380
The darlings are helpless babies living in a golden playpen,

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,780
and nick's their nanny.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,000
And by the time he's done cleaning up after them,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,830
there's nothing,and I mean nothing.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,710
left of him for me.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,760
Nick?

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,510
I have made more time for us.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,200
And I've been completely supportive
of lisa wanting to open her own art gallery.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,150
I'm sorry.Can you excuse me just for one second?

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,610
- See?
- Oh,I'm sorry.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,140
It's just-- it's my client who's on trial for murder,but she can wait.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,100
you know,many couples find that creating a special time free from workday distractions.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,390
A meal,perhaps.

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,090
Nick.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,690
I told you,lisa,after patrick's senate campaign is over,

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,580
and letitia's murder trial is done,things will be easier.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,780
It'll calm down.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,090
I promise.

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,350
You two probably feel like you're having a really hard time.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,040
But you're being honest with each other about your dissatisfactions,

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,640
and that's-- 

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,930
all right,look.This one i should probably take.I'm sorry.

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,380
hey,brian.What's up?

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
You kidnapped our son!

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,140
Andrea,our son stowed away on my jet.

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,410
I had nothing to do with it.

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,920
You planted the idea in his head.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,890
The pygmy has a mind of his own.

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,650
And let's face it,unlike you,

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,530
is smart enough to realize he'd be better off here with me.

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,900
I want to be with both of you.

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,900
That's why I stowed away,and that's why I called nick.

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,450
Your son told me he has two weeks off from school,and rather than return to brazil,

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,950
he wants to stay here in new york,splitting his time.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,450
Just for the record,your brother is not exactly a fair arbitrator.

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm not partial to brian.

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,310
Yeah,well,back at you,boss.

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,430
I'm partial to my nephew because,like him,

39
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,900
I had to live through years of my parents' crap,and it's not fun.

40
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,320
You're two adults.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,360
It's two weeks.

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,530
The kid deserves a vacation.

43
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,180
Figure it out.

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,670
Nice work.

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,710
You've created a situation where our son has had to hire a lawyer.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,900
Oh,i created?

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,820
What did I just say?

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,030
You're the one who kidnapped him.

49
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,450
- Say kidnapped again
- kidnapped!

50
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,950
Why do you deliberately provoke me?

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,590
I just said don't say kidnapped again,and you say it!

52
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,960
Hey,how's my favorite felon?

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,490
Oh,she needs a tiny favor.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,370
Well,what is it?

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,260
I have to go to the crown regent to try and settle everything for pat's election night party,

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,260
- but after that
- it's about the party.

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,750
See,well,I want to be there,so if you could get me excused from my house arrest,

58
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,090
I could be there-- you know,for paddy.

59
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,770
Letitia,do you remember ellen's memorial service?

60
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,710
Didn't come off smoothly.

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,370
Brian and I wound up in jail.

62
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,180
So maybe it's best for our case if you start acting like you're actually under arrest.

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,010
mom-bo.

64
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,710
Jeremy.

65
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,390
Anything I can do to help?

66
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,910
help is on the way.

67
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,440
My new fuel,which I'll be ready to produce in mass quantities,

68
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,080
suitable for commercial distribution within the next decade,will--

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,000
I can wait outside here.

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,570
No,noyou got my message.Good.Stay.

71
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,720
This won't take a minute.

72
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,880
Ni hao.

73
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,320
okay.

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,130
So what's cookin'?

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,190
Last week,I asked you to marry me.

76
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,570
I-I know.

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,830
it was very exciting.

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
And I've waited a week for your response.

79
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,490
But I haven't heard a word from you.

80
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,990
Obviously you're not ready to take this to the next level.

81
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,090
really?

82
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,350
Right here?

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,300
If you're not willing to respect me enough to give me an answer

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,480
when i ask you a direct question,we're through.

85
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,490
Forgive me.

86
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,410
What?

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,590
What?

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,270
'Cause we c-c-- we can talk about-- we can talk about this later.

89
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
No,there is no later.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,270
It's over.

91
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,320
Done.Go.

92
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,350
Go.

93
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,160
Sorry.Where were we?

94
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,260
Uh,ah,yes.

95
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,580
The world is changing rapidly.

96
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,550
I need a favor.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,710
I just did you a favor.

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,380
You're double-dipping.

99
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,100
My mom wants to go to patrick's election party at the crown regent.

100
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,790
Two words--house arrest.

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,970
If your mother was up for murder,

102
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,220
and you asked me for a hall pass to go see your brother win an election,

103
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,420
I'd totally do it.

104
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,710
Jeremy,I can't just go into the judge's office

105
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,240
and ask for favors on your mother's behalf.

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,140
That's--that would just be weird.

107
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,280
Not as weird as it would look

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,080
if I went to her office and told her what you just did to me,or.

109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,740
what I'm about to do to you.

110
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Who taught you how to play hardball?

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
You.

112
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,950
I like it.

113
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,080
it's been a rocky road to the senate for eytorn general patrick darling.

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,980
how can anyone not trust that face?

115
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,010
O un camino difícilyou look so honest.

116
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,710
I look so fat.

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,860
With voting to begin in less than 48 hours,

118
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,480
incumbent senator danielle root still holds a narrow 3-point lead in the polls,

119
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,700
placing her in a statistical dead heat with patrick darling.

120
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,930
Please.

121
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,250
you're nervous.

122
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,980
I was.

123
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,630
I was a wreck until you came back.

124
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,080
I don't know how I ever would've faced this alone.

125
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,810
You got this far without me.

126
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,520
Barely.

127
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,060
what?

128
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,590
I just never thought I'd be here,by your side for your biggest moment.

129
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,880
This.

130
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,350
is going to be our biggest moment.

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,270
going public with carmelita?

132
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,440
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,260
I will not keep her hidden anymore.

134
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,080
Election night,whether I win or lose,dad,

135
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,340
inm gog public with our relationship--done.

136
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,030
You do realize,do you not,that there could not possibly be a worse time for this?

137
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,450
You say that like there would be a time that would please you.

138
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,900
What your father is saying,patrick,is that should you win,this revelation.

139
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,010
woulimpair your ability to govern.

140
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,220
To say nothing of how it will steal away the very thunder of a night

141
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,560
that you and i have been talking about,

142
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,900
have been dreaming about,for years.

143
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,550
Then again,of course,that may be your intention.

144
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,480
No,no,no,no.

145
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,750
You two aren't gonna bully me out of this,not this time.

146
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,140
Carmelita's gonna be there by my side,and that's that.Case closed.The end.

147
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,630
See,I'm not like you,dad.

148
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,260
I live from my heart,not my head.

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,490
And that's how I intend to govern once I get to washington.

150
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,960
Mr.Darling is in with someone!

151
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,400
Well,well,well.

152
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,780
Hello.

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,910
- Chas 
- patrick.

154
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,300
Tripp.

155
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,860
I can only imagine what I'm interrupting.

156
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,090
Should I call security,sir?

157
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,700
It's okay.

158
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,080
Hello,chase.

159
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,650
We missed you at the funeral.

160
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,890
What's going on?

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,230
Nick george,chase alexander.

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,880
Chase is ellen's brother.

163
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,340
Been a few years,huh?

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,190
So how's it going,chase?

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,630
Are you still punishing quail down there at sandhill?

166
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,520
Tell you the truth,tripp,I really haven't had the stomach for it this year.

167
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,280
Oh,that's too bad.

168
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,980
- I was thinking
- I know you killed my sister,you son of a bitch.

169
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,030
Hey,listen,I didn't do anything.

170
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,220
- Ellen was the one wh
- patrick,that's enough.

171
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,210
She loved you,and you took her away from mom and me forever,

172
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,260
and you never even loved her back.

173
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,760
That is not true,chase.

174
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
I know you did something,you bastards,and I'm gonna find out.

175
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,260
I'm gonna find out what you did
to my sister,and you're gonna pay.

176
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,880
You're gonna pay,you son of a bitch!

"Dirty Sexy Money s02e04"

179
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,450
Well,you have to do something, Nick.

180
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,790
He's obviously nuts.

181
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,490
He's also kind of right.

182
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,860
Oh,that's rubbish, Nick.

183
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,230
Ellen tried to kill my son,and she died in the attempt.

184
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,460
Her death was accidental.

185
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,420
The events that occurred thereafter were affected only to avert misunderstanding.

186
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,690
The election's tomorrow.

187
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm aware of that,paddy,perhaps even more than you are.

188
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,570
Well,it's obvious that chase is agitated,frantic.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,920
But nonetheless,he's the uncle of my grandchildren,

190
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,450
and,well,I--I'm going to need you to talk to him,nick.

191
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,590
Find out what he wants.

192
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,190
Make him feel safe.

193
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,350
Okay?

194
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,290
<font color="#ffff00">Dirty Sexy Money

195
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,410
I will see what I can do.

196
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,480
I love it,the light.

197
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,140
How much?

198
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,340
What kind of clientele are you prepared to attract?

199
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,840
Uh,I have relationships with a lot of major collectors.

200
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,690
Such as?

201
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,320
The ingersolls,the macmillans.

202
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,970
Pretty tight with lucy lawless.

203
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,930
Lucy's a major collector now?

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
Well,anyone with major taste is a major collector as far as I'm concerned.

205
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,560
That's just me.

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,610
Let me turn on the lights in here.

207
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,110
Bill gates parks his helicopter on the roof of this building when he visits the city.

208
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,980
Bono is a regular at the sushi bar.

209
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,800
And I've never heard of you,or the macmillans.

210
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,630
My money is as good as anybody'S.

211
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,620
It's not,actually.

212
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,530
You're a first-time dealer with second-rate clients.

213
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,050
I wish you'd been more forthcoming when you called.

214
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,920
I wouldn't have wasted your time.

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Thanks.

216
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,730
Hi,I am looking for chase alexander.

217
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,240
Well,this is the number he gave me.

218
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,890
Yes,chase alexander.

219
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,390
Just-- did he say when he might be back?

220
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,790
All right,j--tell him that nick george called.

221
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,750
He has the number.

222
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,770
Okay?

223
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,660
Thank you.

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
The crown regent hotel called.

225
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,080
Good news only,daisy.

226
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,910
Good news.

227
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,290
They wish patrick the best of luck,

228
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,420
but they've suddenly become unavailable for his reception tomorrow night

229
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,780
due to the political leanings of the new owner.

230
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,270
Perfect.

231
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,650
And,nick.

232
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,200
Karen darling's here to see you.

233
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,630
Thank you,daisy.

234
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,430
So what did simon do now?

235
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,640
Asked me to marry him.

236
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,880
And what did you say?

237
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,200
I didn't say anything for a whole week.

238
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,460
- Because?
- I was thinking.

239
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,300
God,nick,I've been married four times.

240
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,000
Even I have shame.

241
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
So what happened?

242
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,910
He dumped me.

243
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,220
And now he won't return my calls,he won't let me see him.

244
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,130
It sounds like he really loves you.

245
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,100
He does love me.

246
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,140
Nick,this is my fault.

247
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,590
This is my fault,nick.

248
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Oh,my god.

249
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,810
I feel so stupid.

250
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,180
You asked me to marry you all those years ago,

251
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,750
and I just let that offer slip away,and now simon.

252
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,570
It's like I marry the guys I don't love,and I lose the ones I do.

253
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,510
God.

254
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,110
Would you talk to him?

255
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,390
You want me to talk to simon?

256
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,120
- Yeah.
- No.

257
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,760
Why not?

258
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,980
Because I think you dodged a bullet.

259
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,470
Look,I don't think simon loves you the way you think he does,not even close.

260
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,100
Then what's the harm in it?

261
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,420
Go to him.

262
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,560
There's nothing you love more than being right,right?

263
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,820
And if simon doesn't love me,I'm sure you'll let me know.

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,250
Please.

265
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Karen,I-- hold on.

266
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,880
hello?

267
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,540
Thanks for meeting with me.

268
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,490
You're not an easy guy to find.

269
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,330
You alone?

270
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,250
Completely.

271
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,730
So I assume you want me to shut the hell up and go away,right?

272
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,350
Not at all.

273
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,700
I just want to hear what you thenk happed.

274
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,080
That's all.

275
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,560
Okay.You really want to know?

276
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,360
I think my sister was fed up with patrick and his girlfriend.

277
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,040
Oh,yeah,I know all about her or him.

278
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,250
My guess is ellenwas gonna leave patrick and take the kids,

279
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,140
and then h hkilled or had her killed.

280
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,790
Then he just dumped her body in that wedding cake castle of theirs

281
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,680
and burned it down to cover it all up.

282
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,350
Divorce--darling style.

283
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,710
Listen,chase,I know that you're in pain--

284
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,560
no,you don't know anything about it.

285
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,290
Now maybe brotheits intuion isn't good enough to send somebody to jail,

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,560
but once I go to the press or the D.A.

287
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,100
Pre and I tell 'em what I know,it'll sure make things hard for patrick tomorrow.

288
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,360
So you go.

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,980
Run and tell tripp.

290
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,840
Bet he thought he had this election in the bag,didn't he?

291
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Well,now he's gonna feel what it's like to lose something.

292
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,050
Yes,Patrick.I spoke to him,and that's as much as we can do at this point.

293
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,870
Nicky.

294
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,880
Oh,you are such a dear-- moving the entire campaign party here just for me.

295
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,310
But you didn't need to.

296
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,530
I had just gotten permission to go out.

297
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,420
Uh,hang on.

298
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,790
What--how--well,how did you manage that?

299
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,390
Oh,jeremy took care of it.

300
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,050
Friend of a friend,he said.

301
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,890
He can be quite charming,you know.

302
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,460
Yeah,yeah.

303
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,210
Charming's a nice way to put it.

304
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,330
Hey,pat.

305
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,460
Did chase seem unstable to you?

306
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,940
Is he still threatening to go public?

307
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Stability is not the first word I'd use to describe him.

308
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,860
Great.Okay,nick.

309
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,490
Uh,see you later.

310
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,340
What's wrong?

311
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,100
Nothing.That was just standard political ops.

312
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,420
for tonight.

313
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,750
It didn't sound like standard political ops.

314
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,640
Who's unstable?

315
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,140
what aren't you telling me,paddy?

316
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,380
Look,if I told you to trust me,would you?

317
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,020
You know I would.

318
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,820
Trust me.

319
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,390
It's nothing.

320
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,660
mona lisa.

321
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,700
Jeremy.

322
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,890
Gettin' her vote on.

323
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,640
I like it.

324
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you following me again?

325
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,420
Heck no.

326
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm exercising my democratic right.

327
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,630
Besides,you'll be relieved to know that my heart is otherwise occupied.

328
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,770
With whom?

329
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,430
Sadly,I cannot say.

330
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,570
Don't let it get you down.

331
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,790
That's not what's getting me down.

332
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,940
What's the matter,nick forget your birthday?

333
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,580
Anniversary?

334
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,200
No!The--the gallery space I'wanting to rent.

335
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,130
They rejected me bause apparently I don't have enough fantastic celebrity clients.

336
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,290
You never mentioned yours truly?

337
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,230
The name "darling" comes up enough in my life,thank you very much.

338
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,250
I respect that.I do.

339
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,660
But it was totally the wrong choice.

340
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,750
Go back to voldert.

341
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,790
Tell him I'll be your partner.

342
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,120
- No way.
- It'll clinch the deal.

343
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,490
And nick would kill me and you.

344
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,120
Not necessarily in that order.

345
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,800
Lisa,lisa,lisa,to see you with your own gallery would be a thing of beauty.

346
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,210
Come on.You know you were put on this earth to tell people what art to buy.

347
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,840
So what if you need to grease the wheels with a little darling oil?

348
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,560
It's just business.

349
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,480
Think about it.

350
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,230
Ciao.

351
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,920
So what'll it be today-- a threat,request,warning?

352
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,010
Question,actually.

353
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
What are you doing with karen?

354
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,840
You proposed to her.

355
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,630
You dumped her.

356
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
What's your game?

357
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,680
You know what?

358
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,250
I'll tell you.

359
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,770
Karen darling only wants what she can't have.

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Am I right?

361
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,650
My guess is,right about now,she's missing the hell out of me.

362
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,360
In about a day or so,if I ignore all of her phone calls and her texts,

363
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,780
she'll be ready to beg me to take her back.

364
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,140
Now when she comes crawling-- and we both know she will--

365
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,370
I'll marry her,take all the shares she has of darling enterprises,

366
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,050
combine them with the shares I've been steadily acquiring,

367
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,370
and,uh,take over tripp darling's company.

368
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,370
Okay.

369
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,310
uh,so why are you telling me this?

370
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,800
well,because,nick,I trust that you'll take the information I've just given you,

371
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,200
and you will put it to good use.

372
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,580
And--and--and don't forget to vote.

373
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,850
I won'T.

374
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,950
Who'd you vote for?

375
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,170
come on.

376
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,950
What?Based on your feelings for the darlings,it's a fair question.

377
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,180
I voted for patrick.

378
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,350
Well,on behalf of the family,thank you.

379
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I'm gonna tell you something you're not gonna like,

380
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,320
but ouwant y to hear me out,okay?

381
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,360
That's an interesting use of our "special time," but okay,go for it.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,750
I can't get the gallery space that I want,

383
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,860
that I need,unless I use a celebrity connection,and,um.

384
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,590
jeremy offered to be my partner.

385
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,620
You went to jeremy for help?

386
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,420
No.No,no,no.

387
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,220
We ran into each other when we were voting,and he said he'd go in on it with me.

388
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,630
No.

389
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,840
He's not after me anymore,nick.

390
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,420
He's fallen for some oth girl.

391
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,140
What girl?

392
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,870
I don't know.

393
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,770
I don't care.

394
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,340
I.

395
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,970
look,I can set boundaries,nick.

396
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,890
I can handle him.

397
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,300
Actually,you've proven that you can'T.

398
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,330
I already set up a follow-up appointment with the owner to try and convince him--

399
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,840
lisa,I don't care.I don't care.I won't allow it.

400
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm just trying to do something with my life.

401
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Well,then try again.

402
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,300
And why don't you try doing it in a way that isn't a tremendous insult to me,

403
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,150
your marriage and your dghter and all the things that we'r in therapy trying to save?

404
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,630
Me having something of my own can be part of saving everything.

405
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,880
Well,lisa,if you want something of your own,then you should do it on your own.

406
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,450
The answer is no.

407
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,460
Thank you so much for our special time.

408
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,500
So you met with chase,you heard him out.

409
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,410
I did.

410
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,680
And his theories,tripp,

411
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,220
about what really happened are not that far from the truth.

412
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,620
Yeah,he's always been sha.

413
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,450
He's also desperate.

414
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,520
I found out that since ellen's death,he's lost his job,

415
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,530
the bank's foreclosing on his house,

416
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,250
and the monthly checks that ellen was sending him have obvious dried up.

417
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,690
So he's a man who has nothing to lose.

418
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,740
Well,methinks we should offer him a way out of this cul-de-sac he's found himself in.

419
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,760
You want me to pay him off?

420
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,600
I won't do it.

421
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,540
By not going to the police,

422
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,260
I am already deeper into this cover-up than I want to be.

423
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,540
We all are,nick.

424
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,650
Trust me,I'm not advocating any further attempts to cover anything up.

425
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,570
So what do you want me to do?

426
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,320
Go back to him with a package--

427
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:12,770
a combination of financial relief in the short run and a long-term plan of some sort,

428
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,420
a position in one of the companies.

429
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,020
He was taking money from ellen.

430
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,170
This is not really any different.

431
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,180
So you want me to pay him off?

432
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,100
I want you to invite him in,nick.

433
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,350
He's family.

434
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,560
And carmelita?

435
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,100
Is pat still dead set on having her by his side for his.

436
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,910
acceptance speech?

437
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,310
Well,I'll have a chat with carmelita.

438
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,020
myself.

439
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,660
Go to chase,nick.

440
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,040
Time,I believe.

441
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,620
is of the essence.

442
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,830
I'm sorry I'm late.

443
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,410
I called your office,and they said you were already on your way.

444
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,620
That's no problem at all.

445
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,050
so listen,um.

446
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,190
I talked with my husband,and.

447
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,690
I'm afraid it's just,uh,it's not going to work out.

448
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,970
I'm--I'm sorry for wasting your time.

449
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm confused.

450
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,530
Your partner's already signed the lease.

451
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,320
My partner?

452
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,730
hello,mrs.Guggenheim.

453
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,490
What--what are you doing,jeremy?

454
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,870
Well,I thought about our discussion.

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,310
I called severin,and voila.

456
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,740
welcome to the lisa george gallery.

457
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,730
Just sign,here and here.

458
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,510
I.

459
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,630
I-I-I can'T.

460
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,480
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,010
Excuse me.

462
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,720
Keep this chilled.

463
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,160
Hey.

464
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm sorry for the,uh,ambush.

465
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,180
You know me.

466
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,640
I can't resist a big entrance.

467
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,790
Ah,jeremy,I appreciate this,but I can'T.

468
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,430
I talked to nick about you helping me,and he went ballistic.

469
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
That's perfectly understandable.

470
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,830
Doing this would cost me my marriage.

471
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,500
It's not worth it.

472
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,000
Doing this won't cost you anything.

473
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,670
Telling nick that you're doing it.

474
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,600
you want me to go behind his back?

475
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,910
I want you to have your cake and eat it,too.

476
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,800
I mean,come on,lise.

477
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,990
Who deserves this more than you?

478
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,160
I have wanted this practically my whole life.

479
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,570
You will totally rock at it.

480
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,730
Yeah.

481
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,330
It's not like nick denies himself anything when it comes to his career.

482
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
Word.

483
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,320
Come on,lise.

484
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,680
Think of yourself for a change.

485
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,860
Nick can never find out about this.

486
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,270
He never will.

487
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,230
Let the tastemaking begin.

488
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,590
Hey,you're late.

489
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,820
is brian jr.With you?

490
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,850
Why would he be with me?

491
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,130
I can't find him.

492
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,400
We were running late this morning,

493
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,950
and I--and I jumped in the shower,and I--brian!

494
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,690
Yeah,nice try.

495
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,200
You were supposed to be here,like,over an hour ago.

496
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,070
Brian,listen.

497
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,090
I am telling you the truth.

498
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,930
I can't find our son.

499
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,040
Brian!

500
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,600
What if he ran away again?

501
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm gonna call the police.

502
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,840
Brian!

503
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,130
tripp,what are you doing here?

504
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,500
Uh,the--the bellboy said he thought it would be better if I were to wait inside.

505
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,470
what do you want?

506
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Patrick let me know that you were planning

507
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,900
to share the stage with him tonight at the victory celebration.

508
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,360
Is that a problem?

509
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,260
Well,for me?

510
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,460
Uh,certainly there are concerns,but my concerns are secondary to my.

511
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,480
concerns for you.

512
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,020
What concerns?

513
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,650
Thatour appearance onstage with patrick could give rise

514
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,910
to unseemly questions about you and about ellen's death.

515
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,120
Ellen's death?

516
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,380
What about it?

517
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,550
Well.

518
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,290
that's complicated.

519
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,780
Complicated?

520
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,700
ellen didn't die in a fire,did she?

521
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,310
Regrettably,no.

522
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,070
then tell me what really happened.

523
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,330
Sit down,dear.

524
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,060
So your house would be paid for in full,

525
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,950
college funds for your girls d woulbe put in place,

526
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,640
established in your name,and like I said,

527
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,820
if you're interested,that position at darling avionics could be yours.

528
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,540
You know,you people make me sick.

529
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,650
Look,chase,if you really feel you have to go to the police or the press with this story,

530
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,190
then I'm not speaking on behalf of the darling family when I say this-- I understand.

531
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,970
I just worry that the amount of money

532
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,690
you're gonna be offered for this story isn't really gonna be enough to solve your problems.

533
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,600
And we both know that there's no guarantee that you'll find the justice you're seeki.

534
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,940
So the truth.

535
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,510
the truth just doesn't matter anymore,does it?

536
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,940
- No,it's just that what you think is the truth
- okay,j-just stop,stop.

537
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,920
Okay,just respect me enough to just stop.

538
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,960
I mean,don't you people.

539
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,540
know when you've won?

540
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,860
I mean,who am I kidding anyway,right,trying to do the right thing?

541
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,510
I got a wife and three kids.

542
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,840
All right.

543
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,110
You can have my silence.

544
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,070
I take it you know where to find me to send the check.

545
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,610
Yeah,we do.

546
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,420
You know,you sounded a lot like tripp darling back there,nick.

547
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,810
He must be so proud.

548
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,720
The polls are about to close,and hopes remain high here at the imperial,

549
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,540
the legendary multistory mansion that patrick darling calls home.

550
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,290
The candidate has been behind closed doors.

551
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,570
With hardly 18% over the incumbent senator,danielle root.

552
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,330
In oswego county,a typically blue-collar haven,

553
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,550
darling is creeping up with a little over 49% of the votes there.

554
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,500
If it strikes anyone as a surprise that darling is doing so well.

555
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,870
Have you seen carmelita?

556
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,740
No,I haven'T.

557
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,120
You put her on the list,right?

558
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,050
Yeah,she's on the list.

559
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,430
Well,I've left her five messages,and she hasn't called back.

560
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,650
- You don't think that tripp
- he just walked in.

561
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,510
Hey,guys.

562
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,570
Dad.

563
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,930
Returns are coming in.

564
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,590
Excuse me for a second.

565
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,620
- Okay?- Yeah.Jeremy.

566
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,580
Wait up.

567
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,530
Nice work on getting that temporary furlough for your mom.

568
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,290
Well,that's me,you know-- jeremy darling,power broker.

569
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,430
You know,something like that requires a motion from the D.A.'S office,right?

570
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,630
That crackerjack legal mind.

571
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,500
You want to tell me who you're friends with over there that has that kind of legal pull?

572
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,950
We're serving domestic limoncello?

573
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,520
Excuse me,nick.I gotta go talk to the help.

574
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,070
Jeremy-- this stuff is toxic!

575
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,340
Um,he's about 4 foot tall,he has a face like a smurf.

576
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,320
Here's a recent picture,and he's 4'2" exactly.

577
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,030
And,uh,she's the one who lost him.

578
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,180
bad in buffalo.

579
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,630
Albany's good.Syracuse?

580
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,010
Still a toss-up.

581
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,900
Did you talk to him?

582
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,990
- Who?
- Simon.

583
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,010
Yeah.Well,we talked.

584
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,750
And-- well,I don't know how to say this.

585
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,750
Okay,he's really calling it off,isn't he?

586
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,590
No,actually,he wants to marry you.

587
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh,god.

588
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,650
Nick,thank you.That's great.

589
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,530
But you shouldn't do it.

590
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,200
Why?

591
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,870
He's using you,karen.

592
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,520
Simon only wants you for your shares in darling enterprises.

593
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,160
It's part of his grand plan to take us over.

594
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,330
How would you know that?

595
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,020
Because he told me.

596
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,740
Why would he say that to you?

597
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,880
Albany's a lock.

598
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,910
That's great.Thanks.

599
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
You are such a jerk.

600
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,420
Karen,listen,it's the truth.

601
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,090
You just want to keep me waiting forever,wishing for you.

602
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:44,980
no.

603
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,410
Uh-huh,but never quite having you.

604
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,850
I thought you were better than that,nick.

605
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,590
- Karen
- what happened to you?

606
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,480
I.

607
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,270
with 4% of the vote counted,it's too close to call.

608
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,180
Poll watchers around the state are reporting record turn-out

609
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,690
despite inclement weather in some of the precincts

610
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,770
around the adirondacks and great lakes.

611
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,100
It's an election that has inspired voters of every description,

612
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,930
poughkeepsie to the hamptons,t

613
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,140
o make their voices heard,possibly because no one.

614
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,250
you came.

615
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,610
I did,but I can't stay.

616
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,240
What's the matter?

617
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,380
I know everything.

618
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,930
About what?

619
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,190
Ellen's death.

620
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,150
I.

621
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,470
did not kill her.

622
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,980
I know that.

623
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,410
I know she attacked you.

624
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,200
I know she slipped and fell.

625
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,100
I know you moved her body and burned her to avoid some scandal.

626
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,410
Who told you this?

627
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,800
It doesn't matter.

628
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,570
What matters is I can't be with someone

629
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,370
who's capable of taking part in such a massive lie.

630
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,530
Sweetheart,please.

631
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,200
It's not a discussion,paddy.

632
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,800
I moved back after all these months

633
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,480
because I wanted to be with the man that I loved.

634
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,910
But I don't know him anymore.

635
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,700
Carmelita,please.

636
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,330
Good-bye.

637
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,650
Let me go.

638
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,270
Just.

639
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,080
tell me who told you this.

640
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,810
Please,just.

641
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,100
just tell me that.

642
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,900
I've--I've--I've always believed he was bound for greatness.

643
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,700
He just carried himself differently from other children.

644
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,630
Would you all please excuse us for a moment?

645
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,060
My father and I need to discuss something privately.

646
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,810
Excuse me.

647
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,850
I want to talk to you.

648
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,100
You make me sick.

649
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,920
What's happened?

650
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,450
You told carmelita?I spoke to carmelita,yes.

651
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,090
When are you gonna learn to stay the hell out of my life?

652
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,090
It was,in my opinion,necessary for her sake.

653
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,820
- I know how much she means to you
- so you drove her away?

654
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,970
Patrick,why don't we deal with this later?

655
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,870
No,you stay out of this,nick.

656
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,130
This is a family matter.Got it?

657
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,470
I didn't drive her away.

658
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,360
Is that right?

659
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,310
Will you please expin to him that it would never have worked out having carmelita by his side?

660
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,800
It wouldn't have been seemly.

661
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,040
And it would not have been safe for her.

662
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,790
What about me,dad?

663
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,440
Why can't you just finally admit you've made this election all about you?

664
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,180
Nick,will you please explain to him that what I did was the right thing to do?

665
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,210
I know that's how you saw it.

666
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,180
Nick.

667
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,320
Oh,my god.

668
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,750
You can't even convince him?

669
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,410
You pay him to buy your crap.

670
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,600
Enough,patrick!

671
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,400
Good lord.

672
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,640
Oh,what now?

673
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,640
- Tripp?
- No.

674
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,320
Dad?

675
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,650
Oh,my god.

676
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,640
Tripp?

677
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,380
Dad?

678
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,280
Tripp?

679
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,220
No shortage of behind-the-scenes drama tonight as just moments ago,

680
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,000
tripp darling,the family patriarch and father to senate candidate patrick darling,

681
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,750
was rushed by ambulance here after suffering ?

682
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,170
en ambulancia an apparent heart attack.

683
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,150
He was lucky,actually.

684
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,900
The E.K.G.Confirms that mr.Darling suffered an M.I.,

685
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,630
But there should be no lasting damage to his heart.

686
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,870
thank god.

687
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,040
he'll sleep awhile.

688
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,600
I advise you all to go home and do the same.

689
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,260
Thank you,doctor.

690
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,870
thank you.

691
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,840
Patrick,mom,come in here.

692
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,180
Quick.Come on.

693
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,370
With 78% of precincts reporting,we are calling a winner.

694
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,390
The newest senator from the state of new york is patrick darling.

695
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,460
It looks like his native manhaan has come through for the city's favorite son.

696
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,030
will wonders never cease?

697
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,960
I'm so proud of you.

698
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,640
Thank you.

699
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,920
Hey,look what I found at election headquarters.

700
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,840
The fuzz rounded him up.

701
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,810
oh,thank god.Baby.

702
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,230
Where the hell have you been?Where have youeen?

703
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,350
I didn't want to hear you and mommy fight anymore.

704
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,570
S-so you ran away?

705
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,290
I took the subway to coney island.

706
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,720
But then it starte to get dark,so I left.

707
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,840
And I got kinda lost.

708
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,510
Well,the important thing is that you're safe now,okay?

709
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,450
And you don't do that again,okay?

710
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,920
- Okay.
- You don't do that again.

711
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,290
All right.

712
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
congratulations,pat.

713
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,680
I kns it'not how you planned it,but.

714
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,490
thanks.

715
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,040
Look at him-- like freddy krueger,

716
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,410
just waiting for a chance to kill again.

717
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,840
You're angry.I get it.

718
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,450
No.

719
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,050
I'm not angry.

720
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:04,340
because now I understand how tripp darling lives,works,operates.

721
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,480
fully.

722
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,230
Victories have costs.

723
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,850
Maybe I should take a little less patrick darling down to washington and,uh.

724
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,590
a little more tripp.

725
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,260
Well,that'll make your father happy.

726
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
Oh,no,it won'T.

727
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Brian,um,scheduling-wise,

728
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,810
- I think you know that I-- tonight is
- yeah,I know,andrea.

729
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,460
It's your night with him.

730
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:52,040
I know how eager you must be to have another chance to lose him again.

731
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,240
no,no.

732
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,800
What I meant was,why-- why don't we just take him home together?

733
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,830
We need to work this out.

734
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,030
Yeah,okay.

735
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,900
Sorry if I was a little rough on you before.

736
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,990
No punches thrown.

737
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,230
Kinda progress for us,huh?

738
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,790
Yeah.

739
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,460
Hey,jeremy,could you do me a favor?My phone is dead.

740
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,900
Keep it.

741
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,650
I got extras.

742
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,380
Thanks.

743
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,200
daddy.

744
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,020
I think I'm kinda in over my head.

745
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:53,720
I know you told me not to get emotionally involved with simon,but I did,and now.

746
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,410
nick is telling me that simon only wants me so he can take over the company.

747
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,510
I don't know what to do.

748
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,100
You know,you're gonna have to learn how to make decisions without his help,

749
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
because one day.

750
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,940
I know.

751
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,960
Okay.

752
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,400
Bye.

753
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,110
Go home.I'll stay.

754
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,360
Oh,no,nicky.

755
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,310
That's not necessary.

756
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,380
Well,actually,it is.

757
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,310
Your hall pass runs out in ten minutes.

758
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,030
Oh.I don't think we want another nola lyons production.

759
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,790
You make your point.

760
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:01,490
The last one by his side,nicky,out of everyone.

761
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,130
shouldn't you be at your brother's coronation?

762
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,030
No.

763
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,220
This is more important.

764
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,940
I'm listening.

765
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,020
I.

766
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,430
I'm sorry.

767
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,410
That's it?

768
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,710
No.

769
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,050
I want to say yes.

770
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,470
Uh,yes.

771
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,820
to what?

772
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,070
yes,I'll marry you.

773
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,070
If the offer still stands.

774
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,390
It does.

775
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,940
Hey,sweet cheeks.

776
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,130
Hello?

777
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,520
hello?

778
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,430
jeremy?

779
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,560
how'd paddy do,nick?

780
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,310
He win?

781
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,370
Yeah,he won,tripp.

782
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,380
He won.

783
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,880
that's quite a day,for any couple.

784
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,140
A happy ending,at least.

785
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,310
For the darlings.

786
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,730
What about the georges?

787
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,880
How about their happy ending?

788
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,300
I got the gallery.

789
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,390
Yeah?

790
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,640
All on my own.

791
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,820
No help from jeremy.

792
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,550
I...

793
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,590
I was gonna tell you.

794
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,870
Well,that's great.

795
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,050
That is great.I am very proud of you.

796
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,630
Thank you.

797
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,220
I'm sorry.

798
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,100
I forgot to turn it off.

799
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,880
Sorry.

800
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,270
I'm--I'm--I'm here.

801
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,880
Like I said.

802
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,350
If the two of you can keep being
honest with each other,you can.

803
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,040
Overcome anything.
