00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,370
I really like your shower.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,460
Well, to be honest with you,
baby, it's better with you in it.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,840
All these nozzles--
they're very useful.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,870
I am never getting out of here.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,210
karen's phone.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,890
Uh, yeah. Is karen there?

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,760
She's busy, nick.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,590
Can I take a message?

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,320
no, that a right. Thanks.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,840
No, thank you.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,470
who s that?

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,530
Oh, it was A... wrong number.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,200
are you ready to help me with that
little thingy I need help with?

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,190
oh, yeah. I'm coming right up.

16
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,400
look, I know this isn't easy, so
anytime you want to talk about it,

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,100
we can talk about it, okay?

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,120
Do you still love mom?

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,210
- Yes, but--
- but what?

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,710
You said we could talk about it.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,330
Right, but there are some questions which-- I
mean, it seems like there's a direct answer to--

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,350
- or a relatively direct
answer-- - too many words, dad.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,030
What do you want from me?

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,510
- Kiki!
- Mom!

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,730
Listen, everything's in the
bag-- the pajamas, toothbrush--

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,200
there's also a permission slip
for a field trip you have to sign.

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,640
Thanks.

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,580
Um, I will see you in 48 hours.

29
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,650
Well, unless you want
to talk before that.

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,280
About?

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,520
I don't know. Us?

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,100
Kiki, can I have a minute? Thank you.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,340
All right, listen, we've
tried the separation.

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,680
It's been two weeks. It's enough.

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,910
It's certainly been enough for kiki.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,010
I'm not going to get together
with you just to be judged.

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,370
Lisa, I want to make this work, okay?

38
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,640
So let's have your mom watch kiki tonight,
and we'll have dinner, just to talk.

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,140
Say yes, mom.

40
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,120
are you sure you're
all right, mrs. Darling?

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,260
You seem a little... giddy.

42
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,120
Of course I am, clark.

43
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm a free woman, giddy to drink in
the colors of the fall before they fade.

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,940
Mrs. Darling, I could...
I could drive if you want.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm fine.

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,060
I barely touched my mimosa
at breakfast good day.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,860
so, simon, what exactly brings you here?

48
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,290
I heard you had opened a gallery, so I just wanted
to stop in and take a look, d then I saw this.

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,490
Thgh he's a little too obvious with his derivations
without being really clear about his intentions, I

50
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,100
I just--I keep
coming back to it.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,780
Best kind of art is the kind you
can't make up your mind about.

52
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,600
- Ambivalence.
- Exactly.

53
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,560
We both know a lot about that, hmm?

54
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm sorry?

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,170
I mean, we're both with people
who can'make up their minds.

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,240
I thought you said you
came here for the art.

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,720
I did. I did. I'll take the painting.

58
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,680
And while I'm here, lisa,
I'll also give you this.

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a conversation between my karen and
your nick captured by my security cameras.

60
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,260
It's worth watching, even if...

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,470
just to clear up a few ambiguities.

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,450
Yeah? Well, let me
clear up some of yours.

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,310
I'm not sure what kind of thing gets you off, but
I'm not the kind of woman who spies on my husband.

64
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,780
will that be cash or charge?

65
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,020
well, let me spell it out for you.

66
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,380
Everyone you recommended, dad, to be
my chief of staff-- every one of them--

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,850
in one way or another, belongs to you, and I need
someone who will be working for me, ergo nola.

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,960
She prosecuted your mother.

69
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,130
Exactly.

70
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,530
What better way to demonstrate
that I don't hold a grudge

71
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,640
and that I'm someone who's willing
to reach across the aisle and--

72
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,140
oh, paddy.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,860
Mr. Darling, perhaps your
heari isn't what it used to be.

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,590
I beg your pardon.

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,300
your son has already given me the job.

76
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,760
Now let's get down to business.

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,220
What do you suggest, nola?

78
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,360
Committee assignments. We
hear you folks have thoughts.

79
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,810
I fish in hampshire in england...

80
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,190
every year with the
chairman of foreign affai.

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,330
He can get you a seat.

82
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,510
That's great, dad,
except we were thinking--

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,970
you're not listening, patrick.

84
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,000
Foreign affairs.

85
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,490
It positions you perfectly for a
first-term run at the white house.

86
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,710
We've got a different idea.

87
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,720
Oh, but of course you do.

88
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,790
Well, let's-- let's
hear them out, tripp.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,850
With all the recent controversy--
you know, the death, the fire,

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,750
the transsexuality of it all-- we think
avoiding the spotlight would be best.

91
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,370
Show we're sious.

92
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,800
We're thinking agriculture.

93
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,170
Agriculture?

94
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,270
You heard it right, dad. Agriculture.

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,960
Patrick wants to not exploit his family
connections too avidly right out of the gate.

96
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,270
All right. Okay.

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,070
You'vebviously come here
with your minds made up.

98
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,680
I profoundly regret that pretending to respect
me has taken up so much of your precious time.

99
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,830
It was really nothing.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,620
I couldn't agree more.

101
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,390
Your father doesn't like
strong women, does he?

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
He likes mom.

103
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,120
I said strong, not murderous.

104
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,870
What are you doing here? What the hell?

105
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,130
What is she doing here?

106
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,220
She's my chief of staff.

107
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,590
We've got a meeting in the mayor's
office in ten minutes, senator.

108
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,260
Sorry, jerms. Gotta run.

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,580
* who do you think you are?mr. Big stuff

110
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,550
* you're never gonna get my love

111
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,170
* now because you wear
all those fancy clothes

112
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,470
* oh, yeah and have a big, fine car

113
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,190
* oh, yes, you do now do
you think I can afford...

114
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,560
oh,my.

117
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,710
it wasn't my fault.

118
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,070
You were inticated and
you were driving the coupe.

119
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,260
Poor girl.

120
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,890
Well, the doctor said
she's gonna be fine, tripp.

121
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,550
He meant the coupe.

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,470
You should thank your lucky stars, tish.

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,030
The young woman agreng
to be treated here

124
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,280
saves us the possibility of
this turning into tabloid fodder.

125
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,340
She rode up on that bicycle out of
nowhere, only blocks from our house.

126
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,750
I mean, this is obviously
some sort of a scam.

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,480
Well, it happened to my friend
lucy tennbrook only last year.

128
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,620
Oh, she lost millions.

129
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,160
I say we go back to that
intersection and talk to witnesses.

130
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,850
Absolutely not.

131
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,130
We are two weeks removed from your
having been on trial for murder.

132
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,180
The last thing we need
is another scandal.

133
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,440
He's right, I'm afraid.

134
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,560
She'll be better taken care
of here than in any hospital.

135
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,910
Lovely.

136
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,030
speak with the young woman, nick.

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,030
ah, you're awake. Mind if I come in?

138
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,220
Um, who are you?

139
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,750
Nick george, family lawyer.

140
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,990
Oh, of course.

141
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,850
Um, wrenn darcy.

142
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,890
Nice to officially meet you.

143
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't worry. I'm not
planning on suing anyone.

144
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,580
Well, whether you decide to sue
or not is entirely up to you.

145
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,510
I'm just here to make sure
you have everything you need.

146
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,270
Well, then you're good at your job.

147
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,290
I have an on-call nurse and a maid

148
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,720
and this person who just
keeps fluffing my pillow.

149
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,210
Welcome to life with the darlings.

150
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,670
Is there anyone I should
call, let 'em know you're okay?

151
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,410
Um, no.

152
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,340
My family is all up in maine.

153
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,180
Besides, they don't
really worry about me.

154
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,330
Believe it or not, working the fragrance counter
at bendel's makes me the success of the family.

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,870
I should probably go.

156
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,420
No, wait. The doctor wants us to watch you for a
while and make sure you don't have a concussion.

157
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:47,490
Trust me, I'm-- I'm completely sound so please
thank the darlings for their hospitality.

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,430
Tell them if they ever need
a house sitter... just...

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,460
You a little dizzy?

160
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,470
A little.

161
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,240
All right. Well, just,
uh, just rest, okay?

162
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,630
What?

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,490
Uh, you're just not my
idea of a family lawyer.

164
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,940
Get some rest.

165
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,350
Okay, counselor.

166
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,780
it's worse than I thought.

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,870
At this stage, unfortunately, the only
treatment with any real odds of success

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,570
would be coutinus rounds
of high-dose chemotherapy.

169
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,320
And so what are those odds?

170
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,400
Optimisticly, about 10%
chance of surviving 12 months.

171
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,930
in bed...

172
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,760
sick, in never-ending pain?

173
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,960
So what, are you just gonna give up?

174
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,700
I want to spend the time that I have
left teaching our son how to live, brian,

175
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,060
not how to die.

176
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,420
I can't say that I would recommend your
choice, but I certainly understand it.

177
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,830
So what about the good stuff?

178
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,990
The good stuff?

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,250
The N.I.H.Trial I read about
at this hospital, quackenbush.

180
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,740
The waiting list to get into the next
run of that trial is over a year long.

181
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,860
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,280
Hey, grim reaper, I know how this works,

183
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,130
so how much is it gonna take
to get her into that trial?

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm gonna pretend we're not
having this conversation.

185
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,270
Good. I'm gonna pretend I'm
talking to a human being.

186
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
There's a woman in there
thwi an 8-year-old son.

187
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,480
The sad truth, mr. Darling, is that there are
thousands of women with equally life-threatening cases

188
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,330
who actually want the treatment.

189
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,440
You want to play
rough? Let's play rough.

190
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,170
You know that building you're about to break
ground on, the $100-million children's cancer wing,

191
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,330
the one bearing your stupid name?

192
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,000
What if I prevent my family from
signing the check they promised?

193
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,160
It's andrea's decision, mr. Darling.

194
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,050
My family's putting up
half the jing for that wing.

195
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,010
You make it happen.

196
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll take care of andrea.

197
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,640
She's gonna be okay.

198
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,970
And she's not looking
to make any trouble.

199
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,990
Thank god.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,450
But I think for her sake and for
the sake of avoiding a scandal,

201
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,240
you're going to have a
houseguest for a while.

202
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,180
Nicky, do you honestly think
it's safe ving her here?

203
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,090
As long as you don't take her for a dve.

204
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,100
letitia...

205
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,020
whatever the girl needs, she shall have.

206
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,420
She's the injured party.

207
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,710
That's how it should be.

208
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,570
Shades of lucy tennbrook.

209
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,100
you're kidding me, right?

210
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,410
You say you want me out of your life, and
then you get a job working for my brother?

211
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,750
I fell on hard times.

212
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,560
Or should I say I was pushed?

213
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,330
Or maybe it's neither one.

214
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,190
Maybe you are just obsessed
with all things darling.

215
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,590
I mean, if you're not prosecuting
a darling, you're sleeping with one.

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,270
If you're not sleeping with a darling...

217
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,090
what exactly are you
doing for my brother?

218
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,210
Patrick, unlike some people
to whom he's related, has guts.

219
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,120
He was generous enough to give me a second chance
when my career fell into the crapper thanks to you.

220
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,470
Oh, so this is your way of getting back
at me, right, by cozying up to patrick?

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,270
Get over yourself, jeremy.

222
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,170
I have.

223
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,170
You should, too, pronto.

224
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,910
you look pretty.

225
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,040
Thank you.

226
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,650
Kiki and I spent an hour and
a half picking out this outfit.

227
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,650
can you imagine? Being nervous
for a date with my husband.

228
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,400
Not to say this is a date, because I...

229
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,040
how are you doing?

230
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,170
Honestly?

231
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,500
It's weird after all these
years to wake up alone every day.

232
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,320
I guess I'd feel pretty weird,
too, if I was actually sleeping.

233
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,320
You know, you could move back in?

234
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,440
I want to make this work, lise.

235
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,890
I do, too, completely, but I...

236
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,060
but?

237
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,820
Simon eldestopped by the gallery today.

238
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,850
What the hell did he want?

239
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,360
He bought a painting, a very expensive
one, and he mentioned something about karen,

240
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,540
about a
conversationou had--

241
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,060
I did speak with karen recently.

242
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,840
- I told her not to marry simon.
- Okay.

243
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,840
The only reason that simon wants to marry her
is to get control of darling enterprises stock.

244
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,600
I had to tell her not to
do it. I was doing my job.

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,490
I want us to work,

246
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,220
but we--we can't if karen is always going
to be lingering on the edge of our lives.

247
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,210
- We can'T.
- She's not.

248
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
Promise me.

249
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,430
karen darling will no longer be a
part of your life-- or ours--anymore.

250
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,900
I promise you, karen
darling and I are done.

251
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,030
nick george is here to see you.

252
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay, send him in.

253
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,800
That's all for now,
gentlemen. Thank you.

254
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,960
Well... hello, nick.

255
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,540
You don't seem too
happy. What's the problem?

256
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,820
The problem is that you need
to stay away from my wife.

257
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,370
okay, I can't speak for you,
but usually, when I'm this angry,

258
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,350
it's from a lack of perspective.

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,180
So...

260
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,630
so let me help you out.

261
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,580
Save the company.

262
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,610
I don't care about the company.

263
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,880
At least, it's not my first concern.

264
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,690
Well, then what is?

265
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,170
You...

266
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,940
and me.

267
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,020
Now it not on youtube
ye but what do you think?

268
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,400
It's good for a few hits, hmm?

269
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,720
his company are insane.

270
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,380
You can't just show up here whenever
you want and screw with my head, nick!

271
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,790
I know!

272
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm sorry, okay? You're right.

273
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,330
Karen, I don't want to see
you make a huge mistake.

274
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,760
Then step up.

275
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,890
see?

276
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,850
You mess with my lady, you mess
with my stuff, I mess with yours.

277
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,910
Just consider it a life lesson.

278
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,590
I mean, you can't learn everything
you know from tripp darling.

279
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,990
I'show you out, but I have a
feeling, by now, you know the way.

280
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,810
So...

281
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,130
what do you think?

282
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:44,530
I think I'm a lucky man, able to look at someone I
love and know she feels exactly the same way for me.

283
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,230
That's the most precious
thing in the world.

284
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,160
let me take you out tonight.

285
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,060
Oh, I'm sorry. I can'T.
I have a family dinner.

286
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,900
With the same family that disowned you?

287
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,210
Well, yeah, mommy made me promise I'd
come so she'd have somebody to gossip with

288
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,580
while daddy and patrick argue over
what senate committee he's gonna be on.

289
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,260
so that's what goes at
these darling family dinners?

290
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,920
Yeah.

291
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,320
"Page six" would be very disappointed.

292
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,660
but I will see you after, though, okay?

293
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,870
- You bet.
- Okay.

294
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,870
All right.

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,130
Oh, come on. Up you go.

296
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,130
- Caught you lookin'.
- Yes, you did.

297
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,080
what?

298
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,740
There's a dinner
tonight at the imperial.

299
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,740
Do what you have to, just
make sure you're there.

300
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,600
Relax. I told you, patrick's
ready to go with agriculture.

301
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,630
Tripp gave in.

302
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,790
Okay, don't be fooled.

303
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,020
One thing tripp darling
doesn't do is give in.

304
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,190
I can't launch my biofuel next quarter
without some high-profile political support.

305
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,100
I need patrick on that committee.

306
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,150
I'm not interested in spending any more
time with these people than I have to.

307
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,020
Then let me be the
first to remind you...

308
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,310
you have to.

309
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,290
hey, swami, big news. You're in.

310
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,090
In what?

311
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,030
The trial.

312
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,150
The experimental cancer
drug-- I pulled some strings.

313
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,460
I told you I didn't want treatment,
experimental or otherwise.

314
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,010
Do you know what it took
me to get you into this?

315
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,510
Let me guess, brian. Money?

316
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,400
You amaze me.

317
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,760
because I have values?

318
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,700
Because you're so selfish!

319
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,940
You know, whatever you think you're
proving by doing yoga and burning incense

320
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,480
when you should be
taking medicine--

321
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,810
I am proving that there is more
to life than avoiding death.

322
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,640
Listen to me, you willful bitch.

323
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,810
You're gonna take the meds and thank me.

324
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,870
You are such an idiot.

325
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,120
Why do you get to me so?

326
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,970
I'm not bothering you, am I?

327
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,690
Not in the least.

328
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,680
In fact, it's a pleasure to
hear. Please... keep playing.

329
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,180
Okay.

330
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,980
don't be fooled. This...

331
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,930
this is the only song I can play.

332
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,330
I'm what my piano teacher
called... unmotivated.

333
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,770
I'm glad you're up and about.

334
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,210
It's a good sign.

335
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,760
And truth be told, it's been
refreshing to have you in the house,

336
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,710
though I regret the circumstances
that brought you to us.

337
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,030
My wife...

338
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,840
she keeps life interesting.

339
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,760
Yeah. I read the papers.

340
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,220
Well, you must love her very much.

341
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,180
I do... actually.

342
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:17,660
It's admirable, standing so faithfully beside
someone who's been less than faithful to you.

343
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,620
Everyone I know thinks
you must be a saint.

344
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,220
a saint?

345
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,510
uh, no, hardly.

346
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,830
Simply a man who...

347
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,210
40-some years ago...

348
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,070
found the girl of his dreams.

349
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,300
And... I don't want toet go.

350
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,500
- I hope that wasn't out of line, bringing that up.
- No.

351
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,960
- I just-- - on
the contrary, I...

352
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,940
I appreciate it.

353
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,900
I have friends.

354
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,900
I see them every day at the club.

355
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,090
And they have yet to mention it.

356
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,770
Well, can I tell you something?

357
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,530
of course you can.

358
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,730
It's nice to meet someone who...

359
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,270
can afford to take a
million second chances,

360
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,520
but you still hold on to the first one.

361
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,220
Thank you for that.

362
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,500
Anytime.

363
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,730
What's cookin'?

364
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,830
you said you wanted an
answer, and I have one.

365
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,420
Oh, neat.

366
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,450
So... what's it gonna be?

367
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,100
Not like I'm impatient after
waiting on you for 15 years.

368
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,640
If it wasn't for simon,
I might even wait forever.

369
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,110
nick george's office.

370
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,790
is he in?

371
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,340
He's in a closed-door meeting.

372
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,480
With whom?

373
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm not sure.

374
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,340
Daisy, it's me. You can tell me.

375
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,870
I can't do it.

376
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,050
Is it karen darling?

377
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,550
Yes. Do you want to leave a message?

378
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,950
Is that your final answer?

379
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,290
no. There'lle no mesge.

380
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,690
Final answer.

381
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,990
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

382
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,240
Look, I have to make
things work with lisa.

383
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,110
I owe it to her. I owe it to kiki.

384
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,430
And what about you?

385
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,470
I want to do the right thing.

386
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,510
Of course you do.

387
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,860
And I love lisa.

388
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,140
I love you, too. I always
have, and you know that.

389
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,530
But I just--she's my wife, and look, I
can't apologize for doing the right thing.

390
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,040
hi, simon? Lisa george.

391
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,390
I want to see what's on that disc.

392
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,930
everybody.

393
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,670
Everybody.

394
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,130
We are gathered together tonight
to celebrate our perseverance

395
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,830
and to remind ourselves that we must
never take for granted our hard-earned...

396
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,890
second chances.

397
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,740
To letitia's freedom.

398
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
I'll drink to that.

399
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,390
And to my princess karen...

400
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,340
with a fifth and, it
is hoped, not final...

401
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,350
tripp.

402
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,410
Wedding forthcoming.

403
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,750
Thanks, daddy.

404
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,200
And to patrick, who has weathered
this exceedingly difficult year

405
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,740
and has found himself in
the united states senate.

406
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,730
you're one step closer
to pennsylvania avenue,

407
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,510
and you're gonna get there
if you play your cards right.

408
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,720
My cards are my business, dad, but
thanks for the vote of confidence.

409
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,450
To family.

410
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,500
- To family.
- To family.

411
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,590
To family.

412
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,200
- nicky.
- yeah.

413
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,870
Where's lisa? I thought you
two were making a go of it.

414
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,790
We are. She's moving back in on monday.

415
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,940
But she and kiki are...

416
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,850
well, they're having a girls' night.

417
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,180
I can't tell you how
pleased I am to hear that.

418
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,480
I wish my husband had your same
willingness to forgive and forget.

419
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,110
Unfortunately, he's just a
little too enchanted by our...

420
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,150
little con artist to realize
what he could lo, financially...

421
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,260
and otherwise.

422
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,600
oh, hello, boris, natasha.

423
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,340
Say hello to gabby and portia.

424
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,950
Back-up singers for the new
song J. T. And I just wrote.

425
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,010
It's called "moving on."

426
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,650
you should get the ringtone.

427
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,260
- Hey, uncle jeremy.
- Hey, muchacho.

428
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,560
What do you think you're doing?

429
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,390
There's no alcohol for you.

430
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,350
Excuse me?

431
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
Sorry. Not my rules.

432
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,370
But the medical trial has
very strict requirements.

433
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,830
You think because I had sex with
you, that means I changed my mind?

434
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,790
You may find this hard to believe, brian,
but the sex wasn't that mind-altering.

435
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,650
Well, then you tell our son that you have the
big "c" and that you're doing nothing about it.

436
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,850
And then afterwards, you
two can go coffin shopping.

437
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,030
and here she is, ms. Chief of staff.

438
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,770
I wish patrick had given me more notice.

439
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,370
I wasn't expecting that
you'd attend a family dinner.

440
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,710
Professional hazard.

441
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,970
Despite what you think, ms. Lyons,
I harbor no ill will towards you,

442
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,380
and I hope you perform your
tasks for patrick with the same...

443
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,630
single-mindedness with
which you prosecuted me.

444
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,520
That's very gracious of you.

445
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,550
Oh, and I...

446
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,810
I just hope that there are
no hard feelings about your...

447
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,570
doomed relationship with my son...

448
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,290
jeremy.

449
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,770
Yeah.That was my mistake

450
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,740
oh, no, dear.

451
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,830
That was no mistake, not at all.

452
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,560
Agriculture? It'll seyou back years.

453
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,810
I c--ian't believe you're
even considering it.

454
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm doing more than considering, dad.

455
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,360
I've made up my mind.

456
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,430
It's that woman.

457
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,140
That woman's influence
is destroying you.

458
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,340
It has nothing to do with her.

459
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,570
Have you asked yourself exactly
what it is she wants from you?

460
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,320
Maybe she's the only one that
doesn't want something from me, dad.

461
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,910
Evsi conder that?

462
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,460
Now I like what you just said
ithere about second chances.

463
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,570
Why don't you take your own
advice and support me for a change?

464
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,410
hey there. Look at you.

465
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,090
How's the boarder?

466
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,280
Far from bored.

467
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,850
Karen lent me this dress.
I thk it goes for 10 grand.

468
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,700
Nice.

469
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,030
It must be strange for you.

470
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,240
How so?

471
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,420
Just being around this all the time.

472
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,460
Yeah, yeah. Definitely strange.

473
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,350
You're married, right?

474
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,030
I am, yeah.

475
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,200
So where's your wife?

476
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,840
She's right here.

477
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,550
Lisa, what are you doing here?

478
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,220
Simon showed me the disc.

479
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,290
Look, lisa, I can't do this right now.

480
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,680
You can and you will.

481
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,510
- Lisa.Just--I was--I
was-- - you lied to me.

482
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,960
- Keep it down.
- You said you were working when you went to see karen?

483
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,950
You went out there to see if she was still
pathetically waiting for you. Was she?

484
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,480
- Are you two finally on?Because if
that's what you want-- - Calm down.

485
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,000
that slut, that rich, disgusting string
bean made of money, then have her.

486
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,300
She's waiting for
you. She is wide-open.

487
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,300
Hi, lisa. I smell trouble.
Or is that your perfume?

488
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,600
Karen. Walk away.

489
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,900
Sweetie, if I do that, he's
just gonna look at my ass.

490
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,380
you can't resist.

491
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,100
You will not be happy until you
see our relationship die, will you?

492
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,160
Well, he certainly won'T.

493
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,200
You stupid, slutty bitch.

494
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,430
lisa, what the hell?

495
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,920
Oh, no, no, no.You and I have
never been in the same class,

496
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,280
but I'm not afraid to
fight above my weight.

497
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,930
Oh, honey, I'll kick
your ass if I can find it.

498
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,500
Oh, bring it.

499
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,500
Now it's family night.

500
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,720
I've always wanted to do this.

501
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,110
Oh, hell, no!

502
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,450
Whatever you think happened,
it was not her fault!

503
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,550
I know what I saw, nick!

504
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,460
Why don't you back off
and listen to her for once?

505
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,590
Hey, why don't you back off, fauntleroy?

506
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,370
This is none of your business.

507
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,630
You know what? I think it is!

508
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
Lisa's been pretty cool with all your little
heagames, but even an art chick has got limits.

509
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,220
Who the hell are you
to talk to me that way?

510
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm your worst nightmare.

511
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,270
Shut the hell up, both of you!

512
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,140
Just let the bitch be.

513
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,630
lisa...

514
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,570
when we first moved back to new york, and your
father, he offered to help us out, you said no.

515
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,020
No. We were gonna make it on our own.

516
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,580
Is this what you hadn mind?

517
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,710
Because I think... this is...

518
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,470
where you were meant to be, who
you were meant to be l along,

519
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,320
and now I am just a reminder of that time
you spent pretending to be sothing else.

520
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,560
I'm done. It's over.

521
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,310
I know.

522
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,790
talk about your setups.

523
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,110
So your mother was behind
our entire relationship?

524
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,980
No, I'm telling you, she found out we were
seeing each other, and she told me to geep itoing.

525
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,310
Yeah, and you just went along with it?

526
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,650
You were trying to send
her to the electric chair.

527
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,960
She used you.

528
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,160
That's part of being a darling, which
you seem to have pretty down yourself.

529
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,720
What? What are you talking about?

530
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,750
You're using patrick.

531
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,600
For wh?

532
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,490
To get close to me
because you still love me.

533
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,070
Okay, you know, whatever
you need to tell yourself.

534
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,050
Tell me you don't think about me...

535
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,990
when you take your dress off
at the end of a long, boring day

536
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,220
or when you're in the shower
with no one to soap your back

537
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,530
or in the early morning when
you're all sleepy and you roll over.

538
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,430
- ready to go?
- YeS.

539
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,210
I am ready.

540
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,200
Night.

541
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,480
you picked out your soft P.J.S, huh?

542
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,420
yeah.

543
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,600
So you have fun tonight?

544
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,260
Uncle jeremy's funny.

545
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,460
yeah.

546
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,870
You know I love you... so very much?

547
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,700
you're my sweet angel.

548
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,980
Sweet dreams, baby.

549
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,470
I thought you we gonna tell him instead of
just talking about my brother's comedic chops.

550
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,420
I changed my mind, brian.

551
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,930
I'm gonna do the trial.

552
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,200
Since when?

553
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,870
Since tonight.

554
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,960
After that dinner, I realized there is no way I
can leave my son alone with you and your family.

555
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,100
I actually have to live.

556
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,890
You all right?

557
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,940
Believe it or not, this is
pretty much par for the course,

558
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,370
except it's usually a darling that
throws the first punch, not my wife.

559
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Well, you probly don't feel this
way right now, but you're lucky.

560
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,080
To have not one but two women
who care enough to fight f y?

561
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,670
well, that's one way of lookin' at it.

562
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,280
I don't know.I've been in new
york for almost three years now,

563
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,760
and I don't have anyone like that.

564
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,420
Not that I haven't dated, it's just...

565
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,660
the guys in this city...

566
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,980
I mean, even the ones
who seem nice, like you...

567
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,330
lost your faith in men, huh?

568
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,010
Yeah, almost.

569
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,670
Not quite.

570
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm sorry I had to bother you,
but thanks for the ride, jeremy.

571
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,790
After your craptacular cage match with
my sister, it's the least I can do.

572
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,620
You rely gonna sleep here tonight?

573
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,430
Beats explaining to my mother
that my marriage is over.

574
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,080
Thanks for sticking up for me.

575
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,550
You think I was just gonna stand
there and let karen wail on you?

576
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,870
Nick did.

577
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,020
I...Fought for so long to
hold on to my marriage because

578
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,580
I thought I had to. I...

579
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,510
I had no idea who I'd be without nick.

580
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,090
maybe it's just time
to let go, you know?

581
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,380
I'm just, um... not sure
I'm ready to let go...

582
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,350
all alone.

583
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,690
Lisa?

584
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,690
This isn't about forever, jeremy.

585
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,530
It's just about tonight.

586
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,380
At 6 years old, you were
in love with karen darling?

587
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,030
Completely.

588
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,900
I grew up just assuming we'd be gether.

589
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,570
Till what went wrong?

590
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,430
Life, I guess.

591
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,210
Karen broke off our engagement, and I
went back to college, where I met lisa.

592
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,710
And I have spent the rest of
my life caught between them--

593
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,080
lisa, karen, karen
and lisa-- and now...

594
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,290
you think you've lost both of them.

595
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah.

596
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,700
Well, I doubt that.

597
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,970
You're not the kind of
guy women get over easily.

598
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,740
Even just knowing you
two days, I can see that.

599
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,080
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

600
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,870
It's, uh, probably my last night
on 1,000-count sheets, so...

601
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,520
- yeah, you gotta take advantage.
- Yeah.

602
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,900
Did it ever occur to you that neither karen
nor lisa were the right person for you?

603
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
The crazy truth is, no.

604
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,440
I have never thought that.

605
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,780
Well, that's too bad.

606
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,080
'Cause there might be other options.

607
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,630
I feel likn I cabreathe
for the first time in years.

608
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,460
Must be nice.

609
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,410
Oh, yeah.

610
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,600
You have no idea what it's like
to be under someone's thumb.

611
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,230
look, I'm, uh, I'm grateful to you
for wanting to be my chief of staff,

612
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,760
even though...

613
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,860
I know why you're doing this.

614
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,290
You want to be close to jeremy.

615
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,660
It's okay.

616
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,140
Neither of us can be with
the person we really want.

617
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,660
that's one thing have in common.

618
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,230
Uh, this is me.

619
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,650
- Good night. Good night.
- And thank you.

620
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,100
For wh?

621
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,660
For being you.

622
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,330
That's a surprise.

623
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,690
Little paddy stuck up for himself.

624
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,720
yep.

625
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,370
And he's taking the open seat
on the agricultural committee.

626
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,390
Nicely done.

627
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,690
Simon...

628
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,960
I can't go through with this.

629
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,890
It's just that I'm
getting...too involved--

630
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,240
oh, don't tell me you're having
regrets about your little boyfriend.

631
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,470
Look, patrick is already completely
dependent on me, letitia is evil,

632
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,480
and your girlfriend karen is, you know,
part psychopath, and ifhey find out--

633
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,200
oh, you know, I...I'm sorry. I forgot.

634
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,560
I-I had something I had to show you.

635
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,800
- What?
- Come here. Nola, come here.

636
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,810
- Don'T.
- Come here!

637
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,270
- Don't!
- Now!

638
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,900
Hi, simon.

639
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,050
They tell me...

640
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,310
that when he wakes up in the morning,
there's still only one person he asks for.

641
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,360
Isn't that something?

642
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,520
Simon, they're fishes.

643
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,810
Tell my sister I made them for
her and give her my kisses. Bye!

644
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,030
Just tell me. Where's my brother?

645
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,220
He's fine.

646
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,380
He's well taken care of.

647
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,380
When is this done? When
is this gonna be done?

648
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,700
Listen, don't you ever forget all the
things I've done for you, nola lyons.

649
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,190
- Who's my little soldier?
- Don't touch me.

650
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,240
nick.

651
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,670
You're leaving without saying good-bye.

652
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,720
Hey, tripp.

653
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,750
Quite a night, huh?

654
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Oh, yeah, always.

655
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,890
How's karen?

656
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,790
Oh, well... she's licked her wounds,
and she's resting comfortably.

657
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,820
My ferocious little girl.

658
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,260
And--and wrenn,
how's wrenn?

659
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,270
Well, I don't think she's gonna
tell anybody about the accident.

660
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,510
As soon as she's feeli better, we'll
send her on her way. Probably tomorrow.

661
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,070
She's a lovely girl, isn't she?

662
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,170
She is.

663
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,570
You know, my whole life...

664
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,280
I thought of letitia as the only
woman that i could ever be happy with.

665
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,580
Perhaps I was mistaken.

666
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,070
good night, tripp.

667
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,460
Good night, nick. Thank you.

668
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,830
So what can I do for you now?

669
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,860
Are you here to see karen... again?

670
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,950
I'm here for you.

671
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,310
You recording this in case
you want to watch it later?

672
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,390
I know that's your thing.

673
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,190
What's up, nick? It's late.

674
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,410
When I first started working for
tripp, he told meou were the enemy.

675
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,340
And I thought, no,
he's not such a bad guy.

676
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,610
He just does things dierently,
you know, old money, new money.

677
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,330
But after seeing what you're
willing to do to get what you want,

678
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,520
I've learned something.

679
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,590
No one has to pay me to destroy you.

680
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm more than happy to do it for free.

681
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,700
Did you rehearse that?

682
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,630
I mean, 'cause I like it.

683
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,690
I like this new nick
'cause he's waking up.
