1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:03,180
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:05,913
until his plane went down
in Long Island Sound.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,072
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--

4
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:10,528
Tripp, the empire builder...

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,837
you lied to me.
You said you knew about the affair.

6
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:14,004
I didn't know.

7
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:16,170
Letitia, the
sophisticated socialite...

8
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,429
Your father was my great love.

9
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:21,541
Brian, the man of god... I lied to
my wife and daughters last night.

10
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:23,000
I told them that
you were an orphan.

11
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:25,016
Patrick, the
principled politician,

12
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:26,755
Karen, the
professional divorcee...

13
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:28,927
Karen, do not call me on
the home phone number.

14
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,370
I'll always love you, too.

15
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:32,493
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

16
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,463
She was my best friend
in the whole world.

17
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:36,303
- I want you.
- If Juliet found out...

18
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,842
- She won't find out.
- You think Simon Elder,

19
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,741
the billionaire philanthropist,
blew up your father's plane?

20
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,951
Simon Elder is not the man you think
he is, and your boss isn't either.

21
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,840
- Morning, daddy.
- Hey.

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,053
- Hi.
- Hi.

23
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:00,703
I have to get you
some new suits.

24
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:02,970
The dry cleaner is starting to
think I have a thing for him.

25
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,242
Oh, I'm sorry I stayed
here at the office again.

26
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:06,133
Coffee?

27
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,400
I been going through this
pile of donation requests.

28
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:10,190
It's okay. We know you're busy.
It's all good.

29
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,393
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,383
I just don't know how I'm
supposed to help people

31
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,703
if I can't make time
to write the checks.

32
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,233
The whole family sleeps here now.
Charming. I work in a sweatshop.

33
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:21,192
- Pookie-kai, Daisy.
- Pookie-kai, long time, no see.

34
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,022
Pookie-kai? What is--
what is pookie-kai?

35
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,041
- Mm. Secret girl stuff.
- Ah.

36
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:26,632
Um, maybe we should
go to my desk.

37
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:27,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

38
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,633
Thanks, guys. How are you?

39
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,880
Honestly? I'm up to my ears hanging
this new show at the gallery

40
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,531
I'm reading three books,
none of which I'm making any headway in,

41
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,162
- and I kinda miss my husband.
- Yeah, me, too.

42
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,603
-He's a great guy.
- That's funny.

43
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,601
- I'm sorry.
- You know what? Don't be sorry.

44
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:45,043
I know this is a big
opportunity for you...

45
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:47,192
and I know that you have to do this,
not just for the money,

46
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:48,831
but to find out what happened
with your dad, but--

47
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:50,900
Hey, Lisa, you don't have to explain.
I understand.

48
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,292
All the business you do for
the Darlings during the day

49
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:55,370
and all the noble work you do
with their money at night,

50
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,901
I just feel like there's no-- there's
no us anymore. It's all Darlings.

51
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,290
Tell you what.
We are gonna have dinner tomorrow night.

52
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:03,570
Nick, that's not what I'm getting at.
I'm not complaining. It's fine.

53
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,032
I know that that's not
what you're getting at.

54
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,513
Hey, tomorrow night,
just you and me, Del Posto.

55
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,633
What do you say?
Kiki can stay with your mom.

56
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,160
Say something. Anything.

57
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:19,413
You've just admitted to me that you've
been an adulteress for 40 years.

58
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,251
Forgive me if I'm
short on words.

59
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,943
- Where are you going?
- What?

60
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,173
You haven't been in the
same bed with me for weeks.

61
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:31,071
I've known that you've
suspected something,

62
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:33,570
and I also knew that
you'd never say it.

63
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:37,910
I mean, God forbid that Tripp
Darling should ever admit to being...

64
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:43,832
- affected by anything.
- Just tell me one thing.

65
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:48,102
Our children,
are they all mine?

66
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,841
Yes.

67
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,132
Absolutely.

68
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,702
- Oh, god.
- What?

69
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,671
The thought that you
can be so sure...

70
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:04,331
that such attention was paid to
such a prolonged, continuous insult

71
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:10,193
that you can say "absolutely," as if
it were a favor you did me fondly.

72
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,203
My god, Tish. It's so sordid.

73
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:20,940
- Wait, what's the place called?
- Bar known.

74
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:25,193
- Like the little dudes, bar gnome?
- Not gnome, freak show. Known.

75
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:29,012
That's too bad. I was psyched.
I was gonna get, like, a little red hat.

76
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:31,890
Will you just come with me anyway
'cause it's opening night,

77
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,660
and then there's this...
oh, what are you eating?

78
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,710
Sausage. What?
What's the matter? Peta?

79
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,711
No, I've just been
all queasy all morning

80
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,680
and I'm, like,
a little bit spinny.

81
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,653
Will you just tell me, Jeremy,
are you coming with me or not?

82
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,682
Well, I gotta make sure
Juliet's not gonna be there.

83
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:51,551
But as for me, tomorrow night?
Fo sho. I'm already there.

84
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:53,182
- Jeremy!
- I gotta go.

85
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,731
I'll see ya then, babe. Bye.

86
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,851
- Aha!
- What?

87
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,113
- You were just talking to her.
- Who?

88
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:02,450
- Your secret girlfriend.
- I have no girlfriend.

89
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:07,270
Oh, yeah? Then who did you spend 600
grand on at Bulgari, Justin Timberlake?

90
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:11,712
All right, Jules, I am telling the
truth, okay? I am... I'm Pluto.

91
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:15,191
I'm cold, distant and alone.

92
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:19,072
- Well, speaking of planets--
- Pluto is not a planet anymore.

93
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:24,360
It will always be a
planet to me. Ta-da!

94
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,181
- What is this?
- An early birthday present.

95
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,971
- Hayden planetarium!
- Hee! I got you the whole place.

96
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:39,030
- Get out.
- For rizzle. The entire cosmos to yourself.

97
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,323
Well, I don't--
I don't have a gift for you yet.

98
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:43,803
- It's kinda three weeks early.
- Yes, you do.

99
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,710
You see, there's this new
club opening tomorrow night.

100
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:51,393
And they begged me,
so I promised to make an appearance,

101
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,542
- and you can come with me.
- It's not Bar Known, is it?

102
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:57,750
Oh, I know!
It's like the worst name ever, right?

103
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,462
Yeah, it's--
it's the absolute worst.

104
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,251
You should just bail on it, you know?
Stay home, read a book.

105
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:08,341
Are you on cold medicine? It's a
new club. They asked me to be there.

106
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,173
And for your information,
I read a book last night.

107
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,673
Reading's a lifestyle, though.
It's an ongoing commitment.

108
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:16,061
Jeremy, I promised.
I owe it to them to be there.

109
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:19,981
And now, thanks to me, so do you.
She is decided.

110
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,532
I found something very
interesting, Tripp.

111
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,311
- Lookin' in your dad's calendar?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:33,360
In the wake of the massive
helpfulness from the police,

113
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:37,702
I decided to go over it again,
check all the names, all the dates,

114
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,483
see if I could figure out,
you know,

115
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,463
who gave dad all the information
on Simon Elder and why.

116
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:45,613
And my dad had several meetings
with someone he referred

117
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,143
- to only by the letter "C."
- "C"?

118
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,583
Yeah, I have no idea who it could be.
Met him once a month, sometimes twice.

119
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,463
Hang on a second.

120
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,790
There were a few times I asked your
dad to do some detective work for me.

121
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:03,833
Just after Kenneth was
assassinated was the first one.

122
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:07,861
And there we others.
When he wanted to...

123
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:13,241
maintain a tasteful distance,
he employed the services of that man.

124
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,912
- "Harold Templeton"?
- Well, that's not his real name.

125
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:22,823
He was a spy in the
'60s for England...

126
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,463
and China...

127
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:26,050
and France.

128
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,983
He even did some work
for Kennedy in Cuba.

129
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,043
He managed to make himself
globally unpopular.

130
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:36,092
You can't mention this to anyone,
not even Lisa.

131
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:41,973
- How do I find him?
- There's a little vineyard in--

132
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:46,210
just outside of Milan.
It's near our summer place in Italy

133
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,800
where you and your dad used
to spend some time with us.

134
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:54,601
They make a great little
wine. Chiavennasca.

135
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,573
Anyway, if I
remember correctly,

136
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,040
you go to that vineyard...

137
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,040
you ask for that wine...

138
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,230
- slightly chilled--
- Wait a second.

139
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:09,630
Are you asking me to go to
Italy to find this guy?

140
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:13,022
Yeah. No, I mean,
that's where Dutch always started out

141
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,423
when he was trying to track him down.
He keeps a very low profile.

142
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,052
Anyway, you ask for the wine,
then see what happens.

143
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,360
If you manage to
locate Mr. Templeton,

144
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:27,206
he might be able to explain
to you the origins of the...

145
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,105
Elder dossier. Who knows? He may
even be able to tell you who "C" is.

146
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:37,057
Okay. I'll go to Italy.

147
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,911
- Nick.
- Yeah.

148
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,752
- Snag a bottle for me, will you?
- Will do.

149
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,671
- Chiavennasca.
- Chiavennasca. Got it.

150
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,060
Aren't those to die for? It's like
they're made out of George Clooney.

151
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,970
- How much?
- $1,200.

152
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:11,633
12... $1,200?
Do they come with a kidney?

153
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:15,210
- No, they come with each other.
- Yeah.

154
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:18,181
What kind of person
spends $1,200 on shoes?

155
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:24,323
- Lisa. Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,432
- What are you doing here?
- Picked up a suit for Nick.

157
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,810
Uh, we're going out tomorrow night,
so I just thought maybe--

158
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,733
Oh, well,
then you have to buy those shoes.

159
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,371
- No, actually--
- Oh, yes, actually.

160
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,381
And do get them in raspberry.
I have them. I wear them all the time.

161
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,161
You know, I can't buy shoes that
cost as much as car insurance.

162
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,130
Lisa, honey,
don't be so financially resistant, okay?

163
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,720
It's just money.

164
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:54,022
Oh, you did a little
shopping today, huh?

165
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,993
No, I did a little browsing.
Karen Darling did the shopping.

166
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,103
Right after I told you our
whole world was Darlings,

167
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,661
- Darlings everywhere...
- Yeah.

168
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:05,421
I ran into her. We chatted. Three
hours later, those shoes showed up.

169
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:06,690
Well, that was thoughtful.

170
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,052
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of thought
went into that purchase.

171
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:11,451
What's the problem? She sent you a gift.
She does stuff like that.

172
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,082
Why would Karen
Darling send me a gift?

173
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,531
Hey, Lise, you're starting
to sound a little paranoid.

174
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:18,441
Okay? Sometimes a
shoe is just a shoe.

175
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:23,162
Mm-hmm, and sometimes it's a bomb.
So much for our night out, huh?

176
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:27,363
Instead of a great meal at Del
Posto and a night of wild sex...

177
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,862
which I was really
looking forward to...

178
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,701
I get leftovers and a
dvd and you get a, what,

179
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:39,900
a whirlwind trip to some villa in
italy to pick up one bottle of chiav--

180
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,873
- Chiavennasca.
- Chiavennasca.

181
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:42,810
Yeah.

182
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:46,522
- Why don't you come with me?
- I can't. It's work.

183
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,102
Why not?
So what if it's work? Come on.

184
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,121
It's a private jet.
There's--there's room.

185
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:53,811
You know, your mom can
watch Kiki over the weekend.

186
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,691
- Let's go to Italy.
- Yeah?

187
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,460
Yeah. Look, it's totally free,
and for two days, no Darlings.

188
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,922
No Darlings.

189
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,220
- See? Reading. Happy now?
- Very nice.

190
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,140
Oh. "Babes in Toyland"?

191
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,972
I felt bad I didn't
have a gift for you,

192
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,702
so I rented out
the whole angelika.

193
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,731
- For tonight?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,130
- Well, that is so sweet of you.
- Oh, I know.

195
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:38,480
- But I can't go.
- You have to. The thing is set.

196
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,833
Well, we have to go to the club tonight.
I gave my word.

197
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,232
My word is my bond.

198
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,013
Anyways, when I decided I
wanted to read for the remake,

199
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:48,421
I decided that I couldn't
watch the original

200
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:53,653
because Annette Funicello is so iconic.
I didn't want to copy.

201
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,052
But it was a really
picturesque thought.

202
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:57,920
Thanks.

203
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,102
Why aren't you dressed
for school today, Gustav?

204
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:06,500
I don't want to go.

205
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,332
Oh, is that how they
do things in Sweden?

206
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:10,311
School's like a tea party,
you go if you want?

207
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,810
What happened to your face?

208
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,190
- Bully hit me.
- Did you hit back?

209
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,452
- Jesus says don't hit back.
- Says who?

210
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:19,670
My mommy.

211
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,003
Your mommy?

212
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,101
You mean your mommy who's dead?

213
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,173
Yeah.

214
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,503
Poor kid.

215
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,101
She's in a better place now.

216
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,903
Bully or no bully,
still has to go to school.

217
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,401
Okay, but I'm gonna
get terrorized.

218
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,680
Gustav, the world is full of
bullies and always will be.

219
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,410
- You can't live in fear.
- What am I supposed to do?

220
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:51,050
- What do you think?
- Fight back.

221
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,120
Like David and Goliath-- you find
a weakness and you take advantage.

222
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,970
There's your Bible
truth for today.

223
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,653
Because I share your passion
for the truth, that's why.

224
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:18,191
Well, what makes you so sure
the painting's a forgery?

225
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:21,263
Peter, I don't want to do this to you.
You've been our doctor for years.

226
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:24,093
But Tish and I were passing
through David Frank's gallery

227
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,393
on our way to meet Karen
about a week ago...

228
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:29,161
I don't know,
maybe it was the light.

229
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:35,720
And I saw a speck of prussian blue
in "das kind"-- your painting.

230
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:38,440
- Prussian blue? I...
- Yeah, the pigment.

231
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:45,723
It had not yet been invented in Engel's
lifetime. So I became suspicious.

232
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:50,380
There's a forger in Belgium
who's becoming quietly famous

233
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:55,720
in some circles for this sort of thing.
I'm sorry...

234
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,611
- but your painting's a fake.
- Stretfield's guaranteed $6 million.

235
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:07,712
- That painting's our exit strategy.
- Oh, Peter. Peter, Peter.

236
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:13,181
You've been Tish's O.B.-G.Y.N.
over three decades.

237
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:20,241
And this is a little secret.
Trust me.

238
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,561
This is going to go
with me to my grave.

239
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:28,563
- I am curious...
- About what?

240
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,391
In all the years that you've
been delivering our children...

241
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:38,241
have you ever been aware that any
of them might not have been mine?

242
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:43,182
- You might look into that for me.
- Yeah, sure. I could, uh,

243
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:47,211
get you an answer on that, um,
sometime next week if you like.

244
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,171
Tomorrow would be best.

245
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:08,391
If Natalie Kimpton's gonna be
here all night with Ryan Casdale,

246
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,563
this place is over
before it even began.

247
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,303
Why are you with LOSER?

248
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:16,210
What is that? The old vodka
in the water bottle routine?

249
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,943
That is so 2004.

250
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,880
Does she think she's
fooling anyone?

251
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh! I'm so tired of that
backstabbing little witch.

252
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:29,232
Cuz you rather
date your sister.

253
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,853
What, are you text
bombing your girlfriend?

254
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:35,521
No. I'm--
I'm betting on polo online.

255
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,772
Oh, my god! Astrid!

256
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,640
Go 2 ladies room now!

257
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,373
- When did you get back from Andorra?
- Oh, about two hours ago.

258
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,753
- What's with Boris and Natasha?
- Oh, it's some sort of satanic--

259
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,072
You look super hot tonight.

260
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,480
You do, too.

261
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,001
I thought maybe we could, uh...

262
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,182
Pee does not go well
with this dress.

263
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:10,732
I'll get you another one.

264
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,183
Someone just came in.

265
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:19,800
- So you want to have a three way?
- No, no, no. It could be my sister.

266
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,950
You are about to have
sex in a public bathroom,

267
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,533
and that is what you're worried about,
your sister?

268
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,171
That is so incredibly lame!

269
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,520
This has got to be the best part
about being rich, don't you think?

270
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:37,300
- What's that, the private jet?
- Yeah, no lines, no security.

271
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,533
And no pesky rules about
cocktails before takeoff.

272
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:42,273
What do you mean?
In first class,

273
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:44,550
they practically pour the
drinks down your throat.

274
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,260
Not if you're flying the plane.

275
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,253
Wait a minute, Clark.
You're flying the plane?

276
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,921
Tripp sent me to flight school.
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

277
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm expecting a real easy
trip across the pond.

278
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,353
You two can just
lean back and relax.

279
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,633
You guys!

280
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:00,351
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi.

281
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:03,642
Hey, Lisa, my shopping buddy.

282
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,330
What a surprise.

283
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,440
Clark, honey,
could you get the luggage for us?

284
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:08,580
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

285
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:10,822
Yeah, daddy told us that you
guys were taking the jet,

286
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,621
so we thought we
would just hitchhike.

287
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,772
- You don't mind. Do you?
- No, no, no, no. It's fine.

288
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:18,810
It's, uh... perfect.

289
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:36,833
This place is incredible.
Please tell me that

290
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,371
we don't have to spend the
whole day with Karen and Freddy.

291
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,912
I'm guessing that Freddy's out
golfing and Karen's out cold.

292
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:45,590
- We can just sneak out of here.
- Buon giorno, amici.

293
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:50,411
- Hey, Karen. You're up early.
- I know. The espresso in Italy is so good.

294
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:55,180
I've had, like, four already.
Wow. You guys look freshly laid.

295
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,583
- Am I interrupting?
- Uh, not at all.

296
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,210
- What do you guys want to do today?
- What do we want to do?

297
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,832
Well, Karen and I have some stuff to
do for your dad, a little business.

298
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:07,751
Oh, we don't mind. We're game for
anything. Absolutely anything.

299
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:12,283
Um, Nick and I don't get to spend
much time alone, so we're...

300
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:18,932
Oh. I get...
I get it. "Love time."

301
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:20,792
Yeah.

302
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:25,380
- I hope that's not a problem.
- No, not at all.

303
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:28,503
You go your way, we'll go ours.
Italy's big, you know?

304
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:34,583
Oh, my god! These are so good.
These are molto, molto yummy.

305
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,031
You want some?

306
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,831
- Holy crap!
- What?

307
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:50,401
Eww. I hope Ryan's taking penicillin.
That girl is septic.

308
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:56,571
- Are there any pictures of me?
- I haven't looked.

309
00:17:57,646 --> 00:17:59,521
Listen, I think my wife is on to us,
all right?

310
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:01,541
So we're just gonna have
to be a little more...

311
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,893
Hey...

312
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:04,320
Listen.

313
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,741
What is it?

314
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:07,952
Chora.

315
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:14,971
Chora?

316
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:17,723
That's your bully?

317
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:19,450
She's a girl.

318
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,190
Come on. Get it together, man.

319
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,763
I'll pick you up after school.

320
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:32,842
You better run, hot dog.
Mama's hungry!

321
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,593
Right this way.

322
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:42,691
Allora, today, we have for to
taste is the rosso di valtellina.

323
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,992
Also we have the pinot nero
and a very nice gragnano.

324
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,252
- Signora.
- Grazie.

325
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,552
Prego. Signore.

326
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:51,770
Thank you.

327
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:56,723
Uh, you dot happen to have Chiavennasca,
do you?

328
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,020
- Si.
- Slightly chilled?

329
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:02,703
Slightly chilled?
Vado lo domandare.

330
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:08,030
Okay, who's stalking who?
It's such a puzzle. Hi.

331
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:11,361
- Hi, Karen.
- Hello.

332
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,273
- How are you? Freddy.
- Nick.

333
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,053
So I guess Italy's not as
big as I thought, huh?

334
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:19,382
Yeah. It's gettin'
smaller all the time.

335
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:23,203
- Lei vuole mangiare con noi?
- Do you mind if--

336
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:27,120
'Cause we drove all the way here,
and it'll be so awkward

337
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,450
if you're sitting next to us but not,
you know, with us.

338
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:34,700
- We wouldn't want it to be awkward.
- Oh, perfect. Okay. I love this now.

339
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:45,293
- How the hell did you get in here?
- I followed the flower delivery guy.

340
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,790
Don't worry.
Your wife is out getting waxed.

341
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:51,450
I'm sorry. I meant your sister.

342
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,941
- What the hell is this?
- Publicity stunt.

343
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:57,561
- You kissed Ryan "creepo" Casdale.
- My agent told me to.

344
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,771
Does your agent make decisions
for your lips? What about us?

345
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:04,541
Jeremy, what do I want with some
actor who looks in the mirror

346
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,080
more often than I do?

347
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,571
He's a boy. He's a baby.

348
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,721
You're my man.

349
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,833
You're my big man.

350
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,172
You didn't sleep with him?

351
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:23,232
I fell asleep a few times while he
was talking, but that's about it.

352
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:24,492
Promise?

353
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:26,092
I promise.

354
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:27,813
I do.

355
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:28,982
Here.

356
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,452
Wait, wait.
I have to tell you something.

357
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:45,032
What? You want me to put
on explosions in the sky?

358
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,192
Yeah. But I have to
tell you something.

359
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:02,232
- Don't you ever knock?
- That's your girlfriend?

360
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,113
I was gonna tell you about it.
I swear.

361
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,701
Oh! So those tickets
to "Babes in toyland,"

362
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,763
they weren't a gift at all?
They were subterfuge?

363
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:12,070
They were subterfuge
and a gift.

364
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:13,471
- And you!
- What?

365
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,250
Weren't my bangs enough?

366
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:18,462
Oh, it was a completely
different approach to bangs.

367
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,340
- Get out of my house, you whore!
- Let it go.

368
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:22,021
Can't we just all talk
about this like adults?

369
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,493
Get her drippy butt
out of my house!

370
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,823
- No!
- What?

371
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,443
She's not leaving.

372
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:34,260
This is...
utterly mortifying. This is...

373
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:36,802
the worst thing
that's ever happened.

374
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:40,913
Juliet, you are my sister, and I
love you. But I can't choose sides.

375
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:47,620
Well, guess what. You just did.

376
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:53,032
Oh. I gotta go throw up.

377
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:58,801
You know,
even when we were little,

378
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,742
I knew you were grounded.

379
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,532
Well, I got grounded
a few times, maybe.

380
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:03,811
I don't know if I was grounded.

381
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,280
Yeah, when I met him at William
and Mary, he was kind of a flake.

382
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:09,750
A naughty flake.

383
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:14,310
Well, you know, I've just always
seen him as such an old soul.

384
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,991
I don't know if you know him as well
as you think you do, Karen, really.

385
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,761
I don't think you do either, Lisa.
I've known him for a long ti--

386
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,211
Longer than you, and I--

387
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:25,753
Well, I remember Nick and
I walking on the beach

388
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:30,552
and the way the sun hit your hair.
It just glistened.

389
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:33,142
- Signore George.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:36,013
Oh, would you follow me,
please, to the tasting room?

391
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:40,383
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- You asked for the Chiavennasca.

392
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,683
Yeah, yeah, I did.

393
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:46,971
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I just have some family business.

394
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:54,350
- All right. You all keep bonding.
- Will do.

395
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,192
Come il tuo italiano?

396
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:06,111
Uh, non buono.

397
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,832
Mi dispiace.

398
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:10,282
What a pity.

399
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:15,660
To speak english puts me in
mind of irretrievable times.

400
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,113
Ah, well.

401
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:26,183
- This the Chiavennasca?
- No, no. It's vin ordinaire.

402
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:39,062
- So you're Dutch's boy?
- Yeah. I guess so.

403
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,102
For what do you seek?

404
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:47,332
When my dad died, his briefcase was
full of information about Simon Elder.

405
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,503
Incriminating information.

406
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:53,102
Elder, as in
the techno-philanthropist?

407
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:53,790
Yeah.

408
00:23:57,045 --> 00:24:00,013
Any idea why he might have
had a file like that?

409
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,572
Uh, did I--
did I do something wrong?

410
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:07,990
I'm-- I'm sorry. I... if you are who
you say you are, I will find you.

411
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:14,270
If not, well.
Those are your bad dreams. Arrivederci.

412
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:20,261
Me wearing the Superman underoos
and he's wearing Wonder Woman.

413
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:21,623
I'm not kidding.

414
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,052
- There he is.
- Hi, baby. Just in time.

415
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:29,710
What's going on? We can go.

416
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:33,570
No. We've moved on to spirits.

417
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,061
Nick, we're drinking grappa.

418
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,691
Maybe the two of
you have had enough?

419
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,161
Loosen up, baby.
We are in India.

420
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,643
- We are?
- What did I just say?

421
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:52,361
You said we were in India.
Nick... it's grappa.

422
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:57,332
Remember?

423
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:00,802
Remember what? What a--
what about grappa?

424
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,752
We had a couple of bottles the
night that Nick proposed to me.

425
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,453
- Nick proposed to you?
- You didn't tell her?

426
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,373
- When would that have come up?
- When did he propose to you?

427
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:19,230
When we were 19. Why didn't you
tell her? You're so secretive.

428
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:23,703
Because we were 19. Exactly.
We were 19. It's ancient history.

429
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,110
It was down by the lake,

430
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:28,603
just down the hill from where
we're all staying. And we--

431
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:33,252
I don't know, we'd been, like,
sailing all day or playing tennis.

432
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:35,462
I just remember him
saying that he--

433
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:40,132
he knew it wasn't gonna be easy
because I was so rich and he wasn't.

434
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:43,192
But he knew we were
supposed to be together.

435
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:46,912
- Hey, Karen, can we...
- Oh, let her finish.

436
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:48,462
Let her finish.

437
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:53,853
Uh, and then we, you know, we drank
a bunch-- we drank a bunch of grappa.

438
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:55,431
Lisa.

439
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,500
Lisa, I should've told you.

440
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:03,073
Thanks.

441
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,402
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:11,132
God, you are a bitch sometimes.

443
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:13,290
I know. It's a problem.

444
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:21,422
Lisa, come on. I was in Italy.
I was drunk on grappa.

445
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,950
Everyone proposes when they're 19.
It didn't mean anything.

446
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,460
Well, it meant
something to her.

447
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,600
And it-- it certainly would've
meant something if she'd said yes.

448
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,342
Lisa, it was a
thousand years ago.

449
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:34,440
When we started dating,
we exchanged plenty of stories

450
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,710
about our old boyfriends
and girlfriends, remember?

451
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:37,493
Yeah, so?

452
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,610
Well, there must have been some
reason you decided to leave

453
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:42,280
this particular one out unless
maybe you forgot. Did you forget?

454
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:49,433
I don't understand why you
don't just go to the headmaster

455
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,021
and tell him this
bullying is taking place.

456
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:55,681
Because the little orphan is never
gonna learn how to stick up for himself.

457
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:56,892
Like you learned?

458
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,813
18 years of being beat up by girls,
and what's his revenge?

459
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,883
- The ministry.
- That's awful.

460
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,073
Hey, every summer, your uncle
Brian would come back from vacation

461
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:08,763
with aunt Deirdre and cousin
Derinda covered in bruises.

462
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:12,673
It was tragic. What did they call
you again? The, uh, the princess?

463
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:14,461
What did they call you
again, Fatty-Paddy?

464
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,191
I wouldn't mind a
changed subject.

465
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,491
I swear, sometimes I don't know
where you children come from.

466
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:22,170
Why did you really enter the church,
uncle Brian?

467
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:25,930
I didn't see anywhere else
in the world I fit in.

468
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,313
I didn't want to pursue
business or politics.

469
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:33,211
I never...
felt really well liked.

470
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:35,870
So a life of leisure
didn't seem appealing.

471
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:38,890
You need friends for that kind of thing.
So, you know,

472
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:42,331
I guess I really never felt
a part of the human family.

473
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:50,980
- Well, thank you for your honesty.
- Oh, Ellen, thank you.

474
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:58,040
Take it easy, sailor.
You're gonna overheat your blood.

475
00:27:58,886 --> 00:27:59,723
Sorry.

476
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,342
I haven't seen a child
pepper food that vigorously

477
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:06,933
since you were a boy, Brian.
Bon appetit.

478
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,252
Oh, you should probably answer that.
I'm sure it's your

479
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:16,142
girlfriend Karen calling to
invite you for a midnight swim...

480
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:19,583
or maybe another romantic
grappa party or something.

481
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,962
- Pronto?
- Mr. George.

482
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,742
Harold Templeton.
May we convene?

483
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:32,052
I apologize for my abrupt
exit the last time.

484
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:35,111
But you can never be too sure
who's who in my line of work.

485
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:37,132
Your father
would've understood.

486
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,560
He was... also a complex man.

487
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,902
- What happened?
- Three months ago,

488
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:46,763
he asked me compile information
on Simon Elder-- anything vexing.

489
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,540
What for? To--
to blackmail him?

490
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:50,943
I never asked.
It was not my concern.

491
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,203
But when your father
came to me a second time

492
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:56,061
and asked me to perform similar
due diligence on Tripp Darling,

493
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:59,260
well, I realized he was
working for someone else,

494
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,720
so I washed my hands of it.

495
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:07,933
So who was my father working for?
Do you know?

496
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,270
Did he ever mention someone that
he referred to by the letter "C"?

497
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:17,050
No. Not that I recall.

498
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:20,471
And there's your Chiavennasca
for Mr. Darling.

499
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:28,951
Hey.

500
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,261
Hey.

501
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:33,171
I'm really sorry about earlier.

502
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,280
You know what?
Save it for someone who cares.

503
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,802
- Okay.
- Okay. Um, I, um...

504
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:41,571
I don't want these shoes anymore.
You know why?

505
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,060
- They don't fit?
- No, actually, they fit fine.

506
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:46,833
Um, I don't want these
shoes because these shoes--

507
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:50,421
these $1,200 shoes--
stand for everything that is

508
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,292
selfish and foul and consumptive
and creepy about you.

509
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:56,873
- Wow.
- Nick and I have... a daughter.

510
00:29:57,426 --> 00:30:00,252
And, um, you have this dream,
and it's never going to come true.

511
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:04,212
So stay away from my husband and...
stay out of my way.

512
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,393
- Who was that, baby?
- Nobody.

513
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,201
Make me a drink, would you?

514
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:33,951
Go away.

515
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:36,883
We need to talk.

516
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,811
I'm not speaking
to you, traitor.

517
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:47,440
- Juliet... I love her.
- Love?

518
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:54,590
- Okay, I... I really like her.
- Like?

519
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,912
I'm moderately interest--
why can't you be cool about this?

520
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:02,640
Because she doesn't care about you.
She's only using you to get at me.

521
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:05,551
Oh, okay. Now I get it. Yeah.
It's-- it's about you. Right?

522
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:08,550
- Everything is just all about you.
- I'm just trying to protect you.

523
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,820
You don't have to!
You're the one running around

524
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,431
telling everyone you
want to be independent.

525
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:14,261
You want your own career,
you want to move out.

526
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:16,602
You--you can't even let your
twin brother date someone

527
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,552
you had a stupid fight
with over bangs? Why?

528
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:21,783
Because it makes you feel so lonely
and freaked out and threatened.

529
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,831
I mean, bangs?

530
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:34,803
- I feel so far from home.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

531
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:38,970
I hate that we can't just get
on a plane right now and go.

532
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:44,882
Well, we could, but we'd have
to fly with Karen and Freddy.

533
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,851
Well, they have
their private jet.

534
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:51,040
We are flying back like--
like normal people with...

535
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:56,931
lines and security and peanuts
and back pain and... life.

536
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,412
God... it's...

537
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:07,040
weird being married.

538
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:09,731
It's so weird.

539
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:12,192
Yeah...

540
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,500
it is.

541
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,471
- Promise me something.
- What?

542
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,040
Promise me that we are never
going to have to come all the way

543
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,483
to Italy for a stupid bottle
of wine again, please.

544
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:41,652
Lisa...

545
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,023
we didn't come here
for a bottle of wine.

546
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,521
I needed to meet with a guy
who did some work for my dad.

547
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,720
When did you do that?

548
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,742
When I went down to
the wine cellar.

549
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:55,960
He's a spy.

550
00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:58,951
It's a long story.

551
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:02,013
I look forward to hearing about
it halfway over the Atlantic.

552
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:09,291
You know, I count on you for so much,
Lise. You know that?

553
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:12,081
A little.

554
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,471
When I look at you,
there's this perfect line from me

555
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:17,873
through you to the
center of the Earth.

556
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:21,202
You keep me connected
to everything.

557
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:23,873
You do the same for me.

558
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:27,971
And Kiki does it for both of us.
It's a...

559
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,072
it's a beautiful thing.

560
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,531
You know, I don't think my dad
felt that way about anyone.

561
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,280
You don't think he felt
that way about you?

562
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:35,831
I don't know.

563
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:39,230
I really don't.

564
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:46,551
Lei vuole fare l'amore?

565
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:51,140
- You picked up a little italian?
- Enough to get by.

566
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,660
Victoria, would you excuse us?

567
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:15,101
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you so much...

568
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:18,042
for all you do.

569
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,300
Silver up to snuff?

570
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,001
It's getting there.

571
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,573
We need to talk.

572
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,301
What's that?

573
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:49,820
D.N.A. results.

574
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:52,852
You lied to me.

575
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,631
What the hell have you done?

576
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:58,241
I found out what
I needed to know.

577
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,951
I found out the only way
that I could given the fact

578
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:04,493
that my wife doesn't
tell me the truth.

579
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:08,302
So... so you know?

580
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:12,821
I haven't read the results.
I won't.

581
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,370
I want to hear it from you.

582
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:22,841
Which of our children
isn't mine ?

583
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:27,352
Which one is Dutch's?

584
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:35,891
I'll tell you.

585
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:40,891
But you've got to promise
me nothing will change...

586
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:43,611
as far as the children
are concerned.

587
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,701
I don't have to
promise you anything.

588
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,322
You took my life--

589
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,222
you took my life that
I placed in your hands

590
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:55,092
to help me carry it
safely to the grave,

591
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:58,930
and you laid it on every
bedside table you could find

592
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,753
while you pursued whatever it was
you were pursuing all those years.

593
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:05,522
I hope it was the
obliteration of yourself,

594
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:08,161
because, my god,
that's what you've achieved.

595
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,780
Just tell me the truth...

596
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:14,362
or leave right now. I mean it.

597
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:20,020
You're the only woman in
the world for me, Tish.

598
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:25,810
But I can't live every day with my
face being pushed into this filth.

599
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:30,502
If you want me in
that bed tonight...

600
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,503
tell me.

601
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,393
All right.

602
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,423
All right.

603
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:51,963
I'll tell you.

604
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,121
No, Chora! You're hurting me!

605
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,011
What's the matter?

606
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:08,731
You gotta be nicer to me, or else
I'll tell Mei Ling Hwa the truth.

607
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:11,412
- What is this, blackmail?
- You told me to find a weakness.

608
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:14,652
You cunning little turd.

609
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:18,972
What do you want?

610
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,551
Get off my back, Chora!

611
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:23,953
Get off of me!

612
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:26,992
Help me. Please.

613
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:33,680
Hi, Chora.

614
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:37,412
Those are nice hair clips.
What are those, bumblebees?

615
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,290
- Hornets.
- You know god, Chora?

616
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:43,253
Well, he's sorta my boss.
And you see that boy over there?

617
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:49,631
God told me you're not
being very nice to him.

618
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:51,652
And God is so disappointed.

619
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,710
So from now on,
he wants you two to be friends.

620
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,202
Otherwise you're gonna
burn in hell for eternity,

621
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,711
and eternity's a
very long time.

622
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,270
Are we clear?

623
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,043
Good girl.

624
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:20,911
So I'm assuming you met our friend--
Mr. Templeton?

625
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:22,183
Yes, I did.

626
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:25,572
- And what did he have to say?
- Well, you were right.

627
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:28,763
He put the Elder file
together for dad.

628
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:30,673
Yeah, I figured.

629
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,973
- To your good health.
- Cheers.

630
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:48,023
So what do you think?
Be honest.

631
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:51,581
My father was working
for someone else.

632
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:02,812
Could it be that "C" that
was in his calendar?

633
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,380
I don't know. Maybe.

634
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:07,990
But he was gathering that
information for someone.

635
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:11,232
And Templeton stopped helping
when he found out about it.

636
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,291
So that dossier,
all that information on Simon Elder,

637
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:20,003
that wasn't just Dutch doing...
diligent work on my behalf?

638
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:22,810
No, it doesn't look like it.

639
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:29,720
He was gathering information
about you as well.

640
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,452
- About me?
- Yeah.

641
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:39,552
- I'm sorry.
- Why? You didn't do it.

642
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,763
- I know, but he--
- No, you're you.

643
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:45,331
And you're good. That's true.

644
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:49,932
Well...

645
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:53,112
anything happen
while I was gone?

646
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:56,652
Nothing unexpected.

647
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:01,151
Things continue to
reveal themselves.

648
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,782
Reality.

649
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:18,523
I like looking at
the stars because...

650
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:22,013
you know, they're so...

651
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:27,511
hot and fiery and explosive,
but it feels totally safe

652
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,062
and totally exciting all at
the same time, you know?

653
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,930
I never thought a girl
could make me feel that way.

654
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:37,991
But you do.

655
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,642
Looking at you is like
looking at the stars.

656
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:50,892
You make me feel like I'm a part of
everything, like I have a place.

657
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,323
Are you being for real?

658
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:02,953
Natalie, I'm "for realer" with you
than I've ever been with anybody.

659
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,232
Me, too.

660
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,751
Maybe we're in love.

661
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,813

00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:31,941
I'm pregnant.

00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,632
That's wet.
