1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:03,204
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:05,555
until his plane went down
in Long Island sound.

3
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:07,907
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--

4
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,358
Tripp, the empire builder,

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,642
Letitia, the
sophisticated socialite.

6
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:14,843
Don't you think it kills me to see
you making the same mistakes I did?

7
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,665
- What mistakes?
- Putting three people in your marriage.

8
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:20,299
- Brian, the man of God...
- Is orphan not P.C. anymore?

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,074
- He's not an orphan.
- Your brother Brian is his father.

10
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:24,850
Patrick, the
principled politician...

11
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,806
I am tired of it all-- the money,
the advice, the support, all of it.

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,135
- Patrick--
- we are done.

13
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,537
We finally get together.

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,360
- Been a long time coming.
- I'll say.

15
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:33,900
Karen, the professional divorcée...

16
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,980
Nick is my past,
you're my future, okay?

17
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,953
Letting me risk ruining
my marriage to Freddy

18
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,932
sure makes it seem like
you want me free for you.

19
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,930
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

20
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,970
She was my best friend in the whole world,
and I hate her guts.

21
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,541
Baby, are you sure it's not bad luck
to see each other on the big day?

22
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:17,503
Who cares? That tradition has not
exactly worked for me in the past.

23
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:22,912
What's that tradition
all about anyway, huh?

24
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,743
Did Moses cook that up?

25
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,490
It's about seeing your beloved
again for the first time.

26
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:31,161
And no,
Moses did not "cook that up."

27
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:34,723
Now have you two given any
thought to your vows at all?

28
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:36,830
I'm thinking a golf
theme would be nice.

29
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:41,012
You know, something with hazards
and fairways and holes in one.

30
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:43,601
No, all we need is have and
hold and sickness and health

31
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:44,952
and a little open bar.

32
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,961
You know, Karen, as your brother, I agree.
No one cares what you say.

33
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:53,662
But as your minister,
I am required to honor this... eternal union.

34
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:58,723
Okay. Just do what you want.
Just, uh, keep it short.

35
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:03,223
- See you in seven hours.
- Whoo! Amen to that.

36
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:06,191
Because we are in it to win it.

37
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:09,291
- Next question.
- Mr. Attorney general, earlier today,

38
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:12,371
your office indicted one of the city's
biggest real estate developers,

39
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,753
the Fantini brothers,
on multiple counts of--

40
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,622
of bid rigging, fraud,
collusion, tax evasion--

41
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:21,053
Fred, this lawsuit's a message to all
of New York's real estate developers.

42
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,580
You will be held accountable for your
corrupt and deceive business practices.

43
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,613
Next.

44
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,293
But aren't you worried that
by bringing charges against

45
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:31,141
Michael and Sal Fantini,
you may come into conflict with your father?

46
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,413
This is not about my family, Dave.
This is about our New York.

47
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,042
Okay. Thank you. No more questions.

48
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:42,382
The ambassador decided to bring
a date at the last minute.

49
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:47,451
People can be... so thoughtless.

50
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:52,050
I'm kinda having second thoughts...
about the wedding.

51
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,973
Yeah, I assumed that's
what you meant.

52
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,142
Is this about Nick?

53
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,541
- Is it?
- Nick? No, no.

54
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:05,611
No, Nick hasn't even entered my mind today.
It's about... Freddy.

55
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:11,021
He's not exactly, um... complicated.

56
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,411
You're just like your father.

57
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,613
You want fairy tale love.
You're a romantic.

58
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,021
But... you know what's
really romantic?

59
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:24,972
Is to wake up every morning and say,
"I choose you...

60
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:30,390
"again today, no matter what."

61
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,763
Like you chose dad.

62
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,302
Or Dutch.

63
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,203
Oh, well, I chose both, and, uh...

64
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,590
that was my mistake.

65
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,410
But-- but this just
isn't you, Paddy.

66
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,980
This vendetta against my friends,
my colleagues.

67
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,980
Where in heaven's name
did the notion come from?

68
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:55,100
If this is some kind of a response
to my offer to her, it's childish.

69
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,130
Dad, I am the attorney general
of the state of New York.

70
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,861
I go after the bad guys.
It's what I do.

71
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:03,100
It's incomprehensible to me that
you could attack me like this,

72
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,162
and on your sister's wedding day.

73
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,740
You have become a complete
stranger to me, Patrick.

74
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,331
The fact that you see this as
an attack in the first place

75
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,810
- is the real problem.
- Son, I think

76
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:19,101
it would be in the best interests
of everybody if you were to...

77
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,490
move out of the Imperial
for the time being.

78
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:25,011
Maybe you should go upstairs
and take a look, dad.

79
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:29,193
- I already have.
- Oh, Paddy, I...

80
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:36,530
You're doing the right thing...
for you and for your city.

81
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,072
I know.

82
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,200
Come.

83
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:49,243
You look like you could use a drink.

84
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,911
It's 9:30 in the morning.

85
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,483
Is this about Patrick's
press conference?

86
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:02,200
No. On the contrary.

87
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:07,241
Today... everything
is about my Karen.

88
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:15,581
This is a little tradition, a...
ritual I enact for her weddings.

89
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:20,531
I got it from her first father-in-law--
Vicente de la Huerta.

90
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,950
You open the bottle of tequila
first thing in the morning,

91
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:29,141
and by the time you go to bed,
it's gotta be bone dry.

92
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,972
All right.

93
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,191
Wow, that's amazing.

94
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,701
Certainly has its virtues,
doesn't it?

95
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:56,631
Uh, Tripp, I...

96
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:01,750
You know,
those silly magazines whip themselves

97
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:06,230
into a frenzy for pictures
every time Karen gets hitched.

98
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:09,762
I remember last time.
It was a story unto itself-- the bidding war.

99
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,590
I want you to meet with
these people today,

100
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,310
- come to an understanding.
- I can do that.

101
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:19,932
Oh, and, uh,
in the interests of the new dispensation,

102
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,691
we could give the money to charity.

103
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:23,960
Done.

104
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:29,763
All right.

105
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:34,812
- To Karen.
- To Karen.

106
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,010
I don't know how this
could've happened.

107
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:45,260
My assistants usually pay such
assiduous attention to every detail.

108
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,973
Well, here's some details for you.

109
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,131
This wedding is in six hours,

110
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,130
and I have to write a sermon for my
sister and her fourth ex-husband,

111
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:56,311
so fix the cuffs quickly so they
fit my son and not an orangutan...

112
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:01,563
Oh, my god. Excuse me.

113
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:05,840
Hi, Brian.

114
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,671
Andrea, where the
hell have you been?

115
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:10,301
Brazil. I finally went
and saw Iguazú falls.

116
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,602
And it was a
life-changing experience.

117
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,121
Well, it certainly played
hell with your fashion sense.

118
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,661
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Well, then why did you come?

119
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,863
Because the last time I checked,
you dumped our son in my lap

120
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:21,733
like a half-eaten
sandwich and disappeared.

121
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,740
- I want to talk to him.
- No, not today.

122
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,561
Look, Karen's getting married.
There's a lot going on--

123
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,292
I'm still his mother, Brian.

124
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,060
Just meet me in the
rectory in an hour.

125
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,833
Mei Ling Hwa and the
twins are out of town.

126
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:46,902
- We have a situation on our hands.
- What's going on?

127
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,510
Karen is having second thoughts, and

128
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,101
I'm quite certain that
they revolve around you.

129
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:56,123
Me? I--
look, I haven't done anything.

130
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:58,321
Which allows her to live
in this fantasy world

131
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,862
that someday you two
may end up together.

132
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:05,132
You know this. You must.

133
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,340
All I'm asking is for you to talk to her.
Let her know once and for all

134
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:13,832
that there is no possible
future for her with you, none.

135
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:20,732
- Unless there is.
- I'll talk to her.

136
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,693
Good. Then it's quite simple.

137
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:27,613
Tell her you're not in love with her
and that you never, ever will be.

138
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:55,051
Private number? That's so 2006.

139
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:58,682
- Hello.
- Juliet.

140
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,081
- Hey, don't hang up, okay?
- Who is this?

141
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:05,311
- Natalie. Natalie Kimpton.
- What do you want?

142
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,361
Listen, just turn the radio station
on to our station, okay? Please.

143
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,040
Never!

144
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,856
Our guest in the studio
today is Natalie Kimpton.

145
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,045
Why don't you tell us
about your new single?

146
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:25,917
I heard it's quite the, uh, vision quest.
That's what I've been told anyway.

147
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,401
A new single?
You must be kidding me.

148
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:32,020
Well, Jonesy,
it's called "free to forgive." And...

149
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,702
it was inspired by the most
devastating experience of my life--

150
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,003
my breakup with Juliet Darling.

151
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,991
Do you hear what's
happening on the radio?

152
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:43,541
I sent "free to forgive" to her
to get her to make up with you!

153
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:45,833
- Jeremy, I can't hear the song.
- Why do you want to?

154
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:49,413
That she-devil is evil, Jules.
She is a thief, just like you said.

155
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,202
She pretended to be pregnant to
try and marry me and get my money.

156
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:55,061
If she's trying to win you back,
it's 'cause she wants something.

157
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:04,540
Maybe once or twice but
staying mad at me is expensive

158
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,671
and it's free to forgive.

159
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:09,631
Oh.

160
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:14,962
And it's free to forgive.

161
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:19,511
I'm just worried that mom and I are
gonna miss Karen tossing her bouquet.

162
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:21,621
I already told all my
friends I'd catch it.

163
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:24,440
It'll be worth, like,
$10 million someday.

164
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,312
Kiki, you're gonna get there as soon
as your mom is done at the gallery.

165
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:28,980
- That's the best I can do for you.
- Dad.

166
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:32,142
- No, no cater waiters.
- I've known Stella since college.

167
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:34,771
If anything smacks of elitism,
it'll freak her out.

168
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:38,732
I want canned beer and potato chips.
Okay, thanks. Bye. Hi.

169
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:39,383
Hi.

170
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:41,410
Uh, you can't wear a
tux to Stella's opening.

171
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:45,261
I know, but I have to, because I have
to be over at the Imperial right now.

172
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:50,541
Nick, you promised you would go
with us to the gallery first.

173
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,041
Look, I have to talk to the press,

174
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,112
I have to pick which
magazine gets the photos,

175
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,282
I have to make sure that the
bride actually gets married.

176
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:57,771
That's a joke, right?

177
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:01,200
No. Letitia asked me to make sure
that Karen gets down the aisle.

178
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:04,151
Apparently she's having doubts,
cold feet.

179
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:06,661
Kiki, will you hang this up
for me in the closet, please?

180
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:07,851
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

181
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:11,400
She's got cold feet
because of you, right?

182
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,791
According to Letitia, yes,
but she's getting married.

183
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,621
Just not to the man
she really wants.

184
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:18,210
Lisa, the only reason that I am
not making it to the opening

185
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,981
is so I can go tell
Karen to marry Freddy.

186
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,783
You're gonna see for
yourself in four hours.

187
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,452
You know what?
I really don't need to go to this wedding.

188
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,250
It's not like Karen
and I are close...

189
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:27,652
and I'm sure there'll
be another one, so--

190
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,442
- All right, fine. Don't come.
- Okay, great.

191
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:34,762
Wait a minute.
If mom doesn't go, who's gonna take me?

192
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:35,930
Lisa, come on.

193
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:39,493
Okay. You can go with your father.

194
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,872
Oh, thank you, god.

195
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:45,352
You're an evil person.
You abandoned your son.

196
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:50,632
Oh, I didn't abandon him.
I left him with his father for two months.

197
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,603
Yeah, and because you did,
my marriage is probably over.

198
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,222
My wife and children have
been in China for two weeks,

199
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,213
and I don't know when or
if they're coming back.

200
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:00,930
Just as a little added bonus to
your little selfish walkabout.

201
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,262
Oh, look who's talking. You haven't
had a selfless moment in your life.

202
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,462
Listening to you sob for weeks about
the untimely death of your mangy cat

203
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:12,370
was pretty selfless, believe me.
Why'd you even come back here?

204
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,351
To see my son...

205
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:19,272
and you...

206
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:22,492
maybe...

207
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:24,620
a little.

208
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,062
Oh, crap.

209
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,593
Shouldn't you be getting dressed?

210
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:38,310
The wedding's in
less than two hours.

211
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,601
I'll be ready in time. Don't worry.

212
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,463
Are, uh, you okay?

213
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,983
Look, I know living in this
hotel isn't ideal, but when

214
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:53,083
the new place is ready,
we'll move in, we'll have a new home.

215
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,390
I'm fine. I like it here.

216
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,672
It feels as much like
home as anyplace.

217
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:02,532
Okay. Well, I've, uh,
I've gotta run out for a sec.

218
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,690
Don't get lipstick on your collar.

219
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,743
Excuse me?

220
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,582
Or doesn't she wear lipstick?

221
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,380
Am I supposed to be following this?
Because it's all...

222
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,772
going way over my head.

223
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:27,831
So you're not seeing someone else--
a woman, a man, in between?

224
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:36,422
I don't know what you're-- I--
no, Ellen, I'm not seeing anyone but you.

225
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:42,870
Just go.

226
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,832
No, what are you talking about?
What are--

227
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:46,760
Just go.

228
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:01,460
Hey, Karen.

229
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:05,402
- Everyone's looking for you.
- It looks like you found me.

230
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:12,403
That's Nick--
1, everyone else... zero.

231
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,141
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

232
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:20,192
- I don't think I'm gonna do this.
- That's technically not a question.

233
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,632
I know. I answered it myself.

234
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,133
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:28,791
You don't think me marrying Freddy is...
is a huge mistake?

236
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:32,272
Like... the hugest?

237
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:39,092
Look, Karen, if you're hoping
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet

238
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,671
and tell you not to marry Freddy,
I can't.

239
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,410
Nick, this isn't about you.

240
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:49,532
My entire life doesn't revolve around
a stupid crush I had when I was 18.

241
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,313
This is about Freddy and if
he's the right one for me.

242
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:53,432
Okay.

243
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,732
Just wanted to get your opinion,
that's all.

244
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay.

245
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:05,901
Hey. Have you presold
my wedding photos yet?

246
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,162
Uh, not yet.

247
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,151
Well, don't settle for
less than $2 million.

248
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,610
That would suck.

249
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,133
- Paddy, my boy.
- "Paddy, my boy"?

250
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,902
I believe that is an
appropriate greeting.

251
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:39,242
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Lower your voice. I'm not deaf.

252
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:43,013
- You told Ellen about Carmelita?
- I did nothing of the sort.

253
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,111
And I am offended that you would even
think that I would do such a thing.

254
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,260
Maybe that's because you
hired a private investigator

255
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,513
to follow me around and
take photographs of us.

256
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,292
I was trying to save your marriage.

257
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:54,963
- Is that right?
- I love you, son.

258
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,690
Whatever nonsense has come
between us doesn't change that.

259
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,110
Now come on. Have a drink.

260
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:07,020
Your sister's getting married.

261
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,660
It's a great day.

262
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:18,091
- Dad, this place is a palace.
- Yeah, it's a little like one.

263
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:20,491
Come on in.

264
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:23,270
Excuse me. Hello there, young lady.

265
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,000
- Hi.
- Kiki, right?

266
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,913
- Yeah. This is kiki.
- I'm Mrs. Darling.

267
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:32,013
- And I am Tripp Darling.
- Your house is so beautiful.

268
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,230
Thank you.

269
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,710
Well, maybe you'll bless us by
having your wedding here someday.

270
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,192
- I really could?
- Oh, yes. Of course you can.

271
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,023
Your dad is family.

272
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:46,530
Thank you for taking care of things today,
Nick. I appreciate it.

273
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,020
It was no problem.
It was... it was fine.

274
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,842
- Uh, are the photographers here yet?
- I asked them to get here early.

275
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:56,503
The vultures of the tabloids are
in my office even as we speak.

276
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,603
- $50,000.
- Uh, who are you again?

277
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:00,903
- "Style and grace."
- Well, "Style and grace,"

278
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,053
I'd like to remind you that the
bidding starts at $1 million.

279
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:07,062
Guys, I want to remind you,
this is Karen Darling.

280
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,690
- On her fourth wedding.
- To a second-rate golfer.

281
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:12,253
The public's hungry for access,
but they're not starving.

282
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,672
Well, this could be her last wedding,
and the bidding starts at $1 million.

283
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:18,541
- I think I've been clear.
- Then I think I'll skedaddle.

284
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,942
- Good luck, guys.
- See you.

285
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,911
$500,000.

286
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,632
$400,000?

287
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:28,861
- Okay, I'll give you $250,000.
- Sold.

288
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:32,351
But I'm gonna need a little,
uh, s-k-i-n.

289
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,050
I'm 10. I can spell.

290
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,311
I'll go $350,000 if I can
tag along for the honeymoon

291
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:42,013
- and get some opplesstay actionay.
- I speak pig latin, too, ummyday.

292
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,940
- Dad, look, the wedding's starting.
- We're gonna make it.

293
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:49,721
Okay, guys, listen,
no skin and no honeymoon.

294
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,710
- Then nothing over $200,000.
- Okay, you can have some honeymoon.

295
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,313
- I'll go $300,000.
- Sold.

296
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,890
- Here we are again.
- Here we are.

297
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:04,840
You know,
there's a word for how I feel right now.

298
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:07,681
Aware.

299
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,791
Aware. Whoa.

300
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:14,412
It's a japanese word.
It means reverence...

301
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:21,852
for the transient beauty
and mortality of all things.

302
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:26,083
Daddy...

303
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:29,282
- you're so wasted.
- I know I am.

304
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:31,750
I know.

305
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:39,253
You realize...
that on this day in a father's life...

306
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:45,833
grief and joy... are intertwined.

307
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:49,580
Oh, and remember, be kind...

308
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,033
be fair...

309
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,180
and, uh...

310
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,733
- be true.
- Be true.

311
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,522
- And, oh...
- Daddy... it's okay.

312
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:05,971
You don't have to finish it.
I know the whole thing.

313
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:13,003
But you know something? I really believe
that this me, it's going to last...

314
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,880
for quite some time.

315
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,600
- Be patient.
- Be patient.

316
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,233
Thank you, daddy.

317
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,893
- May I have this walk?
- You may.

318
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,963
Everybody, please sit down.

319
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,243
And so, Karen, Freddy,

320
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,481
I send you off into
the mystery of marriage

321
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,582
with three words that
start with the letter "C."

322
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:39,210
First, confirmation--

323
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,682
married people provide
confirmation for each other.

324
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:47,403
When one person sees a
shooting star or an aurora,

325
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,470
then they have someone
to turn to all the time

326
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:54,992
to whom to which to say, "did you see that?
Did that really happen?"

327
00:20:56,065 --> 00:21:00,830
And in a life that's full of amazing moments,
it's important to have...

328
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,110
confirmation.

329
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,572
The second is consolation--

330
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:10,613
married people provide
consolation for each other.

331
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:14,623
When bad luck,
death or even the simple sadness

332
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,492
of the passing of beauty
becomes hard to make it go on,

333
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:23,531
then you have someone to turn to for a hand,
for an embrace,

334
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:27,493
for a kiss, for consolation.

335
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,830
And last but not least...

336
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,333
there's joy.

337
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:43,232
It's not a "c" word, but then...
life and love are surprising.

338
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,831
You may kiss the bride.

339
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,943
Oh, my god.
I feel like a prisoner in here.

340
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:56,282
Karen, before we go into all that madness,
I need to tell you something.

341
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:01,012
What are you doing?

342
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:04,693
When I first proposed to you,
I didn't love you.

343
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,333
- Oh, that's okay.
- No, listen.

344
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:10,331
I saw this world,
and I wanted to be a part of it.

345
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:12,771
Freddy, honey, it's okay. I get it.

346
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:16,200
But during the ceremony,
and hearing those vows,

347
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:18,931
I realized that I have
fallen in love with you.

348
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,701
And none of the superficial stuff--
the money, whatever--

349
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,790
matters to me anymore.

350
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,480
- I want to propose.
- You already did.

351
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:33,732
- I want to do it again.
- Oh.

352
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:35,800
Karen Darling Mason...

353
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,321
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

354
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,653
Oh, god.

355
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:54,040
I want to spend the rest of my life with you,
too, baby... forever.

356
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,192
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present to you

357
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:01,101
- Mr. and Mrs. Freddy Mason.
- All right, Freddy!

358
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:19,421
I want a divorce. Now.

359
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:32,011
Tell me this is some kind of joke.

360
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,642
I told you I was having second thoughts.
I told you both.

361
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,940
Karen Darling,
you are not going out there

362
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,340
and announcing your divorce
during your wedding.

363
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,500
Of course not.
I would never ruin a party.

364
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:45,171
Karen, you've been married for less
than an hour. Is it possible--

365
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,970
I can tell when these things won't work out,
Nick. I'm a pro.

366
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,853
You're an embarrassment
is what you are.

367
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,490
You thinks this makes me happy?
Because the last time I checked,

368
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:56,160
being a 4-time divorcée wasn't
exactly a big selling point.

369
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,640
Then why did you go through
with it in the first place?

370
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,140
- Because you told me to!
- Karen, listen to me.

371
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:04,861
While Freddy may not be the perfect man,
he is as capable

372
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:08,580
and deserving a fourth husband
as you're likely to find.

373
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:12,691
Tables seven and eight
are filled with lawyers.

374
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,950
Am I gonna have to go out
there and hire one of them,

375
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,660
or are you gonna take
care of this for me?

376
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:18,453
- I will talk to Freddy.
- Thank you.

377
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:21,342
Now I can go outside and have
my father-daughter dance.

378
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:23,941
- Karen.
- Yeah, what? I need a drink.

379
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:27,692
Let's all just agree that your father
doesn't need to know about this right now.

380
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:31,101
- Let him have his night.
- He's so happy.

381
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:34,281
I know, and I wish I had it in
me to stay married just for him.

382
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:36,620
But I don't.

383
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,292
Well, I hope you're happy.

384
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:52,073
Well, your honor, the seven deadly
sins are not like the constitution.

385
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,753
They can't be amended.
So if I were you, yes, I'd be worried.

386
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:56,960
May I?

387
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:02,072
Brian...

388
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:04,801
what a wonderful wedding sermon--

389
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:09,551
so much... humanity, so much hope.

390
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:17,140
There really is such a kind person
buried deep down inside you,

391
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:20,801
deep... deep down...

392
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,612
inside you...

393
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:25,941
somewhere.

394
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:28,642
Thanks, dad.

395
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,563
So how is it being a Darling?

396
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:36,611
I'm pretty new at it, but I guess it's okay.
The food's good.

397
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:40,942
Well, when I grow up,
I'm going to live just like this,

398
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:45,691
no matter what it takes.
No matter what.

399
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,240
This is nice, right?

400
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:56,420
- We don't dance enough.
- Would dancing satisfy you?

401
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,580
Would dancing give you
whatever it is that you--

402
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:00,172
- Ellen, I don't want to--
- Smile.

403
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,671
There's a nice fake picture.

404
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:05,301
Hope everybody in the fake
world likes fake looking at it.

405
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:09,210
You know what?
I am not going to do this. I can't.

406
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm gonna get a drink.

407
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:16,020
It's an annulment.

408
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:18,923
Freddy, per Karen's request,

409
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:21,163
I've prepared all the
necessary legal documents.

410
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,611
There's a judge at table number seven,
he's ready to sign.

411
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:29,452
- But I still get the check, right?
- Of course, baby, I made a vow.

412
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,180
You will still receive the
full divorce settlement

413
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:37,841
as specified in the prenup--
$3 million.

414
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:43,090
All you have to do
is sign right there.

415
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:54,272
Done.

416
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:01,812
You must be ecstatic.

417
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:06,621
- Freddy... I never meant--
- Karen, please...

418
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:10,960
Don't feel sorry for me.
Okay? I feel sorry for you.

419
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:14,493
Because you are a screwed up little
girl who has a thing for her lawyer.

420
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:17,903
And no matter how hard
you try and fight it,

421
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:21,811
you are gonna die alone and unhappy.
That's what you deserve.

422
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:29,551
- Hey, listen, Karen, he's just--
- Nick, don't, okay?

423
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:36,501
- Just don't. Don't.
- I'm sorry, Karen.

424
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:50,872
So what's the matter?

425
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,622
I came here to discuss with you
a highly sensitive matter, but

426
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:59,540
I realize perhaps now
is not the best time.

427
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:03,780
I had a cup of Chai tea.
I'm gonna be up all night. Talk to me.

428
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:09,641
I have this acquaintance for
whom I care a great deal.

429
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:12,831
- A mistress?
-  She, uh...

430
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,570
used to be a mister.

431
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:20,253
It's none of my business
how you like your eggs.

432
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,193
Well, I appreciate that, but, uh,

433
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:28,242
you see, Ellen-- she keeps asking
all sorts of questions, and, uh,

434
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,432
she knows something, and I just can't--
I just can't keep lying.

435
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,480
Then stop lying. In fact,

436
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,973
I think it's time
for Patrick Darling

437
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:40,081
to stop apologizing
for being himself.

438
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:44,793
Come on, it's the 21st century.
People's hearts and minds are open.

439
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:46,691
They're tired of the
politics of deception.

440
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:50,291
They're starved for truth,
and I'll bet Ellen is the same.

441
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,880
But if I tell Ellen the truth she,
you know,

442
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,283
she might leave me,
and that could ruin my campaign.

443
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,291
I don't know. I think Ellen's
smarter than you give her credit for.

444
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:02,153
So you think I should just tell her
the truth, just confess everything?

445
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,291
It's not a confession.
It's a conversation.

446
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:06,541
And it's the right thing
to do for your marriage,

447
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:07,823
for your country...

448
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,110
and for your soul.

449
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay.

450
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,182
Okay, great. Thank you.

451
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,363
- Thank you.
- All right.

452
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,552
I'm proud of you, Pat.

453
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,953
I appreciate your discretion.

454
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:32,230
It's all good.

455
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:38,121
- Good night.
- Good night.

456
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:54,241
You're sure Ellen Darling has
no idea this came from us?

457
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:59,473
Yes, sir. Absolutely sure.

458
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,922
Good...

459
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:04,743
Good... good.

460
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,843
- Quite a roller coaster today.
- Yeah.

461
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,960
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

462
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:15,110
I managed to sell those
pictures for $1.3 million.

463
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,630
- That's nothing to sneeze at.
- Yeah, that's nice.

464
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:20,063
I still matter.

465
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,131
So you want to tell me
what really happened?

466
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,863
He told me he loved me.

467
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,771
Right after the ceremony,
he just spit it out.

468
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:31,643
- And that wasn't good?
- I don't know.

469
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:36,510
When I thought Freddy was in
it only for the money, it...

470
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:40,170
it somehow made it okay. You know?

471
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:42,471
Like it was easier to deal with.

472
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:45,461
I knew he'd always be there because
the money would always be there.

473
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:47,730
- And then it got real.
- Yeah.

474
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,840
More real, anyway.

475
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:54,621
But then after he said those horrible
things to me at the divorce, it--

476
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,312
it just proved that...

477
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:59,461
- I did the right thing.
- He was wrong. He was hurt.

478
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:01,611
He was right about one thing.

479
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,723
I am in love with you.

480
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,292
Karen--

481
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,623
You know we belong together.

482
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:23,423
We've both known it since we were kids.
We fit.

483
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:28,340
I gotta go.

484
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:58,182
O doomed from here to eternity lord
have mercy on such as we bah, bah, bah

485
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:09,972
Bone dry.

486
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,172
That was a beautiful wedding day.

487
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:20,013
Oh, Karen finally got it right.
I'll sleep well tonight,

488
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:25,912
knowing that she has found a man's
heart in which to make her home.

489
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:31,233
Daddy, can I talk to you?

490
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:40,092
Oh, I think we might
have set a record here.

491
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:44,871
How was the opening?

492
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,373
- Amazing.
- Good.

493
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,490
- A-mazing.
- Excellent.

494
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,893
Stella's paintings
sold out in one hour.

495
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:54,282
She is now passed out
drunk on my office couch

496
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:57,431
with some cuban short stop who's
just defected to the Yankees.

497
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,542
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

498
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:04,072
- So how was the wedding?
- It was all right.

499
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:08,020
Karen's wedding photos sold for 300 grand,
so the Darling family foundation

500
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,082
only had to kick in a cool
mil to protect her feelings.

501
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,041
- That's kinda sad.
- Yeah.

502
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,232
So she actually went
through with it.

503
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:21,420
And then 45 minutes later,
she got through with it.

504
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:23,520
What?

505
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,971
Karen had the marriage annulled.

506
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:28,980
I wonder why.

507
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:32,730
Well, it had nothing to do with me
if that's what you're implying.

508
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:36,641
- Of course it didn't, Nick.
- Hey, Lisa, would you wait?

509
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,600
- I'm tired.
- I know, I know, and I'm tired, too,

510
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:42,001
but I just--
I want all of this to stop.

511
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:46,851
I love you,
and that is never gonna change.

512
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:50,892
I don't know how many times I
have to say this-- I'm yours.

513
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:55,421
- One more time.
- I'm yours.

514
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,023
Come here.

515
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,801
I'm going shopping on Madison.

516
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:17,532
It's Carmelita.

517
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:24,121
Excuse me?

518
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:27,410
Her name is, uh, Carmelita.

519
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:33,132
Do you love her?

520
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,511
I love, uh...

521
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,620
I love you both.

522
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:43,733
I can't give her up.
I've tried. I don't know how.

523
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:50,013
Well, then...
we don't have a choice, do we?

524
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:56,141
The three of us are gonna sit down
together and set some ground rules.

525
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:59,752
The three of us? You, me and...

526
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:02,542
you, me and who?

527
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,462
Carmelita.

528
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:07,460
She won't destroy this marriage.

529
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:11,462
And she will not keep us out of Washington,
either one of us.

530
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,783
I didn't marry a
Darling for nothing.

531
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:25,292
Bingles! Bingles, wait for me!

532
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:28,833
Bingles!

533
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,483
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

534
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,552
Oh, look what I got. Here.

535
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:36,490
- Thank you.
- Ta-da!

536
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:37,890
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

537
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:40,483
Hey, will you tell Germs
that we're friends again?

538
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:43,352
I think we should
tell the whole world!

539
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:49,160
He's in here.

540
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,822
- Hi.
- Hey.

541
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:55,010
Where's Brian Jr.?

542
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:57,311
He's at a fencing lesson,
but he'll be back.

543
00:35:57,598 --> 00:36:00,282
He's getting really good at it.
You know, I think if he has a few more--

544
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:02,051
I'm taking him back to Brazil.

545
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:06,191
What?

546
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,821
Yeah, I realized this morning
when I woke up in Queens...

547
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:14,053
I went to Brazil to find myself,
but I think I found a home, too.

548
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:17,102
- In the jungle?
- No, in Sao Paulo.

549
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:22,193
And what about Brian Jr.? What about
Maple Grove? He's gonna start in the fall.

550
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,183
You can't just come in here and uproot him.
He has a life here now.

551
00:36:25,378 --> 00:36:28,531
I'm sure we can find him a
fencing coach down there.

552
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:31,873
And you'll pay for it if you
want him to live in the manner

553
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:35,971
to which he's become so quickly
and completely accustomed.

554
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:40,100
Did you really think I'd
let you keep him forever?

555
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:44,033
- Mommy!
- Hi!

556
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,841
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

557
00:36:57,836 --> 00:37:00,040
- Patrick.
- Hello, dad.

558
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:09,881
Where's Ellen?

559
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,962
Are things okay with the two of you?
Fences mended?

560
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:16,703
We're on the way.

561
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:23,481
- So this is where you're living?
- For the time being.

562
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:30,880
Let me reiterate--
I had nothing to do with Ellen finding out,

563
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:35,271
- absolutely nothing at all.
- That why you came here, dad, to,

564
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,561
convince me of your innocence?

565
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:39,630
I came to tell you I loved you

566
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,831
and that you're ways
welcome under my roof,

567
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:46,251
regardless of whatever business
disagreements we might have.

568
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,413
I feel bad I let it go this far.

569
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:57,241
But the point is,
if you get tired of hotel living,

570
00:37:57,937 --> 00:38:00,990
the fourth floor of the
Imperial is always waiting.

571
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,151
I appreciate that, dad. Thank you.

572
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:05,553
But, uh,
we found a place over on the park.

573
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:11,291
- Where, exactly?
- The Octavius.

574
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,631
Simon Elder owns that building.

575
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:20,792
I know, dad. He suggested it.
We move in in two weeks.

576
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:29,051
- Do I really have to go to Brazil?
- You're not going to Brazil yet.

577
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:30,873
You're just going to
Queens with your mom.

578
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:35,880
- Do they have lemon curd in Queens?
- I'll send a jar home with you.

579
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,892
And there'll always be plenty
here when you come visit.

580
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,792
Are you sure she'll let me visit?

581
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:48,430
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to make sure that she does.

582
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:51,823
Let's go, sweetie.

583
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,180
Don't pack just yet.

584
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,403
Bye, daddy.

585
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,741
Bye, little man.

586
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:12,951
What in God's name is this?

587
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:17,380
Just some sock Freddy wanted to sell
to kids as part of a golf video.

588
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:21,201
Oh. Maybe he wasn't a keeper.

589
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:24,532
Last night I told Nick that
he and I belong together.

590
00:39:24,716 --> 00:39:27,210
- And then I kissed him.
- Oh, Karen.

591
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,932
I know, I know.
But I just got so caught up in the moment.

592
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,572
You know the wedding made
me feel so romantic.

593
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:36,063
Yeah, well,
why do you do this to yourself?

594
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:42,383
Because I want to marry Nick.
Don't I have to try?

595
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:46,321
I can't go the rest of my life
wondering what might have happened.

596
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:51,093
- Can I?
- Oh, no. N-no.

597
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:56,463
- No, you can't. I just...
- Mom, that's a candle. You can't...

598
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:58,193
Here you go.

599
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:09,230
- I'll just ask you for one thing.
- What's that?

600
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:13,470
Let me help you.

601
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:22,751
He has stolen my son.

602
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:26,402
Patrick is a person, Tripp,

603
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:30,202
making his own choices.
This isn't about theft.

604
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:35,352
There are so many spurious
assumptions behind that statement.

605
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,410
Tripp, do you know that
Patrick is working with Simon?

606
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:40,711
He's living in Simon
Elder's building.

607
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:45,091
Ostensibly, to all intents and purposes,
Simon Elder is serving Patrick

608
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:49,800
in some sort of all-encompassing
advisory capacity, and I am certain that

609
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:54,500
it is Simon Elder who was behind
Paddy's push to indict my friends.

610
00:40:54,925 --> 00:41:01,010
I'm not a vengeful person, Nick.
I have endured massive betrayal.

611
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:05,061
And I have responded
with patience...

612
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:07,131
and with love.

613
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:11,683
But I will not suffer this man.

614
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,440
What do you want to do?

615
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:25,071
I want to destroy him.

616
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,860
I want that son of a bitch...

617
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:39,313
completely and utterly destroyed.
