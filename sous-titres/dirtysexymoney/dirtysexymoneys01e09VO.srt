1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:03,345
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,650
until his plane went down
in Long Island Sound.

3
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:08,858
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings-- Tripp and Letitia...

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,572
Which of our
children isn't mine?

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,120
Brian, the man of god...

6
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:15,246
Please help the arbitrator
of the custody meeting

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,906
to understand that
I love my son.

8
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:20,111
Give her the good sense to accept
my generous donation. Amen.

9
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,942
Patrick, the
principled politician...

10
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:23,200
Isn't this something?

11
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,626
You can have one
saturday night a month,

12
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:25,985
but the rest of the
weekends are ours.

13
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,567
So why exactly would I do this?

14
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,411
Because it's more than
you'll ever have otherwise.

15
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:30,841
Karen, the
professional divorcée...

16
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:31,801
- Karen Darling?
- Hi.

17
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:33,631
- Do you eat anything yummy?
- Down girl.

18
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,311
Shut up.

19
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:36,332
And Jeremy and juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

20
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,772
I want this girl
to like me for me.

21
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,610
You're a Darling.
As soon as she finds that out,

22
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,141
things are never
gonna be the same.

23
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,782
I guess she can
never find out then.

24
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:44,191
What the hell was that?

25
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,581
So how long is it gonna take you
to wrap up this custody hearing?

26
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,502
Brian, this is the fate of
your child we're dealing with.

27
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,750
Custody cases rarely turn
out in favor of the father.

28
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:00,230
Thanks. Never knew that.

29
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,783
Especially situations where the
child is forced by the father

30
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,652
to lie about being an
orphan from Sweden.

31
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:07,901
I did the best with what I was
given situation-wise. Back off.

32
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,980
Oh, in the matter of
Brian Darling vs...

33
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,832
I'm sorry, your honor.
Where are Andrea Smithson and counsel?

34
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:19,472
Oh, they've already been notified
that I've ruled in her favor.

35
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:22,110
She now has full custody, and she can
leave the country at her discretion.

36
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,500
- What the hell is going on?
- Your honor, on what grounds--

37
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,572
On the ground that Brian
darling is under arrest

38
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,631
for attempting to bribe
a public official.

39
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,393
Oh, crap.

40
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:35,363
- Nice to see you again.
- That woman is a complete liar!

41
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,882
Your honor, a moment.

42
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,312
You bribed the arbitrator?

43
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:44,371
You told me that we
were gonna lose.

44
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:47,290
- Oh, so it's my fault now?
- Bail is set at $5 million.

45
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,711
What are you gonna
do about my son?

46
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,512
Why can't we ever
stay at your place?

47
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,803
You wouldn't wanna.
My place is a total sty.

48
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:01,723
Who cares?
It doesn't have to be perfect.

49
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:05,010
I can't do it, Sofia.
Trust me, it's for your own good.

50
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,891
- Okay, fine.
- Wet.

51
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:11,422
But no more pudín for
you until I go there.

52
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,733
Where are you on
this pain chart?

53
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:22,931
About a three.
But that's the morphine talking.

54
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,322
About an eight or a nine
when the meds wear off,

55
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:29,953
but we're not about to
let that happen. So...

56
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:33,533
- You shot me in the leg.
- I was aiming for higher.

57
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,723
- Where do we go from here, Ellen?
- Well...

58
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:39,902
I'm sorry I shot you.

59
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,632
We both know we can win
this election, Patrick.

60
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:48,441
And I'm not gonna let you screw it
up with your childish indiscretions.

61
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm gonna win.

62
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:53,043
Not if you lose your wife in
the middle of the campaign.

63
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,770
Is that a threat?

64
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,830
Patrick, I am not made to share
you with another woman or...

65
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,872
- man.
- But I thought we...

66
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,970
had, like, a... a deal.

67
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,802
Well, I have had
a change of heart.

68
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,842
End things with Carmelita,

69
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,132
or I will end any shot you
have of a seat in the senate.

70
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,001
Okay.

71
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,512
I'll do it.

72
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,620
Brian should be free on
bail in a few hours,

73
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:33,922
but this is far from over.
He committed a class "c" felony.

74
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,211
- What does that actually mean?
- Maximum ten years in prison

75
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:39,890
minimum, suspended
sentence of one year.

76
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,712
- What's your best guess?
- I really don't know.

77
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,443
One month in jail, maybe two.

78
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,643
Well, we must know someone on
good terms with this judge.

79
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:51,560
No. The belief that we can get
away with pulling strings behind

80
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:55,090
the scenes is exactly what got Brian
into this position in the first place.

81
00:03:55,468 --> 00:04:00,420
Going that route is utter foolishness,
not to mention unprincipled.

82
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,721
- Not to mention illegal.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,711
What about Patrick?
He is the attorney general of New York.

84
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,970
Doesn't that count
for anything?

85
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,971
Patrick's campaign is
already so compromised

86
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:16,923
that the slightest whiff of corruption
could completely derail it.

87
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,141
Patrick has denied you,
denounced you

88
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:23,142
and gotten into bed with Simon Elder--
your greatest enemy--

89
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,770
and yet he's still more
important to you than Brian?

90
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,841
Brian committed a felony.

91
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:31,333
Because he loves his son,
like fathers are supposed to.

92
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,160
Because he is
fueled by contempt.

93
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,600
Contempt permeates
every cell of his being.

94
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:38,380
What is the point of
having power and money

95
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,781
if we don't use them
to help the children?

96
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,881
- What else are they for?
- Good grief, Tish, the point...

97
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,881
the money compels us
to act impeccably.

98
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:53,730
If we start to use our influence,
our privilege to pervert justice...

99
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:58,960
that conduct-- that is the beginning
of the end of us as a family.

100
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:00,842
As a family?

101
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,562
I think we would
all be best served

102
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:15,403
by reacting honorably
to this situation,

103
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:18,463
all of us, especially Brian.

104
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:21,671
And if this were Patrick or Karen,
would you be saying the same thing?

105
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:26,153
Exactly the same.
What Brian needs is our support

106
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,763
while he spends a
month or two in jail.

107
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,560
Nick, the children's
hospital proposal?

108
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:38,993
$400 million ought to do it.

109
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,772
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

110
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,281
Is there something going
on between you and Tripp?

111
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,643
Don't worry about that.

112
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,232
Worry about keeping
my son out of jail.

113
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:00,931
If your father were alive,
he'd know how to handle this.

114
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,421
I'd like to be alone.

115
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,360
Six months ago.

116
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:27,253
- Welcome back, Mr. George.
- Thank you, Howard.

117
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,652
And please call me Dutch.

118
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,562
Hello there.

119
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,381
Hello.

120
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,300
I thought you were
up in Valhalla.

121
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:48,541
Oh, well, I snuck out. I wanted to
wish you a happy birthday in person.

122
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,132
That's nice.

123
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,670
- You don't like it.
- No, it's beautiful.

124
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,592
No, I know. It's extravagant.

125
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:04,791
Look, it's just that, you know,
I've worn this watch for 30 years,

126
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:07,280
and it's a gift from my father,
and I...

127
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,753
I just can't imagine
replacing it.

128
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:12,791
I'm really touched.
I really am.

129
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:16,131
And you are the only one who
remembered my birthday this year.

130
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,251
It's lovely. Thank you.

131
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,143
- Nick didn't call you?
- No.

132
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:28,762
Nick hasn't talked
to me in months.

133
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,091
- I was hoping that--
- It's okay. It's my fault.

134
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:36,330
I wasn't there for him,
not the way a parent's supposed to be,

135
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:38,202
and so he learned
to live without me.

136
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:41,123
Now I have to learn
to live without him.

137
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm sure that Nick would be open
to repairing your relationship.

138
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,442
It's too late. It's too late.

139
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,281
God, I know life is
about making mistakes,

140
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,670
but the mistakes you
make with your kids...

141
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,713
They never go away.

142
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,613
They just grow.
They keep growing and growing.

143
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:09,930
What's the matter?

144
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:17,936
- I've made mistakes, too.
- What are you talking about?

145
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,705
Nick is not your only child.

146

Synchro: Travis - Transcript: Raceman

147
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,362
A little privacy, please.
This is all a big misunderstanding.

148
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,710
Get a life, vulture.
Please tell me that

149
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,962
you did something to get
my son back. Something.

150
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:48,263
Hey, I just got you out of jail, Brian.
How about a thank-you?

151
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,391
Send yourself a gift basket.
What are we gonna do?

152
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,373
You got me, sunshine.
We're screwed.

153
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,510
- Jeremy?
- Hey, Lisa.

154
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,960
- Hey.
- Is Nick here?

155
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,441
Actually, he's bailing your brother
out of jail. What's going on?

156
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:09,570
- What are you looking for?
- Bingo.

157
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,022
Is it cool if I borrow
your place tomorrow night?

158
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,480
- Jeremy...
- What? I'm not driving.

159
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,732
- You're a valet.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

160
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,770
- So can I use your place?
- For what?

161
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,983
Well, this girl I'm into
doesn't know who I am.

162
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:26,660
- She thinks I'm poor.
- What gave her that idea?

163
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,280
I told her I was poor.
So I just need a place that

164
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,423
looks like a poor guy would live there,
you know?

165
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,880
- Jeremy, we're not poor.
- Those ants look pretty low-budge.

166
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:39,323
- Those ants cost 12,000 bucks.
- Proving my point.

167
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,941
Look, I'll pay you if you want,
you know, if you could use the cash.

168
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,411
I have a better idea.
How about you tell her the truth,

169
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,300
get to know each
other as people?

170
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:49,070
I like your style, Lise.

171
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,251
But that ship has sailed.

172
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:58,102
What a pleasant surprise.
It's so, uh...

173
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:04,190
interesting of you to come visit me,
Karen. How's Freddy?

174
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,201
We got divorced the day we got married,
Pat. You were there.

175
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:10,632
Oh, right. Right, right.
Kudos on that.

176
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:14,210
- You're still on morphine.
- Yes, indeedy.

177
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,752
I feel like I'm filled
with lime green neon.

178
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,152
Well... captain neon...

179
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,860
as a voting member of the
board of Darling enterprises,

180
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,093
I'm gonna need you to sign some
tax stuff for the foundation.

181
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,213
It's just quarter-end stuff.

182
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:33,450
Okay, let me help
you with that.

183
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,243
Good enough.

184
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

185
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:40,960
Oh, hey, Simon.
What you doing here?

186
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,020
- Simon.
- Hey, Patrick. I just

187
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,240
have a little business to
discuss with your brother.

188
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,461
Okay, I was just leaving.
Hospitals kinda freak me out anyway.

189
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:55,423
You know, it's like death. "I'm
coming for you, Karen. Here I come."

190
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:58,460
It's, like,
just the way they hit me sometimes.

191
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,510
Hey, Karen. Karen, um...

192
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:04,392
I know you're very
involved in philanthropy.

193
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:07,872
And I wondered if you'd have
any interest in merging

194
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,160
some of our resources...

195
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,550
for a good cause.

196
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,893
Hello, mama.

197
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,641
I don't usually...

198
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,832
merge my resources with
virtual strangers.

199
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,441
Then maybe you'd be up for
discussing charitable giving

200
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,923
over dinner sometime.

201
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:30,173
I got your charitable
giving right here.

202
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,902
I'll consider it,
but don't hold your breath.

203
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:36,380
My family loved that
building you tore down.

204
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:40,812
She and dad have always
had some kinda connection.

205
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,920
Yeah, it's called family.

206
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,403
Um, speaking of which,
are you...

207
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,103
are you still planning on calling
dad and having him testify

208
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,050
in this Fantini brothers
real estate thing?

209
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:58,960
Uh... actually,
that was what we were about to discuss.

210
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:00,541
Fine. Okay.

211
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,653
Uh... my bad.

212
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,631
Sweet dreams.

213
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:07,863
Bye.

214
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,592
- Take care, Karen.
- Adios.

215
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,680
- When did you get back?
- A few hours ago.

216
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,223
I'm sorry I'm late to dinner,
but this jet lag is crippling.

217
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,853
- I just had to take a nap.
- I tried to let you sleep, dear.

218
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:23,660
- So... what did I miss?
- Brian could be going to jail.

219
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:26,102
- Brian, no.
- That's an exaggeration.

220
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:29,870
I'm sure whatever happens,
Nick will take care of it, won't he?

221
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,520
No, actually,
it's all Nick's fault.

222
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:34,723
How can you blame Nick for
your systemic malfeasance?

223
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,550
I'm not blaming Nick
for my malfeasance,

224
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,092
but I lost my son because of
his incompetence and disregard.

225
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:42,200
I find your notion that
Nick is incompetent absurd.

226
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:44,873
Well, I know, but, dad,
that's because he has you snowed,

227
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,752
just like Dutch did.

228
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:54,950
Dutch... don't go.
We're not done.

229
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,402
I cannot talk
about this anymore.

230
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,343
Please don't leave angry.
Don't leave angry.

231
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,103
I am gonna be angry about
this for the rest of my life.

232
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:05,773
I tried to tell you so many times.
I wasn't sure you wanted to know.

233
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,503
When? When did you
try to tell me?

234
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:13,953
I couldn't get up the courage.
I was afraid you'd leave me.

235
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,773
- Please.
- It's fitting, actually.

236
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:24,811
All this time that I have been lying
to Tripp and agonizing over it,

237
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,202
you were lying to me,

238
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:31,341
which is exactly what I deserve.
It makes perfect sense.

239
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:35,721
Why should I expect to be treated
any better than your husband?

240
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:39,003
Dutch... I love you.

241
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:42,893
And I know that you love me.
We'll survive this.

242
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,831
Nick was right about you people.
He was right all along.

243
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:51,313
I have to get away from you--

244
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:55,043
from all of you--
before it's too late.

245
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,210
You ready?

246
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,573
Here it goes.

247
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:04,952
Wow.

248
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,662
This place is...

249
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,951
- not good.
- I know, right?

250
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,013
I mean, I--
it's, like, it's the best I can do.

251
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:20,081
You know, I'm cool with it
because I have no choice.

252
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm-- I'm poor. So, uh...
what do you say?

253
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,542
Now that we've
seen hooverville,

254
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:29,072
why don't we head back to your place,
get some pudín?

255
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,642
Can we talk first?

256
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,813
What about?

257
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,120
I wanted to talk with
you about Brazil.

258
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:40,051
- Brazil.
- Brazil.

259
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,500
Speaking as a parent,
I think you're making a mistake.

260
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:46,232
I'm not.
I'm finally doing something right.

261
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:48,141
I just thought that
you wanted Brian jr.

262
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,643
to reap the benefits of being
born into the Darling family.

263
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,931
That was before I realized what
that family is capable of.

264
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,482
And before I went to Brazil.

265
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:59,570
Andrea, I don't think you
want to deprive your son

266
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,370
of the father he's
just getting to know.

267
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,773
He made him into
a swedish orphan.

268
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:08,671
Look, I know this isn't
gonna be easy for Brian jr.

269
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,711
but it's also what's best.

270
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,971
See, between the people like you that
the Darlings pay to get things done

271
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:23,350
and the simple fact that both Brian
and his money are so attractive,

272
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:28,201
we have to get away,
for my own safety and my son's.

273
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:37,923
I know it's not all ritzy,
but I'm just a valet, doll face.

274
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,691
So you have no goals...

275
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:44,731
no dreams, no hopes... nothing?

276
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:48,781
Well... I do want to go
to space at some point.

277
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,863
Like, for real. Like--
like space is-- it's kinda my thing.

278
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:58,403
- This is not going to work out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

279
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,793
What, is this because I'm poor?
Because you know what?

280
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:05,132
- That is like financial racism.
- No, it's not because you're poor.

281
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,691
It's because you don't
care that you're poor.

282
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,190
I need to be with someone
who wants to go somewhere.

283
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:16,293
- I do! I want to go to space.
- I am sorry.

284
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,723
All right. Wait.
Sofia, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

285
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,271
Just let me explain, okay.

286
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:23,561
Ay, no. And something is,
like, biting me or something.

287
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,200
I know, right?
The little bastard.

288
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:28,743
Okay, look...
I shoulda told you this a long time ago.

289
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,033
Told me what?

290
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,180
The truth about who I am.

291
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,831
- Hello, Nick.
- Letitia.

292
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:38,623
I assume you heard the charges
against Brian have been dropped.

293
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,001
Yes, such good news.

294
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:42,673
And given Tripp's feelings
about the matter,

295
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,742
I assume you had
something to do with it.

296
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,742
I did what I had to, Nick.
You'd do the same for Kiki.

297
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,120
And what exactly did you do?

298
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,803
Uh, you don't need to
concern yourself with that.

299
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,301
The point is,
it's taken care of.

300
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:03,480
Letitia, I cannot be in the position
of representing the family in--

301
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,772
You're not in any
position, Nick.

302
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:09,010
You follow your conscience,
you speak your piece,

303
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,221
and we'll all do what occurs to
us to do. It's a good system.

304
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:17,160
And you're right most of the time,
just not about this.

305
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,420
And, uh,
if you could keep this between us,

306
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,671
- I'd greatly appreciate it.
- You want me to keep this from Tripp?

307
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,782
He has so much faith in
your legal abilities,

308
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,093
he'll just assume it's
another one of your victories.

309
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,593
You want me to lie to Tripp?

310
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,982
Tripp sometimes feels that helping
the children is indulgence.

311
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:34,970
Letitia, I can name at
least five occasions

312
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,201
where Tripp has gone out of
his way behind the scenes

313
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,410
to make things happen for Patrick,
Karen, Juliet.

314
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:43,180
He picks and chooses his favorites.
That's no secret. Fini.

315
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,143
What are you trying
to hide, Letitia?

316
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,760
What won't you tell me?

317
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:09,480
It's, uh... It's--
it's difficult to explain.

318
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,091
Give it a shot.

319
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:14,842
Um...

320
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:20,943
information has recently come to light.
Information that...

321
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:26,371
Tripp has had trouble
coming to terms with,

322
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,531
not that I blame him at all.

323
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:35,300
You know, Letitia, the last time
I saw my dad before he died...

324
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:39,710
he said some things
I didn't understand.

325
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:42,470
And now you're starting to.

326
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:47,050
Now... we all are.

327
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,301
Everything is... happening.

328
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,730
Go ahead.

329
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:58,253
After I told him about...
my affair, um...

330
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,021
Tripp blackmailed my O.B.-G.Y.N.
He was...

331
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,610
he was sure that the
twins weren't his.

332
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,582
But he was wrong.

333
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:13,681
Yes.

334
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,691
And Brian is my brother.

335
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,633
Brian is your brother.

336
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:27,492
It could've been Karen.

337
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,070
Wow. Thanks a lot, Lisa.
You're a big help.

338
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,741
Look at it like this--
it's a fresh start for you and Brian.

339
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,172
I'm not especially sure I want
a fresh start for me and Brian.

340
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,711
You know,
when I was in the fifth grade,

341
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,641
I'd saved up my allowance to buy this
book, "Where the red fern grows."

342
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,733
I'm sitting in the
lobby at Darling Plaza

343
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,723
waiting for my dad reading the book,
and Brian walks by, and he says,

344
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,660
"oh, I read that book last year.
The dogs die."

345
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,873
And I don't know what came over me,
but I just tore the book in half,

346
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:56,291
threw it in the trash can--
I never finished reading it.

347
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:59,811
Knowing Brian is my brother makes me
want to do that with my whole life.

348
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,732
- Your whole life?
- It's a feeling, lisa.

349
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,250
Obviously, I'm not talking
about you and Kiki, all right?

350
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:06,180
So why do you keep
working for them?

351
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,582
- Come on, Lisa. You know why.
- No, I don't.

352
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:11,450
Whatever you find out there is
not going to bring your dad back.

353
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:13,282
Lisa, this isn't about my dad.

354
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,821
I finally have a chance to make
a real impact on the world.

355
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:20,891
I am going to build a $400-million
pediatric cancer research center.

356
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,162
And I can't do that without
the Darlings' money.

357
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:27,651
There is just no possible way.
No possible way.

358
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:30,093
So I'm just--
I'm stuck, you know?

359
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:33,992
Yeah. It's about the money.

360
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,541
Yeah.

361
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:39,712
It's about the money.

362
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,491
Excuse me?

363
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,370
- No kiss?
- No.

364
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:55,240
Someone might see.

365
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:57,832
Oh, come on.
What's one last kiss?

366
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:02,110
- Last kiss?
- Well, yeah, you know...

367
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:08,342
Last kiss today, last kiss this minute,
last kiss with our clothes on.

368
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:11,691
You're messed up.

369
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:16,133
And I'm trying to be careful.

370
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:21,003
Oh. She's not gonna
shoot you, too.

371
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:26,071
The firearms chapter of
my marriage is over.

372
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,501
I hope.

373
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:34,523
She must really love you.
You know, to shoot you like that.

374
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,910
I guess that's a word for it.

375
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:43,420
Are you all right?

376
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:51,083
Yeah. Of course.

377
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:55,492
Paddy, if you need to
simplify your life...

378
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:00,760
and just be with Ellen,
I understand.

379
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,610
I just want you to be happy.

380
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:15,123
No.

381
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:18,232
Come.

382
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,893
Ellen can shoot me all she wants,
but it's...

383
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,440
being away from you
that's really killing me.

384
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,553
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.

385
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,211
Last kiss?

386
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,433
- Okay.
- I need serious help.

387
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:59,223
Jeremy, I told you. You cannot
use our place for your poorhouse.

388
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,690
I don't want to.
I bought a little studio in the Bronx,

389
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:05,233
hired a Broadway designer
to make it look all ratty,

390
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:07,431
- and I showed it to Sofia.
- So problem solved.

391
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:11,153
Mm, not quite. She wanted to
dump me because I had no goals.

392
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,533
- So I told her.
- The truth? Good for you.

393
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:17,070
- No. I told her I was an artist.
- Good one.

394
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:20,930
Yeah, I panicked because she
was grilling me, and, you know,

395
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:23,813
I started thinking about you and your
ants and how you work in a gallery,

396
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,563
and so I figured you
could just hook me up.

397
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,101
You need to stop
lying to this woman.

398
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:28,341
- No, I can't.
- Why?

399
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:30,403
Because I want her
to love me for me.

400
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:33,181
Jeremy, you are not
a struggling artist.

401
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,430
Sure I am.
I am an artist of life.

402
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,502
Could you just hook me up with,
like, five paintings please?

403
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:46,580
- So you didn't seem surprised.
- Because I knew you'd call.

404
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,261
Oh. I didn't.

405
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,542
I usually keep people guessing.

406
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,631
Ask any of my four ex-husbands.

407
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:55,610
Ah.

408
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,642
So are you on good
terms with them?

409
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,730
Mm-hmm, all but one. Freddy--
you know, the last one--

410
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:05,243
I think he's still a little
stung by the 1-day turnaround,

411
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,581
but he'll get over it.
You were married once, right?

412
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:12,051
I was. We're still quite close.

413
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:15,533
She's a special woman.
A princess.

414
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:18,831
Aww, yeah. I get it.
She's special.

415
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:22,362
No, seriously.
She's a princess... from Ghana.

416
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:23,531
Of course.

417
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:26,973
I still think of her as,
my primary partner in life,

418
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,653
even though we've
legally split.

419
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:33,182
But we have a child together,
and there's a deep connection and...

420
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:38,261
I don't know.
I guess it's hard for me to let go.

421
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:39,473
I like that.

422
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:43,750
I didn't come here looking
for a primary partner.

423
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,953
Yeah, I got that.

424
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:52,193
So I thought we could, um,
I thought we could start things off

425
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,861
by talking about
charitable giving.

426
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:59,450
- Really?
- Yeah, 'cause I, uh...

427
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:02,681
I just love giving.

428
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:10,001
It's an artform.

429
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,202
So, like,
what's with the numbers?

430
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,802
Isn't it amazing?

431
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:20,380
She painted it when she
got married last month.

432
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,410
It--it represents
indivisibility.

433
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:26,463
- That is not really my thing.
- Okay.

434
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:30,613
How about this one?

435
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,043
It's, uh, it's a blue dot.

436
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,082
- Not me.
- You sure?

437
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:41,431
Yeah, I'm pretty sure about it.

438
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:44,163
You might have a blue dot
somewhere deep inside.

439
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:46,833
Art shows us images of
our internal structures.

440
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:50,173
It helps us see
parts of ourselves.

441
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:54,880
- Nick's lucky to have you.
- Thank you.

442
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:59,551
- I like naked people.
- Excuse me?

443
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,383
Like these over here.

444
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:05,052
You know, I think I could fake it
as someone who paints naked people.

445
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,070
You know,
I could talk the talk.

446
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,521
Okay, let's start by
calling them nudes.

447
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:11,841
All right. Wet.

448
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:13,273
Nudes.

449
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:17,641
Jeremy Babeson loves his nudes.
Let's nude it up!

450
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:27,131
I know this is a...
a lot to deal with.

451
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,102
Were you ever gonna tell me?

452
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,500
You know,
if Nick hadn't forced you to?

453
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:34,373
Dutch and I were planning to tell you,
and then...

454
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:38,053
and then he died, and I thought,
why burden you with...

455
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,582
you let me my spend my
who life hating him.

456
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:46,262
Would it have changed
anything if you'd known?

457
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:51,382
Yeah.

458
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:56,041
Is this why you always
kept me at a distance?

459
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,251
Is this why you always
pushed me away?

460
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:00,273
- I've done no such thing.
- Sure you have.

461
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:03,510
Is this why,
because I could've blown your cover?

462
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,341
I've never pushed you away.

463
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,883
You pushed me right out of this
house and into the seminary.

464
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:09,480
I never fit. I never belonged.

465
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:12,493
Whatever I did,
I did to protect you, not me.

466
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,682
You did it to save yourself!
Just admit it.

467
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:20,672
Well, at least now I know why
I feel like such an alien.

468
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,592
- Oh, Brian.
- How long has Tripp known?

469
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:27,661
- You can still call him dad.
- How long has he known?

470
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,873
- A few weeks.
- How'd he take it?

471
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:35,473
He was angry at me, but not at you.
He loves you just the same.

472
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,442
- Right.
- It's the truth.

473
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:40,881
Well, I've had quite a day.
I've lost two fathers and a son.

474
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:43,442
Please get the
hell away from me.

475
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:02,253
Not a word.

476
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:09,283
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you ask?

477
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,911
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

478
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:17,033
You must have wondered when
you found out about the affair.

479
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:19,522
- I for sure did.
- Yeah.

480
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:22,621
It crossed my mind Karen
might be my sister.

481
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,961
I thought it best to
leave that alone.

482
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,830
Why didn't you tell me?

483
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:32,222
I was...
honor-bound not to tell.

484
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,051
Honor-bound? Honor-bound
to whom?

485
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,162
To Letitia.

486
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:40,842
I submitted to her
belief that the...

487
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:47,360
unraveling of nearly 40 years of ties
would be the undoing of the family.

488
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:49,192
Well, I'm not talking
about the family.

489
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,250
- I'm just talking about me.
- You're a part of the family.

490
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:55,121
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- You're a part of the family to me.

491
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:56,713
Listen, you want to be angry,

492
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:59,113
you be angry at Letitia,
be angry at Dutch.

493
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,983
They're the ones who
spawned this disaster.

494
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,570
They're the ones who left
us to pick up the pieces.

495
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,271
I'm just saying,
I wish you would've told me.

496
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:11,383
I think it would've been
the right thing to do.

497
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,422
Well, you didn't tell me.

498
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:19,031
You knew about the affair way before
I did, and you didn't tell me.

499
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:21,473
- Come on.
- No.

500
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,760
- No one says everything.
- Yeah.

501
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:31,102
No, you're right.
No one says everything.

502
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:32,973
You're right.

503
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:37,243
But I lost my mother...

504
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,441
I lost my father...

505
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,782
I lost my whole childhood
to your family. You owe me!

506
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,473
I owe you?

507
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:48,061
Yes.

508
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:52,331
You owe me the truth.
That's all.

509
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,710
You owe me the truth.

510
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,263
Did you sleep at all?

511
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:26,880
I'm gonna run to the gym.

512
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:32,111
Give Kiki a hug and a kiss for me,
all right?

513
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,963
- Wait. You okay?
- Yeah.

514
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

515
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:58,763
Well, look who's up.

516
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:01,390
- Hi.
- Hey.

517
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:06,412
Listen, I'm going to
Mombasa next weekend.

518
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,841
I'm opening up a
clinic and a school.

519
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,662
And I would love for
you to come with me.

520
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,762
I mean, after all, this...

521
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,992
was supposed to be about
charitable giving, right?

522
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:20,263
Oh, I'm sorry. I never go to
Mozambique on a second date.

523
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,240
- Kenya.
- Oh, yeah, I can.

524
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:26,340
I just don't know that I will.

525
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,153
Oh, look at that. Goodness.

526
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:31,681
And is that you
playing hard to get?

527
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:34,643
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm not sure.

528
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,201
Hey...

529
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:42,030
I don't want you to do to my dad
what you did to Darling Plaza.

530
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:47,070
- Or me, for that matter.
- I won't. I promise.

531
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:50,632
I just want what's best...

532
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,273
for everybody.

533
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:54,971
- Okay?
- Okay.

534
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:59,511
My dad can never find
out about this, okay?

535
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:03,592
Telling Tripp Darling what I'm
about to do to his daughter--

536
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:06,792
believe me--
is the last thing on my mind.

537
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,271
What's the first thing?

538
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,852
- These are amazing.
- Well, thank you.

539
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:17,180
With that one, I really wanted to
transcend the mundane, you know?

540
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:19,950
Make the body really speak.

541
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:23,662
I feel so bad that
I doubted you.

542
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,591
Why you never showed me this?

543
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,511
Well, you see,
that's the life of a solitary artist.

544
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:34,273
It's just me and my paints and...
my other paints.

545
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:36,572
See, I wanted you
to like me for me.

546
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,540
Not for my mad skizills,
you know?

547
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,042
Do you think I could...

548
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:46,131
Oh, yes, you know, sure.
Take whichever one you want.

549
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,820
I mean, like,
they are my children to me, but,

550
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:52,211
like, the ones
that I give away.

551
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:53,971
I was going to say...

552
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,041
I want you to paint one of me.

553
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,000
You know...

554
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:02,662
Naked?

555
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,162
I was thinking...

556
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:06,122
nude.

557
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,590
Let's start tomorrow.

558
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:15,660
You know, today I really want
to get to know my subject,

559
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:18,101
do a little case study.

560
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:30,930
What are you doing here?

561
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,230
I came to wish you
a happy birthday.

562
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:39,061
- Oh, sorry. Me.
- You've been drinking.

563
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:44,093
- Just a little.
- You think that's a good idea?

564
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:46,911
It has not been a
very good birthday.

565
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,191
God, I would do everything to go back
to the beginning and start again.

566
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,181
I would do
everything differently.

567
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:03,651
Only I'd...
I'd fall in love with your mom again.

568
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,222
And I would be your
father forever.

569
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:10,371
Those things...
would not change.

570
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:16,281
Well, I better head up.
Uh, Lisa made dinner.

571
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,770
So happy birthday, dad.
Get yourself a cup of coffee.

572
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,160
Listen, I need to talk to
you about the Darlings.

573
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,210
Oh, why am I not surprised?

574
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,771
There's something
you should know.

575
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,893
I don't care!
I don't care about the Darlings!

576
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:31,091
I don't wanna know
their secrets.

577
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,332
I don't want 'em in my life.
They're not my family.

578
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,800
Except for Kiki and Lisa,
no one is.

579
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:40,550
That's not true because I am,
and they are.

580
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:44,790
And no matter how hard you try
to distance yourself from them,

581
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:47,880
they always will be.

582
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:53,710
And it's my fault,
and I am sorry about that.

583
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,043
I am very sorry.
It is my fault.

584
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:58,730
Dad. You know what,
dad? Let's--

585
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,603
I want you to have
grandpa's watch.

586
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,851
- Here. Take it.
- I don't want it.

587
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:11,362
For all of the, uh,
the birthdays that I forgot.

588
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,051
- I don't want the watch.
- Just-- just-- just take it.

589
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,911
I got a new one. As a gift to me.
All right? On my birthday.

590
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:24,723
- Just... take the damn watch.
- Okay, fine. Thank you.

591
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:38,320
Listen, I'm sorry. I mean it.
I am so, so sorry... for everything.

592
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,451
I got it wrong.

593
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:52,451
That was the last
time you saw him?

594
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,322
Yeah. And I know he was trying
to tell me about Brian.

595
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,570
- You can't be sure.
- Well, I think I can.

596
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:01,490
It was the first time he took a
drink in I don't know how long.

597
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,643
He'd probably just found out from
Letitia that Brian was his kid,

598
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:06,440
and he wanted to tell me.
He wanted to

599
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:08,840
talk to me about it,
and I didn't want to listen.

600
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:11,351
- I just shut him down.
- Nick, you can't beat yourself up.

601
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,491
He was a terrible father.
He was never around.

602
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:17,330
You practically raised yourself.
He forced your mom out of the--

603
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,380
That's all true, Lisa, but...

604
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,011
it was the last time I saw him,
and he needed me.

605
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:27,750
And I turned my back on him.

606
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:29,901
You didn't know.

607
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,092
No, no, I didn't.

608
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:35,363
But I do now.

609
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:43,351
- What are you gonna say to him?
- I have no idea.

610
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:53,943
Look, I know I said I
wouldn't bug you again,

611
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,122
but it's an emergency,
and you weren't picking up.

612
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,750
- What happened?
- Good morning, Jeremy.

613
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:00,022
- Sofia wants me to paint her.
- Since when do you paint?

614
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:01,351
I don't. Keep up, Nick.

615
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:04,790
I told you yesterday this was a bad
idea. Why didn't you listen, Jeremy?

616
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,791
Would somebody please
tell me what's going on?

617
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,753
Shh. Lisa,
I don't need the lecture, okay?

618
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:12,982
You know,
what I need is the artist's phone number

619
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,921
so I can take a picture of Sofia,
he can paint her naked,

620
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:17,562
and then I can
say that I did it.

621
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,311
Okay.

622
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,952
But I'm gonna need a little time,
all right?

623
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,062
You're the wettest.

624
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:30,322
Call you later.

625
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,540
You have got a great
sense of humor.

626
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,820
Of course.

627
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,591
What's this?

628
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:04,693
It belonged to my father--

629
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:06,802
our father.

630
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,473
I don't know.
I thought you might want it.

631
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,141
I don't.

632
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,451
Okay.

633
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:29,573
Nothing's changing,
you know, between you and me.

634
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,450
I see.

635
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,541
I mean, even if we're related,

636
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:39,210
we're not family,
and we never will be.

637
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,222
Oh, wait.

638
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:44,560
What?

639
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,283
What, Brian?

640
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,093
How many more awful things
do you want to say to me?

641
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:56,622
I'm in the same boat you are.
We both got a raw deal.

642
00:38:57,276 --> 00:39:00,911
We're brothers and our father's dead,
so don't let that change anything.

643
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:02,693
Just wrap yourself
up in the comfort of

644
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:05,410
your meanness and your self-pity
and just-- just say it.

645
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,583
Say you hate me.
Get it over with.

646
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:13,951
Fine. I hate you.
Would you sit down, please?

647
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:24,013
Come on. This is what church is for--
dragging the ruined past

648
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:27,681
through the messy present
into the perfect future,

649
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:30,552
and ruining it together.

650
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,313
Come on.
Would you sit down, please?

651
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:46,670
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

652
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:56,011
Okay, so I want
you to eat healthy

653
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:57,923
and do your homework,

654
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:01,350
- and don't forget to e-mail.
- I won't.

655
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:03,371
And I'll come visit
you as soon as I can.

656
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:04,730
Okay.

657
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,911
Our flight leaves in an hour.

658
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,362
Could I just have a minute?

659
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:14,741
I brought you something.

660
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:18,010
An old watch?

661
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:19,311
It's from...

662
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,990
from your grandfather,

663
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:25,742
who got it from his father,

664
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:28,092
who got it from his.

665
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:33,630
It's been passed down
for over a hundred years.

666
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:37,022
And now it's yours.
