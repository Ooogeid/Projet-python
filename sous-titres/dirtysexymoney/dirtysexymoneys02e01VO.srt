1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,800
<I>(Man) ...Has Traffic Backed Up
<I>On The West Side Highway.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,100
<I>The Red-Carpet Event
<I>Was Thought To Be A Fund-Raiser

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
<I>For Patrick Darling's
<I>Senate Campaign,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,100
<I>But Turns Out
<I>It's Just A Birthday Party

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,300
<I>For Their Family Lawyer
<I>Nick George.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,300
<I>And That's Your Weather
<I>And Traffic...

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
(Man) Mister--Mr. George,
How Did You Do It?

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,900
Will Tripp
Be Putting His Powerbehind Patrick's
Senate Campaign?

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
Yes, But To What Extent
Remains A Question.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
Nick, Tell Us,
As The Darling Family Lawyer,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,300
How Were You Able To Broker
This Historic Reconciliation

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
Between Father And Son?

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,800
Well, It Was, Uh,
It Was Quite An Adventure.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Thank You.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,000
(Man) What--What Are Your Plans
For Your Birthday?

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,700
(Letitia)
Here's The Birthday Boy.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Letitia Darling,
You Look Beautiful.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,100
How Are You?

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,700
Mm. Sorry We Didn't Have Time
To Plan Anything Too Fancy.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,900
Oh, Well, I'm Sure
This Will Be Just Fine.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,100
Happy Birthday, Nick.
Thank You.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,900
Have You Seen My Wife?

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,300
Lisa's Not With You?

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No. No.
If You'll Excuse Me.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,400
Patrick, Where's That Wife
Of Yours?

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,900
Ellen's Not Alcoholically
Indisposed <I>Again, Is She?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, Mother.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,100
I'm Sure She's Just Running
A Few Moments Late.

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,000
(Laughs) No.
Brian Used To Be A Minister.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,100
He Was One For Ten Years

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
But He's Working For Me Now.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,100
Got A Little
Too Much Sun, Hmm?

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,700
Yeah, Paddy And I
Went Sailing Yesterday

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Off Our Place
In The Hamptons.

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,800
Hey, Nick.

36
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
I Want You To Meet
An Old Friend Of Mine.

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
Hal Matheson, Nick George.
Nice To Meet You.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Your Dad
Was A Hell Of A Guy.

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,500
He'd Be So Proud Of You
If He Was Still With Us.
Thank You.

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
Hey, Brian.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,000
(Lowered Voice) You Haven't
Seen Lisa, Have You?

42
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,900
No. But If You See
A Waiter...

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Hello, Princess.
Hi, Daddy.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Have You
Got Something For Me?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A Kiss...

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,900
And This.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Thank You.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,300
Hey.

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,800
You Made It.

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
I Did.

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,800
So Are We Okay?

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
We're Okay.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Can The Birthday Boy
Come Up Here, Please?

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,900
You Ready?

55
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,300
(Letitia) Over Her Nick.

56
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,200
Nick...

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,500
What Can I Say?

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,400
Never Before--

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,900
Well, Maybe Once Before,

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
And I'm Thinking
Of Nick's Dad Dutch--

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,900
Has One Man Done So Much
To Hold A Family Together.

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
What's This?

63
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,400
That...

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,300
Is The Key To That--

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
That Boat.

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
It's Yours.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
Happy Birthday.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
Thank You.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,900
What's Going On?

70
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,600
What's Going On?

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
<I>(Man) N.Y.P.D.
<I>Prepare To Be Boarded.

72
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,800
What's Happening, Nick?
<I>Nobody Move.

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,000
What Did You Do, Nick?
<I>Prepare To Be Boarded.

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,800
What The Hell Did You Do?

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,500

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,600
{\a6}48 HOURS EARLIER

77
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,200
Tripp And Letitia Want To
Throw Me A Birthday Party.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
It'll Be Small And Simple,
Just Us And The Darlings.

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,700
The Darlin Don't Do
Small And Simple.

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
Well, Then It'll Be
Large And Complicated,

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
But We Have To Do It.

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,200
Where Are You Going
All Dressed Up?
Gallery Hunting.

83
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
Nick, I Was Really Hoping
It Would Be Just Us

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
For Your Birthday This Year.
All Right. Here's What
We're Gonna Do--

85
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,000
We're Gonna Get A Sitter
For Tonight,

86
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,900
And We're Gonna Have
Our Dinner, Just Us.
Thank You.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,200
But Tomorrow, We're Gonna Go
Yachting Wh The Darlings

88
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,000
Semiformal.
Perfect. I'm Looking
Semi-Forward To It.

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,600
All Right.
I Have Got To Go.

90
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,000
Six Months Of Mending Fences
Between Patrick And Tripp

91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,400
Are About To Finally Pay Off.
Must Be Some Fence.

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, You Said It
Yourself, Lisa.

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
The Darlings Don't Do
Small And Simple.

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
If You Don't Want Me Involved

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
In Your Senate Campaign, Son,
Just Say So.

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Of Course
I Want You Involved, Dad.

97
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,700
But You Don't Know How To Be
Involved Without Creating An Air

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,100
Of Constant Judgment
And Pervasive Meddling.

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,300
Patrick,
We Just Made Headway.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Let Me Guess Where You Get
Those Ideas From. Simon Elder.

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,000
I Get My Ideas
From My Own Mind, Dad.

102
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,200
I Severed Ties With Simon
A Long Time Ago.

103
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,000
Ever Since You Left This
Family's Sphere Of Influence,

104
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,600
Your Life Has Spun
Completely Out Of Control.
Out Of Your Control, Perhaps.

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,800
Listen,
You're A Passionate Family.

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
You're A Family Of
Strong Opinions, So Naturally,

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,900
Sometimes You're Gonna
Get Into Conflict.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
But At The End Of The Day,
You're Still A Family.

109
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,300
You Love Each Other.
You're There For Each Other.
His Campaign Is In A Shambles!

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
We're Still Ahead
In The Polls.
Not For Long

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Keeps Showing Up
At Every Campaign Speech,

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,600
At Every Fund-Raiser
Three Sheets To The Wind.

113
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,800
The Rigors Of Public Life
Have Taken Their Toll, Yes.

114
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,400
Maybe It's Just That She's
Trying To Deaden The Pain

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Of Having Lost You
To Your Vanished Carmelita.

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
That's It, Nick.
We're--We're Done, Here.

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Wait A Second.
Everybody Just Calm Down.

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,700
Now I Have Worked--
We've All Worked--

119
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
The Last Six Months
To Make This Moment Happen.

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Well, This Moment Is Over.
(Tripp)
Oh, Don't Be A Fool, Paddy.

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Because When You
Come Back To Me,

122
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,000
Asking For My Assistance,
Asking For My Acceptance--
You Don't Get It, Dad, Do You?

123
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm Never Going To Ask You
For Anything...

124
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,300
Ever Again.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,900
Lisa. <I>Bella Bambina!

126
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,700
<I>Come Stai?
(Honks Horn)

127
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,500
Jeremy Darling, Stalker.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,900
Is That The Headline You're
Longing To Read On T.M.Z.?

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
What Do You Mean?
I'm Just Tooling Around.

130
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,400
This Just-Showing-Up Thing Was
Cute, Oh, The First 17 Times.

131
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,100
Now It's Just Starting
To Get Weird.
Cut Me Some Slacks. I Can't think about you.

132
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,700
Ever Since That Night
We Kissed.

133
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
That Was Six Months Ago,
And We Didn't Kiss.

134
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
You Kissed Me.
You Kissed Me Back...
A Little.

135
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,500
I Mean, It Wasn't
"The Notebook,"

136
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,700
But I Diinctly Recall
A Kiss Back.
Look, Marriages

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
And When I Let You Kiss Me,
Mine Was In A Bad One.

138
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,400
It's In A Better One Now.
Can We Have Dinner Tonight?

139
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,400
I Am Having Dinner At Etienne
With Nick, My Husband,

140
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,000
And We--You And Me--
Are Not Happening,

141
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
For Dinner Or Anything.

142
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,100
Please Leave Me Alone
And Get A Helmet.

143
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
That Was Amazing.

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm All Discombobulated Now.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Yeah. Mm.

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
Would You Make Me
Some Orange Juice, Please,

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
With A Little Gin In It?
Sure.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Actually,
Hold The Orange Juice.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,500
All Right,
All Right.

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh, Hey, There's, Um,
A Fund-Raiser Tonight

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
At The Brooklyn
Botanical Gardens.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm Giving Them A $10-Million Grant

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
To Do Research In The Rain Forest.

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
You Want To Go?
Sure. Sounds Planty.

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,200
I Just Have To Make
An Appearance At Home First.

156
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,000
Ah, So Tripp Still Has
No Idea His Daughter

157
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
Is Sleeping
With The Enemy, Huh?

158
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
No, He's Completely Clueless
Still.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,100
Well, Don't Be So Su.
People Figure Things Out.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
What--What--
What Are You Doing?

161
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,900
Going Through Your Stuff.

162
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
What's The Story
With This One?

163
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Well...

164
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
When I First Came
To New York...

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,400
I Wasn't Sure If I'd Ever
Amount To Anything...

166
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,300
So I Saw That
In A Shop Window,

167
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,100
And It Reminded Me
Of The Ugly Ckling.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,500
You Know,
It Turned Into A Swan.

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,800
It's Not Worth Much,

170
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,600
But It's A... Reminder
Of A Simpler Time.

171
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,800
That's Sweet.

172
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,300
What?

173
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,400
I Love You.

174
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank You.

175
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
I Think
You're Really Neat, Too.

176
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
Good Afternoon.

177
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Oh, I Hope So, Daisy.

178
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
'Cause The Morning Monumentally Sucked.

179
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Oh, Karen Darling's
Here To See You.
Hi, Nick.

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,700
Karen.
What Can I Do For You?

181
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, For Starters,
Close The Door.

182
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Why?

183
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,600
I Have To Give You
Your Present.

184
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Happy Birthday.

187
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,700
Karen, Put Your Dress  Back On.

188
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,600
I Brought You Some Grappa.

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
No, The Nudity Was Enough.

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,100
Get Dressed.

191
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,300
All Right. Gee.

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Grumpy Gus.

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Would You
At Least Pour Me A Drink?

194
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,400
Thank You.

195
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,100
What The Hell Is Going On?
Why Are You Doing This?

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Simon Told Me Heoved Me.
Mm.

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
You're Still Seeing Simon?
Oh, Yeah, I'm Snooping On Him
For Daddy.

198
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,500
Thks For Keeping Me
In The Loop.
You Know What, Nick?

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
When You Have A Problem,
I'm Always There For You.

200
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,800
Sorry.

201
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,900
What's The Problem, Karen?

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Simon's Falling For Me,
And... (Sighs)

204
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
I Kinda Feel Like,
I Don't Know...

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,200
Bad.

206
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,800
Huh?
Yeah.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,300
So Remove Yourself.

208
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Well, That's What
I'm Trying To Do.
Yeah?

209
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
By Showing Up Here Naked
And Coming On To Me?

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
You're My Exit Ramp,
You Know.
No, I Am Not

211
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
I'm Just Your Old Boyfriend
That You Run To When You Start

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,300
To Have Feelings
For Anyone Else.

213
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah, That's Kinda What I Mean
By "Exit Ramp," Nick.

214
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,300
Listen, If You Want Out
Of This Predicament, Which You

215
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,100
Got Yourself Into, You're Gonna
Have To Do It Yourself.

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,500
I'm Not Gonna
Kiss You Out Of It.

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Well, I Was Hoping
For A Little More Than Aiss.

218
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Well, You're Not
Gonna Get Anything.

219
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,600
So Pull Back, Step Out,
Absent Yourself.

220
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,100
You Have Choices.
(Normal Voice) Wow.

221
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Okay.
Thanks For Understanding, Nick.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, Hey.

223
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,700
Happy Birthday.

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,100
I Hate This.

225
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
We're Almost Done.

226
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Well, We Could Wreck It
And Start Over.

227
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,100
<I>Ate Logo To You, Too.

228
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
What's Your Problem,
Cruella?

229
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,600
That Was
The Brazilian Consulate.

230
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,000
There's Still This
Strangely Unspecified Holdup

231
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
With Our Visas.

232
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,500
Shrimp Doesn't Mind.
Go Rub A Crystal.

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,700
This Was Supposed To Be
A One-Week Visit, Brian.

234
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,500
It's Stretched Out
To Nearly Four.

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,900
And You're Telling Me You Had
Nothing To Do With This.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Why Is It So Important
That You Get Back To Brazil?

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
I Mean, Why Are You Even
Living There At All?

238
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,700
Andrea.

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh, Hi, Tripp.

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Your Stay Continues
To Be Pleasant?

241
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
More Long Than Pleasant.

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
Brian, Could I--

243
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,900
May I Steal You Away?

244
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
I Need You To Talk To Ellen.

245
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,700
Why, You Need Me To Get
Her Recipe

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,100
For Long Island Iced Tea?

247
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,900
No, I Want You
To Counsel Her.

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
Counsel?

249
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Yes.

250
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Patrick May No Longer
Think Of Himself

251
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,100
As An Extension Of This Family,

252
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
But The Rest Of The World Does.

253
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,900
And His Wife...

254
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,700
It's Obvious That Ellen
Is Terribly Unhappy.

255
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
But That Unhappiness Is Turning
Her Into A Public Embarrassment.

256
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
I Left The Church
And Took This Job

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
So I Wouldn't Have To Smile
And Nod And Pretend I Care

258
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
About
Other People's Problems.

259
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,000
When You Sent Me To Munich
To Fire All Those People

260
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,000
And Close Down That Factory,
That Was Fun.

261
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,900
Are You Telling--
Are--Are You Saying No?

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah. I'm Saying No.

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Well, Yes.

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Thank You For Your Frankness.

265
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,800
I Count On It.

266
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,800
It Is The Biggest Dead End
In The World, Mr. Darling.

267
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,100
This Carmelita,

268
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
This So-Called Lady Friend
Of Yours,

269
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
She Doesn't Want To Be Found.

270
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,900
But To Have Her Just...
Out There Somewhere...

271
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,200
Not Knowing...

272
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Just... It Kil Me.

273
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
You Want My Advice,
Mr. Darling?

274
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,300
Go Home To Your Pretty Wife.

275
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
My Pretty Wife, Mr. Cameron,
Is A Belligerent Drunk

276
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
Who Calls Me Names
In Front Of My Children

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
And Takes Swings At Me
In Public,

278
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,200
That Is When She's Not Online

279
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,800
Ordering Single Barrel Bourbon
By The Case.

280
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,700
Keep Looking.

281
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Never Give Up.

282
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,600
Where The Hell Have You Been?

283
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
Good Evening, Foster Brooks.

284
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,600
Answer Me.

285
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
You Were Looking For Her Again,
Weren't You?

286
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,400
"Her." (Scoffs)
I Should Say "It."

287
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,100
I've Been Out Campaigning...

288
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
And Working At My Office,
Ellen.

289
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh, God, You Disgust Me.
You Know That?

290
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,600
I Disgust You, Really?

291
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,600
Yeah. You're A Pervert.

292
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,500
I'd Forbid Our Children
To Be Alone With You

293
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,100
If You Weren't Their Father.

294
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
I Could Still Do It.

295
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,300
What's The Matter
With Me, Pat?

296
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
What Did I Ever Do To You?

297
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Well, You Shot Me
In The Leg, Ellen.

298
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Ring A Bell?

299
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
God.

300
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,300
You Smell Like A Still.

301
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,700
I'm Going To Take A Shower...

302
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,900
And Try To Wash Whatever's Left
Of This Marriage Off My Body.

303
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Try Not To Fall Down.

304
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Hit Me.

305
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Jeremy Darling.

306
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
What If I Told You
I've Been Coming Around Here

307
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Every Night
For The Past Two Weeks

308
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,300
Waiting For You To Show Up?

309
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,300
(Scoffs)
I Wouldn't Believe You.

310
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Oh, Well.

311
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
Do I Know You?

312
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Does Anybody
Really Know Anyone?

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Your Drink, Sir.

314
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
Should I Ask About The Girl?

315
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,800
How'd You Know
About The Girl?

316
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,200
Come On.
There's Always A Girl.

317
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
I, Uh...

318
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
I Overextended Myself...

319
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,800
Heart-Wise.

320
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,600
You Know,
I Put Myself Out There,

321
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
But She Just Doesn't Want Me.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,100
If You Want My Advice,
Don't Take No For An Answer.

323
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,300
Sometimes A Girl
Just Wants A Guy To...

324
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,700
Push.

325
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,400
It Makes Her Feel Pretty.

326
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,400
Thanks For The Drink.

327
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,400
* Mirror, Mirror On The Wall *

328
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,900
* Who's The Greatest Of Them All? *

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
* 'Cause I Came *

330
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
* And I Saw *

331
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
* I Conquered All *

332
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,100
What The Hell Are You Doing?!

333
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,800
You Are Making Me Do This.

334
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,600
Look What You And Your
Perversions Turned Me Into.

335
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,100
Ellen, Stop It!

336
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,700
You Have A Perfectly Good Woman
Who Loves You, But No,

337
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,900
You'd Rather Be
With That Shape-Shifter.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Are You Crazy?
You're Never Gonna Find Her.
You Know That, Don't You?

339
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
You Will Never Find Her, Ever.

340
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh, My God, Ellen.

341
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,400
What--What Did You Do?!

342
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,600
I Had Her Taken Care Of.

343
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,800
Oh, My God.

344
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
Sw-Sweetheart?

345
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,000
Ellen?

346
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Baby?

347
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
(Whispers) Ellen?

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,500
What Have You Done?

349
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,400
(Voice Breaks)
Oh, What Have You Done?

350
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Why Did You Do This?

351
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Hello.

352
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
I Need Help.

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,700
I Need Help.

354
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
(Tripp) I'm Here, Paddy.

355
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,900
What Can I Do?

356
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
I Promise, Lisa,
I'll Be There.

357
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,700
But What You Don't Get Is I'm
Fine With You Saying You Can't.

358
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,000
I Can, I Promise.
Look, I Just Got To Patrick's.

359
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm Gonna See What They Need.

360
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
I'll Be Outta Here
Intes. 1
(Ding)

361
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,700
I Just Want To See You,
You Know?

362
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Lisa, It's My Birthday.
I'll Be There.

363
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
Mr. George.

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Thank You, Clark.

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,900
What The Hell
Happened Here?

366
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Somebody Start Talking.

367
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,900
Now.

368
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh, Finally.

369
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
I Was Just Ab--

370
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Jeremy.

371
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,600
What Are You Doing Here?

372
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,300
I Heard You Were Flying Solo.

373
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,500
I Thought I'd Pull Alongside
And Refuel.

374
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,400
How Did You Know I Was Alone?
Don't Sit Down.

375
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,100
I Called Francois, The MaTRe'd.
He's An Old Coke Connection.

376
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,100
Get Up.
I Was Gonna Have
A Bottle Sent Over

377
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
For The Two Of You
Love Birds,

378
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
But He Said
There Was Only One,

379
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
And That You Were Looking
Kinda Blue.

380
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Voil?

381
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Nick Is Going To Be Here
Any Moment.

382
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,200
Well, When He Arrives,
I Will Totally Flee The Scene.

383
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,800
No.

384
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,300
Five Minutes.

385
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,100
Seven Tops, I Promise.

386
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Possibly Ten
If We're Vibing.

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
I Get That It Was
An Accident, Patrick.

388
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
I Get That You Didn't Lay

389
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,800
But We Still Have To Call
The Police Now.
I Completely Agree.

390
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,300
If Paddy Had Been Able
To Tell Me On The Phone

391
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
What Had Transpired,
I Would've Called Them Myself,

392
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Right Then.

393
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,800
Okay. All Right.
Let's Do It.
Nick.

394
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,300
Tripp, Every Moment We Delay
Increases The Appearance--

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,900
I Know.
That's What I'm Thinking About,

396
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,200
About How This Will Look
And The Toll That It Will Take.

397
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,400
On What, The Election?
No, On The Family,  On The Kids.

398
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,600
You Know What The Press
Is Going To Do With This.

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
What Are You Asking Me
To Do?

400
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm Not Asking You
<I>To Do Anything.

401
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,600
Although You Do Make A Very
Strong Case About The Election.

402
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,600
I Mean, If This Gets Out,
That'll Be Done.
Did You Seriously Expect Me

403
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,600
?? Move Her Body,
Put It Somewhere Else,

404
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Set It On Fire And Make It All
Look Like An Accident?
It's What Dutch Woulda Done.

405
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
And Look What It Got Him,
Pat--A Permanent Address

406
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,000
At The Bottom
Of Long Island Sound.
Nick.

407
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,400
What?
This Isn't Some Case Of Me

408
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
Running Down To City Hall
And Fixing A Parking Ticket.

409
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,100
You Do Realize That?
This Is A Woman's Life.

410
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
And A Man's, And A Family's.

411
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,800
It's Many Things, Nick, Many.

412
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
All Right, Look...

413
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,500
If I Were You,
I'd Call The Police.

414
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Once This Situation
Becomes A Legal Matter,

415
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,900
I Hope You'll Call Me As Your
Family Lawyer To Do My Part.

416
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,900
But Right Now
This Isn't A Legal Situation.

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,800
It's A Moral One,

418
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,700
And As Of Right Now,
It's Not Min It's Yours.

419
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
Good Night.

420
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,900
What Are We Gonna Do?

421
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
Well, There's Only
One Thing We Can Do.

422
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,900
We Must Follow
Nick's Sage Advice.

423
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,500
Hey.

424
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,100
The Car's Waiting For Us
Downstairs.

425
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,100
You're Going Dressed
Like That To The Benefit?

426
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh, Yeah.
No, I'm Not Going.

427
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,200
Okay.

428
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,500
Wild Guess--

429
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,500
I'm Tired. That's It.
That's All.

430
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Karen, Uh, You Know
That It's Okay

431
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,600
If You Don't Want
To Say I Love You.

432
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,500
I Mean, That's What
This Is All About, Right?

433
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
<I>No. Maybe A Little, Yeah.

434
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay.

435
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,900
You Know I Could Have
Any Woman In New York?

436
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,900
But I've Chosen You
Because I Enjoy Being With You,

437
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
So I Said It.

438
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,200
You Don't
Have To Say It Back.

439
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
<I>But While We're At It
And We're Being Honest,

440
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's Just Get It All
Out On The Table.
(Scoffs)

441
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,300
I Know Why You're Seeing Me,
And I Know It's For One Reason

442
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
And One Reason Only,

443
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,800
And That Is To Gather Dirt For Daddy.

444
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Well, I...

445
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,200
Y--'Cause It Started Out
That Way, But It's Not--

446
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,600
Let's Cut To The Chase.

447
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,800
Karen...

448
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,600
I Made My First Fortune
On A Prism,

449
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,900
A Computer Processor

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,700
That Could Read Information
On Waves Of Light.

451
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Now...

452
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,300
In Six Months...

453
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm Gonna Roll This Out.

454
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,300
What Is That?

455
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,300
A Fuel--
Cleaning Burning...

456
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
Nontoxic.

457
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
This Is Going To Do
For Transportation

458
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,900
What My Prism Did
For Information.

459
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,800
It's Gonna Change Everything.

460
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,900
It's Yours. I Want You
To Take This To Your Father.

461
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
Let Him Hand It Over
To His Chemists.

462
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
They--They're Gonna Have Fun
Figuring This Out.

463
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,600
And Your Father Will Make More Money

464
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,900
Than Even He Could Ever Imagine.

465
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
I'll Lose Millions In R&D,

466
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,300
But Hey, Daddy's Happy,
Right?

467
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
Because That's What This
Is All About, Right?

468
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,300
Keeping Daddy Happy?

469
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, My God.

470
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,900
We Really Did Not Need To Drink
That Whole Second Bottle.

471
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,900
I Respectfully Disagree.
A High-End Buzz Becomes You.

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh. Jeremy

473
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,700
Jeremy, You Saved Me From
A Night Full Of Self-Pity.

474
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,800
Thank You.

475
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,800
But This Is Where It Ends.

476
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,000
Meaning?

477
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,600
Meaning Don't Try
And Kiss Me.

478
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
I Wasn't Going To.

479
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,100
Damn It, Jeremy.
Why Do You Do That?
Ow!

480
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Because I Think
You're Beautiful.

481
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,500
Come On, Lise, You Got Stood Up
For A Birthday Dinner

482
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,400
You Were Trying To Throw
For Someone Else.

483
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
You're The Prettiest Girl
In New York,

484
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
And You Know You Want Me
To Kiss You.

485
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,200
Or You Want To Kiss Me,
Whichever.

486
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
I Don't.

487
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I Know You Are Unable
To Believee When I Say It,

488
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,500
But I Really Don't.

489
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Nick!

490
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,400
Nick! Nick, Nick, Wait!

491
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Let's Go.

492
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,200
Nick, Wait! Wait!

493
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Nick!

494
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Maybe My Family And Your Family
Are Just A Bad Combination,   You Know?

495
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,100
You Ever Think Of That?

496
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,300
It's Crossed My Mind.

497
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Your Mom And My Dad,
My Wife And Your Brother...

498
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
I Don't Know,
You And Me...

499
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,100
I Mean, There Are People
All Over The World

500
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,500
Whose Interactions
Are Simple And Clean

501
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,400
And Generally Lead To
Good Things Happening, Right?
Yeah, Well...

502
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,700
(Clinks Glasses)
Here's To Them.

503
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm Sorry.

504
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,800
About What?
Just The Way I Talked To You
When You Showed Up Here Naked...

505
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,600
When I Said
You Have Choices.

506
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,700
'Cause Maybe We Don't,
Really.

507
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,100
You Know, Maybe Lisa Doesn't.
Maybe Jeremy Doesn't.

508
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Maybe You Don't,
And Maybe I Don't.

509
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,000
I Don't Know.
Maybe Patrick Doesn't.

510
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
Patrick?

511
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,200
I Just Mean That Maybe...

512
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,100
It's All Just Chemistry,
You Know?

513
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
You Know, You Just...

514
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,500
You Want What You Want

515
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,400
And You Can't Stop Wanting It.

516
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Maybe It's That Simple.

517
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,200
Yeah, You're Drunk.

518
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,500
And You're Beautiful.

519
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
And You're Thinking About Simon.

520
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,700
I Am.

521
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,200
I Can't Talk Right Now, Lisa.

522
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,300
No, I'm Sorry.

523
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,000
It's Nothing.

524
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,900
Everything's Fine. No.
No, It's Nothing.

525
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,700
Yeah, I Can Be There.

526
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,300
I'll See You Then.

527
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
Who Was That?

528
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,800
That Was Your Father.

529
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
8:00 Tomorrow Morning--
I've Been Summoned.

530
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
What?

531
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,700
You And I Are Not
A Bad Combination, Nick.

532
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,200
It's Just It's--
It's--It's Bad Timing.

533
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,900
Hey, Mom.
Where The Hell Is My Son?

534
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,700
He And Andrea Just Left.

535
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,500
I Begged Her To Stay
And Say Good-Bye,

536
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,700
But She Said That They Could
Still Catch The Flight.
Their Visas Came Through?

537
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,900
Yes. She Said She Got
A Phone Call From The Consulate

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,600
Out Of The Blue.

539
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
Next Thing I Knew, She W--
She Was Grabbing Little Brian

540
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Along With The Luggage
And, Well, To Be Honest,

541
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,500
A Few Of Our Best Towels.
Where's Tripp?

542
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,100
Why? Do You Want Him
To Intervene?

543
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,100
He Already Did.

544
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,800
Excellent, Clark.

545
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,200
Well Done. Thank You.

546
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
You Wanted To See Me?

547
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah. Please.

548
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,800
Do You Know How Many Men Died
Building The Brooklyn Bridge?

549
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
No Idea.

550
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,100
27.

551
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,900
27 For A Bridge That,
Every Day,

552
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,400
More Than A Million People
Go Back And Forth On.

553
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,100
So This Is Your Way Of Saying
That Ellen Wasxpendable?

554
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,700
No, No, No, No.

555
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,400
Just That For Every Venture...

556
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,000
There Are Costs.

557
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,000
People Aren't Costs, Tripp.
They're People.

558
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,200
Ellen Contrived A Life
That Can Be Best Described

559
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,500
As A Venal Venture

560
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,500
In Which, Regrettably,

561
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
She Did Not Have The Strength
To Play Her Role.

562
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,100
In The End, She Resorted
To Drink And...

563
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,800
Finally, Last Night,
Once Again...

564
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,800
To Violence.

565
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,700
She Had None Of The Patience
And Grace

566
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,300
That Make Your Marriage
To Lisa Such A Blessing.

567
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah, I'm A Lucky Man.

568
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,500
All I Asked Her To Do

569
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,300
Was To Help Protect My Son
And His Innocent Children

570
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
From Whawould
Surely Have Become

571
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,000
An Immensely Destructive
Misunderstanding.

572
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,000
What Do You Want
From Me, Tripp?

573
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,500
I Want You To Allow Yourself

574
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
To Become
A Part Of This Family.

575
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,600
Oh, I Know We're Not Perfect.
We're Messy.

576
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
But You Yourself Said

577
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,900
That At The End Of The Day,
We Love Each Other.

578
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,100
Let Yourself
Be A Part Of That.

579
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
You Are A Son To Me.

580
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Let Us Love You.

581
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
Dad.

582
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,300
I'm Gonna Have To Bail
On Nick's Party.

583
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,400
D--Hey, Nick.
Hi, Jeremy.

584
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,200
Did You...

585
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,800
What--I-I Should Go.

586
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,200
Jeremy, Wait, Wait, Wait.
There's One Thing.

587
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,300
I Will Be At My Office...

588
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
If You Need Anything Else
Taken Care Of.

589
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,900
You Ready To Talk?

590
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,100
I'm Ready To Listen.

591
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,700
I Was Drunk, Nick, And...

592
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
You Left Me Waiting Ere
When I Told You--

593
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,900
Are You Seriously Defending
The Idea

594
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,900
That You Were Kissing Jeremy?
Are You Seriously
Not Willing To Forgive Me

595
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,300
When You've Done
The Same Thing With Karen?

596
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,700
Oh, So We're Even Now?
Is That The Moral To The Story?

597
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,700
At The End Of The Day,
That's What This Marriage Is?

598
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
You Tell Me
What This Marriage Is.

599
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Doesn't It Ever Occur To You
That You Are Headed Down

600
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
The Exact Same Path
Your Dad Went Down?

601
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,400
Little By Little,
They're Pulling You In.

602
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,100
I'm Losing You.

603
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,000
You're Losing Me?

604
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,200
You're Kissing Jeremy,
And You're Losing Me?

605
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,100
We're Losing Us.

606
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
You Know It's True.

607
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,700
I Know When You Took This Job

608
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
You Thought You Could Walk
This Razor's Edge All The Time

609
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,400
Between Their Values And Ours,
Between Their Family And Ours,

610
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,800
But Someday, Nick, You're
Gonna Have To Make A Choice.

611
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,000
And When That Day Comes, I...
I Hope You Choose Us.

612
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,900
You're Coming, Right?

613
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,500
Lise, You're Coming To The Party?

614
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm Going For A Walk.
Lisa!

615
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
It's Because I Wouldn't Do It.

616
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,100
I Wouldn't Go To Ellen
And Talk To Her

617
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
And Tell Her To Sack Up
And Play Darling Ball,

618
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,900
So You Disappeared My Family.
I Had Nothing To Do With It.

619
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,200
You're Full Of Crap.
No, I Am Not, Actually.
If I Had Known Events

620
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,800
Were Unfolding That Way
With Theirisa,

621
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,100
I Would Have Jumped
At The Chance To Help.

622
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,200
If You Had Come  Me...

623
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,700
That's What Family Does.

624
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,200
We Help Each Other.

625
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Well, I'm Sorry
I Didn't Talk To Ellen.

626
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,900
If You Had Taken The Time

627
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,200
To Let Her Air
Her Troubled Mind...

628
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,300
Things Might Have Gone
Differently.

629
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
What Are You Talking About?

630
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400
It Would Be A Great Help
To Your Brother Patrick

631
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,000
And To Me, Too,

632
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,300
If You Could Agree That You
Spent The Past Two Days

633
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Sailing With Him
Out At The Hamptons.

634
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Why?

635
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,000
Will You Do It Or Not?

636
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,500
Sure. Why The Hell Not?

637
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,700
And Spend Ten Minutes
In The Tanning Bed

638
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,700
Before We Go To Nick's Party.

639
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Well, You Look A Trifle Pale.

640
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,900
Well, Look Who's Here.

641
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,800
Aren't You Going
To Nick's Party?

642
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm Running Late. He'll Live.

643
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
So...What Did Your Daddy Think

644
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,700
Of My Little Concoction?

645
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,200
I Didn't Give It To Him,
And I'm Not Going To.

646
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,600
You Sure About This?

647
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah.

648
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,800
Look, My Whole Life,

649
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,300
There's Only Been One Man
Who--Who Ever Moved Me,

650
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,100
You Know, Who--

651
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,100
Who Made Me Feel Like
I Was Actually Living.

652
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
Nick.
YEAH.

653
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,300
But Something's Happening
To Me, Simon, With You.

654
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,700
I Don't Know What It Is.
You Know, Maybe I'm Growing Up.

655
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,200
I--Maybe.

656
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,500
Maybe You're Just Amazing.

657
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I Just--I Know That I--
I Don't Want To Let You Go.

658
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,900
What You Do To Me,
It Scares Me A Little, You Know?

659
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,700
But I Like It.

660
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm Gonna Go.

661
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm Gonna Go To... The Shindig.

662
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
Hey.

663
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,400
You'll Come After?

664
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
I Will.

665
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Okay.

666
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Yeah, It's Me.

667
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,400
We've Got Her.

668
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
Let Me Guess

669
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,100
It's A Long Story

670
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
Make It Short

671
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,700
I'm Amistake

672
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I'm Always The Mistake.

673
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,700
Always?

674
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,200
So Since You're Such
A Master Of Mistakes...

675
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,400
Is It A Mistake
You Came Back Here?

676
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
Probably.

677
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,100
Is It A Mistake Letting Me
Stand Next To You?

678
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
It's Kinda Hard
To Say, I Guess.

679
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,100
Would It Be A Mistake

680
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,600
To Take Me To That Limo
You've Got Parked Outside

681
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,300
And...

682
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Only One Way To Find Out.

683
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,100
This Is Definitely Not A Mistake.

684
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,000
No.

685
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,600
<I>(Man) I'm Standing In Front
<I>Of Valhalla,

686
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,200
<I>The Legendary Rural Compound

687
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,600
<I>Of America's First Family,
<I>The Darlings.

688
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,600
Mr. Clark! Mr. Clark. Look.
<I>Valued Aover $30 Million,
<I>The Property, Which Was Once

689
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,800
<I>The Home Of Legendary Gangster
<I>Bugsy Siegel...

690
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,400
The Country House.
<I>Is Expected To Be
<I>Completely Destroyed.

691
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,400
Should We Call Mr. Darling?
<I>Investigators Are Already
<I>On The Scene

692
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,600
<I>Trying To Determine
<I>The Source Of The Blaze.
Nah.

693
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,400
<I>(Woman) Gabe, This Is A Truly
<I>Shocking, Shocking Tragedy.

694
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
Let's Not Ruin The Party.

695
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,100
<I>(Man) The Red-Carpet Event
<I>Was Thought To Be A Fund-Raiser

696
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,100
<I>For Patrick Darling's
<I>Senate Campaign,

697
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
<I>But Turns Out
<I>It's Just A Birthday Party

698
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
<I>For Their Family Lawyer
<I>Nick George.

699
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,900
<I>And That's Your Weather
<I>And Traffic.

700
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,500
(Man) Mister--Mr. George,

701
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,000
How Were You Able To Broker
This Historic Reconciliation

702
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,500
Between Father And Son?

703
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,900
Well, It Was, Uh,
It Was Quite An Adventure.

704
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,500
Here's The Birthday Boy.

705
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,600
Letitia Darling, You Look Beautiful.

706
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,000
How Are You?
Mm.

707
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,100
Happy Birthday, Nick.

708
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Thanks.

709
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,000
Have You Seen My Wife?

710
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,700
Lisa's Not With You?

711
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,600
No, No.
If You'll Excuse Me.

712
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,100
Patrick,
Where's That Wife Of Yours?

713
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm Sure She's Just Running
A Few Moments Late.

714
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
No, Brian
Left The Ministry.

715
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,900
Got A Little Too Much Sun,
Huh?

716
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,700
Yeah, Paddy And I
Went Sailing Yesterday

717
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Off Our Place In The Hamptons.

718
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,500
Hey, Nick.

719
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,400
Want You To Meet
An Old Friend Of Mine.

720
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,400
Hal Matheson, Nick George.

721
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,800
Nice To Meet You.
Your Dad Was A Hell Of A Guy.

722
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,400
He'd Be So Proud Of You
If He Was Still With Us.

723
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,200
THANK YOU.

724
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
(Tripp) Have You
Got Something For Me?

725
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,900
Yes, Daddy. A Kiss...

726
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,100
And This.

727
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,100
You Made It.

728
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,200
I Did.

729
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,800
So Are We Okay?

730
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,600
We're Okay.

731
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Can The Birthday Boy
Come Up Here, Please?

732
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,000
Never Before--

733
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,300
Well, Maybe Once Before,

734
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,100
And I'm Thinking
Of Nick's Dad Dutch--

735
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,100
Has One Man Done So Much

736
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
To Hold A Family Together.

737
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,100
Happy Birthday.

738
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,000
What's This?

739
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,700
That...

740
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,500
Is The Key To That--

741
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,100
That Boat.

742
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,100
Thank You.

743
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,200
What's Going On?
I Don't Know.

744
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,900
<I>(Man) N.Y.P.D.
<I>Prepare To Be Boarded.

745
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,300
What's Happening, Nick?
I Have No Idea.

746
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,800
What Did You Do, Nick?
What The Hell Did You Do?

747
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,500
<I>Nobody Move.
<I>Prepare To Be Boarded.

748
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,100
(Man) Stand Back, Please.
You Ratted Me Out?

749
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,600
What Did You Do, Nick?
I Didn't Do Anything.

750
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,700
(Man) Excuse Me. Step Back.
Step Back, Plee.

751
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,300
Sorry To Have To Do This,
Mr. Attorney General.

752
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,100
I Got My Orders.
Detective Larrabee,
What Seems To Be The Problem?

753
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,800
Murder, Nick,
In The First Degree.
But--

754
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,400
Here's An Arrest Warrant.

755
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,200

What?

757
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
God, This Is Outrageous.
You Have Theight
To Remain Silent.

758
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,200
Anything You Say Can
And Will Be Used Against You

759
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
In A Court Of Law.
Patrick.

760
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,400
Nick.
Nick.

761
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
You Have The Right To Have
An Attorney Present...
Lp. Nick, Help.

762
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,000
(Tripp) Patrick.
(Larrabee) If You Cannot Afford
An Attorney,

763
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,100
One Will Be Appointed For You.

764
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,300
(Tripp) I'm Here, Darling.
I'm Here, Dear.
Mrs. Darling...

765
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,000
Do You Understand These Rights
As I Have Spoken Them To You?

766
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,900
