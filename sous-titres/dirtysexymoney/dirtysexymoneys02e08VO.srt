1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,810
Garbage.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,710
Garbage.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,830
Garbage.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,340
- karen?
- Oh, hey.Speak of the devil.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,120
Uh, y-your mother said you were in here.I didn't realize you were--

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,720
please, nick.
You've seen me in less.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,300
Remember that, yeah, back when you gave a damn?

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,150
- What are you doing?
- Purging.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,340
I'm getting rid of everything simon elder ever gave me or liked.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,240
I do it after every marriage.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,620
Although I don't suppose you could consider this a marriage seeing

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,330
that it didn't actually "happen." Thank you for that.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,870
Look, by working together with your father to stop that wedding--

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,940
I know.You were just looking out for me.Don't worry, nick.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,750
Your medal for heroism is on its way.

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,710
Look, I just need you to sign these.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,660
They'll reinstate your darling stock now that you're not marrying simon anymore.

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,170
oh, that's right!
I get my stock back.

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,850
Gee, that makes everything better.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,390
Leave it there and go away.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,730
okay, maybe I didn't handle the situation exactly perfectly--

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,770
yeah, maybe.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,900
But whatever I did, I did for you because I care about you.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,770
That's the truth.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Could you please go now?

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm just saying, that's the truth.

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,550
Would you please go, nick?

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,790
nick, I have some troubling news

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,350
ellen's brother has reared his head again.

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,390
He's not living up to his end of our bargain.

31
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,710
Uh, chase is looking for improvements on his deal?

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,510
No.Brian got a call from the manager at darling avionics.

33
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,810
Apparently, chase is spreading his theory about how his sister met her death.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,360
He's saying that patrick killed ellen?

35
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,220
Well, that amongst other things.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,700
That's alarming,

37
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,860
since patrick's inauguration is less than 48 hours away.

38
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,080
Precisely.So I'm gonna need you to go out to bethpage

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,380
and have a chat with him, put a lid on this.

40
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,740
Well, I'm pretty much booked, tripp.

41
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,320
You asked me to finish the partnership agreement between you and simon by the end of the day.

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,730
- Can't brian go out there--
- no.Brian, no.

43
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,250
No, andrea's in the hospital.

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,030
He's got his son to take care of.
His plate's full.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,700
Right.

46
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,860
And really, it's best for me if you do it.

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,740
I mean, you're the only one of us that chase trusts.

48
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,290
- I an, you know that.
- True.

49
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,270
It's best this way.

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,260
- All right.
- Let's get outta here.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,540
I have to go and meet patrick and his ever charming chief of staff.

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,340
I strongly disagree.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,420
Patrick should be sworn in on the floor of the senate like everybody else.

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,860
- This will read as elitist.
- Elitist?

55
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,120
Really?To be sworn in at federal hall is elitist?

56
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,270
That's where george washington was inaugurated, for heaven sake.

57
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,400
If you have new york asses to kiss, we'll fly them to D.C.

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,620
This is not about donors.

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
It's about tradition.

60
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,120
Patrick...

61
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,880
a little input, a smidge?

62
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,560
- Whatever you two think.
- Patrick, please.

63
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,960
Well, I was just thinking what all

64
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,010
this would mean to me if things had gone differely.

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,430
I am not gonna have another conversation about carmelita.

66
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,890
I know, but if--if she were just here, it would--

67
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,290
well, she's not.She won't be.

68
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,430
It's over.
You need to move on.

69
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't get it.

70
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,720
She is the main reason I ran for the senate.

71
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,810
And the fact that she scurried upstate and stayed there

72
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,550
is the reason you won.

73
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,250
Grow a pair.

74
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,090
I'm afraid i find myself compelled to agree with your chief of staff, patrick.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,320
carmelita is a lovely individual, but she woulbenot an asset to this situation.

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
{a6}Simon Elder: Meet me. Now.

77
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,750
Well, I should go.

78
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,500
I have some work that i actually have to get done.

79
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,850
Thank you for backing me.

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,240
Well, on those rare occasions when I think you are correct, ms. Lyons,

81
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,940
you will always find me at your side.

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,350
How very...
patronizing.

83
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,830
do you have any idea what it would mean

84
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,100
if I could manufacture a clean, nontoxic biofuel

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,010
right here on american soil?

86
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,040
You'd win a big stuffed animal?

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,440
I am that close.

88
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,280
Or I was until E.P.A.
Approval died in closed committee.

89
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,500
What do you want me to do about it?

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,970
I want you to find out what happened.

91
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,110
More precisely, who killed it.

92
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,180
I want the minutes from that meeting.

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,620
You're asking me to steal a sealed file from a U.S. Senator.

94
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,570
Sweetheart, you're not working in patrick's office for the government pension.

95
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,890
Get me the damn file...

96
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,030
and get it fast.

97
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,010
- hey.
- Hey.

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,460
Where's my little guy?

99
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,530
He's at the zoo with his grandma.

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,460
Mm.I want to see him.

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, you'll see him when you come home.

102
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,640
Brian...

103
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,990
I'm not coming home.

104
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,280
Yeah, you are.

105
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,100
These experimental wonder drugs are gonna kick in really soo and then--

106
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,680
and you're gonna be home before y-you know it.

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,610
No...

108
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,540
I won'T.

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,540
And I need you to say it.

110
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,630
What?

111
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,620
Look at me and say it.

112
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,550
get so sad

113
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,520
tell me that I'm going to die.

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,060
Don't be stupid.
You're not.

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,720
Brian...

116
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,070
I need to know that you can say it,

117
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,320
that you can be strong for our son.

118
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,290
So just say it.

119
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,120
please.

120
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,900
Yore gonna die.

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,690
And you know that that's true, right?

122
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,430
yes.

123
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,740
thank you, baby.

124
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,540
you know what else you can believe in?

125
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,150
I love you.

126
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,370
I love you, too.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,750
{a6}biodiesel Conference
CONFIDENTIAL

128
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,480
buon giorno.

129
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,460
Jeremy, what the hell?

130
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,440
Free-trade americano for the senator,

131
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,760
one nonfat macchiato for the lady.

132
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,270
What are you doing here?

133
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,620
This is one of those rhetorical questns, isn't it?

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,820
I asked you to go to bloomberg's office and get those permits for the inauguration.

135
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,500
You said get them by lunch.

136
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,530
I said I need them by lunch.

137
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,150
No, you said, "get them by"--

138
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,150
god!What is it with you?

139
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,810
You try to undercut me at every turn.

140
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,980
And you never miss a chance to treat me like the hired help.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,590
You are an office assistant.

142
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,470
You are the hired help!

143
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,900
This is my brother's office.
You're not my boss!

144
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,180
what the hell is going on in here?

145
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,390
I can hear you both down the hall.

146
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,260
He is a dimwit.

147
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,850
She is a dungeon mistress...

148
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,590
what?

149
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,200
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

150
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,340
We need to tone it down a notch, okay?

151
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,410
Both of you.

152
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,560
Obviously you both still have feelings for each other.

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,480
- Please.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,850
And you're gonna need to deal with it.

155
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,920
He is my brother.

156
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,590
Ha.

157
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,010
She is my chief of staff.

158
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Work it out.

159
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,710
Otherwise, you'll need to find employment elsewhere.

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,100
Both of you.

161
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,560
No, no.
That'S...

162
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,870
your...

163
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,640
nick george--

164
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,040
the darlings' favorite problem solver.

165
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,580
I was wondering how long it'd take for you to show up.

166
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,540
How are you, chase?

167
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,610
I stopped by darling avionics,

168
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,410
and the plant manager told me you walked off the job yesterday.

169
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,120
That's right.

170
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,570
Do you mind if I ask you why?

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,070
What do you care?

172
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,420
Wife left me, took the kids.

173
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,220
Hey, chase, just so you know,

174
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
it was out of compassion not guilt that we were trying to help you.

175
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
Help me?

176
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,870
You offered to buy my self-respect, and I sold it.

177
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,170
I took money to look the other way about my own sister's murder.

178
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,660
It a minute.
Ellen was not murdered.

179
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

180
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,380
If you say so.

181
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,810
Look, I am--I am frustrated for you, and I--

182
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,710
but I'm at a loss here.

183
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,710
Tell me, what can I do?

184
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,020
Nothing.

185
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I've taken everything I'm gonna take from you and the darlings.

186
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,150
Well, what is it you want, chase, really?

187
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,450
The one thing you can't give me.

188
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,290
Well, what's that?

189
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,550
Justice.

193
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,260
we're full today.

194
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh, hey, carmelita.

195
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,060
- Hi.
- Your 1:00 is here.

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,960
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,800
Okay.
3:00.

198
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,530
Carmelita rainer?

199
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,010
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

200
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,510
Chase alexander.

201
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,210
I'm ellen darling's brother.

202
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,940
Oh.

203
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,220
Oh, what can I do for you?

204
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,770
I'm going public with what I know about ellen's death.

205
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,100
And I thought you might like to join me,

206
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,250
seeing as you've been left out in the cold by those sons of bitches, too.

207
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,210
I know about you and patrick

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,700
and I can tell by that look on your face you know what I'm talking about.

209
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,340
- Actually, I don'T.
- That's a bunch of crap.

210
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,680
Now you know patrick killed my sister, and you're the reason he did it.

211
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
you know what, sweetie?

212
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,330
Why don't we just take a minute and talk this over, okay?

213
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,400
- I'll give you a cut.
- I am not here for a haircut.

214
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,910
Look, I'll tell you what I know,

215
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,820
you tell me what you know while I cut your hair, okay?

216
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,430
Okay.

217
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,460
Okay.

218
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,240
This is insane and a complete waste of my time.

219
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Why won't you just admpatr ick's right?

220
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,750
About what?

221
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,570
That you still have feelings for me.

222
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,670
No.
Not.Negatory.

223
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,580
Come on.
Admit it.

224
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,220
You can't look me in the eye.

225
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,480
You can't even be ane with me.

226
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,620
I can so.

227
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,370
Not without losing your mind,

228
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,250
'cause whenever you're around me,

229
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,130
all you can think about is my hands underneath you,

230
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,860
my lips on your neck...

231
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,260
that thing I used to do.

232
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,390
Oh, that is such a low blow, bringing up the thing.

233
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm a desperate man.

234
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,640
Look, you're always complaining that I'm still half boy.

235
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,070
But you're the one who won't work it out here, not me.

236
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,160
God, can't you see I'm crazy about you?

237
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,930
You're such a little bitch.

238
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,010
okay.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,860
I admit it.

240
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,420
Admit what?

241
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,150
I still have feelings for you.

242
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,750
There.Doesn't that feel good?

243
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,560
No, because it's never gonna happen.

244
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,710
- Why?
- It's complicated.

245
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,230
Things with you are always complicated.

246
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,590
- What is so incredibly--
- jeremy, just trust me.

247
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,730
It's better for everyone that we're through.

248
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,720
hi.I don't have an appointment,

249
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,940
but it's very important that I see the senator.

250
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,990
- Um...
- hi.

251
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,090
Can I help you?

252
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm heresee the senator.I'm--

253
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,670
I know exactly who you are.

254
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,810
He's not gonna be back for hours.

255
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,730
Listen, if you know what's good for you,

256
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,830
you'll stay out of his life.

257
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,860
Carmelita.

258
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,080
I need to see you...

259
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,930
alone.

260
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,960
Of course.
Come right in.

261
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,960
Oh, dear brian.

262
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,600
What a pleasant surprise.

263
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,080
How are you?

264
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,630
How is your lovely bride doing?

265
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,620
Well, she has about ten white blood cells and can't eat solid food, but

266
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,200
- aside from that, she's great.
- Oh, damn.

267
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,530
You should be with her, son.

268
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm fine.

269
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,080
I can mind the store without you.

270
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,850
Well, obviously.

271
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,970
I turn my back for one minute,

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
and simon elder's your new partner?

273
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,960
what about me?

274
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,260
- This is a matter of--
- you told me good things were ahead.

275
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,810
- And they are.
- Yeah?

276
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,980
Because the last time I checked,

277
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,500
your half of the company and simon's half

278
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,570
and little st.Nick waiting in the wings leaves bupkes r me.

279
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,380
Brian, this is not the time for you to worry about business.

280
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,110
Well, I think it is,

281
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,690
because if there's one thing that this whole thing with andrea has taught me about time,

282
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,220
it's that there's not enough of it.

283
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,810
And this little trip down the corporate ladder is not what I signed up for.

284
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,500
I quit.

285
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,790
he seemed very dangerous.

286
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,710
I hope I didn't do e wrong thing coming here.

287
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,360
No, it was exactly right.

288
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,970
I mean, he kept going on and on, completely irrational.

289
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,020
And then he said he was coming into the city.

290
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,710
Carmelita, you were right to come.

291
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,530
We'll take care of it.

292
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,500
- Are you sure?
- Completely.

293
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,600
Okay.

294
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,650
I should go.

295
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,570
Your chief of staff wasn't too pleased to see me.

296
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,320
I think that she's just worried about...

297
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,480
you know, perception.

298
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,390
It's her job.

299
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,920
Okay.

300
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm gonna go.

301
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,340
No, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

302
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,870
She's worried.

303
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm not.

304
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,720
Now that I've seen you,

305
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,190
I'm not about to let you just turn around and walk out of here.

306
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,120
Let's have lunch tomorrow...

307
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,990
somewhere we can talk.

308
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,130
Please.

309
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,940
just say you will.

310
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,480
chase alexander is obviously delusional.

311
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,940
I think there's only one option.

312
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,090
- hich is?
- A 927.

313
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,870
A psychiatric hold?

314
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,070
We just need a doctor to sign off.

315
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,630
Well, I mean, we can arrange for that, yes?

316
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,890
it seems like the right thing.

317
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,670
Wait a second.Tripp, do you really want to have this guy locked up?

318
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,310
I mean, all he's done is say he's planning on

319
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,640
going public with a story we all know is mostly true.

320
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,360
He's been ranting, and--and this way,

321
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,670
he will have professional medical help.

322
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,780
It's for his own good, nick.

323
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,030
Well, what happens for his own good when the 72-hour psychiatric hold is up?

324
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, if he keeps shooting his mouth off, we'll have him committed.

325
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,230
- No.
- Well, we better do something, nick,

326
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,800
because the way carmelita made it sound--

327
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,640
- let me--let me talk to him.
- you already did.

328
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,490
well, give me one last chance to give him one last chance, please.

329
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,480
Wh-what does this guy mean to you that you're so interested in saving him, nick?

330
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,200
He's a human being.

331
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,240
- Just let me talk to him.
- Sure.

332
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,890
Um, absolutely.
Uh, just...

333
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,100
sit down with him, have a chat.

334
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,740
But please make sure that he understands that no good can come from this.

335
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,420
Thank you.

336
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,260
Hey.

337
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,090
This is getting to be a habit.

338
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,490
Well, I half expected you not to show up.

339
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,910
I almost didn'T.

340
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,900
And don't even think about offering me more money,

341
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,320
because I know where that's gonna get me--

342
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,450
- nowhere.
- Okay.

343
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,360
Listen, chase, I am the first person to admit that having the darlings in your life can be...

344
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,760
destructive.

345
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,570
They've made me doubt myself.
They've made me...

346
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,160
wonder about my motives.

347
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,680
But the bottom line here is that patrick didn't kill your sister.He didn't

348
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,610
I wish I could believe that.

349
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,670
All right.Well, just think about how all this is gonna end.

350
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,790
You go through wh this, you--you seek your revenge...

351
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,800
you won't win.There--there-- there's nothing to be won.

352
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,370
Nobody knows that better than me.

353
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,150
But you can get your wife back and you can get your kids back.

354
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,690
Chase, I am sorry about ellen,

355
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,760
but there is still a way out of this for you.

356
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,750
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

357
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,500
You know, maybe you're right.

358
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,340
I mean, look at me.

359
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,980
Look at what I've become.

360
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,200
what the hell's going on?

361
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,590
I don't know.

362
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,800
- You set me up?
- That's him.

363
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,580
No.No, I did not set you up.

364
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,810
- I trusted you, and you set me up?
- Chase alexander?

365
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,770
What?
What's going on?

366
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
You're gonna have to come with us.

367
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,990
We have a court order to hold you for psychiatric detention.

368
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,030
Wait a minute.Officer, there has been some kind of mistake here.

369
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,190
You sick bastard.

370
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,320
You lure me here, you tell me everything's gonna be okay...

371
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,560
- chase--
- and then you have them show up?

372
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,520
- Officer, there has been a mistake.
- You're worse than the darlings.

373
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,790
Nice.
A little more passion.

374
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,150
Uncuff him.
I'm serious.Now!

375
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,000
It's only for 72 hours, mr. George.

376
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,260
I trusted you.
I believed you.

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,370
You are the worst one of 'em all.

378
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,550
You are worst son of a bitch of 'em all!

379
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,510
yeah, yeah.

380
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
What the hell were you thinking?

381
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,540
what the hell are you talking about?

382
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,400
We agreed that I would go talk to chase,

383
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,920
I would protect him-- all of us--

384
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,740
from this situation escalating out of control,

385
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,090
and you sent in the cops?!

386
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,240
Sent in the cops?
Me?

387
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,190
If anybody sent in the cops, it would've been nola.

388
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,780
Oh, nola, my ass.

389
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,640
There is nothing that goes on in this family that you don't know about,

390
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,690
control or otherwise quietly endorse.

391
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,540
God, tripp, don't you see that by going behind my back,

392
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,940
by using force, you forfeited the one real hold we had on him, his trust in me?

393
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,770
I did not go behind your back.

394
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,650
I would never betray you like that, nick.

395
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,520
No, you would betray me like this.

396
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,170
Nick, listen, whatever's happened,

397
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,210
I assure you, I had nothing to do witht.

398
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,970
oh, my yearling.
How are you?

399
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,060
Double grande depresso, mom.

400
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,660
Double grande.

401
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,200
yes.

402
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,270
Employment can be wilting.

403
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,130
It's not the job, it's the boss.

404
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,080
Who, nola?
Yeah.

405
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,860
She's a definite wilter.

406
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,730
Mm.
What happened?

407
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
She finally fessed up.

408
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,290
She has feelings for me.

409
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,960
Of course she does.
You're adorable.

410
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,830
But she says it's too complicated.

411
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,620
Oh.

412
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,350
- What?
- Mm.

413
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,650
- She's seeing someone else.
- You think?

414
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,830
It does seem likely.

415
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,250
- You want my advice?
- What?

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,110
Let her go.
Love sucks.

417
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,430
Hey, I was in love with nick r close to,

418
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,860
what was it, forever, and what did he do?

419
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,270
He booby-trapped the one chance at happiness I had left.

420
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,860
You're wrong, dear.

421
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,610
Thanks to nick, you have a chance at happiness.

422
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,270
Simon elder is the culprit here.

423
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,530
nick has always had your best interests at heart.

424
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,310
Take my advice.

425
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,280
Put your...

426
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,200
resentments aside, and go see him, soon.

427
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,440
As for you, dear, find out who nola is seeing

428
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,710
and do whatever it takes to remove him.

429
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,850
You'll get your little wilter back pronto.

430
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,830
- Mom.
- What?

431
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,710
This poor boy's in love.

432
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

433
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,140
I never expected to see this place again.

434
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,150
They, uh, always ask about you.

435
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,100
Jorge made sure we got our private room.

436
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,900
P-please...
come and sit down.

437
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,020
Thanks a-again...

438
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,000
- for the warning.
- Are you kidding?

439
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,190
I could never let anything happen to you.

440
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,450
What's this?

441
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,840
A pass to my inauguration.

442
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,650
I want you there.

443
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,380
Paddy...

444
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,500
you know what they're gonna say--

445
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,270
your father, your chief of staff.

446
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,280
I don't care.
I want you there.

447
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,810
And after you're in and that gets you past security and my father and my chief of staff,

448
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,370
I am going to pick you out of therowd by name and announce you to the world.

449
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,370
Patrick...

450
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,830
tomorrow'S...

451
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,530
not just going to be the start of my first term of office.

452
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,380
It's going to be the start of a new life...

453
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,310
for both of us.

454
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,400
Brian.

455
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,660
Bishop bascombe.

456
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,130
Your grace.

457
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,220
Well, isn't this a coincidence?

458
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,080
Before I began my hospital rounds today, I was praying,

459
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,930
and suddenly, the lord put you in my mind.

460
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,290
It was as if you were standing right there in front of me.

461
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,170
And now here I am again...

462
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,140
walking away.

463
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,490
Well, brian, the six months is up, isn't it?

464
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,250
Your penitential retreat?

465
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,390
Yeah.

466
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,030
- Time flies.
- And?

467
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,610
Well, have you thought about coming back?

468
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,810
To the church?

469
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,270
Not so much.

470
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,270
Brian...

471
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,800
it could be--

472
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,250
it could very well be-- that

473
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,820
god is calling you back.

474
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,280
He's not.

475
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,100
Trust me.

476
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,390
How do you know?

477
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,130
Because I never called him.

478
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,760
But since you seem to have a direct line,

479
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,640
will you give him a message for me?

480
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,930
Anything.

481
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,950
The fact that we're all dragged here

482
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,010
through time and space

483
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,270
and then made to suffer and die...

484
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,650
really sucks.

485
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,200
- hello.
- Yeah.

486
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,290
I'm on my way back right now.

487
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,880
Um, just have jeremy leave the permits on my desk.

488
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,110
Um, what do you mean he went home?

489
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,430
W-well, can you just call him and...

490
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,340
just forget it.
I-I--forget it.

491
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,260
I'll deal with it in the morning.

492
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,040
yeah.
Bye.

493
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,970
simon?

494
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,630
Simon elder?

495
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,520
Are those permits on my desk?

496
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,070
- You're seeing simon elder?
- What?No.

497
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,550
Don't lie to me, nola.
I follow you.

498
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,660
- I watched you get into his car.
- You followed me?

499
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,370
My god, this is harassment.

500
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,170
Are you in love with him?

501
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,300
You are, aren't you?

502
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,620
I don't owe you an explanation.

503
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,980
No, you don't,

504
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,940
but you're gonna owe my senatorial sibling one,

505
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,160
right after I tell him about how you're spending your evenings

506
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,440
bouncing on the corinthian leather with simon elder

507
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,620
in the backseat of his german love machine.

508
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,010
Jeremy, listen--

509
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,080
get away from me, trampolina!

510
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,090
I mean, what do you like about that guy, the jewelry?

511
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,280
- I can wear jewelry.
- I'm not sleeping with simon.

512
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,460
You're not?

513
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,880
- No.
- Then what is going on?

514
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,000
Fine, I'll ask him.

515
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,470
I meet with him from time to time.

516
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,420
Okay?

517
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,090
He helped my father out once.

518
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,270
Yeah?

519
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,610
And?

520
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,060
I can'T.

521
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
Fine.

522
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,920
It's your choice.

523
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,110
He's got control of my brother.
He won't tell me where he is.

524
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,560
Brother?

525
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,560
I can't tell you ything else.

526
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,560
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

527
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,580
- No.
- Yeah.

528
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,900
I'm gonna open up a can of whoop-ass on this freak.

529
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,590
Jeremy, no, you can't--

530
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,190
you can't do anything.If you do anything at all

531
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,630
that makes it apparent that you know about this,

532
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,720
my brother could be in serious danger.

533
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,970
Don't worry.

534
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,130
I'm gonna take care of it.

535
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,600
this is you...

536
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,010
being you.

537
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,350
I get that.

538
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,260
This is what you do.

539
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,580
You bring us into this world...

540
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,750
you make it incredibly hard to feel at home here,

541
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,740
and then right when we finally realize that this is where we want to be,

542
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,530
you force us out--

543
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,450
all part of your wonderful, unknowable plan.

544
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,220
Look...

545
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,710
she's dying.

546
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,940
She thinks she's ready.

547
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,960
But here's the thing...

548
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,630
I'm not...

549
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,630
and neither is our kid.

550
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,680
You want me to pray?
I'll pray.

551
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,040
Please don't take her.

552
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,920
She's got a few more...

553
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,860
paper chains to make

554
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,550
for a few more christmas trees...

555
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,750
a few more birthday parties to arrange...

556
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,270
cupcakes to ice for a few more years.

557
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,830
At least give us "k" through 12.

558
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,310
I mean...
it was just getting good.

559
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,080
You want me back?

560
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,270
Then you step up

561
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,490
and show me what you can do for me.

562
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,770
And if you do, I'll do whatever you want.

563
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,780
nick, we need to talk.

564
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,370
It sounds serious.
It is.

565
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,940
See, there comes a time in every man's life

566
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,490
when he needs to step up

567
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,270
and take matters into his own hands.

568
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,040
That time for me is right now.

569
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,030
Okay.
Shoot.

570
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,960
I need you to do something.

571
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,600
Uh, well, what's that?

572
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,840
Nola lyons.

573
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,970
She's in trouble.

574
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,730
trouble?

575
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,020
Hey, simon.

576
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,370
What kind of trouble?

577
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,380
You know what?
It'll sit.

578
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,880
Uh, w-wait, jeremy.You didn't even tell me what the--

579
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,670
no.No, no, no.It's--it's cool.

580
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,730
- You sure?
- It's supercool.

581
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,100
I'll see y'all around the quad.

582
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,400
- Nick.
- Simon.

583
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,370
What was that all about?

584
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,360
I have no idea.

585
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,550
well...

586
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,210
the signed partnership agreement

587
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,520
between me and tripp.

588
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,410
You are stuck with me.

589
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,660
it's official.

590
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,340
I've got chase alexander here.
Bringing him over from county.

591
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,380
Somebody needs to sign for the transfer.

592
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,880
I'll go get the doctor.
We weren't expecting you.

593
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,250
Okay, sunshine.
Time to check out your room.

594
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,790
All right.
That's good.

595
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,130
Now I want you all to take meticulous notes.

596
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,380
Thisatient's value as a research subject can't be overstated.

597
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,940
What's going on here?

598
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,610
- Brian.
- Get away from her.

599
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,230
Hey.

600
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,270
- Hey, what are you doing?
- She's not a science experiment, leeches!

601
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,170
- Mr. Darling, this is a teaching--
- and you're fired!

602
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,320
Dr. Feelgood.
Stop it, brian.Stop it.

603
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,710
As I was saying, this is a teaching hospital.

604
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,020
When a case takes an unexpected turn, we invite the residents--

605
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,920
wh-what unexpected turn?

606
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,000
Andrea's white count is up,

607
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,640
marginally, anher ca-125's undetectable.

608
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,950
I don't understand.

609
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,670
I'm getting better.

610
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,590
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves,

611
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,000
but there definitely appears to be some improvement.

612
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,980
The drug seems to be working,

613
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,580
and for the first time since we began treatment,

614
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,780
there's reason to hope.

615
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,770
Hope, brian.

616
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,550
Nick?

617
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,450
anyone home?

618
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,180
Nick?

619
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,400
oh.

620
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,600
Who are you?

621
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,520
You don't remember?

622
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,400
oh, god.
Did we, um...

623
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,630
you know?

624
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,320
I'm ellen's brother chase.

625
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,370
Oh!Right.
Ellen's brother.

626
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,590
Oh.

627
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm so sorry about her.

628
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,960
So what are you doing here?

629
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm looking for nick.

630
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,390
You know, we had a tiff, things were said.

631
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,390
- Oh, me, too.
- Oh.

632
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,640
You know, I'm gonna go.

633
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,710
I'm gonna go, but, um, could you--

634
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,030
when you see him, could you do me a favor and let him know that I--

635
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,810
have a gun-- you have a gun.
You have a gun.

636
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,820
I--you know what?It's cool.I'm just gonna take a--

637
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,800
you're not going anywhere.

638
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,630
Okay.

639
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,590
Okay.
I'll call you back.

640
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,170
You wanted to see me?

641
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
Yeah, I wanted to, uh,

642
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,820
thank you for the senate file you got for me.

643
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,510
Once patrick gets to D.C.,

644
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,840
It's gonna be very helpful.

645
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,150
You're welcome.
Is that it?

646
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,940
No.

647
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,860
No, I wanted to...

648
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,730
show you this.

649
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,500
What is it?

650
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,630
It's your brother's report card.

651
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,800
He's quite a capable learner.

652
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,870
Although his teachers, as you'll see,

653
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,140
say he's having some issues with self-control.

654
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,390
- When am I gonna be able to t--
- talk to him again?

655
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah, I been thinking that it's, uh, about time to set up a chat.

656
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,950
But given your own problem with self-control,

657
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,430
I don't think you'd be such a good influence.

658
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,500
I don't know what you're talking--

659
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,790
if you can't keep your mouth shut about our little arrangement,

660
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,790
if you think you're gonna run to your boyfriend

661
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,050
and get him to help save you,

662
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,240
then clearly you don't know how to restrain yourself.Clearly...

663
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,270
you don't understand what the stakes are.

664
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,750
Am I wrong?

665
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,750
No.

666
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,540
Good.

667
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,020
Thank you for the respect of an honest answer.

668
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,800
He is a smart kid.

669
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,050
I know you're proud of him.

670
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm done.

671
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,120
Money doesn't make you happy.
You know that, right?

672
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,070
Oh, boy howdy.

673
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,460
I had to lose my wife

674
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,000
and sell my soul to nick george to learn that lesson.

675
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,710
Ruined my life, taking money from that jackass.

676
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,650
Sorry?

677
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,010
Yeah, you should be--

678
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,630
all you darlings--

679
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,640
for perpetuating the lie that money fixes everything.

680
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,970
You got all of us

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,820
everywhere chasing something that'll only make us miserable in the end.

682
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,430
And nick...

683
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,000
he's the worst.

684
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,070
He ties it all up in a pretty little bow christmas morning.

685
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,880
Well, he's not really that b-- bad.

686
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,470
Ellen said you had a thing for him.

687
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,980
She hated you, you know?

688
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,380
Well, that's disappointing.
I always thought of her as a friend.

689
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,350
She would make fun of you, too,

690
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,100
your little crush on nick.

691
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,440
The guy is married with a kid, you keep trying to jump him anyway.

692
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,210
You're a real slut, aren't you?

693
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,340
hello?

694
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,240
Where do you think you're going?

695
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,080
- nowhere.
- That's right.

696
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,690
okay.
Okay.

697
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,660
- You friggin' win.
- Brian.

698
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,560
What brings you here?

699
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,230
You can have me back...

700
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,550
- if you still want me.
- Well...

701
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,420
it has little to do with me, brian, buT...

702
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,170
I'm sure the lord is pleased.

703
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,900
Well, that's what counts.

704
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,410
might I ask you what changed your mind?

705
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,730
I-I had A...

706
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,570
revelation.

707
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,620
Really?

708
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,880
Of what nature?

709
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
I realized my little foray

710
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,110
into the world of darling enterprises

711
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,010
wasn't getting me what I wanted.

712
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,120
So that's when I decided that I could get what I'm looking for right here.

713
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,830
What are you saying, brian?

714
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,300
What I'm saying is simple, bishop bascombe.

715
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,100
I want your job.

716
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,670
we're here live at federal hall, the first capitol of the united states,

717
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,720
the site of george washington's first inauguration,

718
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,790
and today, senator-elect patrick darling's swearing in ceremony.

719
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,460
it is an unusual location for a freshman senator's inauguration.

720
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,830
Some would call it downright esumptuous.

721
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:50,030
But we've come to expect nothing less from america's first family, the darlings.

722
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,680
I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter.

723
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,640
Will well and faithfully...

724
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,040
well and faithfully.
Doesn't that sound funny?

725
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,950
It sounds perfect.
Go on.

726
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,200
The office upon which I am about to enter,

727
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,860
so help me G.

728
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,140
So help me god.

729
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,290
Look at you.

730
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,020
All right, here's the plan--

731
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,270
I want you to wait outside,

732
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,260
and when I'm coming down the stairs to be sworn in,

733
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,570
I want you to sneak in behind me,

734
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,750
and when I'm about to give my speech--

735
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,770
are you sure you want to do this?

736
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:30,050
I have never been more certain about anything in my entire life.

737
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,350
This is our moment.

738
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,120
- Love you.
- I love you.

739
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,860
Go, go.

740
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,610
Perfect.It establishes exactly what...

741
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,580
patrick.

742
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,050
- Dad.
- That was carmelita.

743
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,770
That's rht,

744
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,700
and I plan to have her by my side for when I take the oath of office.

745
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,040
And you thought springing this on us at the last minute--

746
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,280
was the only way to get it done, nick.

747
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:57,910
Patrick--

748
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,570
this is my inauguration, gentlemen, my senate career, my life.

749
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,270
Which, for all intents and purposes,

750
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,590
we are more determined to preserve than he is.

751
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,370
what?

752
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,950
{a6}HOME

753
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,580
excuse me.

754
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,890
- Hello?
- nick...

755
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,660
hello, lisa?

756
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,910
Are you in the house?

757
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,450
Hello?

758
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,620
He'S...

759
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,670
who is this?
Are you okay?

760
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,450
- who is this?
- Nick...

761
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,600
karen, is that you?

762
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,380
tripp, where's ken?

763
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,670
I have no idea.

764
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,420
With letitia, probably.

765
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,570
jeremy!

766
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,150
Have you seen nick?
I gotta find him.

767
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,710
Listen, you didn't tell him about simon and me, did you?

768
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,500
- No.
- Are you sure?Because--

769
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,310
but I'm gonna as soon as I find him.

770
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,960
No, no.You can't tell him.
You can't tell anyone.

771
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,280
- Listen, I'm sorry that I got you involved--
- no, you did the right thing.

772
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,170
I told you, I'm gonna take care of it.

773
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,220
- No.
- Let me go take care of it.

774
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,580
jeremy, listen to me!

775
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,860
Listen, this is...

776
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,520
ms. Lyons, there you are.
Everything okay?

777
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,500
Um, yes, everything is fine.

778
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm actually just gonna check in with the senator.

779
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,080
Why don't you check on-- on that side...

780
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,080
will do.

781
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,470
If I'd told you,

782
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,120
you would have undertaken all these machinations to stop me,

783
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,680
and I will not be stopped, not this time.

784
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,600
You're deranged, suicidal.
It's political suicide.

785
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,370
Mr. Darling.

786
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,780
This is your greatest achievement, son.

787
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,760
It is beyond my comprehension why you are so compelled to sabotage--

788
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,760
mr. Darling, sir, we--

789
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,440
having carmelita by my side after everything you've done to us

790
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,080
would be my greatest achievement.

791
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,450
- Mr. Darling.
- What?!

792
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,380
We've got a situation.

793
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,170
- Letitia.
- Nicky.

794
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:40,820
Is karen with you?

795
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,510
No.

796
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,010
When I saw her this morning, she said she was headed to see you.

797
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,420
Where did she go?

798
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,680
- Did she go to my house?
- I tried to tell--

799
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,770
- yes, why?
- Nick.

800
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,760
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, I think so, too.

801
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,900
What's going on?

802
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,070
Oh, chase has escaped--

803
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,480
overcame his guard, knocked him out,

804
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,000
stripped him naked, stole his gun.

805
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,940
- When, just now?
- No, a couple of hours ago.

806
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,850
Get a cop to 224 bank street, now.

807
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,450
- yes, sir.
- What's happening, nick?

808
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,280
Uh, we've gotta call off the inauguration.

809
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,540
Get this area evacuated immediately.

810
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,630
What's happened?
What can I do?

811
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,580
No time to explain, tripp.

812
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,790
Manas the senator-elect patrick darling makes his way onto the stage...

813
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,880
thank you.

814
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,100
Thank you.
Too loud.

815
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,270
hey, nick!
We gotta talk.

816
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,130
- Not now, jeremy.
- But, nick!

817
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,770
chief!

818
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,890
Chief, we gotta shut this down.

819
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,970
- Why?
- Security threat.

820
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,640
We gotta stop it, now.

821
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,000
gun!
Everybody down!

822
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,160
Nick, don't!

823
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,060
Everybody down!
