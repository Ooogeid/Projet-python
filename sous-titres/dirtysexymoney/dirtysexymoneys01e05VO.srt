1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
<i>As a lawyer for
the richest family in new york</i>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,737
<i>until his plane went down
in long island sound.</i>

3
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:08,532
<i>He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--</i>

4
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:10,033
<i>Tripp, the empire builder...</i>

5
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:12,451
You lied to me. You said you knew
about the affair.

6
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:13,680
I didn't know.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,788
<i>Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite...</i>

8
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,000
Your father was my great love.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,258
<i>Brian, the man of god...</i>

10
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,890
I lied to my wife
and daughters.

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,480
I told them
that you were an orphan.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,580
<i>Patrick,
the principled politician,</i>

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,280
<i>Karen,
the professional divorcée...</i>

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,360
Karen, do not call me
on the home phone number.

15
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:29,845
I'll always love you, too.

16
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,980
<i>And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.</i>

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,967
She was my best friend
in the whole world.

18
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:35,726
- I want you.
- If Juliet found out...

19
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,227
She won't find out.

20
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,580
You think Simon Elder,

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,280
the billionaire philanthropist,
blew up your father's plane?

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,185
Simon Elder is not the man
you think he is,

23
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,825
and your boss isn't either.

24
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:56,294
Morning, daddy.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,080
- Hey.
- Hi.

26
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:00,203
I have to get you some new suits.

27
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,744
The dry cleaner is starting to think
i have a thing for him.

28
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,297
I'm sorry, i stayed here
at the office again.

29
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,680
I been going through this pile
of donation requests.

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,675
It's okay. We know you're busy.
It's all good.

31
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,715
I just don't know how
i'm supposed to help people

32
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:13,476
if i can't make time
to write the checks.

33
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,360
The whole family
sleeps here now. Charming

34
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:16,645
I work in a sweatshop.

35
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,560
Pookie-kai, daisy.

36
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,479
Pookie-kai,
long time, no see.

37
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,689
Pookie-kai?
What is pookie-kai?

38
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,380
Secret girl stuff.

39
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,480
Maybe we should go to my desk.

40
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:27,961
Thanks, guys.

41
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:30,989
- How are you?
- Nestly?

42
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,215
I'up to my ears hanging this
new show at the gallery,

43
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:34,296
i'm reading three books,

44
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:35,996
none of which i'm making
any headway in,

45
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:37,715
and i kinda miss my husband.

46
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:38,842
Yeah, me, too.

47
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,949
He's a great guy.

48
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,180
- That's funny.
- I'm sorry.

49
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,506
Don't be sorry.
I know this is

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,247
- A big opportunity for you...
- I am really sorry about-

51
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,030
just for the money but to find out
what happened with your dad,

52
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:50,380
You don't have to explain
i understand

53
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,660
All the business you do
for the darlings during the day

54
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,804
and the noble work you do
with their money at night,

55
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,980
i just feel like
there's no us anymore.

56
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,392
It's all Darlings.

57
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:01,141
Tell you what. we are gonna have
dinner tomorrow night.

58
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm not complaining. It's fine.

59
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,905
- You're doing your job.
- Tomorrow night,

60
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,714
just you and me, del posto.

61
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,903
What do you say?
Kiki can stay with your mom.

62
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,699
Say something.
Anything.

63
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,880
You've just admitted to me

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,685
that you've been an adulteress
for 40 years.

65
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,680
Forgive me
if i'm short on words.

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,471
- Where are you going?
- What?

67
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,127
You haven't been in the same bed
with me for weeks.

68
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,382
I've known that you've
suspected something,

69
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:32,880
and i also knew
that you'd never say it.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,387
I mean, god forbid
that tripp Darling

71
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,646
should ever admit
to being...

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,476
affected by anything.

73
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,203
Just tell me one thing.

74
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,262
our children,

75
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,793
are they all mine?

76
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,192
Yes.

77
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,273
Absolutely.

78
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,281
Oh, god.

79
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:55,438
What?

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,980
The thought that you can be
so sure...

81
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,580
that such attention was paid
to such a prolonged,

82
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:06,280
continuous insult
that you can say "absolutely,"

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,214
as if it were a favor
you did me fondly.

84
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,328
My god, Tish.
It's so sordid.

85
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,265
- Wait, what's the place called?
- Bar known.

86
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,680
Like the little dudes,
bar gnome?

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,957
Not gnome, freak show.
Known.

88
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,480
That's too bad.
I was psyched.

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,815
I was gonna get, like,
a little red hat.

90
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,710
Will you just come
with me anyway 'cause

91
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,280
it's opening night,
and then there's this...

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,502
What are you eating?

93
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,238
Sausage.

94
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,280
What?
What's the matter? Peta?

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,180
No, i've just been
all queasy all morning

96
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,871
and i'm, like,
a little bit spinny.

97
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,456
Will you just tell me,
Jeremy,

98
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,870
are you coming with me
or not?

99
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,373
I gotta make sure Juliet's not
gonna be there. But as for me,

100
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:51,213
tomorrow night?
fo sho. I'm already there.

101
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,280
I gotta go.
I'll see ya then, babe. Bye.

102
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:56,927
What?

103
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,179
- You were just talking to her.
- Who?

104
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,880
- Your secret girlfriend.
- I have no girlfriend.

105
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:05,480
Oh, yeah? Then who did you spend
600 grand on at bulgari,

106
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,895
Justin Timberlake?

107
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,734
All right, Jules,
I am telling the truth,

108
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,400
i am... i'm pluto.

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,780
I'm cold, distant
and alone.

110
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,780
All right.
well speaking of planets--

111
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,678
Pluto is not a planet
anymore.

112
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,716
It will always be
a planet to me.

113
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:24,880
What is this?

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,959
An early birthday present.

115
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,080
Hayden planetarium!

116
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,380
- I got you the whole place.
- Get out.

117
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,676
For rizzle. The entire cosmos
to yourself.

118
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,048
Well, i don't have
a gift for you yet.

119
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:42,764
It's kinda
three weeks early.

120
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,080
Yes, you do.

121
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,185
You see, there's this new club
opening tomorrow night.

122
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,780
and they begged me,

123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,980
so i promised
to make an appearance,

124
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,109
- and you can come with me.
- It's not bar known, is it?

125
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,280
Oh, i know! It's like
the worst name ever, right?

126
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
Yeah, it's
the absolute worst.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
You should just bail on it,

128
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,843
you know?
Stay home, read a book.

129
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,965
Are you on cold medicine?

130
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,246
It's a new club.

131
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,280
They asked me to be there.

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,780
And for your information,
i read a book last night.

133
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,567
Reading's a lifestyle, though.
It's an -

134
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,380
Jeremy, i promised. I owe it
to them to be there.

135
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,980
And now, thanks to me,
so do you.

136
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,700
She is decided.

137
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,994
I found something
very interesting, Tripp.

138
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,580
Lookin' in
your dad's calendar?

139
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,580
Yeah.

140
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,780
In the wake of
the massive helpfulness

141
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,023
from the police,

142
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,233
I decided
to go over it again,

143
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,280
check all the names,
all the dates,

144
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,480
see if i could figure out,
you know, who gave dad

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
all the information
on Simon Elder and why.

146
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,326
And my dad
had several meetings

147
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,641
with someone he referred to
only by the letter "c."

148
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,331
- "c"?
- I have no idea who it could be.

149
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,380
met him once a month,
sometimes twice.

150
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Hang on a second.

151
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
There were a few times
i asked your dad

152
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,357
to do some detective work
for me.

153
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,980
Just after Kenneth
was assassinated

154
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
was the first one.

155
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,000
And there we others.

156
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,980
When he wanted to...

157
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,280
maintain
a tasteful distance,

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,700
he employed the services
of that man.

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,880
"Harold Templeton"?

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,834
Well, that's not
his real name.

161
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,900
He was a spy in the 60s
for England...

162
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,380
And China...

163
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,680
And France.

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,880
he even did some work
for Kennedy in Cuba.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,980
He managed to make himself
globally unpopular.

166
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,372
You can't mention this
to anyone, not even Lisa.

167
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,280
How do i find him?

168
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
Well, there's
a little vineyard in--

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,480
just outside of Milan.

170
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,580
It's near our summer place in Italy

171
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,975
where you
and your dad used to

172
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,200
spend some time with us.

173
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,580
They make
a great little wine.

174
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,212
Chiavennasca.

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,180
Anyway,
if i remember correctly,

176
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,324
you go to that vineyard...

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,588
You ask for that wine...

178
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,366
- Slightly chilled.
- Wait a second.

179
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:09,114
Are you asking me to go
to italy to find this guy?

180
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,080
Yeah.

181
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,580
No, i mean, that's where
dutch always started out

182
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,580
when he was trying
to track him down.

183
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,380
He keeps a very low profile.

184
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,580
Anyway, you ask for the wine,
then see what happens.

185
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,580
If you manage to locate
Mr. Templeton,

186
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,080
He might be able
to explain to you

187
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,928
the origins of the...

188
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,935
Elder dossier.

189
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,056
Who knows?

190
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:32,597
He may even be able
to tell you who "c" is.

191
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,570
okay.

192
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,808
I'll go to italy.

193
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:38,611
Nick.

194
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:39,608
Yeah.

195
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:42,113
Snag a bottle fome,
will you?

196
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,258
Will do.

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,780
Chiavennasca.

198
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,365
Chiavennasca. Got it.

199
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:01,546
Aren't those to die for?

200
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,380
It's like they're made
out of George Clooney.

201
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,384
- How much?
- $1,200.

202
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:09,380
12...
$1,200?

203
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,180
Do they come
with a kidney?

204
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,104
No, they come
with each other.

205
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,446
What kind of perso
spends $1,200 on shoes?

206
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,186
Lisa.

207
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,525
What are you doing here?

208
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,956
Picked up a suit for Nick.
We're going out tomorrow night,

209
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,880
- So i just kinda thought-
- Then you have to buy those shoes.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,995
- No, actually--
- Oh, yes, actually.

211
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,780
And do get them in raspberry.
I have them.

212
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,780
- I wear them all the time.
- I can't buy shoes

213
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,680
that cost as much
as car insurance.

214
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,128
Lisa, honey, don't be
so financially resistant, okay?

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
It's just money.

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,380
You did a little
shopping today, huh?

217
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,980
No, i did
a little browsing.

218
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,180
Karen Darling
did the shopping.

219
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,480
Right after i told you
our whole world was Darlings,

220
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,080
- Darlings everywhere...
- Yeah.

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
I ran into her.
We chatted.

222
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,880
- 3 h later, those shoes showed up.
- Well, that was thoughtful.

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,364
Yeah, i'm sure a lot of thought
went into that purchase.

224
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:10,056
What's the problem?
she sent you a gift.

225
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,165
She does stuff like that.

226
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,880
Why would Karen Darling
send me a gift?

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,620
Hey, Lise, you're starting
to sound a little paranoid.

228
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,080
OK? sometimes a shoe
is just a shoe.

229
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,002
And sometimes
it's a bomb.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,780
So much for
our night out, huh?

231
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,380
Instead of a great meal
at del posto

232
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,980
and a night of wild sex...

233
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,680
Which i was really
looking forward to...

234
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,280
I get leftovers and a dvd
and you get a, what,

235
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,580
a whirlwind trip
to some villa in Italy

236
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,269
to pick up one bottle
of chiave--

237
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,520
Chiavennasca.

238
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,885
Why don't you
come with me?

239
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,452
- I can't. It's work.
- Why not?

240
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,780
- This is work.
- So what if it's work? Come on.

241
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,355
It's a private jet.
There's room.

242
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,448
You know, your mom can watch
Kiki over the weekend.

243
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,280
- Let's go to italy.
- Yeah?

244
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:59,885
Look, it's totally free,
and for two days, no Darlings.

245
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,418
No darlings.

249
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,726
See? Reading. Happy now?

250
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:20,923
Very nice.

251
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,650
"Babes in toyland"?

252
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,435
I felt bad i didn't have
a gift for you,

253
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:31,566
- so i rented out the whole angelika.
- For tonight?

254
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,240
- Yeah.
- Well, that is so sweet of you.

255
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,380
- Oh, i know.
- But i can't go.

256
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,980
You have to.
The thing is set.

257
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,280
Well, we have to go
to the club tonight.

258
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,874
I gave my word.
my word is my bond.

259
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,680
Anyways, when i decided
i wanted to read for the remake,

260
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,480
i decided that
i couldn't watch the original

261
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,680
because Annette Funicello
is so iconic.

262
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,180
I didn't want to copy.

263
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,280
But it was a really
picturesque thought.

264
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:57,747
Thanks.

265
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,480
Why aren't you dressed
for school today, Gustav?

266
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,613
I don't want to go.

267
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,280
Is that how they do things
in sweden?

268
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,080
School's like a tea party,
you go if you want?

269
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
What happened to your face?

270
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,480
- Bully hit me.
- Did you hit back?

271
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,780
- Jesus says don't hit back.
- Says who?

272
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,400
My mommy.

273
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,189
Your mommy?

274
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,021
You mean your mommy
who's dead?

275
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,749
Yeah.

276
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,759
Poor kid.

277
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,824
She's in a better place now.

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
Bully or no bully,
still has to go to school.

279
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Okay, but i'm gonna
get terrorized.

280
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,780
Gustav, the world
is full of bullies

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,280
and always will be.

282
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,380
- You can't live in fear.
- What am i supposed to do?

283
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,733
What do you think?
Fight back.

284
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,766
Like David and Goliath.
You find a weakness

285
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,800
and you take advantage.
There's your bible truth for today.

286
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,380
Because i share your passion
for the truth, that's why.

287
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,828
Well, what makes you so sure
the painting's a forgery?

288
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,580
Peter, i don't want
to do this to you.

289
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,280
You've been our doctor
for years.

290
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,680
But Tish and i were passing
through David Frank's gallery

291
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,680
on our way to meet Karen
about a week ago...

292
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,019
I don't know,
maybe it was the light.

293
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,280
And i saw a speck
of prussian blue

294
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,480
in "das kind"--

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,874
your painting.

296
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,563
Prussian blue? I...

297
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah, the pigment.

298
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,767
It had not yet been invented
in engel's lifetime.

299
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,056
So i became suspicious.

300
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,180
There's a forger in Belgium

301
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,980
Who's becoming quietly famous
in some circles

302
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,708
for this sort of thing.

303
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,133
I'm sorry...

304
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,680
But your painting is a fake.

305
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,920
Stretfield's guaranteed
$6 million.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,641
That painting's our exit strategy.

307
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,252
You've been Tish's o.b.-g.y.n.
for over three decades.

308
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,852
And this is a little secret.

309
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,905
Trust me.

310
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,904
This is going to go
with me to my grave.

311
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,564
I am curious...

312
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:28,080
About what?

313
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,438
In all the years that you've
been delivering our children...

314
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,180
Have you ever been aware

315
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,768
that any of them
might not have been mine?

316
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,177
You might look into that for me.

317
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:42,871
Yeah, sure. I could...

318
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:45,135
get you an answer on that,

319
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:48,342
- Sometime next week if you like.
- Tomorrow would be best.

320
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,680
If Natalie Kimpton's
gonna be here all night

321
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,980
with Ryan Casdale,

322
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,380
this place is over
before it even began.

323
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,680
What is that?

324
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,462
The old vodka
in the water bottle routine?

325
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,589
That is so 2004.

326
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,260
Does she think
she's fooling anyone?

327
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,418
I'm so tired of that
backstabbing little witch.

328
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,780
What, are you text bombing
your girlfriend?

329
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,280
No. i'm--

330
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,380
i'm betting on polo online.

331
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,280
Oh, my god!

332
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,700
Astrid!

333
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,480
When did you
get back from Andorra?

334
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,780
About two hours ago.

335
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,103
- What'sith boris and natasha?
- oh, it's some sort of

336
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,100
You look super hot tonight.

337
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
You do, too.

338
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:06,980
I thought maybe we could...

339
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,880
Pee does not
go well with this dress.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,880
I'll get you another one.

341
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,580
Someone just came in.

342
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,067
- So you want to have a three way?
- It could be my sister.

343
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:21,080
You are about to have sex
in a public bathroom,

344
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,322
and that is what you're worried
about, your sister?

345
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,732
That is so incredibly lame!

346
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:32,372
This has got to be
the best part about being rich,

347
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:34,462
- Don't you think?
- What's that, the private jet?

348
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:37,080
Yeah, no lines,
no security.

349
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,980
And no pesky rules
about cocktails before takeoff.

350
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
What do you mean?
in 1st class,

351
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,780
they practically pour
the drinks down your throat.

352
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,480
- Not if you're flying the plane.
- Wait a minute, Clark.

353
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,914
- You're flying the plane?
- Tripp sent me to flight school.

354
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,300
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

355
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm expecting a real easy trip
across the pond.

356
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,675
You two can just
lean back and relax.

357
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,180
- You guys!
- Hi, karen.

358
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
hi.

359
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,180
Hey, Lisa,
my shopping buddy.

360
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,919
What a surprise.

361
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,728
- Could you get the luggage for us?
- Yes, ma'am.

362
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,164
Yeah, daddy told us that
you guys were taking the jet,

363
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,698
so we thought we would just hitchhike.
you don't mind. Do you?

364
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,333
No, no, no, no. It's fine.

365
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:16,653
It's...

366
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:18,543
perfect.

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,045
This place is incredible.

368
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,380
Please tell me that we don't
have to spend the whole day

369
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,680
with Karen and Freddy.

370
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,442
I'm guessing
that Freddy's out golfing

371
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,317
and Karen's out cold.
we can just sneak out of here.

372
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,027
Buon giorno, amici.

373
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,321
Hey, Karen.
You're up early.

374
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,880
I know. The espresso
in Italy is so good.

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,201
I've had, like, four already.

376
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,830
You guys look
freshly laid.

377
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:55,994
Am i interrupting?

378
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,780
- Not at all.
- No.

379
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,080
- What do you want to do today?
- What do we want to do?

380
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:03,379
Well, Karen i have some stuff
to do for your dad, a little business.

381
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,380
We don't mind.
We're game for anything.

382
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,080
Absolutely anything.

383
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,380
Nick and i don't get
to spend much time alone,

384
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,200
So we're...

385
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,580
I get...

386
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,840
I get it.

387
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:18,900
"love time."

388
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,700
Yeah.

389
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,580
I hope that's not a problem.

390
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,780
No, not at all.

391
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,351
You go your way,
we'll go ours.

392
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,811
Italy's big, you know?

393
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,580
Oh, my god!
these are so good.

394
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,577
These are lto, molto yummy.
You want some?

395
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,338
- Holy crap!
- What?

396
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,180
I hope Ryan's taking penicillin.

397
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
That girl is septic.

398
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,880
Are there any pictures of me?

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
I haven't looked.

400
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,980
Listen, i think my wife
is on to us, all right?

401
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
So we're just gonna
have to be a little more...

402
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:03,926
Listen.

403
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,067
What is it?

404
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,110
Chora.

405
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,100
Chora?

406
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,214
That's your bully?

407
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,107
She's a girl!

408
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,808
Come on.
Get it together, man.

409
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,834
I'll pick you up
after school.

410
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,443
You better run, hot dog.
mama's hungry!

411
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,380
Right this way.

412
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,580
Allora, today, we have
for to taste

413
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,180
is the rosso di valtellina.

414
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,681
Also we have the pinot nero
and a very nice gragnano.

415
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,661
- Signora.
- Grazie.

416
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,080
Prego. Signore.

417
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,256
Thank you.

418
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:56,031
You dot happen to have
chiavennasca, do you?

419
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,318
Si

420
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,027
- Slightly chilled?
- Slightly chilled?

421
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:02,350
Vado lo domandare.

422
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,752
Okay, who's stalking who?
it's such a puzzle.

423
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:07,872
Hi.

424
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,400
- Hi, Karen.
- Hello.

425
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,080
- How are you? Freddy.
- Nick.

426
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,679
So i guess Italy's not
as big as i thought,

427
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,764
It's gettin' smaller
all the time.

428
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,279
Lei vuole mangiare con noi?

429
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:22,592
Do you mind if--

430
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,249
'cause we drove
all the way here,

431
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:28,280
and it'll be so awkward
if you're sitting next to us

432
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,980
but not, you know, with us.

433
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,780
We wouldn't want it
to be awkward.

434
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,300
Oh, perfect. Okay.
I love this now.

435
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,780
- How the hell did you get in here?
- I followed the flower delivery guy.

436
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,280
Don't worry. Your wife
is out getting waxed.

437
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,780
I'm sorry.

438
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,980
I meant your sister.

439
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,580
- What the hell is this?
- Publicity stunt.

440
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,380
You kissed
Ryan "creepo" Casdale.

441
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,280
My agent told me to.

442
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,383
Does your agent make decisions
for your lips?

443
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,537
What about us?

444
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:03,280
Jeremy, what do i want
with some actor

445
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,751
who looks in the mirror
more often than i do?

446
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:10,466
He's a boy.

447
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,439
He's a baby.

448
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,072
You're my man.

449
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,615
You're my big man.

450
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:19,575
You didn't sleep with him?

451
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,680
I fell asleep a few times
while he was talking,

452
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,752
- But that's about it.
- Promise?

453
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,804
I promise.

454
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,541
I do.

455
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,686
Here.

456
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:40,680
Wait, wait.
I have to tell you something.

457
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,888
What?

458
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,580
You want me to put on
explosions in the sky?

459
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,300
Yeah. But i have to
tell you something.

460
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,324
Don't you ever knock?

461
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:01,784
That's your girlfriend?

462
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,080
I was gonna tell you about it.
I swear.

463
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,380
So those tickets
to "babes in toyland,"

464
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,957
they weren't a gift at all?

465
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:09,280
They were subterfuge?

466
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,420
- They were subterfuge and a gift.
- And you!

467
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,788
- What?
- Weren't my bangs enough?

468
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,769
Oh, it was a completely
different approach-

469
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,880
- Get out of my house, you whore!
- Let it go.

470
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,820
Can't we just all talk
about this like adults?

471
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,580
Get her drippy butt
out of my house!

472
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,473
- No!
- What?

473
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,495
She's not leaving.

474
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:29,877
This is...

475
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,612
utterly mortifying.

476
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:34,066
This is...

477
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:36,280
the worst thing
that's ever happened.

478
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
Juliet, you are my sister,
and i love you.

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,592
but i can't choose sides.

480
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:44,606
Well, guess what.

481
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,025
You just did.

482
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,400
I gotta go throw up.

483
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,880
You know, even when we were little,

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,780
- I knew you were grounded.
- I got grounded a few times, maybe.

485
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,135
I don't know if i was grounded.

486
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,380
Yeah, when i met him
at william and mary,

487
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,734
he was kind of a flake.

488
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,810
A naughty flake.

489
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,520
Well, you know,

490
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,939
I've just always seen him
as such an old soul.

491
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,380
I don't know if you know him

492
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,480
as well as you think you do,
Karen, really.

493
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,380
I don't think
you do either, Lisa.

494
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,480
I've known him for a long ti--
longer than you, and i--

495
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,784
Well, i remember Nick and i
walking on the beach

496
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,537
And the way the sun
hit your hair. It just...

497
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:30,331
glistened.

498
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,597
Signore George.

499
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:33,125
Yeah.

500
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,580
Would you follow me,
please, to the tasting room?

501
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:37,380
Yeah, i guess

502
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,257
You asked for
the chiavennasca.

503
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,176
Yeah, i did.

504
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,220
If you'll excuse me,

505
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,600
i just have
some family business.

506
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,561
All right.
you all keep bonding.

507
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:53,979
Will do.

508
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,614
Come il tuo italiano?

509
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,380
Non buono.

510
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,952
Mi dispiace.

511
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:11,121
What a pity.
To speak english

512
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:15,021
puts me in mind
of irretrievable times.

513
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
ah, well.

514
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,175
This the chiavennasca?

515
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:26,200
No, no. It's vin ordinaire.

516
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,154
So you're dutch's boy?

517
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,343
Yeah.

518
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,755
I guess so.

519
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,610
For what do you seek?

520
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,980
When my dad died, his briefcase
was full of information

521
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,400
about Simon Elder.

522
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,194
Incriminating information.

523
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,480
Elder, as in
the techno-philanthropist?

524
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
Yeah.

525
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:59,151
Any idea why he might have
had a file like that?

526
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,080
Did i do something wrong?

527
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,980
If you are who you say you are,
i will find you.

529
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,369
If not, well.

530
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,180
Those are your bad dreams.

531
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,477
Arrivederci.

532
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,080
Me wearing
the superman underoos

533
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,680
and he's wearing
wonder woman.

534
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,483
I'm not kidding.

535
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:22,860
There he is.

536
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,600
Hi, baby. Just in time.

537
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,519
- What's going on?
- We can go.

538
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,980
No. We've moved on
to spirits.

539
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,581
Nick,
we're drinking grappa.

540
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,046
Maybe the two of you
have had enough?

541
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,088
Loosen up, baby.
We are in India.

542
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,581
We are?

543
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,343
What did i just say?

544
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:49,180
You said we were in India.

545
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Nick.

546
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:52,556
It's grappa.

547
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,186
Remember?

548
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,254
Remember what?
What about grappa?

549
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:02,441
We had a couple of bottles

550
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,568
the night
that Nick proposed to me.

551
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:10,532
Nick proposed to you?

552
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:13,180
- You didn't tell her?
- When would that have come up?

553
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,745
When did he propose to you?

554
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,180
When we were 19.
Why didn't you tell her?

555
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,034
You're so secretive.

556
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,668
Because we were 19.

557
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:23,379
Exactly. We were 19.
It's ancient history.

558
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:25,180
It was down by the lake,
just down--

559
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,508
down the hill
from where we're all staying.

560
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,200
And we...
I don't know, we'd been,

561
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,780
like, sailing all day
or playing tennis.

562
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,980
I just remember him saying
that he--

563
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,880
He knew it wasn't
gonna be easy

564
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,080
because i was so rich
and he wasn't.

565
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,065
But he knew we were
supposed to be together.

566
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:45,693
Hey, Karen, can we...

567
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,320
Oh, let her finish.
Let her finish.

568
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,656
And then we, you know,

569
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,080
we drank a bunch of grappa.

570
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,285
- And, um...
- Lisa.

571
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:58,400
- You know, just spent time...
- Lisa, i should've told you.

572
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,880
Thanks.

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,212
I'm sorry.

574
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,592
God,
you are a bitch sometimes.

575
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,400
I know.
It's a problem.

576
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,726
Lisa come on. I was 19.

577
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,300
I was in Italy.
I was drunk on grappa.

578
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,380
Everyone proposes
when they're 19.

579
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,880
- It didn't mean anything.
- Well, it meant something to her.

580
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,726
and it certainly
would've meant something

581
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,069
if she'd said yes.

582
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:31,317
Lisa, it was a thousand years ago.

583
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,780
When we started dating,
we exchanged plenty of stories

584
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,980
about our old boyfriends
and girlfriends, remember?

585
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,173
- Yeah, So?
- There must have been some reason

586
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,171
you decided to leave
this particular one out

587
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:42,337
unless maybe you forgot.
Did you forget?

588
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,880
I don't understand

589
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,089
why you don't just go
to the headmaster

590
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,680
and tell him this bullying
is taking place.

591
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,673
Because the little orphan
is never gonna learn

592
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:56,480
- How to stick up for himself.
- Like you learned?

593
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,267
18 years of being beat up by girls,

594
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,900
and what's his revenge?
The ministry.

595
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,080
- That's awful.
- Every summer, your uncle Brian

596
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,280
would come back from vacation
with aunt deirdre

597
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,180
and cousin derinda
covered in bruises.

598
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,401
it was tragic.

599
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:11,980
What did they call you again?
The princess?

600
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,816
What did they call you again,
fatty-paddy?

601
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,680
I wouldn't mind
a change subject.

602
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,980
I swear, sometimes i don't know
where you children come from.

603
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Why did you really enter
the church, uncle Brian?

604
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,980
I didn't see anywhere else
in the world i fit in.

605
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,880
I didn't want to pursue business
or politics.

606
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,080
I never...
felt really well liked.

607
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,180
So a life of leisure
didn't seem appealing.

608
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,180
You need friends
for that kind of thing.

609
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,880
So, you know, i guess
i really never felt

610
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
a part of the human family.

611
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:47,862
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

612
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,584
Ellen, thank you.

613
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,614
Take it easy, sailor.

614
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:57,518
You're gonna overheat
your blood.

615
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,451
Sorry.

616
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:02,951
I haven't seen a child
pepper food that vigorously

617
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:04,832
since you were a boy, Brian.

618
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Bon appetit.

619
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,780
You should probably
answer that.

620
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm sure
it's your girlfriend Karen

621
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,176
calling to invite you
for a midnight swim...

622
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,500
or maybe another romantic
grappa party or something.

623
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,380
Pronto?

624
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,734
Mr. George.
Harold Templeton.

625
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:27,396
May we convene?

626
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,380
I apologize for my abrupt exit
the last time.

627
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,580
But you can never be too sure
who's who in my line of work.

628
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,480
Your father
would've understood.

629
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,116
He was...
also a complex man.

630
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,981
What happened?

631
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,078
Three months ago,
he asked me

632
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:45,180
compile information
on Simon Elder--

633
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,380
anything vexing.

634
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,080
What for?
To blackmail him?

635
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,980
I never asked.
It was not my concern.

636
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,749
But when your father
came to me a 2nd time

637
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,923
and asked me to perform
similar due diligence

638
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,259
on Tripp Darling,
well, i realized

639
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:58,880
he was wking
for someone else,

640
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,715
so i washed my hands
of it.

641
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,380
So who was my father
working for? Do you know?

642
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,680
Did he ever mention someone
that he referred to

643
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,142
by the letter "c"?

644
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:13,701
No.

645
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,500
Not that i recall.

646
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:21,007
and there's your chiavennasca
for Mr. Darling.

647
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,078
- Hey.
- Hey

648
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,757
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

649
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:33,879
You know what?

650
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,018
Save it for someone who cares.

651
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,180
I don't want these shoes
anymore. You know why?

652
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,680
- They don't fit?
- No, actually, they fit fine.

653
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,280
I don't want these shoes
because these shoes--

654
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,780
these $1,200 shoes--

655
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,104
and for everything that is
selfish and foul

656
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:53,180
and consumptive
and creepy about you.

657
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,213
Nick and i have...
a daughter.

658
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
And, you have this dream,

659
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,977
and it's never
going to come true.

660
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:02,231
So stay away from my husband
and...

661
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:03,884
stay out of my way.

662
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,809
- Who was that, baby?
- Nobody.

663
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:16,962
Make me a drink,
would you?

664
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Go away.

665
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,379
We need to talk.

666
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,352
I'm not speaking to you,
traitor.

667
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,924
Juliet... I love her.

668
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:47,272
Love?

669
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,666
Okay, i really like her.

670
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,862
Like?

671
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,856
I'm moderately interest--

672
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,505
Why can't you be cool
about this?

673
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,280
Because she doesn't care
about you.

674
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,211
She's only using you to get at me.

675
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,980
Now i get it. yeah.
It's about you. Right?

676
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,056
- Everything is just all about you.
- I'm just trying to protect you.

677
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,124
You don't have to!
You're the one running around

678
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,980
telling everyone
you want to be independent.

679
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,642
You want your own career, 
to move out.

680
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:15,680
You can't even let
your twin brother date someone

681
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,858
you had a stupid fight with
over bangs? why?

682
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:21,737
Because it makes you feel so lonely
and freaked out and threatened.

683
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:23,482
I mean, bangs?

684
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,234
I feel
so far from home.

685
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,250
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

686
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,004
I hate that we can't just get on
a plane right now and go.

687
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:41,880
Well, we could,

688
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,380
but we'd have to fly
with Karen and Freddy.

689
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,800
Well, they have
their private jet.

690
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,780
We are flying back like--
like normal people

691
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,380
with... lines and security

692
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,436
and peanuts and back pain

693
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:56,917
and... life.

694
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,300
God...

695
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,800
it's...
weird being married.

696
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,868
It's so weird.

697
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,800
Yeah...

698
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,500
it is.

699
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,380
Promise me something.

700
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
What?

701
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,170
Promise me that we are never
going to have to come

702
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:26,500
all the way to italy for a stupid
bottle of wine again, please.

703
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,368
Lisa...

704
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,098
We didn't come here
for a bottle of wine.

705
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,680
I needed to meet with a guy
who did some work for my dad.

706
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,080
When did you do that?

707
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
When i went down
to the wine cellar.

708
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,300
He's a spy.

709
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,180
It's a long story.

710
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,775
I look forward to hearing
about it halfway over the atlantic.

711
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,780
You know, i count on you
for so much, Lise.

712
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,200
You know that?

713
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,764
- A little.
- When i look at you,

714
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:15,934
here's this perfect line
from me through you

715
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:17,805
to the center of the earth.

716
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,800
You keep me connected
to everything.

717
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,692
You do the same for me.

718
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:26,380
And kiki does it
for both of us.

719
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,383
it's a...
it's a beautiful thing.

720
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,946
You know, i don't think my dad
felt that way about anyone.

721
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
You don't think he felt
that way about you?

722
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,597
I don't know.

723
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,166
I really don't.

724
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,677
Lei vuole fare l'amore?

725
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,280
You picked up
a little italian?

726
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,680
Enough to get by.

727
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
yeah?

728
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:11,178
Victoria,
would you excuse us?

729
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:12,299
Yes, sir.

730
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,285
Thank you so much...

731
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:17,500
For all you do.

732
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:27,200
Silver up to snuff?

733
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
It's getting there.

734
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,060
We need to talk.

735
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:45,068
What's that?

736
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,486
D.n.a. results.

737
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:52,197
You lied to me.

738
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:54,157
What the hell
have you done?

739
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,380
I found out
what i needed to now.

740
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,780
I found out
the only way that i could

741
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,959
give the fact that my wife
doesn't tell me the truth.

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,101
So...

743
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,837
So you know?

744
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,618
I haven't read
the results.

745
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,546
I won't.

746
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,971
I want to hear it
from you.

747
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,145
Which of our children

748
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,432
isn't mine?

749
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,439
Which one is Dutch's?

750
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,836
I'll tell you.

751
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,787
But you've got to promise me
nothing will change...

752
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,872
As far as the children
are concerned.

753
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:45,546
I don't have to
promise you anything.

754
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:47,794
You took my life--

755
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,880
You took my life
that i placed in your hands

756
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,980
to help me carry it
safely to the grave,

757
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:58,403
and you laid it on every bedside
table you could find

758
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,180
while you pursued
whatever it was

759
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,680
you were pursuing
all those years.

760
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
I hope it was
the obliteration of yourself,

761
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,917
because, my god,
that's what you've achieved.

762
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,800
Just tell me the truth...

763
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,883
Or leave right now.

764
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,300
I mean it.

765
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,242
You're the only woman
in the world for me, Tish.

766
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,480
But can't live every day

767
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,246
with my face being pushed
into this filth.

768
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,900
If you want me
in that bed tonight...

769
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,500
Tell me.

770
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,515
All right.

771
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,518
All right.

772
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,442
I'll tell you.

773
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,500
No, Chora!
You're hurting me!

774
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,355
What's the matter?

775
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:05,862
You gotta be nicer to me,
or else

776
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:09,380
- I'll tell mei ling hwa the truth.
- What is this, blackmail?

777
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,680
You told me to find
a weakness.

778
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,792
You cunning little turd.

779
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,717
What do you want?

780
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,796
Get off of me!

781
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:27,018
Help me. please.

782
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,236
Hi, Chora.

783
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,112
Those are nice hair clips.
what are those, bumblebees?

784
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,253
Hornets.

785
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,324
You know god, Chora?
Well, He's sorta my boss.

786
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,410
And you see that boy
over there?

787
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,202
God told me

788
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,956
you're not being
very nice to him.

789
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,177
And god is so disappointed.

790
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,295
So from now on, He wants
you two to be friends.

791
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:57,980
Otherwise you're gonna burn
in hell for eternity,

792
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,419
and eternity's
a very long time.

793
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:05,434
Are we clear?

794
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:07,914
Good girl.

795
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,580
So i'm assuming you met
our friend--Mr. Templeton?

796
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,180
Yes, i did.

797
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,980
And what did he have
to say?

798
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,780
Well, you were right.

799
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,988
He put the elder file
together for dad.

800
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,200
Yeah, i figured.

801
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,347
To your good health.

802
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,200
Cheers.

803
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,680
So what do you think?

804
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,890
Be honest.

805
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,422
My father was working
for someone else.

806
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,405
Could it be that "c"
that was in his calendar?

807
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:04,053
I don't know. Maybe.

808
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,034
But he was gathering
that information for someone.

809
00:39:08,163 --> 00:39:10,497
And Templeton stopped helping
when he found out about it.

810
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:11,680
So that dossier,

811
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,990
all that information
on Simon Elder,

812
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,671
that wasn't just Dutch
doing... diligent work

813
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,823
on my behalf?

814
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,200
No, it doesn't look like it.

815
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,380
He was gathering information
about you as well.

816
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,823
- About me?
- Yeah.

817
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,080
- I'm sorry.
- Why? You didn't do it.

818
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,900
- I know, but he--
- No, you're you.

819
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:45,240
and you're good.
that's true.

820
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,254
Well...

821
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:52,776
Anything happen
while i was gone?

822
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,316
Nothing unexpected.

823
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,746
Things continue
to reveal themselves.

824
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,550
Reality.

825
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,627
I like looking
at the stars because...

826
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,254
You know, they're so...

827
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,029
Hot and fiery
and explosive,

828
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,880
but it feels totally safe
and totally exciting

829
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,580
all at the same time,
you know?

830
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,700
I never thought a girl
could make me feel that way.

831
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:37,751
But you do.

832
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,800
Looking at you is like
looking at the stars.

833
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:49,380
You make me feel like i'm--
i'm a part of everything,

834
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,000
like i have a place.

835
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:55,101
Are you being for real?

836
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,857
Natalie, i'm "for realer"
with you

837
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:01,774
than i've ever been
with anybody.

838
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,944
Me, too.

839
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,324
Maybe we're in love.

840
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,621
I think we are.

841
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,080
Jeremy.

842
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeah.

843
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,482
I'm pregnant.

844
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
That's wet.

845
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:56,466
Nicholas George?

846
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Yeah.

847
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,900
Simon Elder.

848
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,100
Want to go for a ride?

849
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,420
Sure.
