1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,400
Change. Please change.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,820
Oh,please don't let me be pregnant.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,660
Not the answer l was looking for.

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,430
- Karen.
- Nick. Hey. Hello. Hi.

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,060
Hey. Look,l'm sorry to barge in,but
your mother said l could wake you up.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,370
l guess l'm a little late.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,430
- You're not the only one.
- What

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,240
- What
- Are you okay

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,680
l'm fine. l'm excellent. Why

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,650
- Come here.
- Why

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,210
- What are you doing this weekend
- l don't know. Why

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,780
Well,l thought we could
drive up to the Berkshires.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,290
l booked a suite at the Elm Court.

14
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,290
Oh! Oh!

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,460
- This weekend is not ideal for me.
- Okay.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,590
- What about next weekend
- How about next month

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,540
Next month Boy,wow,that's... Wow,we
really are taking things slow.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,540
l know. lt's good. Let's
shoot for next month.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,880
- Okay. Next month it is.
- Perfect. lt's gonna be sexy.

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,080
It doesn't make any sense.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,210
Why would Simon pick you,out
of all the people in the world,

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,780
to help him fake his own death

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,690
Who cares why Simon picked me

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
What matters is,once l do
it,you will get your brother back

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,230
from wherever Simon's
got him hidden away,

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,720
and l will be your big kahuna.

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,000
That's all l'm thinking about.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,130
And all l'm thinking about
is that this is a trap.

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,370
Look,l know that you
wanna be Action Jeremy,

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,900
but you are world
- famous for being a party boy.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,340
You managed to fool everyone
with your fake amnesia,

32
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,710
but you're not Jason Bourne.

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,350
Hey,l am whoever l need to
be to help the woman l love.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,460
- What are you doing here
- Karen,l'm sorry.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,800
l didn't mean to scare you. l
was just on my way to see Tripp.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,200
Your father and l are hosting
a gathering tomorrow night.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,370
Rolling out our biofuel.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,150
- Listen,is this a bad time
- Oh,any time l see you is a bad time.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,670
Come on,Karen. You're not
still holding a grudge,are you

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,250
Why,because you sold me to my own
father on my wedding day Heck,no.

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,810
Okay,Karen,it all
worked out for the best.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,820
l've got half of the
company and you have Nick.

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,960
Hey,listen,if you wanna let
yourself off the hook,go ahead,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,930
but don't expect me to join you.

45
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,060
You may be able to forget little
things like ruining my life,

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,130
but l'm never going to,because,you
see,Simon,for me it's not over.

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,900
l'm gonna remember what you
did to me every single day

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,040
for the rest of my life.

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,310
l was that important to you l
mean,you got married four times.

50
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,790
l was that important to you

51
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,220
There's not something going on
here you're not telling me,is there

52
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,430
Karen,it's time for our...

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Why,Mr. Elder. Hello.

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,340
- Hello,Letitia.
- Hello.

55
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,600
- Are you all right
- Yeah,l'm fine.

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,770
Let's just get out of here.

57
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,210
- Hey,wifey. What's cooking
- Not much.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,980
l'm working on my sermon for Sunday.

59
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,190
The text is First
Corinthians,Chapter 1 3.

60
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,260
You know ''Love is
patient. Love is kind.

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,230
''Love endures all...'' What

62
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,470
So how does that work when you say
a prayer at a state dinner,anyway

63
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,140
l mean,when you went down
to Washington last week

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,940
to perform the benediction
at Patrick's state dinner,

65
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,350
and you looked out over
all those powerful heads,

66
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,910
what exactly did you say

67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,080
- l started with,''Dear Lord.''
- Really

68
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,760
You sure it wasn't,''Oh,baby,you
look so hot''

69
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,590
What's your problem

70
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,560
This.

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,070
What,you wanna have sex This
isn't exactly setting a mood.

72
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,910
l found it in your suitcase.
What was it doing there

73
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,810
You know what l don't care.

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,040
Go and use it with somebody
else. l want you out of here. Now.

75
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,250
Wait a minute. You can't
throw me out of my own house.

76
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh,yeah l already cleared it
with your mother,babycakes.

77
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,890
Watch me.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,390
Oh,Maria,could you please
pack Mr. Darling's condoms

79
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,100
He's moving out.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Dr. Louis' office,please hold.

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,470
When you're feeling up to it,

82
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,640
l'm gonna have dinner
brought in from Artisanal.

83
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,410
- Osso buco.
- Hmm.

84
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,780
The only thing l'm gonna
want once l'm feeling up to it

85
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,350
is an extremely dry triple martini.

86
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,360
And a time machine so l can
go back to the day l met Simon

87
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,520
and stop this whole baby
mess before it started.

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,260
You're doing the right thing,dear.

89
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,140
Karen Darling,the
doctor will see you now.

90
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,980
So there should be a pretty
impressive turnout tomorrow.

91
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,540
The Port Authority is sending
people,Coastal Commissioner...

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,210
- And the press
- All the journalists

93
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,450
who at one time or another
came out against the biofuel

94
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,080
have kindly rethought their positions.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,220
So it looks like we're ready
to roll this baby out,gentlemen.

96
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,350
- Yeah. Almost.
- Almost There's a problem

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,860
Well,the partnership agreement
between the two of you

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,960
has obviously been executed,but we
are still waiting on your signature

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,460
on the final transfer of the biofuel
patent to Darling Enterprises.

100
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,010
Oh,yeah,right. Well,that
was an oversight.

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,210
So just put the papers together,Nick,and
l'll gladly sign it over.

102
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,980
- All right. l'll do it later today.
- Good.

103
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,620
Tripp,l am proud to have you as my
partner,regardless of how it began.

104
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
- Nick.
- Simon.

105
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,150
All right. Take care,guys.

106
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,060
What's up

107
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,070
Mr. Elder is about to part company with

108
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,200
hundreds and hundreds
of millions of dollars.

109
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,040
l think,under those circumstances,

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,880
that he's being
extraordinarily accommodating.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,540
l have to say,l agree.

112
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,050
- Well,perhaps we should find out why.
- Done.

113
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,550
Knock,knock.

114
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,900
Congressman Watley.

115
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,160
Sit,please.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,970
l didn't know you were in New York City.

117
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,570
Yeah,wife and kids are
in town for a few days,

118
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,810
want to do a little shopping,kick
- start the old economy,you know

119
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,250
Senator,look,l wanted
to stop by and apologize

120
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,380
for the way we left
things the other day.

121
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,480
l realize that l misunderstood
your interest in me.

122
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,590
That's all right. lt's fine.

123
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,860
l do hope that you'll take
the fact that l made an advance

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,600
as nothing more than a
compliment,which is what it was.

125
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,570
- Thank you.
- Anyway,if you are interested,

126
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,870
l would love to have dinner.

127
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,210
Congressman,l've already
told you that l'm not...

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,480
To discuss Darling Enterprises'
new biofuel initiative,Senator.

129
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,550
You still do need the support
of the Energy Committee,don't you

130
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,920
- No.
- No

131
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,620
- Yes,l mean,of course,yes.
- Yes.

132
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,860
And we appreciate that
support,Congressman,absolutely.

133
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,060
Good.

134
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,270
Okay,l'll check my schedule,and
l'll have my office be in touch.

135
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,770
You do that.

136
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,440
- Are you sure you're all right
- Yeah,l'm fine.

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,670
l'm just... l'm a little shaky.

138
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,210
- What exactly went wrong
- Nothing. l just...

139
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,980
You know,l couldn't go through with it.

140
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,580
Oh,Mom,please don't
make a drama out of this.

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,720
Well,certainly not,dear. When have
you ever known me to make a drama

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,200
No,we'll get you home
and draw you a bath,

143
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,530
- and then we'll figure something out.
- l just...

144
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,540
l hate now that Simon is forever
gonna be a part of my life.

145
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,470
- Oh,he won't be,dear. l promise.
- Ma'am.

146
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,670
- Thank you.
- lt'll all be just fine.

147
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,310
Oh,my. lt's really coming down.

148
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,320
Not a good day for an abortion.

149
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,440
Here,l'll get it.

- Brian.
- Well,don't look so happy to see me.

You going somewhere

- Wait,wait,wait a minute.

157

now that you're down a wife.

159

- Lucky bastard.
- Wait a minute. What happened

160
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,090
Andrea kicked me out. She
found out about me and Mei Ling.

161
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,590
Well,you didn't even
sleep with Mei Ling.

162
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah,l know. She found an
unopened rubber in my suitcase.

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,860
Well,we got to explain things to her.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,900
That's ironic,huh

165
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,170
l went down there to have safe sex with my ex
- wife,

166
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,900
l don't have any,and l still get busted.

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,710
What are you doing

168
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,340
There is another bedroom in
this little doll house,right

169
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,220
Yeah,there's Kiki's,but she uses it.

170
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,620
- Okay,good. You stay there.
- Brian,come on. This is New York City.

171
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,320
There are dozens of great
hotels,many of which your family owns.

172
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
And l have a position to uphold,

173
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,770
not only as a Darling
but as a man of the cloth.

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,740
l check in someplace,and it's
gonna be all over Page Six.

175
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,840
Come on,help a half
- brother out.

176
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,810
All right,fine.

177
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,080
An invitation to dinner. What
possible harm could come from that

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,490
lt's a date,Dad. A man
- date.

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,560
You've made your
feelings clear,haven't you

180
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,160
You've established your
orientation. Have you not

181
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,760
Yeah,well,he's not the kind of
gay that takes no for an answer.

182
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,900
Guy.

183
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Guy.

184
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,510
l'm sorry. l'm just
a little rattled here.

185
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,310
You just calm down.

186
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,750
l mean,look,there's
got to be some other way

187
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,340
we can push this through the committee.

188
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
We've got other contacts
in Washington,right

189
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,910
Of course we do,but at this point,

190
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,820
Representative Watley is
still our most prominent,

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,820
our most vehemently vocal critic.

192
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,850
lf we could have his vote,

193
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,200
if we can have his public support
at the rollout tomorrow night,

194
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
that would be invaluable.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,800
But what if he gets tipsy and he
starts putting the moves on me again

196
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
- Then what
- Come on.

197
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,010
lt's a crowded restaurant.

198
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,210
Do the best you can,would
you,Patrick Please.

199
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,080
My car blew up and l was
standing 20 feet away.

200
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,110
Yeah,right,accidents happen.

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,650
But,see,when my private investigator
finds weapons- grade C- 4

202
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,160
mixed in with the
remains of my bodyguard,

203
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,290
the old ''accidents happen'' theory
kind of goes boom out the window.

204
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,940
No,l'm not accusing you. l'm
asking you an honest question.

205
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,240
Okay,okay. Okay.

206
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,040
lf you say you weren't
behind it,then... l'm sorry.

207
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,050
l am. l said...

208
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,660
- Problems Who was that
- Don't you worry about it.

209
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,560
Now,what are you doing here

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,360
The question is what
are you doing with Jeremy

211
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,360
Oh!

212
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,970
He told you our plan.

213
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,080
Well,it's very simple really. He wants
to be your knight in shining armor.

214
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,950
You want your brother,and l have
a need to make a graceful exit.

215
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,220
- Saw the opportunity for some synergy.
- l know you,Simon.

216
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,320
Your brand of synergy
profits no one but you.

217
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,230
Find someone else to help you
with your little exit strategy.

218
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,320
Look,Nola,l'll admit Jeremy's not an
obvious choice for this kind of project,

219
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,460
but things are difficult right now.
l'm not sure l can trust my own people.

220
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,010
And Jeremy's commitment to finding
your brother is strong,to say the least.

221
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,530
No,he's the man for the job.

222
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,780
Unless you have someone else in mind.

223
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,010
Son of a bitch. So that's
your plan all along,right

224
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,080
Compromise Jeremy as a
way of forcing me to do it

225
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
ls that your way of saying yes

226
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,160
Tell me where my brother
is right now,and l'll do it.

227
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,160
Yeah,okay. Nola,listen to me.

228
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,100
When my death is reported
on an encrypted page

229
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,400
of The New York Times web site,a
file on this drive will open,

230
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,380
disclosing your brother's
location. Not until.

231
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,640
Go on.

232
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,120
All right. Here's a
schematic of my building.

233
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
This...

234
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,820
Come here. All right.

235
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,090
The whole shebang will
go down tomorrow night,

236
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,620
after the roll
- out of my biofuel.

237
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,360
By midnight tomorrow,you
will have your brother,

238
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,900
and l will be,for all
intents and purposes,dead.

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,640
- Nola Lyons.
- Nick George.

240
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,390
What are you doing coming
out of Simon Elder's building

241
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh,l was just making sure
all the ''l's'' were dotted

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,560
and the ''T's'' were
crossed for tomorrow night.

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,760
l wanted to assure Simon

244
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,770
that his biofuel has Patrick's long
- term support.

245
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,790
And you came all the way across town
to deliver that message in person

246
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,500
- That's quite a commitment.
- Well,the job demands nothing less.

247
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,800
You of all people should
know that. Excuse me.

248
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,570
- So where do l sign
- Here.

249
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,970
Here and here.

250
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,540
Wow. Ten years of hard
work has finally paid off.

251
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,110
So what if l have to share the
credit with Tripp Darling,right

252
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,920
The world's a better
place,and l'm a satisfied man.

253
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,130
- And you must be,too.
- What do you mean

254
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Unless l'm mistaken,l think
congratulations are in order.

255
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,970
l'd suggest we have a cigar,

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,340
but l don't think you're really a cigar
- smoking kind of guy.

257
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,240
What are you talking about

258
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,250
- Karen hasn't told you
- Hasn't told me what

259
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,720
You know what l'll let
her tell you herself.

260
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,810
The last thing l want
is to ruin the surprise.

261
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,180
Karen,come out of there.

262
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,760
l had Maria make some whoopie
pies,chocolate and pumpkin,your favorite.

263
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,060
Come out.

264
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,760
What am l gonna do

265
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,400
- Well,do you wanna have the baby
- This baby,this way

266
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,810
l mean,God,Mom,Nick and l,we were
finally on the verge of something,

267
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,750
and now l'm pregnant with my crazy ex
- boyfriend's baby.

268
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,280
No,l don't wanna have this baby.

269
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,930
- So do you want...
- No. No,l can't do that,either.

270
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,300
l mean,what if this is my only chance

271
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,280
Well,then your options are severely
limited. You can only be unhappy.

272
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,050
- So,what are you gonna do
- l don't know. l just... l don't know.

273
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,230
Being rich doesn't protect
you from anything,does it

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,430
No,dear. lt doesn't. Not at all.

275
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,030
- Patrick.
- Charles.

276
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,410
l am so glad that you could make it.

277
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,310
- And you must be...
- This is my wife.

278
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,650
This is Dana. This is Patrick.

279
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,640
l've heard wonderful things. You
have my Charles under a spell.

280
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,860
- Lovely to meet you.
- Please,sit down.

281
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,120
So the kids are at the
hotel with the nanny.

282
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,860
- They're watching a movie,so...
- l crashed. l hope you don't hate me.

283
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,530
Not at all. More the merrier.

284
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,090
What the hell's going on
You went behind my back

285
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,040
l am not gonna let Simon hurt you.

286
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,060
- l can take care of myself.
- No,you can't.

287
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,800
Simon walked me through the plan,

288
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,870
the broken window pane in the sub
- basement,

289
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,540
the code that supposedly
disables the security cameras.

290
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,810
My guess is that it goes
straight to the police.

291
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,180
He's trying to frame you.

292
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,490
Okay,fine,let's say it's a set
- up. Then why is you being the rat

293
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,960
in Simon Elder's maze any better than me

294
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,550
A,l know my way around that
building better than you do.

295
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,530
- Okay.
- B,his people know me.

296
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,730
lf they catch me,l can
justify my presence.

297
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,600
- That's true.
- And C,it's just the way it has to be.

298
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,160
Okay l lost my father to Simon.

299
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,270
l've nearly lost my brother.
l won't lose you,too.

300
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

301
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,890
Manufacturing this fuel is
safer than you think,Charles.

302
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,560
- The environmental impact studies...
- What,Patrick What

303
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,300
The environmental impact studies
that you're basing your statements on

304
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,740
don't tell the whole
story,not by a long shot.

305
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,910
What about the flash point

306
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,940
Yeah,what about the
flash point Sounds hot.

307
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,470
ls there any way that you
could push the flash point up

308
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,150
Yeah,can you push it up a bit,Pat

309
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,210
When something goes wrong,this
stuff burns like crazy,

310
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,750
and l'm not going to have
an uncontrollable blaze

311
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,130
at the foot of Manhattan.

312
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,130
Yeah,a blaze to the foot would be bad.

313
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,190
Boom.

314
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,380
Charles,my parents are hosting
a little soiree at their place

315
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,180
tomorrow night for
investors,potential partners.

316
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,980
We would love it if you two could come.

317
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,110
Well,then,maybe we will.

318
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,960
There's Jack. Jack!
l'll just be a second.

319
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,720
Charles,good to see you.

320
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,670
- What the hell are you doing
- l'm giving you a present,silly.

321
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,570
Your panties

322
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,110
What am l supposed to do with these

323
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,810
- Here you go.
- Thank you,Hannah.

324
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,650
Only the best steak in town,am l right

325
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,780
Hear,hear.

326
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,880
Sweetheart,l'm gonna have the
driver bring the car around,okay

327
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,790
- Okay.
- All right.

328
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,150
There's something
you'd like to say to me

329
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,220
My husband hasn't touched
me in over 10 years.

330
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Dana,stop it.

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,630
- Why
- Because l can't do this,

332
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,030
even though l would really like to.

333
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,230
Kiss me good night,please.

334
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,350
- That was a mistake.
- Best mistake l've made in years.

335
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,320
Here he comes.

336
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,560
Sweetheart,it is time
to hit the old road.

337
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,470
Don't forget tomorrow night,my
parents' place. Take care.

338
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,360
- Hi.
- Hi. l didn't see you there.

339
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,730
- Here l am.
- l got your message.

340
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,500
Sorry l didn't call you
back. lt's been a crazy day.

341
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,730
l see.

342
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,100
- Can we talk
- About what

343
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,340
About the good news.

344
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
Simon congratulated me,and
he mentioned good news

345
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,250
and cigars,and since l didn't know
what the hell he was talking about,

346
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,910
l thought maybe you could fill me in.

347
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,450
l'm pregnant.

348
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,650
Okay.

349
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,060
And you told him that the baby's mine

350
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,160
Because it's impossible.

351
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,730
- We haven't had sex.
- No,l didn't tell Simon anything.

352
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,170
- So,what He's just guessing about...
- l don't know.

353
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,340
Trust me,he's the last
person l would tell.

354
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,510
Because it's his,isn't it

355
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,510
- lt's Simon's baby.
- Yeah.

356
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,180
Why didn't you tell me l mean,don't
you think this is information

357
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,490
that l would find kind of relevant

358
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,550
Excuse me,l'm a little
freaked out right now,

359
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,830
and l'm pretty scared of
what this is gonna do to us.

360
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,700
- Can you do this with me
- Can l

361
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,760
l know. l know,honey.

362
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,500
lt's not easy,and l know this isn't
how something should start out.

363
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,350
But nothing we've ever done has
gone according to plan,has it

364
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,150
l've waited so long,Nick,you
know that,so long for us.

365
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,780
So have l,Karen. Look,l love you.

366
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,060
This is why l didn't tell you.

367
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,590
Well,this is a hell of a thing
for me to wrap my mind around.

368
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,730
Forgive me if l can't
just say yes immediately.

369
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,300
Okay.

370
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,970
Well,then,can you say yes ever

371
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,910
l don't know.

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,920
l'm sorry.

373
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,920
But l don't know.

374
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,570
Am I only dreamin'

375
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,890
Or is this burning

376
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,030
Brian.

377
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,970
An eternal flame...

378
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,400
- Brian!
- What

379
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,100
Take those damn things off. l beg you.

380
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,530
What do you want l was working.

381
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,810
Look,l had to listen to you sing
all night long. Just enough already.

382
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,080
Just helps me concentrate.
l'm working on this sermon.

383
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,920
Would you listen to this

384
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,650
lt's about love. ''Love
never seeks its own way.

385
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,990
- ''Love is...''
- What the hell is this

386
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,190
- lt's coffee. lt's your free- trade
swill. - Yeah,well,it tastes like bleach.

387
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,130
Well,l cleaned out the coffee maker
with bleach,'cause it was dirty.

388
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,690
This place is a pig sty.

389
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,100
Yeah,well,l'm sorry that l don't have a full
- time staff of cooks and maids

390
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,200
like you're used to at home,Brian.

391
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,300
Maybe you should have thought
of that before you invaded.

392
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,610
No,maybe you should have
frigging hired somebody!

393
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,670
Planning,Nick. lt's key!

394
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,310
- Look...
- Nick!

395
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,510
What

396
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,420
Will you talk to her for me

397
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,320
- Please Thanks.
- All right,l will,but...

398
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,390
Now,sometimes life surprises you

399
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,460
and creates a path where
there was never one before.

400
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,440
This partnership with Tripp
Darling,Darling Enterprises was,for me,

401
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,100
one such surprise.

402
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,700
So together,we thank you
for joining us tonight

403
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,240
to celebrate the launch of MPG 5000,

404
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,040
a 21 st century biofuel

405
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,280
which,with the help of visionary
friends here and in Washington,of course,

406
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,310
will be ready for production
at the end of the year.

407
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,820

What do you know about
Simon Elder and Nola Lyons

411
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,450
Nola works for Patrick,and
Simon works with Dad.

412
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,810
Are you sure she doesn't
have any ties with Simon

413
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,050
that pre
- exist both those relationships

414
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,320

416
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,820
- Look,l know you don't have amnesia.
- Come on. l do. l forget stuff.

417
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,390
Hey,hey,hey. We don't
have to discuss it. Okay

418
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,800
Just tell me the truth,is there a
connection between Nola and Simon

419
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,290
Okay. They might both be in
Oprah's Book Club together,

420
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,000
- but other than that,l don't know.
- Thanks a lot,Jeremy.

421
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,710
Congressman. Mrs. Watley. l'm
so glad you decided to attend.

We are,too.

423

Miss me

424
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,450
Hello,Congressman.

425
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,780
- Hello,Tripp.
- Mrs. Watley.

426
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,260
l'm so pleased that my son was able
to persuade you to join us tonight.

427
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,630
Happy to lend our support.
Timing is everything.

428
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,960
Well,if you could spare me a minute,

429
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,200
l'd like to introduce you
to my associate,Simon Elder.

430
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,930
Certainly. Certainly. You
can handle my wife,right

431
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,810
l'll do my best.

432
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,610
- Be back in a little bit,sweetie.
- Okay.

433
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,010
- Hey,there's my favorite girl.
- Hi,Nick. How's it going

434
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,420
You know he's moved in with me,right

435
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,860
Yeah,of course. He's
the father of my son.

436
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,350
- l need to know where he is.
- Just take him back.

437
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,730
Not on your life.

438
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,830
Andrea,look,nothing happened
between he and Mei Ling Hwa,l swear.

439
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,900
- l don't care,Nick.
- Well,l can't live with him,period.

440
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,170
Well,you're gonna have
to,because until Brian grows up

441
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,080
and realizes that
being in a relationship

442
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,350
doesn't mean zigzagging between
saving and betraying somebody,

443
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,450
but that it's actually about
being continually present

444
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,220
and continually faithful,l'm
not gonna take him back.

445
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,690
Andrea. All right,fine,but
he's going to a hotel,

446
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,250
because l don't care
what the papers say.

447
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,530
Nick,he could've always gone to
a hotel. The papers don't matter.

448
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't you get it

449
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,700
Of all the places in the
world that he could have run to

450
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,640
and of all the people,he chose you.

451
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,370
Yeah. Lucky me.

452
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,440
He's your half
- brother. Deal with him.

453
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,090
lt's very impressive. l'm looking forward to my next fill
- up.

454
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,660
Do not give me your panties here.

455
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,600
That's impossible. l'm not wearing any.

456
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,930
The Argyle Hotel. Room
909. Come see me later.

457
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,880
Everything but the
door will be wide open.

458
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,810
Whoa.

459
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,490

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,050
- l have a drink,thank you.
- Yeah,what is that

461
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,790
Mmm.

462
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,170
Ginger ale. That's interesting.

463
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,900
Yeah,l'm trying to stay sober so l
don't do something foolish like kill you.

464
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,940
- Excuse me.
- So how far along are we Six weeks

465
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,350
Oh! lnto our breakup l don't know.
Honestly,l haven't been keeping track.

466
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,010
How far are we into
our pregnancy Come here.

467
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,990
How did you know

468
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,500
l didn't. Not for certain.
Not until just now.

469
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,830
l mean,l figured it wasn't
Nick's,given his reaction.

470
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,030
So,what were you thinking

471
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,410
That you were gonna have this
baby and l would never find out

472
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,970
Simon,you broke my heart.

473
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,650
- Why don't you just leave me alone
- Because things have changed.

474
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,080
You're pregnant with my baby,and
you tried to hide it from me.

475
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,090
This changes everything.

476
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,760
l'm not gonna let you within
1 0 feet of this baby,Simon.

477
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,770
See,sweetheart,that's
not your decision to make.

478
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,710
l swear to you,no matter where
you go,no matter what you do,

479
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,470
l'll always be a part
of this baby's life,

480
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,110
and there's nothing you or
your family can do to stop me.

481
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,150
Nothing.

482
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,780
Where's Nola

483
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,930
Don't worry. She'll be
at your place,1 1 :00.

484
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,360
- You'll get dead. Don't worry.

What,you just wanna be maimed

486

l'm calling it off. Tell your girl.

488
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,280
Wait a second. l thought
you needed to flee.

489
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,640

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,880
- that makes me need to stick around.

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,980
- God,she's a bitch.
- Look,she's not a bitch,Brian.

498
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,180
You just...

499
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,650
You hurt her feelings,and
now she doesn't trust you.

500
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,950
Hey,l know this is unorthodox,but
you are a man of the cloth.

501
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,950
- Can l confide in you
- Well,you can give it a shot. We'll see.

502
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,890
Come here.

503
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,270
Karen's pregnant.

504
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,240
- Holy...
- Yeah,l know.

505
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,640
- And it's yours
- No.

506
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,280
Well,whose is it

507
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,780
Well,l guess it could be
half the Fortune 500's,right

508
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,910
- lt's Simon Elder's.
- Oh,man,give me a...

509
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,720
Hey,Brian,and she still
wants me to be with her.

510
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,230
What And raise the devil's spawn

511
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,230
Yeah. Something like that.

512
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,000
Well,you know,l seem to remember
when our plane was about to crash,

513
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,470
you did say something to
her about being the one.

514
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,370
Look,l thought we were gonna die,Brian.

515
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,040
But was it true

516
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,540
Yeah. lt was true.

517
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,050
- You know what the Good Book says.
- What

518
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,580
Love is patient. Love is kind.

519
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,950
- Love endures all things.
- Love endures all things.

520
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,260
My guess is it at least tries.

521
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,010
l'll see you at home.

522
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,410
Great news.

523
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,440
- Tell me. - We got
the stand- down order.

524
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,310
l just got word from Simon.

525
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,190
He's like Scrooge on Christmas
morning,bubbling with life.

526
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,620
- What did he say,exactly
- He called the whole thing off.

527
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,820
No fake break
- in. No fake kidnapping. No fake murder. Done.

528
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,930
Let's go back to my room and celebrate.

529
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,990
- Wait,no,this doesn't make any sense.
- What

530
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,770
My brother. This is my
only chance to get him back.

531
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,000
His plan may be off,but
mine is still on.

532
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,170
- Okay. Then l'm coming with you.
- No,you're not.

533
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,240
Yes,l am.

534
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,010
Look,Nick is out there asking
questions,and Simon is a freak.

535
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,850
l'm not gonna let
something bad happen to you.

536
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,950
l'm not saying you can't be Lara Croft.
Just let me be your Terry Sheridan.

537
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,480
Who

538
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,760
- Congressman.
- Senator. Great party.

539
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,970
Thank you. Got a minute

540
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Look,Patrick,if this is about your
little biofuel thing,don't worry about it.

541
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,140
- You got my vote.
- l know that,

542
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,470
and we are all very
grateful to you for that.

543
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,510
But seeing as how we're
both on the same side now,

544
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,080
- l just don't really know how to...
- Hey,spit it out.

545
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,760
- lt's about your wife.
- What about my wife

546
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,830
The other night,at dinner,um,

547
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,900
she kissed me,and it
was all very innocent,

548
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,530
and,l,of course,l
stopped her right away,

549
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,900
but l just wanted you to...

550
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,310
- l'm sorry.
- l am serious.

551
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,400
l don't want this to become a problem.

552
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,170
No,Senator,l know that you're serious,

553
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,010
but believe me,this,this
is not a problem.

554
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,820
What are you saying

555
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,620
Dana and l love each
other very much. All right

556
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,060
We're partners in every aspect
of our lives except for one,

557
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,030
so we have a little arrangement.

558
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,300
Now,if we meet a great guy
that she and l both like,

559
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,800
we hope that maybe he likes one of us.

560
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,860
Now,you obviously were not into me,

561
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,640
so Dana and l had a little
talk about it and figured...

562
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,670
What are you telling me You
want me to sleep with your wife

563
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,140
She gave you the key
to the hotel room,right

564
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,080
- Right
- Yeah.

565
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,890
You use that key,Senator,

566
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,520
because l certainly

567
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,320
will not be sleeping there tonight.

568
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,420
Karen.

569
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,800
What do you want What do you want What

570
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,100
Hey. Hey,what is wrong What happened

571
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,730
Simon knows the baby's his,and he
says he's not gonna leave me alone.

572
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,640
He wants to be a part of the
baby's life no matter what,

573
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,500
and l don't even know
what l want anymore.

574
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,710
Hey,calm down. Karen,please,just stop.

575
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,310
Nick,this is not your
problem. You said so yourself.

576
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,610
Well,l also said that l love you,

577
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,480
and l do,and l wanna help. So
let me take care of this for you.

578
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,050
Hey,l can take care of this.

579
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,920
- What are you gonna do
- l will talk to Simon,

580
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,430
and l will let him know that it is in
his best interest to stay the hell away.

581
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,840
All right

582
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,210
Can't figure out the access code.
''Swan'' doesn't seem to work.

583
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,080
Try ''jewelry.''

584
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,710
l didn't bring you
along for comic relief.

585
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,050
l need to open up a video
link with my brother,

586
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,650
so that we can find out
where he is and then...

587
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,590
Jeremy,hide.

588
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,400
What are you doing here

589
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,700
Your idiot boyfriend didn't
give you my message,did he

590
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,400
My brother,where is he

591
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,180
Okay,you made a mistake in
coming here,a big mistake.

592
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,080
How you gonna come...

593
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,310

- There's hope for you yet.
- Nola.

602
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,560
Bottom of the drawer comes out.

603
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,200
l found it. l found the access code.

604
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,890

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,940
Dana,l've been going through
a bit of a tough time lately.

607
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,580
l recently lost my wife,as you know,

608
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,210
and someone else to whom l was

609
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,690
very close.

610
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,490
And,look,l know l came all the way here,

611
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,730
but l just... l don't know

612
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,670
if l'm ready for something like this.

613
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,810
lt's okay. You don't
need to explain,Patrick.

614
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,680
Thank you.

615
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,380
lt's just sex.

616
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,190
Here we go.

617
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,400
Listen...

618
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,980
Come on. Hurry up. We
got to get out of here

619
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,210
before his Russian
circus freaks show up.

620
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,410
lt's processing.

621
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,120
You know,for a computer gazillionaire,your
lnternet is surprisingly slow.

622
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,960
lt's coming on. Something's happening.
Oh,my God. Justin! Justin! lt's him.

623
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,490
Hello? Nola,is that you?

624
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,730
Hi. Hi. Are you all right

Oh,my God! Oh,my God.

- What the hell just happened,Simon
- l have no idea.

627
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,000
He must have been in a
hurry to get somewhere.

628
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,940
Where is he Tell me

629

632
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,200
Oh,jeez. Jeez Louise. This is not good.

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,360
