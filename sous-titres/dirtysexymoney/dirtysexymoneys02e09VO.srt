1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,480
they're often criticized for the reckless way they live their lives,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,490
ruling over manhatn from their ivory tower,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,860
untouchable, immortal.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,140
It's only when disaster strikes that the world is reminded...

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,140
even the darlings are human.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,660
Tonight, nearly a month after patrick darling's tragic senatorial inauguration,

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,070
the family, in an effort to set the record straight,

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,470
has agreed to talk about that day's events and the grievous aftermath.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,510
Do youwhnow y chase alexander came looking for you that day?

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,800
he was angry, I guess.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,490
I'd dealt with him briefly in legal matters for the family.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,580
He was--is-- a very confused man.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,210
Upon reaching new yo's historic federal hall,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,690
chase alexander, patrick darling's brother-in-law, fired four bullets.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,510
In the confusion, jeremy darling hit his head

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,480
and was later diagnosed with amnesia.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,860
When the doctor told me that we'd have to work with him to recover his memory,

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,210
I was terrified.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,320
You know, jeremy wasn't the--the fastest learner the first time around.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,010
the first bullet grazed your shoulder.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,400
What was that like?

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,060
It hurt...

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,000
a lot.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,260
The next two bullets sailed harmlessly away

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,760
before alexander was himself gunned down by an actual nypd officer, ty lopez.

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,720
If chase alexander wasn't in a coma right now at st.Benjamin's,

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,900
and he were watching this broadcast,

28
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,930
what would you say to him?

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,560
I would say it has been a long journey back

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,830
from that difficult day,

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,380
and on behalf of all the darlings,

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,900
our thoughts are with him and his family.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,540
A difficult day indeed,

34
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,090
because alexander's fourth bullet found a target,

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,110
albeit, an unintentional one,

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,760
and took an innocent life.

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,400
So who was she, senator?

38
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,780
Who was carmelita rainer?

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,050
She was a dear family friend.

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,010
she was a-a lovely person.

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,810
Truly lovely.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,560
it was me who invited her to attend the inauguration.

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,020
I'm thinking of jackie O.,

44
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,640
What she said...

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,190
after J.F.K.'S assassination.

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,220
"Now he is a legend

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,090
when he would have preferred to be a man."

48
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,960
That's right.

49
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,270
Now carmelita is a legend

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,480
when she would've preferred to be a woman.

51
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,340
We all miss her greatly.

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,770
I swear, they rerun that thing more than "the beverly hillbillies."

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,690
I want to disappear.

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,740
Well, that's why I chose this place, 'cause it's always empty.

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,770
Yeah, I can taste why.

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,770
- Nick...
- Yeah.

57
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,660
What happens when chase wakes up?

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,980
He's been in a coma for five weeks.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,290
I know, but if he does wake up, he could go after you, right?

60
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,830
Or me or patrick or daddy or any--

61
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,500
karen, karen, he's not coming after you because he's not waking up.

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,720
- Okay?
- Okay.

63
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,520
I told you, it's over.

64
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,110
okay.
Well...

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,090
you know, there is, um,

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,160
there is something else you're not gonna want to talk about.

67
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,460
Try me.

68
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,490
Now that I'm single again,

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,560
and you're about to be, um,

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,210
there's this little issue of us.

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,320
Karen, I am just coming out of a 10-year marriage.

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,350
I have a custody mediation with lisa today.

73
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,420
And kiki is convinced that she's never gonna see me again.

74
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,020
Throttle down.Nick, I was just going to suggest...that we be friends.

75
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,540
Friends?We are friends.

76
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,450
no, just friends.

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,990
- Oh, just friends.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,280
When have we ever been just friends?

79
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,820
We were just frien for three minutes once, the day we met,

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,010
and then I fell in love with you, but I for one, this time,

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,320
would commit not to fall in love with you.

82
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,970
- Just friends?
- Just friends.

83
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,800
tripp, what can I do for you?

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,650
What about chase?
What's his status?

85
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,350
Well, the doctors plan to take him off life support on friday

86
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,360
in accordance with his living will.

87
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,470
Why?I got a call from the chief administrator at st.Benjamin's

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,390
saying that chase's wife janine was making some noise.

89
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,420
About fighting his living will.

90
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,120
I mean, she's obviously distraught.
I suspect she's overwhelmed with guilt.

91
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,340
She left him at the height of his mental breakdown, walked out.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,230
- She doesn't want to let him go.
- No.

93
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,080
Well, carmelita's parents did not want to let r go.

94
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,680
Dad, please keep carmelita out of this.

95
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,870
There's nothing we can do to bring her back.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,810
No.

97
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,500
Janine...

98
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,340
doesn't have a leg to stand on legally.

99
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,560
So...

100
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,210
she's just not doing herself or the children a favor by

101
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,890
prolonging this misery.

102
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,140
I'll stop by the hospital later today after my mediation with lisa.

103
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,790
That'll be good.
Thanks, nick.

104
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,720
- Doggy.
- Yes.

105
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,740
Which doggy?

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,770
midas.

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,450
Hey!
GuY.

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,700
Nick, right?
Nick.

109
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,530
That's right.
Welcome home.

110
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,410
Nick george.

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,830
He helps me do stuff.
Call him anytime,

112
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,920
- day or night.
- very good.

113
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,960
You've definitely improved since I saw you at the hospital.

114
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,480
E neurologist said he has a very unusual case, but...

115
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,920
we're still hoping for a full recovery.

116
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,850
Well, I'm sure it'll all work out.

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,710
- Hang in there, jeremy.
- Bye, dick.

118
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,000
- Nick.
- Nick, right.

119
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,100
You've gotta be kidding.

120
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,810
You want 50% custody?

121
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,300
In our case, I think that a 50-50 custody arrangement is appropriate.

122
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,770
You work for a guy

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,690
who you used to be pretty convinced killed your father.

124
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,960
Your definition of what's appropriate doesn't count much.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,090
Look, no one said divorcwas easy.

126
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,770
Let's just try and stay focused on the custody of your daughter.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,660
Lisa, I know you think I'm a good father.

128
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,350
It wasn't that long ago you suggested we have another baby.

129
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,130
That was before I really knew you.

130
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,310
After over ten years of marriage, you didn't really know me?

131
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,630
The important question is what's going to be best for kiki.

132
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,760
All right.

133
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,240
You want kiki 50% of the time, prove you can handle it.

134
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,270
Happy to.

135
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm going to miami tomrow to meet with christo,

136
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,950
and kiki was going to stay with my mom,

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,590
but you can take her for the weekend.

138
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,300
If things go smoothly, we'll talk.

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,610
Fair enough?

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,070
Fair enough.

141
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,700
It's so nice to be back in a regular bed

142
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,790
and out of that hospital.

143
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,160
Well, the shrimp's happy to have you home.

144
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,160
What do you think about maine?

145
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,820
As a state?

146
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,540
I mean for the future.

147
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,380
For us.

148
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm not saying tomorrow,

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,750
but we can think about these things now.

150
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm healthy, and we have a long life ahead of us...

151
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,590
a very...

152
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,120
very...

153
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,140
long life.

154
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,950
I-I know.

155
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,860
hello.

156
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,270
What do you want?

157
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,860
- My name is nick george.
- I know who you are.

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,810
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you,

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,600
but your husband didn't want to live like this.

160
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,400
My husband didn't really know what he wanted

161
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,400
once he got involved with the darlings.

162
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,630
the longer you let him linger in this...

163
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,630
twilight,

164
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,030
the longer it stays in the papers

165
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,530
and the longer your children are gonna have to deal with it every day.

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,490
Well, what if he's still in there?

167
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,440
You know, what if there's a chce he could come back?

168
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,660
He would spend the rest of his life in jail.

169
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,420
Is that what you want?

170
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,670
Life is still life, even in jail.He--

171
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,560
he could watch our girls grow up.He...

172
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,880
the darlings killed your father, mr. George.

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,590
Everyone knows it.

174
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,740
So how could you come here and help them do the same thing to my husband?

175
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Ms. Alexander,

176
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,940
janine,

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,560
I am sorry...

178
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,650
but he's gone.

179
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,700
Let him go.

180
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,600
I know.

181
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,390
I know.
You're right.I'M...

182
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,910
I just have to talk to my girls before--

183
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,590
chase?

184
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,180
oh, my god.
Honey.

185
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,320
Chase.

186
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,300
He's awake!

187
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,110
He's awake.

191
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,660
He opened his eyes.
Oh, god.

192
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,800
They remained open for a minute and a half, and then he went back into the coma.

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,940
The doctors aren't sure if he was actually conscious.

194
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,500
No, it was a reflex, a nerve.

195
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,340
Well, probably, but it doesn't matter now.

196
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,080
She's gotten a lawyer and she's filing suit.

197
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,220
To what end?

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,410
To nullify the living will.

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,710
Oh.

200
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,750
What can we do about that?

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,200
Well, I...could offer to represent the hospital.

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,640
Their right to pull the plug.

203
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah.

204
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,720
- Nick.
- What?

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,800
You okay with that?

206
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,020
you know, chase killed carmelita.
He could've killed me.

207
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,070
He broke into my house, attacked your daughter.

208
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,590
Could've been my daughter in there.

209
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,160
I don't have a problem with it.

210
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,290
I'll call the hospital and set it up for you.

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
Thank you.

212
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,390
We're expecting over 200 parishioners tomorrow tonight.

213
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,880
200 parishioners for "meet the pastor" night?

214
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,260
Don't these people have friggin' televisions?

215
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,110
well, it's not often a minister of your renown returns to the pulpit, brian.

216
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,500
Everyone wants to meet you.

217
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,580
No, they don't want to meet me.

218
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,330
They want a chance to gawk at my relatives.

219
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,820
So they are coming, your family?

220
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,190
Why?

221
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,050
You want to alert "page six"?

222
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,380
no.

223
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,490
I'd like to thank them.

224
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,520
We needed $1.6 million to finish paying for our pipe organ.

225
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,540
Yesterday, that exact amount was donated in your honor.

226
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,480
By whom?

227
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, the donor was anonymous, but

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm re we can both guess who it is.

229
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,080
Yeah.

230
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,830
- I'm sure we both can.
- tell me why.

231
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,320
Why can't you and mom be together?

232
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,940
I asked mommy, and she said she loves you,

233
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,210
that she'll always love you.

234
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,180
Right, I will always love your mom.

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,030
But it's just, sometimes for some reason, we do things to hurt each other,

236
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,720
and it's not good for us.

237
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,330
But most importantly, we know it's not good for you.

238
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,300
But I'll only see you every couple of days,

239
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,150
and that's not good for me.

240
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,280
I know.
I know it's hard.

241
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,740
And I'll only stay with u, like, every other weekend.

242
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,140
Yeah, but that's-- that's just for now.That will change.

243
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,370
What if you fall in love with someone else and move to, like, germany or something?

244
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,410
Dad, I'd never see you again.

245
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,910
Kiki, I'm not moving to germany.

246
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,890
All right?Now just listen to me.

247
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,030
Your mom and I, we are...

248
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,000
we're going through some challenging times.

249
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,800
But I love you more than anything.

250
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,350
I will always be your dad, and that's a promise.

251
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,190
All right?And I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.

252
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,630
I'm not going to germany.
I'm not going to france.

253
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,300
Not going to new jersey.

254
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,290
All right?

255
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,880
All right.
Come on.

256
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,080
are you sure nick can handle it?

257
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,450
Yes, he'll make sure the living will is respected.You don't have to worry.

258
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,090
Oh, I'm not worried.
You should be.

259
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,370
If this guy chase comes out of this coma,

260
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,610
then some very nasty truths also come out about your boss patrick.

261
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,710
I'm well aware.

262
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,110
Our favorite U.S.Senator would suddenly become a worthless asset.

263
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,230
Trust me.
He'll make sure the plug is pulled.

264
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,610
See that he does, or you're worthless to me, too.

265
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,660
Your honor, there is wishful thinking and then there are facts.

266
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,770
No qualified physician has been willing to testify

267
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,210
in support of mrs. Alexander's case.

268
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,710
She simply cannot be allowed to override

269
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,990
the clearly documented wish of her husband, which was for a peaceful death.

270
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,040
- Your honor.
- Yes, mr. Brackman.

271
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,080
Before mr. Alexander is yanked offstage into eternity by the darlings,

272
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
his eldest daughter jillian would like to take the stand.

273
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,010
All right.
Proceed.

274
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,420
Jillian, would you please tell the court

275
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,460
what your daddy said to you before he left for new york the first time,

276
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,150
after your aunt ellen died?

277
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,320
Your honor, relevance?

278
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,710
I'd like to see where this is going.

279
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,370
You may answer the question.

280
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,070
he said he was sorry he had to go,

281
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,830
but that he had to,

282
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,370
to do the right thing for aunt ellen.

283
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,640
Uh, objection, your honor.
This is hearsay.

284
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,550
Overruled.

285
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,660
Finish your thought, miss.

286
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,770
What else did he say, jillian?

287
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,500
He said that he loved me very much,

288
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,620
and that whatever happened, that would never, ever change.

289
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,660
Is there anything else that you want to say?

290
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,810
I know my daddy hurt a lot of people...

291
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,760
but I don't want him to go away.

292
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,450
please don't make him go away.

293
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
uh, your honor, a short recess?

294
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,140
A recess?

295
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,350
This isn't grade school?

296
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,090
Well, I'd suggest that you handle the cross,

297
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,630
but that's right, you've been suspended.

298
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,430
It doesn't take an active legal license

299
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,560
to know you're about to lose in there.

300
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,990
A living will is nothing compared to the tears

301
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,790
of a wittle girl who wuvs her daddy.

302
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,630
You're this committed to patrick's career?
Is that what this is?

303
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,330
I'm just doing my job.

304
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,450
- Maybe you should try it sometime.
- ms. Lyons.

305
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,390
Would you excuse us, please?

306
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,560
What, tripp?I'm not going to attack the testimony of a 9-year-old girl.

307
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,310
I would not want you to.

308
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,220
We've already risked tarnishing our public profile by pursuing this,

309
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
but the law is the law.

310
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,950
Well, then you're gonna have to go in there and say so, because I'm--

311
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,640
nick, what's the matter?

312
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,980
You can't just push and push and push for whatever you want in this wod

313
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,350
without taking other people into account,

314
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,670
- especially children.
- This man killed carmelita.

315
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,740
You and karen were both seriously injured.

316
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,430
Well, I can't take away a little girl's last chance at seeing her father again...

317
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,210
whatever he did.

318
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,290
You can't just eliminate people whenever you feel like it.

319
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,860
What in heaven's name are you talking about?

320
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,360
- Nothing.
- Nick...

321
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,460
look...

322
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,150
they put letitia on trial,

323
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,770
but we both know who really did it.

324
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,560
Really?

325
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,420
And my dad was a first-class bastard,

326
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,430
but that didn't mean he deserved to die either.

327
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,440
Now I'm gonna go back in there,

328
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,990
and I'm gonna tell 'em we rest our case,

329
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,330
and the judge can rule as he sees fit,

330
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,620
but I'm not gonna take that little girl's father away.

331
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,340
I'm sorry.
I can'T.

332
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,800
Nick!
Hey, nick!

333
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,840
Hey, karen.
How you doing?HeY.

334
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,570
Listen, I'm in a-- I'm in a rush.
I gotta go.

335
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Oh, where you going?

336
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,280
Uh, I gotta go to kiki's school.I gotta--

337
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,080
if I'm not there in ten minutes, I'm gonna be late.It wouldn't look good.

338
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,510
Oh, you're playing daddy.

339
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,810
No, actually, I am a daddy,

340
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,610
karen, and I've got kiki for the weekend--a very, very important weekend.

341
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,230
Okay, well, how can I help?

342
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,650
How can you help?
I-I-I don't know?

343
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,920
Well, I don't know either, but you seem a little busy with your job

344
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,190
and now your daddy duties, and I can't do the lawyer thing,

345
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,200
but maybe I could look after...

346
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,060
- kiki.
- Kiki for you if you want.

347
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,510
Um, well, actually, the point is for me to spend time with my daughter, karen,

348
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,020
not toss her into your capable, manicured hands.

349
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,290
Uh, you don't think I can handle this.

350
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,980
No, no, no, no, karen, the issue is not whether or not you can handle it.

351
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,060
The--the mediator seems more interested in wheer or not I can.

352
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,400
Okay, just for the record, I know I'm not mama lisa...

353
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,690
But I can babysit.

354
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,710
Yeah, and I know that, karen,

355
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,790
and the next time that I need kiki to spend the day

356
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,980
getting maages and going shoe shopping, I will call you, okay?

357
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,450
Oh, okay, Yeah.
You know what, nick?

358
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,800
You really kind of suck at this whole "just friends" thing.

359
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,990
You really do.
Thank you.

360
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,510
taxi!

361
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,340
I thought you were coming to bed.

362
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh, no.It's not looking too good.

363
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,390
I'm sorry.I'm just trying to come up with a-

364
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,870
a prayer for this thing tomorrow.

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,230
What thing?

366
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,910
It's for this "meet the pastor" thing.

367
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,470
Oh.

368
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,740
Were you gonna invite me?

369
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,560
Yeah.
Sure, you're invited.I...

370
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,190
I just hadn't gotten around to telling you about it yet.

371
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,530
It's tomorrow.

372
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,710
Honestly, I-I-I figured you wouldn't want to come.

373
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,850
I mean, it's just gonna be a lot of bad coffee and jesus.

374
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,570
Brian,

375
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,630
I'm your wife

376
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,320
and you're a minister.

377
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,980
I know the drill.

378
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,770
Then come.
Fine.

379
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,060
I mean, what do I care?

380
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,460
I gotta go make some coffee.

381
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,230
I think it's gonna be an a-nighter.

382
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,890
- What the hell happened?
- No idea.

383
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,970
Nick srt-circuited like a space heater in a railroad flat.

384
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,730
Tripp's looking for a new lawyer.
Until then...

385
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,370
the living will is suspended.

386
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,460
And that guy lies there like a time bomb

387
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,570
waiting to wake up and destroy everything I've rked for.

388
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,750
I could appeal my suspension d reopen the case

389
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,640
if that's something that you want--

390
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,420
no, no.Stop, stop.
No, no.

391
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,070
The time for legal remedies is over.

392
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,560
You're gonna take care of this,

393
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,520
with finality.

394
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,100
- What does that mean?
- It means chase can't wake up.

395
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,170
It means that patrick can't go to washington with this looming.

396
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,980
He's too important to my plans.

397
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,020
all right.

398
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,020
I will make sure that you have access to chase's room.

399
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,680
The guard will conveniently step away,

400
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,530
and you, my little angel,

401
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,190
- will pull the plug.
- No, I will not.

402
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,060
- Yes, you will.
- I cannot.

403
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,900
- You can and you will do it!
- I am not gonna have blood on my hands--

404
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,620
- because of you!
- Or

405
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,230
i promise you,

406
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,160
you'll never see your brother again.

407
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,060
mr. Jeremy.
A lady to see you.

408
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,890
Well, hello.

409
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,660
Hope I knew you.

410
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,490
You did.

411
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,250
- Who are you?
- Nola...

412
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,400
lyons.

413
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,410
I work with your brother patrick,

414
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,630
as his chief of staff.

415
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,000
And once, a while ago, you and I were...

416
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,150
I had sex with you?

417
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,290
y-yes.
We had sex.

418
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,700
more than once.
Maximum.

419
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,040
Okay, get over yourself now.

420
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,320
So what can I do you for?

421
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
You come back for a rebate?

422
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,880
No, I guess I just wanted to see you,

423
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,410
just in case something bad happened,

424
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,550
to say good-bye.

425
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,120
What's the matter?

426
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,750
Jeremy, I know you don't remember...

427
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,880
but I'm in a really bad situation.

428
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,840
- Chase alexander is--
- the dude that shot the lady?

429
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,910
Carmelita?
Yes.

430
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,610
He's lying in a hospital on life support, and I...

431
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,040
I have to, um...

432
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,780
you have to what?

433
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,100
- Nola, I--
- nola.

434
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,970
what's wrong?

435
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,910
Am interrupting?

436
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,710
No, nos I wajust, uh, just leaving.

437
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,990
Dear, before you go, would you mind?

438
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,920
Uh...for jeremy's flash cards.

439
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,620
Letitia, trust me, this is not the kind of moment that memories are made of.

440
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,880
- oh, god.
- oh, lovely, lovely.

441
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,450
Honey?

442
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,460
Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

443
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,540
That's what you're gonna wear to the "meet the pastor" night?

444
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,480
Yeah.

445
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,480
You look like a pinata.

446
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,410
you know what?

447
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,550
- I can't do this.
- Do what?

448
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,510
Fight with you about your snotty, childish crap.

449
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,200
If you don't want me to come along, brian, just say it.

450
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,960
Come.Don't come.
I don't care.

451
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,310
Just say it.

452
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,970
What?!

453
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,950
That you don't want to be married to me.

454
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,120
Brian...

455
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,480
what you did by marrying me was a beautiful gesture.

456
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,750
I was dying, and it might have saved my life.

457
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,500
But the way that we're living?

458
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,970
Not so beautiful.

459
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,670
Let's not torture each other.

460
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,590
We both love brian jr., And I love you...

461
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,630
but it's all right to say you wantut.

462
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,880
No.

463
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,720
No, it isn'T.

464
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,100
Yes, it is.

465
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,010
Okay, fine.
I want out.

466
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,290
Thank you.

467
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,710
god bless brian darling.

468
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,330
Saint melar's is so fortunate to have him back in its cradle.

469
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,590
Brian is a man of enormous faith

470
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,190
whose many gifts,

471
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,180
especially the generosity he inspires,

472
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,590
are going to be of great benefit to us all.

473
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,530
And so...

474
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,670
let us thank him for his return to the church

475
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,850
as our counselor,

476
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,590
- our guide...
- our bank.

477
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,540
Our reverend.

478
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,520
To brian darling-- welcome.

479
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,930
<i>Dedicated in Loving Memory of Carmelita Rainer</i>

480
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,960
What are you doing here?

481
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,060
Paying my respects.

482
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,600
You're not the only one who misses her, you know?

483
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,780
I do, too.

484
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,440
That memorial service haunts me...

485
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,240
the senseless loss.

486
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,450
I was just trying to understand, I guess...

487
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,350
what she meant to you.

488
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,190
She was the love of my life.

489
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,480
Yet you refused to lift a finger to see

490
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,870
justice done to her murderer.

491
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,850
You're either a saint or

492
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,180
there is something so stoppered up inside you

493
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,240
that it prevented you from responding with the full force of your heart.

494
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,510
What are you getting at?

495
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,330
You didn't express your righteous anger.

496
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,720
And it worries me that you missed a chance to...

497
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,320
grow as a person.

498
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,800
Anger doesn't make you a person, dad.

499
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,430
There is a place in this world...

500
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,790
there is a place in the human heart...

501
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,880
for vengeance.

502
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,340
Things needed to be set right.

503
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,620
If not for you,

504
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,800
then for her.

505
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,480
this is the $1.6-million organ, huh?

506
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,250
Yep.

507
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,150
Ah, it doesn't look like it's worth more than

508
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,660
$1.1 tops.

509
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,550
Well, I hope tripp's pro.

510
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,210
Brian, I told you, if tripp had given this amount of money to the church,

511
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,850
even anonymously, I would know about it.He didn'T.

512
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,370
Yeah?Well, then explain this counselor.

513
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,970
"Mark chapter 1, verse 11." What's that?

514
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,030
"And there came a voice from heaven "

515
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,540
"saying 'thou are my beloved son in whom I am wl pleased.'"

516
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,900
My beloved son?

517
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,290
Yeah.So if tripp didn't do it, who did?

518
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,770
You thinking what I'm thinking?

519
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,010
He's dead, brian.

520
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,660
Our father's dead.

521
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,040
Hey, nick, this whole friggi building is dedicated to the idea

522
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,790
that everyone thought some guy was dead and then he wasn'T.

523
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,650
I'm just saying, it wouldn't be the first time.

524
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,600
Our father can't be alive, brian.

525
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,550
You know, how can you be so sure?

526
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,960
They never recovered his body.

527
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,110
Well, they found his plane.

528
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,900
- Yeah, without him in it.
- hey!

529
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,660
- Lawyer guy.
- Nick.

530
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,750
- It's nick, jeremy.
- Right.Nick.

531
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,020
I was looking for you.
Uh...

532
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,630
what's her name?The--that chinese lady with the freckles?

533
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,260
- Nola lyons.
- Right.Nola.

534
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,790
She has a problem.
Um...

535
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,800
she seemed radically torqued about this guy...

536
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,070
in--in--in the hospital.

537
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,830
- Chase alexander.
- Chase.Right.

538
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,590
Well, what did she say about him?

539
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,160
She told me good-bye, like--

540
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,510
like she wasn't gonna be coming back,

541
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,910
like she was gonna do something,

542
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,370
tonight maybe.
I--the hard drive's all corrupted.

543
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,020
Thank you, jeremy.
I'll see you.

544
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,280
HeY.
Brian, right?

545
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,930
Old church people not your thing?

546
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,710
Not really.

547
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,910
- They smell funny.
- Don't they?What is that?

548
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,140
You know, I used to come out here and play when I was your age,

549
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,870
eight or so years ago.

550
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,690
That would make you 20.

551
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,680
Someone needs a math tutor.

552
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,350
Where's your dad?

553
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,120
He had some work emergency, so he left me with letitia.

554
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,350
This was supposed to be our weekend,

555
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,030
and he left.

556
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,600
Look...

557
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,240
you're probably not thrilled with him right now,

558
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,790
but your dad's a really good guy.

559
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,330
Your mom on the other hD...

560
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,730
- yeah?
- Loves you very much.

561
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,360
She hates your guts.

562
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,100
do you think my mom and dad will ever get back together?

563
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,620
I don't know.

564
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,550
My parents stayed together, and, baby, it was nothing but trouble.

565
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,420
Life is weird.

566
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,370
I know.

567
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,700
I guess...

568
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,080
you know, every saturday night at our house

569
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,310
used to be movie night.

570
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,620
Dad would cook,

571
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,180
and then he, mom and i would watch a movie.

572
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,540
I miss movie night.

573
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,840
Well...

574
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:30,380
even if your mom and dad are living apart, you can still have movie night.

575
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,770
But not with both of them.

576
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,160
No.
No, you're right.BuT...

577
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,060
you could have one with your mom and one with your dad.

578
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,680
Sometimes...

579
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,390
things can change and not be...

580
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,210
you know,

581
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,000
awful.

582
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,310
You're nicer than mom says.

583
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,270
Not really.

584
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,860
nola.

585
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,230
What are you doing her

586
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,670
you don't understand.

587
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,550
- Did tripp put you up to this?
- No.

588
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,410
- Patrick?
- No.

589
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,940
Just get out and let me do this.

590
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,020
You know that's not gonna happen.

591
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,080
If I don't, you don't know--

592
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,950
- you don't know anything.
- All right.

593
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,510
Enlighten me.

594
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,930
What's going on?

595
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,180
If I could tell you, I would.

596
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,140
All right.

597
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,010
I believe yo okay?

598
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,380
But whatever you're doing for whatever reason, it can't happen.

599
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,270
- I won't let it.
- Nick--

600
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,730
now the police are already on their way, wherever the hell they got to.

601
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm not gonna have you arrested,

602
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,290
but I am gonna have somebody posted here 24/7 with the specific orders

603
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,790
not to allow you anywhere near him.

604
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,600
Come on.
Let's go.

605
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,180
you took a life--

606
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,260
the only person I ever really loved.

607
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,450
And I want you to hear her name.

608
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,800
Carmelita.
She was everything to me.

609
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,850
I wasn't even alive until I met her.

610
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,610
And, uh...

611
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,610
now...

612
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,750
I'm like you...

613
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,800
alive...

614
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,570
but dead.

615
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,060
I've got no reason to keep breathing.

616
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,910
Do you get it now, chase,

617
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,810
why I have to kill you?

618
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,900
except I know what...

619
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,070
she would say.

620
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,280
"Paddy...

621
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,820
"there'S...

622
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,920
there's already been too much dyin'."

623
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,240
So, uh...
you go on livin', chase.

624
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,070
That's punishment enough.

625
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,530
what's going on?

626
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,650
Andrea, what are you doing?

627
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,030
I'm gonna stay with a friend for a few days until I figure things out.

628
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,960
You're leaving me just 'cause I--

629
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,530
because you've made it clear that you don't want me to stay here?

630
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,750
Yes.

631
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,150
But I do.

632
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,300
This is why we aren't having this conversation.

633
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,370
You'll say anything to get what you want

634
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,900
because you are afraid of being left alone,

635
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,050
which is how we got into this mess.

636
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,220
You have your family,

637
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,750
and now the church.

638
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,760
Hey, you know what?
Screw the church.

639
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,640
You know why they had this little shindig for me?

640
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,350
So they could dig deeper into my pockets for the next contribution.

641
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,800
'Cause guess what.

642
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,810
I'm a billionaire.

643
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,960
But u never cared about that.

644
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,180
When brian jr.Was born,

645
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,960
you refused child support.

646
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,220
When I sent you checks to brazil, you ripped 'em up.

647
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,650
- Are you blaming me for that?
- No, I'm just saying that...

648
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,720
everybody else in the world just wants me for my money.

649
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,340
You're the only one who wants me for who I am.

650
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,170
And I'm sorry that that just makes me...

651
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,620
a little bit uncomfortable sometimes.

652
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,530
Look, I can't lie.

653
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,950
I jumped into this marriage for some wrong reasons.

654
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,660
But I'm staying in it...

655
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,400
for some good ones.

656
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,020
I mean, if you'll have me.

657
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
- hi.
- Hey.

658
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,510
What happened?
When you called, you said one hour.

659
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,260
We stopped to feed the poor.

660
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,200
We went to cafe lalo for ice cream.

661
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,760
Cool.

662
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,440
Thanks for hanging out tonight, aunt karen.

663
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,390
- I had fun.
- You're welcome.

664
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,740
- I love you, dad.
- I love you, too.

665
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,650
aunt karen.
Look at you.

666
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,360
Yeah, look at me.

667
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,840
Karen, I'm sorry.

668
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,330
That's nowhere near enough.

669
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,030
I am sorry iidn't trust you to help out with kiki

670
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,740
from the moment you offered.
I should have.

671
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,510
And I accept your apology.
You know why?

672
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,130
Because that's what friends do.

673
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,610
- Don't they?
- They do.

674
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,940
dad, I want to watch a movie.

675
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,010
I will be right there.

676
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,720
- Well...
- well...

677
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,720
- good night.
- Good night...

678
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,680
- friend.
- Yes.

679
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,030
what we are now.

680
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,050
oh, keep playing.
I just...

681
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,770
I know it's late.
I just wanted to stop by and...

682
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,960
say thank you.

683
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,480
I don't know if you had anything to do with it,

684
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,800
though I have a feeling you did.

685
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,150
You saved my ass.

686
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,260
And everything else, too, I hope.

687
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,390
You were more of a friend to me today than...

688
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,480
I ever was to you.

689
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,610
I owe you.

690
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,840
And I n't forget that.

691
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,670
That's all.

692
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,520
How do you plan on repaying me?

693
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,870
'Cause as I recall...

694
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,900
you know me pretty neat tricks.

695
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,730
As you recall?

696
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,950
So what, you remember me now?

697
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,500
I remember everything, nola.

698
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,940
I don't have amnesia.
I never did.

699
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,620
- What the hell, jeremy?!
- Yeah, what the hell?Ow!

700
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,630
I've been making myself sick worrying about you.

701
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,510
I wanted to tell you before, but there were always people around.

702
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,340
Do you know how hard it is trying to pretend not to remember you?

703
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,380
How could I forget you?

704
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,640
Wait, so...

705
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,870
you've been pretending to be mentally challenged for fun?

706
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,200
no.I'm staying under the elder radar.

707
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,380
Dude, you told me about your brother, you said you wanted me to help you.

708
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,610
I tried going to see nick,but

709
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,100
simon caught me.I thought he was gonna have me friggin' killed.

710
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,350
You're probably not wrong about that.

711
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,130
Right.

712
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,490
So after hit my head and I woke up in the hospital,

713
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,210
and they were asking me all these questions, like

714
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,940
what year is it, what's your name,

715
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,130
I saw my opportunity.

716
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,530
So you've been faking it for a month?

717
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,820
I figured there must be some way to use this to our advantage, right?

718
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,630
I want to help you find your brother, nola.

719
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,370
I really do.

720
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,890
Karen darling?

721
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,550
You left our daughter in the care of that spoiled,

722
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,430
selfish, emotionally stunted brat?

723
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,330
For one hour, lisa.

724
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,980
Why don't we all have a seat?

725
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,990
No, I won't be staying.
Thank you.

726
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,690
You want 50% custody of kiki?

727
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,120
You couldn't even handle two days with her.

728
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,170
- Hey, calm down.
- Clearly you can't be trusted.

729
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,240
Do you even know what they did together?

730
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,410
Well, they wer't out scoring coke, if that's your concern.

731
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,440
- Karen took her out for an ice cream.
- Because you took off and left her.

732
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,430
Well, something came up.

733
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,720
Something always comes up, nick, and you always put your family last.

734
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,980
That is not what this is about,

735
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,440
and you know it.When it comes to karen,

736
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,510
- u're irrational.
- Yeah?

737
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,130
You want rational, nick?

738
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,750
Let's both be rational

739
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,120
in front of a judge in court,

740
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,320
where I sue your ass for full primary custody of my daughter.

741
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,530
Mediate that.

742
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,950
You need to fix this place up.

743
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,900
Tripp.

744
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,240
This is a surprise.

745
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,230
What can I do for you?

746
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:00,410
Chase passed away in his sleep last night.

747
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,420
- I got the call this morning.
- How did that happen?

748
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,220
Who knows how these things happen?

749
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,970
The animal finally...

750
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,270
gives up?

751
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,340
But it was a blessing.

752
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,870
Chase was an organ donor.

753
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,880
He gave his kidney to a little girl in pittsburgh about kiki's age.

754
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,850
Saved her life.

755
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,540
And that'S...

756
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,370
- why you came by?
- No, of course not.

757
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,160
you accused me...

758
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,460
once again, in so many words...

759
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
of having killed your father.

760
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,790
And I have not been able to get that moment out of my head.

761
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,040
- Tripp--
- nick...

762
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,910
your father was my best friend.

763
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,610
I never, ever wished ill upon him.

764
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,880
But since his death...

765
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,940
since I discovered his betrayal of me,

766
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,290
of the darling famil of everything I hold dear...

767
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:10,570
I admit that there has been more than one night when I have lain awake

768
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,940
wishing that it had been me who had taken his life,

769
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,310
that I'd had the chance.

770
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,020
But I didn'T.

771
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,620
I didn't do it.

772
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,030
It may seem as if I did...

773
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,960
but not everything is as it seems.

774
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,300
I believe you, tripp.

775
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,170
Have a good night.
