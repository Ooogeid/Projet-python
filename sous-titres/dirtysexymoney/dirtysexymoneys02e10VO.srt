00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200
hi.Kate scott. "Scandalous magazine."

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,920
- The darlings aren't home.
- Oh,well,um...

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,400
do you know when they might be back?

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,220
The darlings are away for thanksgiving.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,040
Well,I am doing a 2,000-word
expos?on the family and--

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm familiar with your column.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,110
- "Red carpet confidential."
- Not a fan?

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,900
Come on,what have you got,a couple of
shots of karen sunbathing topless in ibiza?

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,700
- Print 'em.
- Oh,actually,this is not a puff piece.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,880
And if I wanted to print pictures of karen
darling's ya-yas,I wouldn't have to look hard.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,580
No,I'm doing a piece
about family betrayal,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,060
criminal cover-ups and murder.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm just the chauffeur.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,550
Which means you have a front-row
seat for every sordid darling debacle.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,440
I drive the car. I don't see much.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,390
That's not what I hear,clark.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,820
Look,I go to press in six hours.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,270
It's part of our holiday special issue.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,580
I just want to fact-check my story.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,430
Or the i can run thpiece as is.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,950
It's your choice.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,390
I always wondered what
this place looked like.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,750
It's just a family home.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
So was versailles.

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,840
So...

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,870
how long is this gonna take?

27
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,110
20 minutes. An hour tops.

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,850
Okay,first
question--

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,300
I have information that before letitia was
charged with the murder of dutch george,

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,250
the police were
investiging somebody else.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,850
Well,they should've stayed
focused on that person,

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,460
because,as you know,mrs.
Darling was found innocent.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,940
Who is this suspect?

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,300
Her husband,your
boss-- tripp darling.

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,370
Mr. Darling was never under investigation
for the murder of dutch george.
Check your sources.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
So you're denying that when patrick
darling was the attoey general...

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,110
- okay,whoa.Wait a second.
- Of the state of new york,

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,080
- he investigated his own father...
- okay,okay.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,590
Before that investigation
mysteriously went away?

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
You're half right.

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,120
A while back,patrick was
going after his father,

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,650
but it didn't have anything
to do with dutch's murder.

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,230
this whole thing started when tripp
received an unexpected visitor.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,690
- Mr. Tripp darling?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,310
You been served. let's go.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,980
- What's that?
- Well,it's a subpoena from the attorney general's office,signed by patrick,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,020
calling you to testify in
the fantini brothers case.

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,940
Tripp needed that subpoena to go away.

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,000
The fact that the investigation was
being brought by tripp's son patrick

50
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,740
and that the two hadn't exactly been getting
along made things even more complicated.

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,530
- I can try to quash it.
- No,trying is not good enough.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,090
It is imperative that the
two of you figure out a way

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,180
to make sure that I am not compelled
to walk into that courtrooM.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,650
- Why don't you want to testify?
- They're mobsters,brian.

55
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,170
The fantini brothers have a long
and tempestuous history with us.

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,830
Our professionalealings with
them have always been above board,

57
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,440
ethically pristine.

58
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,630
But if am called to bear witness,

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,280
they'll do everything in their
power to make the court believe that

60
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,520
all of their foul
corruption stems from us.

61
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,050
RegrettablY...

62
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,210
patrick knows this,too.

63
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,370
I'll take care of it.

64
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,150
We'll... take care of it.

65
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,930
So nick and brian went to see patrick,

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,530
you know,to try and keep this
misunderstanding within the family.

67
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,550
Patrick,as attorney general,it's within your
power to offer the fantini brothers a deal.

68
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,390
Your office gets an easy conviction,and
it saves taxpayers some money

69
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,270
on what would be a lengthy
and messy trial--case closed.

70
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,070
I already offered the fantini
brothers a very reanable plea deal,

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,120
- and they wouldn't take it. -
Well,then drop the case,dumb-ass.

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,980
- Hey,what happened to hanging back?
- What happened to getting the job done?

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,210
Brian,asking me to drop the case is an
obstruction of justice.That's a felony.

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,570
Uh,surely nick must have
explained that to you already.

75
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,850
Unless he's in on the plan,too.

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,550
My,how,uh,things have changed.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,370
Hey,would you drop the prissy tone?

78
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,830
We're talking about your father.

79
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,240
I could talk like clint eastwood
if you like,but my hands are tied.

80
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,500
The fantini brothers wanted
the big show,and I'm just,uh,

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,740
bringing the popcorn.

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,220
Patrick,we all know that the onlreas
you're going after the fantini brothers

83
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,500
is to attack tripp

84
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,490
uh,listen,gentmen,thanks for coming.

85
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,430
If you'll excuse me,I've gotta get
back to my career of fighting crime.

86
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,780
Patrick,this isn't over.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,170
Really?

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,150
seems like it is.

89
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,100
After striking out with patrick,

90
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,980
nick wanted to go through channels.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,570
Brian chose A...

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,470
less diplomatic approach.

93
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,970
- I-I just,I,uh-- 
- let me guess.Brian's here.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,810
- Should I send him in?
- Nice work,daisy.

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,210
- You got it.
- Look,I have called the governor's office,

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,500
I am waiting to hear on a
judge's ruling on an injunction,

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,800
and right now,I have to get home
and see my daughter for dinner,okay?

98
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,690
- Well,that must be nice.
- Meaning?

99
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,900
To accomplish absolutely nothing

100
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,860
and then go home with
so much friggin' bacon.

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,970
What do you want from me,brian?

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,860
I want you to be half the guy tripp
thinks you are and get something done.

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,970
- I just said I'm on it.
- No,you know what?I'm on it.

104
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,830
- What does that mean?
- You're never gonna get patrick or anybody else to dismiss this case.

105
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,710
The papers have made too
much of a big deal out of it,

106
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,300
and patrick is never gonna back down.

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,300
Well,you're right about
that,but what are you gonna do?

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm gonna go down to jersey,talk
to these fantini brothers,

109
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,630
and maybe get 'em to make a deal.

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,650
These guys are connected,briaN.
They're dangerous.

111
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,710
You're gonna walk in there and say what?

112
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm brian darling,paisan,

113
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,580
and this is how it's gonna be.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,380
How the hell were you ever a minister?

115
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,010
You ever read the bible?

116
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,180
It's full of aggravating
people that get things done.

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,670
Check it out.

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,380
I wish I could tell you
that brian was all talk,

119
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,230
but when that kid gets
an idea in his head...

120
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,040
- sorry to keep you
waiting,padre. - That's ex-padre.

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,740
You know,I don't even
know if this is allowed.

122
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,010
The son of a witness,the brother of
patrick darling talking to defendants?

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,460
All of a sudden you're a stickler
for the rul? Give me a break.

124
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,650
So what do you want?

125
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,140
I know you didn't come all the way to jersey
just to catch a glimpse of some of that.

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
I want you to make a deal.

127
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,540
Take a suspended sentence or
something,and make this case go away.

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,160
- Why would we do that?
- Because if you don't,

129
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,070
you just might end up rotting away in
prison where you both friggin' belong.

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,260
Why don't you let your brother--little
paddy-- worry about such stuff,huh?

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,950
Look,we can handle this one of two ways.

132
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,130
You take a deal,or I can call my brother

133
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,380
and make sure that you both go
to jail for a long,long time.

134
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,390
I make it a policy to stay
out of darling family business,

135
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,410
but brian was in way over his head.

136
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,110
hey,clark,what's up?

137
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm sorry to bother you,mr. George,

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,180
but brian made me drop him off at
the fantini brothers' strip joint

139
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,230
- in jersey about two hours ago.
- Unbelievable.

140
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,620
I-I tried to get inside a few
times,but the goons won't let me in.

141
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,350
I'll be right there.

142
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,400
Brian...

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,560
You all right?

144
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,440
- Good evening.
- Mikey,relax.

145
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,250
Yeah,you,too,clark.

146
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,720
- So you're dutch's kid,huh?
- Yeah.

147
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,050
Well,I hope you got more manners than
this potty-mouthed priest over here.

148
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,810
Look,I camee to tell
you that patrick darling

149
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,830
is gonna offer you a plea barga
that you're gonna find acceptable.

150
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,970
And why should we believe you?

151
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,360
Because it's the truth.

152
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,580
I give you my word.

153
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,460
Well,if you're anything like your
old man,that's good enough for me.

154
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,490
- Get him outta here,will you?
- Brian,let's go.

155
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,250
- clark.
- YeS.

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,120
- Clark!
- Yeah,c--

157
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,170
- thank you.That's really good.
- anytime.

158
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,480
I get lonely sometimes. Sue me.

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
Anyway,nick promised he could
get patrick to play ball.

160
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,360
Now he just needed to deliver.

161
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,850
How'd he plan on doing that?

162
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,250
Well,behind every darling
man is a good woman.

163
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,650
Sometimes...

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,430
two.

165
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,600
care to elaborate?

166
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,080
Patrick was having trouble with his...

167
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,230
girlfriend.

168
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,270
- Carmelita?
- Yes.

169
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,330
She'd kind of flown the coop
on patrick's election night.

170
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,070
Now nick figured if he
could track down carmelita,

171
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,700
then patrick would be much more
agreeable on the whole fantini mess.

172
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,540
- Did it work?
- Like a charm.

173
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Okay,what the hell is so
important that you got...

174
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,260
what happened to you?

175
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,080
we have some news about carmelita.

176
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,620
- Do--do you know where
she is? - Hey,relax.

177
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,420
- Well,what do you know?
- I have a phone number where she can be reached.

178
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,500
Let's have it.

179
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,650
Well,pat,I'm not gonna give it to you.

180
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,870
I'll let you talk to her...

181
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,460
if you retract the subpoena.

182
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,680
Oh,you're... you're kidding,right?

183
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,380
- No,he's not kidding.
- I'm dead serious,pat.

184
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,610
If you want to talk to carmelita,

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,120
you'll retract the subpoena,

186
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,050
make the fantini brothers
a deal they'll accept.

187
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,940
Do not let this go to trial.

188
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,580
You two have sunk to a new low.

189
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
You're using carmelita for
your own wretched gains?

190
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,320
I know. Isn't it great?

191
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,470
- fine,okay.
- All right.

192
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,970
- Here you go. -
What--what is this?

193
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,260
Just a little statement declaring your
unwavering intent to quash the subpoena.

194
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,180
I don't want you changing your mind.

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,430
What the hell has happened to you?

196
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,520
The fantini brothers took
their sweetheart deal,

197
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,720
the subpoena went
away-- case closed.

198
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,070
Now you probably want to beat
that thanksgiving traffic,so...

199
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,730
you know,before I
leave,I wanted to mention,

200
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,080
- I keep hearing these rumors.
- Rumors?

201
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,350
About ellen darling's death and your
involvement in a potential cover-up.

202
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,730
- that's ridiculous.
- Is it,clark?

203
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,210
You have no proof of anything.

204
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,640
No,not yet,but if you
don't start cooperating,

205
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,370
I'll make damn sure I find some.

209
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,870
I'm glad I was able to help you understand
why we needed to have this little chat.

210
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah,well,blackmail
tends to get my attention.

211
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,140
next question--
kareN.

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,080
That's not a question.

213
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,620
Actually,you know,um,I'm
a little parched myself.

214
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,710
Why not?

215
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,240
So my sources tell me that karen nearly broke
off her engagement to billionaire simon elder.

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,550
There were a few bumps along the road,

217
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,530
but everything is just fine now.

218
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,500
In fact,the wedding's next week.

219
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,630
So it is true karen's
tempestuous relationship

220
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,500
with old flame nick george nearly
wrecked everything for simon and karen?

221
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,490
I think you're a little mixed
up on your specifics there,kate.

222
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,490
There was an ex stirring up trouble,but

223
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,600
it wasn't nick george.

224
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,630
Hey,baby,I think it's really
sexy that you're a dad...

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,770
but do I have to meet your son?

226
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,630
elon is a great kid. You'll love him.

227
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,710
Rise up slowly.

228
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,710
- Maybe I'll buy him something.
- Yeah?

229
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,020
Like hot wheels.

230
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,920
And now move into navasana,boat pose.

231
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,090
He's 16 years old.

232
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,660
Yeah,I know,but I can't give a 16 year
old boy what he really wants,now can I?

233
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,390
Uh,no,you can'T.

234
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,210
Hey,did we pick a place for lunch yet?

235
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,400
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah,my place,2:00 P.M.

236
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,750
Ama is gonna cook for us.

237
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,950
Your ex-wife is joining us?

238
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,530
- Yeah.
- Fun.

239
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,580
- That's so-- that's
so fun. - Yeah.

240
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
I thought it'd be a good idea for you
two to get to know each other better,

241
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,560
you know,for elon's sake and all.

242
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,950
Yeah,I totally agree.

243
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,280
Well,as you can
imagine,this whole ama thing

244
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,320
wasn't sitting well with karen.

245
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,850
I'm happy to have lunch with
his son,but his ex-wife,too?

246
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,190
Princess ama of wherever.

247
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,480
Have you registered
your concerns with simon?

248
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,210
No,no. It would be too weird.

249
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,320
We were just getting out of the
boat position when he told me and...

250
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,140
- yoga,mom.
- Oh,yeah.I knew that.

251
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,890
He just doesn't realize how creepy and
possessive she gets when she's around me.

252
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,970
Well,karen,if you and simon can
overcome the emotional infidelities

253
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,030
of high-stakes corporate
espionage,you can,

254
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,510
you know,talk this through.

255
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,260
Just... just be delicate.

256
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,000
So later that afternoon,karen took
her mother's advice to heart and,uh,

257
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,980
decided to give simon a call.

258
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,430
hey there.

259
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,230
So listen,um,I was sort of
thinking about lunch,and--and...

260
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,910
I think I wanted it just
to be the three of us--

261
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,310
you know,you,me and elon.

262
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,660
Yeah,I got you. No problem.

263
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,620
Dad,get off the phone.

264
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,390
He doesn't sound 16.

265
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,070
All right. We'll see you tomorrow.

266
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,810
- Okay.Bye.
- All right.

267
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,550
Isn't that better?

268
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,970
Yeah.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,660
So the next day,simon,karen
and elon met for lunch and

270
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,230
that's when things got...

271
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,900
complicated.

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,940
I want to go to either
oxford or cambridge.

273
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,500
What about the sorbonne?

274
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,890
Les jolies filles tres sexy,right?

275
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,160
That'd be cool.

276
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,170
I'm kind of into continental philosophy.

277
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,930
Yeah,but I'd like to keep him
just a little closer to home.

278
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,930
Why?You always said the
world raised you,right?

279
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,370
- ama.
- Hi.

280
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,630
- I let myself in.
- Ama,hi.

281
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,100
That's-- it's
a surprise.

282
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,640
- I'm so sorry I'm interrupting.
- Um,not at all.

283
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,960
Elon wanted to drive with you later,and
he forgot his learner's permit.

284
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,440
All right. Go.

285
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,510
amA...

286
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,370
Hey,I'm gonna go make sure he
doesn't back over one of our valets.

287
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,480
I'll be right back.

288
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,970
stay.

289
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,580
- well,you look beautiful.
- Thank you,but no.

290
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,370
I--I am here because I am
the mother of simon's child.

291
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,090
You are here because you...

292
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,930
are beautiful.

293
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,980
Beauty makes simon very happy.

294
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,860
We had great sex this morning.

295
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,520
three times.

296
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,250
Don't quote me on that last part,but

297
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,830
you get the picture.

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,950
So that's the whole story?

299
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,320
Karen darling has a
healthy sexual appetite?

300
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,450
Oh,clark.I thought you
were gonna cooperate.

301
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,100
- If that's all you've
got-- - did I say I was done?

302
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,390
Now after ama's surprise drop by,

303
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,670
karen was plenty ticked off,

304
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,390
but simon still didn't have a clue.

305
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,350
Hey,karen. It's simon.

306
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,390
Oh,hi. What do you want?

307
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,310
I was hoping you would have
brunch with me this morning.

308
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,540
Hoping or are you asking?

309
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,870
how does 10:00 work for you?

310
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,350
- Um,it doesn't really.
- Oh,but avoiding me does?

311
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,320
Um,well,maybe I could clear my schedule.

312
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,910
Perfect.I told ama we'd
meet her at hyacinth.

313
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,100
Oh. Oh!

314
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,270
You mean that ex-wife of yours that
you're inappropriately close to still?

315
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,360
That ama? Her?

316
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,770
Yeah,that's the one.

317
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,160
You know what? I actually--I
can'tclear my schedule 'cause see,

318
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,810
I met this guy last
night,and we're having brunch.

319
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,600
It's gonna be me and him
and,well,his ex-wife,naturally,

320
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,020
and his stepmother and this girl
he had a crush on in kindergarten.

321
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,140
And I would love to invite you along,

322
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,620
but that would just be weird.

323
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,300
so what happened? How
did simon win her back?

324
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,890
Have you ever met simon elder in person?

325
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,360
- No.
- Well...

326
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,190
he is a charmer.

327
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,610
Karen.

328
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,800
I know,I'm persistent.

329
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,490
If by "persistent" you
mean "stalkerish," yes.

330
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,160
How did you find me?

331
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,980
You wouldn't return my calls.I got it.

332
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,700
- You gave me no other
option.Karen-- - what do you want?

333
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,620
I spoke to ama.

334
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,860
Oh,is she upset I broke up with us?

335
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,620
Was she planning a cruise or something?

336
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,460
No.Ama and I are going
to limit our relationship.

337
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,660
We're just gonna
interact when we have to,

338
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,600
when we're co-parenting elon.

339
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,360
You're gonna--you're gonna
do that because of me?

340
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,970
There are reasons ama
and i aren't together.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,860
And you're the first woman
that I've cared about--

342
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,600
I mean,really cared
about-- in a long time.

343
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,110
I don't know what to say.

344
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,780
Then don't say anything...

345
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,390
yet. All right?

346
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,190
Okay.

347
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,830
So you see?Nick had nothing to do
with karen and simon's wedding jitters.

348
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,930
Now if you'll excuse me,I've got
a thanksgiving turkey to stuff.

349
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,310
I'm sure you do,but
it's my understanding,

350
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,430
that in the midst of her murder trial,

351
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,280
letitia was arrested for jumping
bail and trying to flee the country.

352
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,270
Okay,that's just crazy.

353
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,450
Who's your source on that one?

354
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,050
The booking officer
at the 19th precinct.

355
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,290
Of course.

356
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,010
From what I hear,

357
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,790
letitia made a run for it,

358
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,280
which is what guilty people do.

359
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,370
Come on,clark. Admit it.

360
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,990
Letitia darling's a murderer.

361
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,350
I can clear all this up,all right?

362
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,940
During the trial,mrs. Darling did
have some problems with her bail,but

363
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,260
she never,ever tried to flee.

364
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,880
I'm all ears.

365
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,860
When mrs. Darling was
charged with murder,

366
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,600
she was placed under house arrest.

367
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,610
Yeah,it sounds like
a real hardship,yeah--

368
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,150
having to stay cooped up in the palace.

369
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,520
You might not think so,

370
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,210
but after a while,letitia
started getting...

371
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,450
restless.

372
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,880
You cannot be out here,mrs. Darling.

373
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,420
You're under house arrest.

374
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,980
I need my daily walk,clark.

375
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,000
And so does midas...

376
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,680
for different reasons,of course.

377
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,170
I love the fall.

378
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,590
It reminds me of,oh,bonfires
and apple picking-- oh!

379
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,190
And spring fashion collections.

380
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,340
I can't wait to see the ferragamo charity
fashion show at the waldorf next week.

381
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,980
Fantastico.

382
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,250
Ma'am,please,you are under strict
instructions not to leave the property.

383
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,340
We own all the property
in the neighborhood.

384
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,090
This is my home.

385
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,500
- mrs. Darling,maybe we
should-- - clark,that's a siren.

386
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,050
- Pull over and make way.
- Yes,ma'am.

387
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,590
hold it right there,ma'am.

388
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,980
71st and madison. We got her.

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
- Mrs. Darling. - I-I'm
just walking my dog.

390
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,660
Step away from the dog and
put your hands in the air.

391
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,360
I give up.

392
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,290
- Mrs. Darling was under arrest.
- Again?

393
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,830
Let's just say,it's moments like these

394
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,010
where nick george
really earns his money.

395
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,750
I got your probation officer
to release you with a warning.

396
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,050
but if you leave the house again for
anything other than court-related reasons,

397
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,180
you're gonna sit in jail for
the duration of the trial.

398
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,030
Thank you,alicia.

399
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,570
Well,I guess it's 5:00 somewhere,huh?

400
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,770
Nick...I was just put in a
police car for walking my dog.

401
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,570
I've earned a fortifying cocktail.

402
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,960
And I,having taken this
case at your request,

403
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,410
have earned a little cooperation.Do
you understand the rules or not?

404
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,110
Truthfully,no.

405
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,470
What do they think I'm
gonna do,run off somewhere?

406
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,540
I'm a darling. Where could I hide?

407
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,090
Look,I know it's nerve-racking
being confined here,

408
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,110
but you have to stay in the house.

409
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,090
- Clark.
- Yes,sir.

410
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,070
- Do you understand?
- Yes,sir.

411
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,590
She can't leave.

412
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,080
- no,SiR.
- God!

413
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,820
I was so looking forward
to that fashion show.

414
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,690
- I feel like I'm under arrest.
- You are.

415
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,890
I know,but now I feel that way.

416
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,000
nick,could you get me the number
for the folks at ferragamo?

417
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,960
- Why?
- Well...

418
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,990
if I can't go to the
collection,I'll bring it here.

419
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,200
If I invite all my
friends,they can't say no.

420
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm their biggest client.

421
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,900
Is that within the law?

422
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,100
I will see what I can do.

423
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,380
As the fashion show approached,mrs.
Darling got more and more excited.

424
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,700
It was good to see her
back to her old self.

425
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,470
I'm thinking the runway can stretch
right through the center of the gallery.

426
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,040
Hi,darling. Or maybe the living room.

427
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,510
Oh,you're seriously putting a
fashion show on here tomorrow?

428
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
Well,ferragamo agreed to it.

429
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,780
They're sending over their spring
collection and their models,and

430
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,530
I've invited 200 of my closest friends
and their daughters and their daughters.

431
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,160
The city of new york can
imprison me in my own home,

432
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,640
but they can't slow me down.

433
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,750
- You'll come?
- I will try.

434
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,180
- It sounds like a realituation.
- Well...

435
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,390
the day of the
show,things got a little...

436
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,630
busy around here,and not
necessarily in a bad way.

437
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,170
hi.

438
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,420
Can we change in here?

439
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,580
N-no.

440
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,610
Sorry.

441
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,660
everything had been
planned to the letter.

442
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,890
The only problem-- when
the big moment arrived,

443
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,720
it just wasn't that big.

444
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,750
oh,I know,I know. I'm late.

445
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,680
It took longer than usual.

446
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,880
Imprisonment fatigues me.

447
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,580
Well,maybe you should
get some rest then.

448
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,870
And miss my big production? Never.

449
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,800
- 11.
- 11 what?

450
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,950
What do you mean?

451
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,720
11 of your friends came.

452
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,450
Why would there only be...

453
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,220
Sycophant suckwads.

454
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm sorry.

455
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,590
I almost feel sorry for letitia.

456
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,440
Then don't run the story.

457
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,460
I said i almost feel sorry.

458
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,860
Of course.

459
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,030
So...

460
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,400
did she call off the fashion show?

461
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,450
You clearly don't know letitia darling.

462
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,810
I refuse to let those
boo birds darken my mood.

463
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,080
Come on. Let's go see the pretty ladies.

464
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,460
ah,well. That was lovely,wasn't it?

465
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,510
My deepest thanks to ferragamo and...

466
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,610
and to all of you for daring--
letitia darling,those clothes...

467
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,720
ah,oh,things of beauty,marvels,really.

468
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,300
But your unwholesome behavior

469
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,120
and the attention that
it's invited,well...

470
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,170
it's cast a shadow over the
lives of all women of substance,

471
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,400
and for that,I really think...

472
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,250
you should be ashamed.

473
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,830
Letitia collapsed...

474
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,060
on the catwalk?

475
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,640
She was dehydrated.

476
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,100
Naturally,we rushed her
across town to the doctor,

477
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,620
and that's when
D.A.Nola lyons showed up,

478
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,790
ready to send mrs. Darling
back to the big house.

479
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,710
thank you.

480
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,630
She violated house arrest again.

481
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,180
M taking her into custody.

482
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,880
Necessity is an affirmative defense where a life is at stake.

483
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,950
My client needed emergency
medical attention.

484
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,280
At a rejuvenation center?

485
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,260
This is a glorified spa treatment.

486
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,410
My wife was lucky she
blacked out on a catwalk.

487
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,140
What would've happened if she'd
been on the grand staircase?

488
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,640
I'll make sure there are
no stairs in her jail cell.

489
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,790
Your wife is done flouting her home confinement. Office.

490
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,780
If you're referring to
the dog walking incident,

491
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,520
the term "home" includes curtilage--
any grounds that are part of a dwelling.

492
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,950
Since the darlings own their entire block,it's
all curtilage,and legally,a part of their home.

493
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,040
That's what I told them!

494
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,430
So if you arrest my client now,

495
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,510
I will have malicious prosecution charges filed

496
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,160
against your office faster
than you can say "mistrial.

497
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,150
Letitia wasn't jumping bail.

498
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,730
She was just having
one of her... spells.

499
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,330
You have an explanation for
just about everything,don't you?

500
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,630
It helps when you're telling the truth.

501
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,760
you're kinda cute,you know that?

502
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,300
Yes,I suppose I do.

503
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,110
what's up with the moustache?

504
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,900
Let's just stick to the article.

505
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,120
Okay.

506
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,240
- Where is juliet darling?
- Vacation.

507
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
For an entire year?

508
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,870
She's chosen a life of leisure.

509
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,550
I've got a line on a story that tripp
dar bought his daughter a padded suite

510
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:22,280
at payne whitney psychiatric when she woke
up one morning convinced she was yogi berra.

511
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,580
okay.

512
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,710
- Juliet is with a boy.
- What boy?

513
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,150
A boy she met while she was
on vacation in the seychelles.

514
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,530
- I need a name.
- Kai.

515
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,710
- You're kidding me.
- No. He's a real sweet kid,too.

516
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,570
Look,all the trouble
started when juliet decided

517
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,850
she was finally ready to
lose her virginity with kai.

518
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,530
All right. I'm listening.

519
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,850
Tonight's the night.

520
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,030
Tonight?

521
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,440
I've waited 25 years
for the right guy...

522
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,510
and the right moment.

523
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,940
And tonight,I'll have both.

524
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,060
- You sure?
- Positive.

525
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,490
Okay,wait a sec.

526
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,450
jealous african princesses?

527
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,760
Showdowns with mobsters? Maybe.

528
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,950
But juliet darling a virgin? Come on.

529
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,970
Look,do you want to hear
what happened,or don't you?

530
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,860
keep going.

531
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,420
Well,like most young ladies,juliet
was still plenty nervous.

532
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,210
So she decided to get all the girls together
to swap stories about their first times.

533
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,960
Oh,it was so incredible.

534
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,580
It was very... adventurous.

535
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,930
Do I really want to hear this?

536
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,710
Oh,let her tell. I want to know.

537
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,310
- Okay,my first time...
- all right.

538
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,500
It was one of those hot,muggy
nights,central park. We were naked.

539
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,840
You were naked in central park? Where?

540
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,100
I swore to nick I wouldn't
tell. It's our little secret.

541
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,720
Did you,you know?

542
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,230
- Oh,my lord,I don't want to know.
- I do!

543
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,790
Oh,of course,yes,yeah,but
we had to be very quiet

544
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,880
because there were people around.

545
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,180
And,sweetie,that doesn't
always happen to everyone.

546
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,200
Okay,natalie?

547
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,000
I did it with the pool boy
at our house in palm springs.

548
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,740
we kind of had this thing all
summer,and it was very,um...

549
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,050
colonial?

550
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,710
Oh,i love that.

551
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,400
Well,what about you,mrs. Darling?

552
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,440
You know,I'm not sure that
I want to indulge in this,

553
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,730
uh,in this particular roundtable.

554
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,610
Mom,this is a valuable opportunity
for me to learn from my female peers.

555
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,020
I need the wisdom of my
tribal sisters and mother.

556
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,150
well...

557
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,800
it was my wedding night,and,uh...

558
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,810
it was very sweet.

559
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,170
Your wedding night?

560
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,640
that's--oh,my god,mom.
Tell the truth.

561
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,020
It was my wedding night,and
that's all I'm gonna say about it.

562
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,560
So...

563
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,680
did juliet gohrough with it?

564
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,860
Well...

565
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,300
yeah,she did.

566
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,210
- How was that?
- Good.

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,460
- Just good?
- Great.

568
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,750
Oh,kai. I feel like...

569
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,210
you and i just sang a song
that no one's ever heard before,

570
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,000
and you and i are the only
ones who will ever know it.

571
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,790
you're so sweet.

572
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,080
- I have to get that.
- What? No.

573
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,470
W-what are you doing? We haven't
even finished cuddling yet.

574
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,730
I have to go out for a while.

575
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,370
Who is that?

576
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,170
Just a friend. I'll be back.

577
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:14,050
Well... kai,you know,if I'm doing
something wrong,y-you'd tell me,right?

578
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,130
of course.

579
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,710
It was perfect.

580
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,140
I'll see you later,okay?

581
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,060
juliet darling--
bad in bed?

582
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,370
You think this is about sex?

583
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,740
- Isn't it?
- No.

584
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,650
This is about kai and the
very big secret he was keeping.

585
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,990
when kai got home later that
day,juliet decided to play it cool.

586
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,330
Hey.

587
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,190
Are you okay?

588
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,360
Where have you been?

589
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,720
I told you I had something to do.

590
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,990
- Something or someone?
- What?

591
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,810
Were you with another girl,someone
more experienced? Just tell me.

592
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,530
No,I wasn'T. Juliet,you're being crazy.

593
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,420
'Cause I think you're keeping
secrets from me,and that is not sexy.

594
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,500
Quoi? What--hey,uh--
wait. Come back.

595
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,710
So juliet went to talk to
the one person a young lady

596
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,070
goes to when she's
feeling a little confused.

597
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,480
Darling,are you--
are you okay?

598
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,800
It's kai.

599
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,140
Oh,he's--he's
such a lovely boy.

600
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,850
what's wrong?

601
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,580
It's about...sex.

602
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm not very good at it.

603
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,680
Do you have any advice?

604
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,240
Oh,sex? Of course.Sex.

605
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,150
you know,sex is like riding a horse.

606
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,560
First you just-- oh,you
fall in love with the horse.

607
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,990
And then you get to know the
horse,and then you learn to jump it,

608
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,710
higher and higher,and then you,oh,you take
all these wonderful adventures with it.

609
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:08,240
But you have to become
one with your horse.

610
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,650
my advice is,uh...

611
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,440
practice,practice,practice.

612
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,430
later that night,kai decided to
lay all his cards on the table.

613
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,290
Juliet...

614
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,400
I know you're angry,anD...

615
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,150
I came to apologize.

616
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,280
Sorry is not good enough,kai.

617
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,420
You're not communicating,you're
keeping secrets from me,

618
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,620
and you're
making me feel--

619
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,770
You're right,okay?

620
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,460
I shouldn't have hid from
you what I was doing today.

621
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,360
I guess part of me wasn't
ready to trust you,but...

622
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,850
I'm ready now.

623
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,050
Trust me about what?

624
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,970
The night we met...

625
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,590
I told you my uncle
was a village fisherman.

626
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:12,290
You were okay with that because you said
you wanted to meet somebody different,but...

627
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,870
the truth is,my uncle is.

628
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:22,200
Jean-pierre desjardins,the former
president of the coquilles islands.

629
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,760
- No way.
- Yes way.

630
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,820
Unfortunately,my uncle's
prime minister led a coup d'at

631
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,800
and took the government
away from him and the people.

632
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,810
L-l--coup d--
oh,that sounds awful.

633
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,210
I vowed to my uncle that I
would restore him to power.

634
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,020
And that's where I was this afternoon--
meeting with one of his friends,

635
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,960
a diplomat,who is going to help us.

636
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:57,120
Oh,kai. Oh,kai.

637
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,480
Telling the truth is so erotic.

638
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,270
Flush with love,juliet
decided she had to help kai

639
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,920
and the freedom fighters
liberate the coquilles islands,

640
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,890
so the next day...

641
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,420
jeremy got a phone call.

642
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,130
- jeremy.
- Jules.

643
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,720
You okay? I've been
worried sick about you.

644
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,410
I have called you,like,a million times.

645
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,520
I don't have my phone.
I don't need it anymore.

646
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,230
What? Where are you?

647
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,860
I'm at the airport...

648
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,290
waiting for my plane.

649
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,290
What? No,no. You have to come back.

650
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,190
I love you,jeremy,but I have
more than you to worry about.

651
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,810
The world's falling
apart at the seams and...

652
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,760
well,I'm going to the coquilles
islands to try and stop it.

653
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,770
- What?
- It's a revolution,jeremy.

654
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,460
We're trying to restore justice.

655
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,630
- Juliet.
- okay.

656
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,500
Um,I gotta go.

657
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,930
My--my plane's
about to board.

658
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,970
No! Wait!

659
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,760
Jeremy darling...

660
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,340
you are my best friend in the whole
world,and I'm gonna miss you so much.

661
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,140
- Juliet...
- I love you.

662
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,610
Au revoir,mon frere.

663
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,940
Is juliet ever going to come back home?

664
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,020
That's classified...
for military reasons.

665
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,840
Speaking of classified,I
am having a really hard time

666
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,890
getting my hands on a
mysteriously unaired interview

667
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,960
that patrick darling gave to dan
rather just before the debate.

668
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,810
Care to comment on why the
network decided not to run it?

669
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,880
Better story probably came along.

670
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,490
Maybe britney flashed her
nether region that day.

671
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,160
Maybe,but,um,we've contacted
people involved with the interview

672
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,350
who confirm that the network shelved
it because mr. Rather asked patrick...

673
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,710
uncomfortable questions.

674
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,780
About what?

675
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,030
About the night ellen darling
"accidentally" died in the fire.

676
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,370
What did patrick say in that interview?

677
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,120
Did he confess to killing his wife?

678
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,230
You have some fanciful ideas about how
far the power of this family extends.

679
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,440
You think the darlings could keep
a lid on a taped murder confession?

680
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,000
Fine. I'll just run the
ellen story with your denial

681
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,200
and possible involvement.

682
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,580
Oh,wait.

683
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,910
Did you say the dan rather interview?

684
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,780
Starting to come back to you,clark?

685
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,680
That interview was...

686
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,830
a little uncomfortable.

687
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,190
But...

688
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,020
it didn't have anything
to do with ellen's death.

689
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,180
It was about booK.

690
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,920
Renata lennox. Darling family publicist.

691
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,140
Not patrick darling.

692
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,990
- And what about your mom?
- What about her?

693
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,030
She needs to be rescued,thanks to this.

694
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,630
I...

695
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,610
I wrote that book many years ago.

696
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,390
Well,and some reporter today
dug up quotes from it about,

697
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,520
how'd you put it,your
mother's "passionate fury"?

698
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,430
Something like that,yeah.

699
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,110
That kind of salacious sound
bite takes on a whole new meaning

700
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,800
under the glare of murder charges.

701
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,670
your father wants you
to start the spin cycle.

702
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,620
I have a press schedule all laid out.

703
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,580
patrick was more than willing

704
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,650
to defend his unfortunate
choice of words in the book.

705
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,170
I'll have to get back to you on that.

706
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,900
There was only one problem-- they
weren't his words to begin with.

707
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,100
"Government censorship of the arts
"evoked my mother's passionate fury.

708
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,450
"And so she fought for all of
us,"but especially you,rodin,"

709
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,980
and you,carpeaux,with your gypsy dancS.

710
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,770
" so you see,dan,this "passionate fury"

711
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,030
that everyone's making such a fuss
over had nothing to do with violence.

712
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,280
It was about her support
of artistic freedom.

713
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,180
And her passion for parisian sculpture.

714
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,740
Sickening how these things can
be taken out of context,isn't it?

715
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,700
It's a plague,dan,truly.

716
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,350
In the book,I was touched by your reaction
to your uncle kenneth's assassination.

717
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,910
To console you,your
mother gave you a kitten.

718
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,020
That's right. Snowball.

719
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,490
No. You said it was
named after caesar trunzO.

720
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,310
You swore you'd name all your
cats after new york senators.

721
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,820
well,there were so many cats--
talmadge,wadsworth,javits.

722
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,490
There were a lot of senators,but
I've never met one named snowball.

723
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,450
You didn't write this
book,did you,mr. Darling?

724
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,500
So the darlings buried
the rather interview

725
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,980
to protect senator patrick
darling from a book scandal?

726
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,740
oh,well,it's not exactly the
article I came here looking for.

727
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:39,250
Still,the newly elected junior
senator of new york-- a plagiarist?

728
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,040
That'll do.

729
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,510
Wait. Wait.

730
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,450
You-- you can't
print that story.

731
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,660
Hey,I-I told you this in confidence.

732
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,100
This wasn't in our deal.

733
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,030
We never had a deal. Sorry.

734
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,240
Wait,you're making a mistake.

735
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,690
Is that a threat?

736
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,130
No. No.

737
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,710
Look,you--you can print
these stories,sure.

738
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,100
But do you have any idea the kind of
front-page scandals that go on in this place,

739
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,970
the kind of stuff that
careers are made of?

740
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,590
I--I'll tell you what,I
will make you a deal.

741
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,980
Go on.

742
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,850
I can be your source.

743
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,450
Just keep quiet on these,and I will
feed you the good stuff as it comes.

744
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,390
Really?

745
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,720
Would I lie to you?

746
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,800
Sounds like a win-win situation.

747
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,030
- we'll talk soon.
- You bet.

748
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,310
Oh,and,clark,happy thanksgiving.

749
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,060
Happy thanksgiving.

750
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,730
the fantini brothers have a long
and tempestuous history with us.

751
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,660
testify in the fantini brothers case.

752
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,790
obstruction of
justice--that's a felony.

753
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,050
- why don't you want to testify?
- they're mobsters,brian.

754
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,220
I'm a little parched myself.

755
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,840
- First question...
- the fantini brothers...

756
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
- talk to these fantini brothers.
- The fantini brothers...

757
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,330
- all of their foul corruptions...
- ethically pristine.

758
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,920
my,how,uh,things have changed.

759
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,330
you have no proof of anything.

760
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,940
- But do I have to meet your son?
- Elon is a great kiD. You'll love him.

761
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,160
- ...A 16 year old boy what he really wants.
- princess ama of wherever.

762
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,210
a few bumps along the road.

763
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,510
he doesn't sound 16.

764
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,140
Don't quote me on that last
part,but you get the picture.

765
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,190
- I can't wait to see the ferragamo charity fashion show.
- I was so looking forward to that fashion show.

766
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,840
Could you get me the number
for the folks at ferragamo?

767
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm their biggest client.

768
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,120
you clearly don't know letitia
darling. she can't leave.

769
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,760
- Clark,do you understand?
- come on,clark.

770
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,880
- Admit it. - yes,sir. - I
almost feel sorry for letitia.

771
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,820
- Then don't run the story.
- Letitia darling's a murderer.

772
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,220
- I can clear all this up.
- Where is juliet darling?

773
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,020
jeremy...

774
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,570
My uncle is jean-pierre desjardins...

775
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,930
this is about kai and the
big secret he was keeping.

776
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,720
- Former president of the coquilles islands.
- And took the government...

777
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,110
is juliet ever going to come back home?

778
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,720
that's classified.

779
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I am having a really hard
time getting my hands...

780
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,300
- "passionate fury"...
- on a mysteriously unaired interview

781
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,180
that patrick darling gave to dan
rather just before the debate.

782
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,640
- Uncomfortle questions.
- snowball.

783
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,650
Did it work?

784
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,520
Like a charm.

785
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,530
hello.

786
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh,hello,mr. Darling.

787
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,470
No. Everything's been quiet around here.

788
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,600
Nothing to worry about,sir.

789
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,760
You just enjoy the holiday.

790
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,400
Happy thanksgiving to you
as well,and to the family.

791
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,870
Good night,mr. Darling.
