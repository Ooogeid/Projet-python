1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:03,529
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:06,070
until his plane went down
in Long Island sound.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:08,498
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--

4
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:10,189
Tripp, the empire builder...

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,398
You're gonna have to start
trusting me sometime.

6
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,235
Letitia, the
sophisticated socialite...

7
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:16,152
Your father was my great love.

8
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:17,415
Brian, the man of God...

9
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,412
I lied to my wife and
daughters last night.

10
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:21,000
I told them that you were an orphan.

11
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,676
I want you and that boy out of this
house until I figure out what to do.

12
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,355
Patrick, the
principled politician...

13
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,067
You have to get your house in order.

14
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,523
Karen, the professional divorcee...

15
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:31,310
Using the chapel for your
fourth marriage would just be

16
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,381
insulting to the rest
of the marrying public.

17
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,420
Karen, do not call me on
the home phone number.

18
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:36,923
I'll always love you, too.

19
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:38,760
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

20
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:39,261
Oh, my god!

21
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:41,701
I've been thinking lately,
and I should get a job, right?

22
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:43,401
My father was working
for someone else.

23
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,873
You should come work for me,
finish what your father started.

24
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,710
You getting anything out of that better
Manhattan conference so far, Nick?

25
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,213
Oh, it's interesting--
bunch of billionaires talking about

26
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,150
how much real estate
they own in the city.

27
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:59,172
Yeah. Well,
it's pretty small potatoes, really.

28
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,991
The reason people come
here is for the game.

29
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:04,833
The game?

30
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:08,082
The game-- a high stakes poker game.

31
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:11,001
It's been going on for about 40 years.
$20 million just to get in.

32
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:15,750
Simon Elder's gonna be there this year.
First time.

33
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:21,383
Well, I guess now's the time to
take this baby to the next level.

34
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:23,661
- Really?
- Yeah,

35
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:27,341
and from what I heard,
it was Dutch got him invited into the game.

36
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:31,382
Would've been one of the
last things your dad did.

37
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:34,093
I guess Mr.
Elder didn't bring that up

38
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,072
when he had dinner with you, did he?

39
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,893
No, he never mentioned it.

40
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:41,521
He had time to accuse me of
murdering my best friend,

41
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:44,521
but he didn't get
around to telling you

42
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:47,820
what he and my best friend
were actually up to.

43
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,980
- I think it was more than poker.
- I do, too.

44
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,181
Well, the game is not
for another two days.

45
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,672
So let us get back to the party.

46
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,342
- Hi, Nick.
- Hey, Karen.

47
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,222
Hello.

48
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,230
- Thank you for not avoiding me.
- I haven't been avoiding you.

49
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,011
Oh, don't fib.
You've been a little distant since Italy.

50
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,412
- Well, it hasn't been intentional.
- Mm. Okay.

51
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,142
Ahem. Hey, baby.

52
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:12,543
- Hi.
- Freddy.

53
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:15,543
So... did you ask about the thing?

54
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,523
Oh, right. Yes. We need a favor.

55
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,552
Freddy and I have been so overwhelmed
with wedding planning that we...

56
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:23,122
we need you to go down to city
hall and get our marriage license.

57
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,940
You know,
do some of that lawyer magic?

58
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,012
You have to sign the
license in person, Karen.

59
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,321
- They haven't changed that law yet.
- Nope, not yet.

60
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,571
Huh. Not even for regular customers?

61
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,063
Seems like there ought to
be some sort of reward or

62
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,991
fringe benefit or something, right?

63
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:36,922
Sorry.

64
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,163
You want a cupcake?

65
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:42,272
I already had three at
Magnolia with Juliet.

66
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:45,222
- But okay.
- That where you two were?

67
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,982
Yeah. She talked about
Natalie Kimpton for hours.

68
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:51,741
- What a slut.
- Hey, don't use that word.

69
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,671
What time you want me at
your office tomorrow?

70
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,403
- 6:00? 5:00?
- 9:00's fine.

71
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,143
Ah, banker's hours. Okay.

72
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,292
- Are you ready for this?
- Ready? I am drooling.

73
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm gonna be a member
of the working class.

74
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,913
- I'm gonna make dad proud.
- See you then.

75
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,303
When Patrick was introduced
to Gerald Ford...

76
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,081
Just before he took
over the presidency.

77
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,661
He had some words of advice for the man.
I love this story.

78
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:18,292
Patrick. Tell Larry what
you said to Jerry Ford.

79
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:24,430
Oh, you tell him, dad.
That was your proud moment, not mine.

80
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:31,231
He said,
"restore dignity to the White House, sir."

81
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:33,203
He was 8 years old.

82
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:36,233
Dignity.

83
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,151
Yowza!

84
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,901
Oh! Oh.

85
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,992
That... was a gold
medal performance.

86
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:48,932
Thanks.

87
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,270
What's the matter, baby?

88
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:57,572
Sometimes, it...
sometimes it's just kind of depressing.

89
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,901
The only thing intimate that
ever takes place between us

90
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:05,580
happens in hotel rooms and limousines,
never in public.

91
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:10,150
Doing what we just did in public
is illegal in most states.

92
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,632
I hate being a secret.

93
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,212
I know.

94
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,101
Hey, you want to go back to Vermont?

95
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,761
We can, uh, you know,
take a weekend.

96
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,392
Going to Vermont is just
another giant secret.

97
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,691
- I'm married and running for senate.
- I can't help how I feel, Pat.

98
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:30,432
We've never even stood in
the street and kissed.

99
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:34,112
Just kissed.

100
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,983
- See?
- See? This isn't so bad.

101
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,172
Did you ever think maybe this is
why I don't want to do it? Hmm?

102
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,750
Because it's hard to feel
free with you and then

103
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,770
not want to feel that
way all the time.

104
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:07,692
God. You are gonna be
president some day.

105
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,460
- Oh, yeah?
- You always know just what to say.

106
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,601
Hey, Patrick!
Take a look over here, sweetie.

107
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,582
- Whoa! Get down!
- Yeah! Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:22,212
- Thanks a lot, sucker! shut up!
- Get over here!

109
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,980
What are you gonna do, Nick?

110
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:26,433
That photo gets out,
dad's gonna crucify me.

111
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,891
Well, with all due respect, Pat,

112
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,991
you should've thought about
that before making a spectacle.

113
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,760
She's tired of being a secret, okay?

114
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,081
Then she should go out with
somebody who isn't married,

115
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,051
who isn't running for the
senate and who isn't a Darling.

116
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,481
That doesn't make
it right for people

117
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,433
to stalk their fellow
human beings with cameras.

118
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,713
I mean, if everything everybody
did was captured on film,

119
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,733
none of us would look like
very good people, right?

120
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,751
Look, Pat,
I'm sure some creep is gonna try and sell us

121
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,050
the negatives or the memory card
for a million dollars any day now.

122
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,771
- Any day is too late.
- Detective Larrabee on two.

123
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,870
Okay. Look, we're just gonna have to
sit back and wait. Hang on a second.

124
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,651
Hello.

125
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:58,421
I'm just calling to let you
know that the NTSB report

126
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:00,580
on your dad's plane
crash came in today.

127
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,271
- What did it say?
- That's the police?

128
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:06,592
It's clean. No evidence of foul play,
no tampering whatsoever.

129
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,230
- Run-of-the-mill engine failure.
- Okay.

130
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,063
- Is it about the photos?
- No.

131
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:15,391
I don't know what to say, Mr.
George. I'm sorry your father's gone.

132
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,213
I know how badly you wanted to

133
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,790
hold someone responsible for
this horrible accident, but...

134
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,703
that's just what it was,
an accident.

135
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,931
And accidents happen.

136
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:30,402
Yeah. Yeah, they do.

137
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,222
Thank you.

138
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,141
You want some coffee?

139
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:57,653
No.

140
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:02,313
- A bagel? A bear claw?
- I'm okay. Thank you.

141
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,802
- Anything?
- No. I just...

142
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,642
I guess I'm trying to figure
out what I'm supposed to do...

143
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,510
now that I don't have to
find out who killed my dad.

144
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,996
Maybe you should just...

145
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,155
start missing him?

146
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,327
Sorry I'm late.

147
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,141
It's 9:00 somewhere, dude.
Time for work.

148
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:32,142
Okay, Darling luxury hotels.
Your family owns 23 properties in the U.S.

149
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,211
And 32 throughout Europe and Asia.

150
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,541
Hotel rooms are only good for one thing,
Nick-- smells like trouble.

151
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,973
Darling live-- four sports stadiums,
three arenas and nine concert venues.

152
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,941
Nah, it would kill
me to be that close

153
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,531
to the limelight and not be a part of it.
I'm sorry. Pass.

154
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,913
Darling farms-- the largest organic
produce company in the United States.

155
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:52,930
I like the crazy boots, but, uh,

156
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,472
come on, dude. Cows? They're scary.

157
00:07:57,046 --> 00:08:00,822
Darling pharmaceuticals.
Let's skip this one.

158
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:03,401
Darling developments--
23 office towers,

159
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:06,042
62 apartment buildings,
10,000 residents.

160
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,282
Can I be, like, the janitor or something,
like the fix it guy?

161
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,491
Well, what exactly can you fix?

162
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,343
Okay, that's a good point.

163
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:15,933
Jeremy, I'll tell you what,

164
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,562
why don't we start with
what you're good at?

165
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,942
Well, I've always had this
uncanny ability to just chill.

166
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,910
You know, like I could be
sitting in a chair and it's 2:00.

167
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,682
Next thing I know-- boom! 4:00.

168
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,893
So zoning out,
that's your special skill?

169
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,852
I can drive a car.

170
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,411
- That's not a special skill.
- Oh, it is the way I drive.

171
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,652
Oh, god,
I always forget how long this takes.

172
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,073
Bureaucracy just another
name for mediocrity.

173
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,353
Freddy, you're gonna
need to stop that.

174
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,801
Karen Darling.

175
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:51,802
That's me.

176
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,393
Hey, it's you. How nice to see you.

177
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,552
Nice to see you again, Ms. Darling.
Is this number three, four?

178
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:03,652
Four. But he's number
one in my heart. Mwah.

179
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,100
Of course he is.

180
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,552
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

181
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,361
- Is there a problem?
- Unfortunately, yes.

182
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,091
Polyandry's illegal
in New York state.

183
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,943
- What'd you just call me?
- Freddy, relax.

184
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,340
What did-- what--
what did you just call him?

185
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,500
Ms. Darling, you're still married.

186
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:25,063
- To whom?
- Your last husband. Sebastian fleet.

187
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,741
No, we were divorced, like, three--
three years ago.

188
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:29,573
He never signed the papers.

189
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,851
You're gonna need to
take care of this.

190
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,433
- Paul Cotley.
- Baby!

191
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:46,613
No. Clark, tell Patrick the
drive-through window is closed.

192
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:49,141
Ma'am, if you could just
get in the car, please.

193
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,201
It's important.

194
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,123
So what do you want?

195
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,472
- Here.
- What are these?

196
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,920
Pictures.

197
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,362
You hired that photographer.

198
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:17,462
I've tried and tried to make it
clear to Patrick just how much

199
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:21,281
he stands to lose by maintaining
this alliance, but to no avail.

200
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:22,693
None.

201
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:27,073
So I find myself compelled to
rely upon your good judgment

202
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:34,391
and the support of this...
sadly necessary object lesson.

203
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,892
How long do you think it would
be before Paddy's opponents sent

204
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,560
someone after the two of you to
document this embarrassment?

205
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,952
How long, honestly,
do you think this can endure?

206
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:46,062
I've thought the same thing.

207
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,502
There's a cashier's
check in this envelope...

208
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:58,400
for considerably more money than you
will require to relocate anywhere.

209
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,262
And believe me,
no one knows better than I do

210
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,890
that money is cold comfort
in the absence of love.

211
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,602
So it is with the...

212
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,513
utmost compassion...

213
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,842
and goodwill

214
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,632
that I appeal to whatever genuine
feelings you have for my son,

215
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,130
and implore you to...

216
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,231
let him go.

217
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,770
This liaison is impossible.

218
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:30,911
- Mr. Darling... Tripp?
- Tripp.

219
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:35,672
I am a living, breathing testament
to the fact that nothing--

220
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,593
and I mean nothing-- is impossible.

221
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,242
I'm gonna do you the favor
of not telling Patrick

222
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:46,912
we had this conversation because
he would be terribly hurt.

223
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,572
And that's the last thing I want.

224
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,371
I see where Patrick
gets his good looks.

225
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,780
- So I'd manage the whole structure?
- No, you'd be working here...

226
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:09,823
Parking cars.

227
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:14,543
Right. We start at the bottom,
common-man style. I forgot about that.

228
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,511
And you'll be working for this man.

229
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,623
Lou Mack,
I want you to meet Jeremy Darling.

230
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,913
- Hello, Lou. I recognize you.
- I was your doorman for eight years.

231
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,243
Yeah, you were. I didn't recognize
you without the, uh, epaulets.

232
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:30,181
Lou is my boss.
I love it. Full circle.

233
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,153
Does everyone get a clipboard?

234
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:37,961
- Nick George.
- Nick, it's Simon Elder.

235
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:41,161
You know, your dad got me into
this crazy poker game tomorrow.

236
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:42,673
Yeah, Tripp told me.

237
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,980
Personally, I think this
whole thing's distasteful--

238
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:48,181
bunch of puffed-up peacocks
gambling away people's

239
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,963
homes and offices as if
life were no more than...

240
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,163
- A card game?
- Yeah, right.

241
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:56,272
But sometimes,
a little distasteful behavior is necessary.

242
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:57,943
Your point being?

243
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,142
Well, there's a reason Dutch
made this happen for me.

244
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,472
We had a plan.

245
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,070
You know,

246
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:11,651
when Robert Moses redesigned new
york city for the automobile,

247
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,953
a lot of good came from his work.

248
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,940
- And a lot of bad.
- Yeah, I agree.

249
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,953
He made this whole city
much more unlivable.

250
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,911
I envision a new Manhattan--

251
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,471
cleaner air, better public transportation,
and your dad...

252
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,213
your dad was gonna help
make my vision a reality.

253
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,412
I see.

254
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:37,341
- So what do you want from me?
- At some point,

255
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,872
the stakes for the game tomorrow

256
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:42,183
will get so high that cash
will no longer be enough.

257
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:44,712
Real estate will
become the necurrency.

258
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,551
And what I want from
you is very simple.

259
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:54,250
Convince Tripp to throw
Darling Plaza into the pot.

260
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,402
What part does an 80-year-old,
15-story building

261
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,483
play in the revitalization
of New York city?

262
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:00,963
Don't you worry about that, Nick.

263
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,942
You just get that piece
of land in the pot,

264
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:05,340
and I will win that hand.
What do you say?

265
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,412
I don't think so.

266
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,550
I'm not sure Tripp would go for it,
and frankly,

267
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,541
I don't know if you're
telling me the truth.

268
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:15,682
- About?
- About my father.

269
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:17,600
That's fair.

270
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,401
That's fair.

271
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,290
I heard you got the clean NTSB
report on your dad's plane crash.

272
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:33,091
You should know, that report

273
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:35,822
was doctored long before
the police ever got it.

274
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:37,482
Really?

275
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,500
- It's a fake.
- A fake?

276
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,622
Now if you really want to
find out who killed your dad,

277
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:47,290
you do this for me. And...
I'll get the real report for you.

278
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,212
- Just think about it.
- Okay?

279
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,093
Okay?

280
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,480
All right, Tobey looked at me,
he's freaking out.

281
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:06,660
I said, "man, you have no choice.
You have to be Spidey."

282
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,540
I taught him this action.

283
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,580
The rest is movie history.

284
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,540
I got this one.

285
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,902
Gracias.

286
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,322
Hey, Jules.

287
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,810
You would not believe the
girl whose car I'm parking.

288
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,783
- Be careful.
- No need. I'm a vehicular ninja.

289
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:41,601
I'm talking about your heart.
You are on the rebound.

290
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:43,430
I'm just parking her car.

291
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,501
Oh, do you know where
your binoculars are?

292
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,330
Little Brian needs them for polo.

293
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,101
Jeremy?

294
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:50,551
Jeremy?

295
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:53,942
Nick, I need you to come with me.
Karen if I go with you,

296
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,122
then your ex is gonna want to
have his lawyer come with him--

297
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:57,891
Never bring a lawyer
if you don't have to.

298
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,911
Exactly. Just go get divorced.

299
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:04,051
No, but, Nick, I can't face him alone.
You know Sebastian.

300
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,932
- No, Karen, I don't.
- Hey, Daisy,

301
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:07,730
where are the rest of
the real estate files?

302
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,272
Which ones, Darling Plaza,
Darling financial center, the hotels?

303
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,583
All of them. I need all of them.

304
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,703
- All right, so Sebastian...
- Yes, Sebastian Fleet.

305
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:20,251
- World-renowned anthropologist?
- "People's" sexiest man alive?

306
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,220
In the anthropology category, yes.

307
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,842
- He's got a pretty incredible heinie.
- I know.

308
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:28,392
- Thank you for that, Daisy.
- He's got a hold on me, Nick.

309
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:32,521
It's magnetic.
It's electric. It's sexual.

310
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,883
- I get it, Karen.
- I will eat him alive!

311
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,761
- You're getting married in three months.
- I know.

312
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,252
So exercise a little self-control.

313
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:41,832
What if I can't?
What if I cheat on Freddy, and he--

314
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,333
oh, god-- and he dumps me?

315
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,050
Well, that sex tape you made with
his caddie didn't seem to faze him.

316
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:48,480
Oh, I know, but Sebastian and I,
we were married.

317
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,930
- He activates my yoni--
- Karen, I'm not comin'.

318
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,581
Fine. Okay. Yeah, don't.

319
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:04,671
But... letting me risk
ruining my marriage to Freddy,

320
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,640
sure makes it seem like
you want me free for you...

321
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,882
and that's selfish. Thanks, Nick.

322
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,203
If Nick doesn't find these pictures,
I'm screwed.

323
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,983
Come on, Nick, Nick, Nick.

324
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,410
- Nick's not answering.
- Patrick, you need to relax.

325
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,672
Oh, relax?
This story could break any second.

326
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:27,222
My whole life could go up in flames.
You want me to relax?

327
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,153
- The story's not gonna break.
- How could you be so sure?

328
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:40,010
- Are you insane?
- I want what's best for you.

329
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:42,752
Oh, so you want to buy off the
woman that I love behind my back?

330
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,661
You do not know yourself
well enough to manage--

331
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,183
I don't need to know myself, dad.
I know you.

332
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:50,073
When are you gonna get it
through your thick skull

333
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,653
that you can't control me anymore?

334
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:54,900
Patrick, when your uncle
Kenneth was taken from us,

335
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,092
your destiny was sealed.

336
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:02,002
It is my deepest,
most heartfelt belief...

337
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:07,122
that a moment is coming in history when you,
Patrick, you

338
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:12,972
will play an important role in the
unfolding mystery of human freedom.

339
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,180
That's what politics is.

340
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,390
That's what you need
to be a part of,

341
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,742
freedom, not license.

342
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:24,440
And you should know
that she promised me

343
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,942
that she would not
tell you about this.

344
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:31,553
- I'm glad that she did.
- No, Patrick, you don't understand.

345
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:34,410
She lied to me.

346
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:38,102
She lies. She can't be trusted.

347
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:41,113
She-- you're the one
that's not to be trusted!

348
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,800
You know what? We're done!

349
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,100
- Patrick--
- You're sick, dad.

350
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,012
You are unwell.
I am tired of it all--

351
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:52,120
the money, the advice, the support,
all of it. We are done.

352
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,522
I mean it.

353
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,011
- What do you guys think?
- Ooh.

354
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,613
I think you're screwed, man.

355
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:10,171
Man. I knew I shoulda
learned how to fix stuff!

356
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,620
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry, man.

357
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,582
Hey, hey. Don't worry, man.

358
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,551
Hey, at least they
can't fire you, right?

359
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:18,441
I got it.

360
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,792
Hey, Jeremy, where you goin', dude?

361
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,703
I know how to fix it!

362
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:41,021
Sorry about the wait.
I just wanted to get it washed for you--

363
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:44,602
- Aw, that's so sweet.
- No tip. Maybe next time.

364
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,340
How'd you get it
fixed in 30 minutes?

365
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:53,340
I bought her a new car
and changed the plates.

366
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,083
When's lunch break?

367
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:58,631
- No. No.
- Ok. This one?

368
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,221
No, no. I hate that.

369
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:03,281
Oh, Nick.
Could I have a word with you?

370
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,060
- Scarlet?
- No, no, I like red,

371
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,032
but we're not doing
a monsoon wedding.

372
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:13,322
I need you to keep an eye on
Tripp at the all-important game.

373
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:14,811
Okay.

374
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,871
He gets very competitive
with that crowd.

375
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,381
He'd never admit it, but he does.

376
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,433
If someone puts him up to a dare,
he'll take it.

377
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,460
He will not walk away from a bet.

378
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,621
So I need you to make sure that he--

379
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,341
well, he doesn't make a fool of himself.
Has he done that before?

380
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,910
- See this finger?
- Yes.

381
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,211
Upon this finger, do you see the
most valuable emerald in the world?

382
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,331
He lost it last year at the game.

383
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,971
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Merci.

384
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,831
- You got the deeds?
- Right here.

385
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:47,981
It's gonna be a real good game.
What'd you round up for me to bet with?

386
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,471
Foundry's bringing half of Harlem.

387
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,621
Mostly just what you talked about--

388
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:56,150
the building on fifth and a few
smaller hotels, Darling Plaza.

389
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,500
Listen now, Tripp,
I know that since we're--

390
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:00,043
Hang on, hang on.

391
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:04,362
Darling Plaza? No. No, no, no.

392
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:08,171
Darling Plaza was our
first home in Manhattan.

393
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:10,613
It was a gift.
Letitia's father gave it to me.

394
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:13,141
Patrick and Karen were born there.

395
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:17,432
I wouldn't sell it let alone
risk it on a game of cards.

396
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,542
Tripp, the fact that it's that
important to you could be useful...

397
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:22,891
- as a bluff.
- Nick, what's going on?

398
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:25,520
I said Darling Plaza
is off the table.

399
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,441
It's off the table. I don't understand.
What's got into you?

400
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:47,102
- Karen?
- Sebastian.

401
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,200
- You were showering?
- No.

402
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:53,812
Okay. Can you sign these, please?

403
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,783
They put these sweet
little stickies on here

404
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:59,413
so you'd know just where to
put your john hanc-hancock.

405
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:02,281
You look beautiful, as always.

406
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:06,931
Sign please. Just-- just sign these.

407
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,072
I'm not sure what went
wrong here, Karen.

408
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,473
I signed those the
first time around.

409
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,873
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,302
I gave 'em to that, what,
the guy from the Netherlands?

411
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:17,192
- Netherlands?
- Oh, you mean Dutch?

412
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,793
You signed them and
you gave them to Dutch?

413
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:22,533
Yeah, yeah, that guy. No problem.

414
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,851
I'll sign 'em again.
Want to come in, have a drink?

415
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:28,092
I'm brewing a little cocoa tea from Peru.
It's quite relaxing.

416
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:30,302
Mnh-mnh. See,
I see what you're doing here.

417
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:32,433
I'm not doing anything,
Karen, besides asking my wife

418
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:36,143
to come in and make herself comfortable.
Come in.

419
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,803
Have some tea.

420
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:46,052
- Oh, you lost your towel.
- No, it tastes better naked.

421
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,591
I remember.

422
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:57,591
- Simon.
- I guess I'm late.

423
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,510
Simon Elder.

424
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,170
Nice to see you again.

425
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:04,402
Hey, I've been meaning to
tell you how sorry I am.

426
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,403
- Sorry?
- About Dutch.

427
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:11,432
But you're lucky 'cause you
got this guy on your team.

428
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,860
Well, you're right there.

429
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:15,823
I am lucky.

430
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,412
I am extremely lucky.

431
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,383
You ready to play some cards?

432
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:22,712
Absolutely.

433
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:29,333
Oh, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

434
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:33,810
Um, I guess, uh,
I should sign these now, huh?

435
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,053
Hey. Oh,
you're finally marrying Nick George, huh?

436
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:44,523
Yeah, Nick. Wait. No. No.
No, no, no, no. Um, not Nick.

437
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:47,382
What are you talking about?
His name's all over this thing.

438
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:50,213
Yeah, because Nick's my lawyer.
I'm marrying Freddy.

439
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:52,042
- He's a golfer.
- Oh.

440
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,231
So you're gonna do it all
over again to somebody else?

441
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,350
Do what?

442
00:23:58,117 --> 00:23:59,332
Nothing.

443
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:00,970
You just be happy.

444
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:03,771
Sebastian...

445
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,311
we were happy.

446
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,882
Why didn't it work out with us?

447
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,710
Come on. I was never around.
I was always out somewhere eating

448
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,960
psychogenic plants or
doing ritual circumcisions.

449
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,353
Mm. Right. That's right.

450
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:20,170
Even when I was here...
I was never Nick.

451
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,422
That was part of it.

452
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,800
There you go.

453
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,682
It was nice being married to you.

454
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:37,183
And it was nice being married to you,
too, Karen.

455
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,192
It really was.

456
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:54,082
Oh, come on. What are you turkeys
doing in my room? Get out.

457
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:57,331
Dude, this is my game. Little squirt jr.
Must have brought it in here.

458
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,210
Have you seen him? He was supposed
to be back with Juliet an hour ago.

459
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,260
- Ooh.
- Crash.

460
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:05,753
The great kazoo here wrecked a
car his first day on the job--

461
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:09,002
Hey! It's all good. I replaced it.
She didn't even notice.

462
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,593
Well, aren't you bothered at all?

463
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:12,852
Doesn't your conscience
feel the tiniest prick?

464
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,262
Not until you walked in, Bri,

465
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:18,151
and I'm still not really feeling it.
Oh! Victorious!

466
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:19,942
- Oh, damn it!
- Damn it!

467
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:24,103
- Oh, you want some punishment?
- Dream on.

468
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:26,483
Come on, Brian.

469
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,301
Everybody in this family gets
away with everything but me.

470
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:30,931
Oh, yeah? Do you see these calluses?

471
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,752
They're from gripping
steering wheels all day.

472
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,043
Please. I'm running for senate,

473
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,500
and my whole life's being run
like a puppet show by dad.

474
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,792
You see, you see?
Nobody gets away with anything around here.

475
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:40,840
Your crap just finally
caught up with you.

476
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:43,573
- Bonjour.
- Where's juliet?

477
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:44,780
She dropped me off.

478
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,350
Pay dirt.

479
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:48,570
Suck it!

480
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:49,403
Yeah!

481
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:52,183
- Still the king.
- Give it, baby. Give it.

482
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,100
Whoa. Oh!

483
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:57,620
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- What, when you go to Washington?

484
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:03,272
Yeah. When I go to Washington.

485
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:08,521
Raise.

486
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:17,141
I'm not feeling self-destructive.

487
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:19,153
$80 million to you, sir.

488
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:27,571
Well, I guess now's the time to take
this baby to the next level, right?

489
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,741
Woodmere Plaza--

490
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:35,380
two connected retail
buildings on Broadway.

491
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:39,532
Appraised last week at $101 million.

492
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:48,711
Darling financial center.

493
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:54,013
- How about Darling Plaza?
- We discussed this, Nick.

494
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,913
There's no reason to
bet the farm, Tripp.

495
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:57,593
- You're out of line, Nick.
- Maybe,

496
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,021
but I can't advise staking
your most profitable building.

497
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,660
I told you not even to bring
the damn deed to the boat.

498
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:13,262
Tripp, don't confuse
sentimentality with business.

499
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,282
Darling Plaza hasn't
made money in years.

500
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:18,670
Il ne pas confondre avec le
prix est la valeur du chose.

501
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:22,722
- Don't confuse the price with the value--
- With the value of the thing. I got it.

502
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:26,630
Now look, the building is paralyzed
by rent control until 2010.

503
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:29,180
It needs over $10 million worth
of structural improvements.

504
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,321
How many times do I have
to explain this to you?

505
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,032
- Would you just trust me, Tripp?
- Nick--

506
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:37,030
Trust me. Just trust me.

507
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:40,983
Well, come on, Darling. Pony up.

508
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,612
Look, all you have to
do is win the hand,

509
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:52,153
and you won't lose anything.

510
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:02,052
Unless you don't think you can win.

511
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:24,562
Darling Plaza.

512
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,333
Sorry I'm late.

513
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,201
- Where have you been?
- Oh, getting my divorce.

514
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:36,902
- And how is Sebastian?
- Fine. Same as ever.

515
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:38,862
Perfect.

516
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,751
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Absolutely.

517
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:48,963
- Tell me you didn't.
- I didn't.

518
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:53,240
- I didn't!
- Oh, you are unbelievable.

519
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:56,210
He wasn't going to sign otherwise.
I had to.

520
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:58,392
How do you expect to make
a fresh start with Freddy

521
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:00,303
if you're still sleeping
with your ex-husband?

522
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,173
He wasn't my ex-husband at the
actual time of the coupling.

523
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,862
We were technically still married.

524
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:08,163
- Karen, your behavior--
- Is what it is. Fine.

525
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:12,811
I wouldn't have had to go over there
and behave at all if it wasn't for you.

526
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:16,111
- And what does that mean?
- Dutch never filed the papers.

527
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,410
- And how is that my fault?
- Well, I'm sure

528
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:20,200
when he was supposed
to be filing them,

529
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:23,971
he was in some hotel doing to you
what Sebastian just did to me.

530
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:30,941
- Don't be disgusting.
- I'm not the one who's disgusting.

531
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:33,770
Look, I know what you think of me,
but don't you think it kills me

532
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,651
to see you making the
same mistakes I did?

533
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,121
- What mistakes?
- Putting three people in your marriage.

534
00:29:38,217 --> 00:29:42,081
- Mother, I divorced Sebastian.
- I'm not talking about Sebastian.

535
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,392
I'm talking about Nick.

536
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,020
I call.

537
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:51,101
Wilkes housing project.

538
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:54,721
The pot now contains over $400
million in cash and property.

539
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,503
No more bets so we stay
under $500 million as agreed.

540
00:29:58,015 --> 00:29:58,991
River card.

541
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:04,393
Gentlemen.

542
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:08,613
Straight.

543
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,241
Flush, all hearts.

544
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:26,841
Mr. Elder wins the hand.

545
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:30,220
- Wow. Well done.
- To you. To you.

546
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:34,673
- Tripp, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

547
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:39,671
- I don't know what else to say.
- You can say to my wife that

548
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:43,820
I've lost the building that we spent the
first seven years of our marriage in.

549
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:46,410
No, in fact, I'll say it to her.

550
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:50,262
I don't want to see
you for a few days.

551
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:05,191
I'm telling you, Bridget,
Katie's so-- ow!

552
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,452
- Bye, Bridget.
- Hello?

553
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:11,882
- Did you buy my son a $30,000 watch?
- It was 15% off.

554
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:14,140
- Are you out of your mind?
- No.

555
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:15,413
You're spoiling him rotten!

556
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:18,500
All he does is walk around now and
mouth off and ask for expensive things.

557
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:22,350
You've turned a nice, fake swedish orphan
into your own personal living doll.

558
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:24,283
And a watch?
He can't even tell time.

559
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,303
He asked for it, you jerk.

560
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,313
He only wanted a Patek Philipp
because that's what you wear.

561
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:32,183
I'm just trying to make him
feel like part of the family.

562
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,521
I love hanging out with him,
but you're the one he's always talking about.

563
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:38,770
- I don't have time for this.
- Pfft. You don't have time for him.

564
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:46,013
Well, look who's back
in her brand-new ride.

565
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,562
Oh, this is a sign.

566
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,622
Hello. Welcome back.

567
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,761
Gracias.

568
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:59,022
Uh, can I, um,
talk to you for a second?

569
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,403
- Sure.
- Okay.

570
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:03,903
I'm just gonna come
right out and say this.

571
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:07,041
- This isn't your car.
- Okay.

572
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,591
I just drove it from home.

573
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:11,602
Oh, I know, but, um, that is--
that is your car.

574
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:14,431
- Then whose car is this?
- This is a rental. Um...

575
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:17,432
Yeah, I was gonna switch it
after I got the other one fixed.

576
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:19,430
But, you know, it felt wrong to do--

577
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:22,921
in the interest of full disclosure--
'cause I'm in this phase in my life

578
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,280
where I'm kind of seeking
consequences and--

579
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,672
do you wanna talk to my boss?

580
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,150
No, it's okay.

581
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,111
You told the truth. That's enough...

582
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,150
As long as you fix my car today.

583
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:39,172
- No problem. Thank you.
-  Okay.

584
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:45,730
Uh, can I, uh,
buy you dinner sometime?

585
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:52,431
- That's sweet.
- But you're not my type.

586
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:54,630
Sorry.

587
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:00,580
Why did you say you rented it?

588
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:02,702
Why didn't you just tell
her you bought the car?

589
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,532
I didn't want her to know.

590
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:10,000
Know what, that you're Jeremy Darling?
That's the ultimate closer, man.

591
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,842
Yeah, I know.

592
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:19,542
I thought I told you to
keep an eye on my husband.

593
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:21,710
- Things got a little out of hand.
- A little?

594
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:24,480
You let him gamble away the
one building of ours that

595
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:27,783
actually meant something to me.
Your father never would've done that.

596
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,721
Well, Letitia, I'm not my father.
And that's, you know, a good thing.

597
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:34,570
He was far from perfect.
I know that, but he protected me.

598
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:39,661
He protected all of us from...
Tripp's whims.

599
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:45,593
It was a comfort, and I miss it.
That's all.

600
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:47,470
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it--

601
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:50,011
you're right to push back.
You know...

602
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:53,951
your father and I...
it's funny, we always felt that--

603
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:56,963
that we were sacrificing so much.

604
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:02,601
But I guess everybody was,
knowingly or unknowingly.

605
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:05,753
We were all having
something stolen from us.

606
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:12,593
You know, I really don't know
who's in control anymore, or what.

607
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,053
For Tripp to have gambled
away that building...

608
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,973
Well, mustn't mean as much
to him as it once did.

609
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,683
And that's not your fault,
it's mine.

610
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:40,630
I came as soon as I could.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

611
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:47,422
- You're gonna miss this place.
- I am, actually...

612
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,290
a little bit. I shouldn't, you know?

613
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:54,811
Sitting Bull said,
"the love of possession

614
00:34:55,467 --> 00:35:00,041
is a disease with them," with us.
And it is, he was right.

615
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:08,531
So I try to see that my ownership
of land and property is...

616
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:13,842
part of a larger creative project.

617
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:21,141
And I have tried not
to be... attached.

618
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:24,591
It's done.

619
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,051
How's Jeremy doing?

620
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:30,440
Good. He's working
for Darling parking.

621
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:36,480
You know why I asked you to walk
him around the company, don't you?

622
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:39,811
- I assumed to get him a job.
- No.

623
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:44,383
I wanted you to see all
the aspects of the company

624
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,352
that you are going to run one day.

625
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:50,640
No, it's not anything we have to
talk about right now. I just...

626
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:55,923
wanted you to know that
that's what my wish is.

627
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:06,721
So... when are you gonna meet with
Simon Elder and get that NTSB report?

628
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,243
Tonight.

629
00:36:08,946 --> 00:36:11,340
Tonight? Oh.

630
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:13,541
Thank you, Tripp.

631
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:17,131
For letting this place go.

632
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,853
Darling Plaza was our
first home in Manhattan.

633
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:26,550
I wouldn't sell it let alone
risk it on a game of cards.

634
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:29,612
But, Tripp, the fact that it's so
important to you could be useful...

635
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,062
- as bluff.
- Nick, what's going on?

636
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,601
I said Darling Plaza
is off the table.

637
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:37,193
It's off the table. I don't understand.
What's got into you?

638
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:45,222
Simon Elder told me that if I could
get this property in the game,

639
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,660
that he would get me the real
NTSB report on dad's plane.

640
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,481
He said the original
one had been doctored.

641
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,940
- And you believe him?
- I do.

642
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,933
- I'm not sure why, but I do.
- Why-- why Darling Plaza?

643
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:03,682
You know, he didn't really say.
Just that it's part of some plan.

644
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:05,872
How do we know that he isn't

645
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,171
somehow the one responsible
for doctoring the NTSB report?

646
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:11,260
How do we know he wasn't
implicated in the crash?

647
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,910
He may be, but if I can get him to trust me,
I'll have a way in.

648
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:19,291
And having someone with
inside access to Simon Elder

649
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:22,072
would not be bad for
Darling enterprises,

650
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:25,563
especially if he thinks that you
and I are at odds with one another.

651
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:28,373
You and me, at odds?

652
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,532
- Okay.
- You in?

653
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:34,791
Let's do it.

654
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,621
I love you, Nicky.

655
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:41,741
And I want to find
out who killed Dutch

656
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,090
just as much as you do, maybe more.

657
00:37:45,238 --> 00:37:49,440
And I told you I would
do everything it took.

658
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:55,632
- There you go.
- Thanks, Athen.

659
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,892
Oh, and can I have some
vanilla ice cream?

660
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,060
Okay.

661
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:02,233
Things are gonna be changing
around here, buddy.

662
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:02,983
Like what?

663
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:05,291
Like less time with aunt Juliet,
more time with me.

664
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,722
- Really?
- Yeah,

665
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:10,020
but don't look so happy about it.

666
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,983
No more watches.
No more fancy clothes.

667
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,081
Just some good old-fashioned
father-son time.

668
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,941
What happens during good
old-fashioned father-son time?

669
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:22,150
I don't know yet. I never had any.

670
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:24,123
You could teach me backgammon.

671
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:26,301
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

672
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:31,241
Let me show you something.

673
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:33,773
See...

674
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,050
you cut a hole in the
center of the stack.

675
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:42,340
Otherwise, you only get
syrup on the top pancake.

676
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:48,293
It's a special syrup distribution
method I developed in seminary.

677
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,601
Oh.

678
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,883
- That's cool, huh?
- Yeah. Thanks, dad.

679
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,942
- We'll start with backgammon tomorrow.
- Okay.

680
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:05,082
- Thanks for your help in the poker game.
- You're welcome.

681
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:08,231
- Your father would be proud.
- I'll take your word for that.

682
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,263
So this is what Dutch
and I were working on--

683
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:11,991
a whole new vision for the city.

684
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,340
Those glass buildings--
transparent solar panels.

685
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:18,063
- I'm glad you're now a part of it.
- Me, too.

686
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,362
Well, you didn't come down here
just to see my dream for Manhattan.

687
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:23,572
I'd like to see that report, yes.

688
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,201
No problem.

689
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:34,593
Hello, Mr. George.

690
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:42,802
- You had the dealer?
- There are two reports.

691
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,631
The correct NTSB report which states

692
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:48,880
your dad's crash was indeed
caused by foul play.

693
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,812
And the maintenance report

694
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:53,491
that says only one mechanic
worked on the plane.

695
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,362
It appears a man named Norman
Exley was responsible.

696
00:39:57,286 --> 00:39:58,551
You've heard of him?

697
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:00,552
Yeah.

698
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,810
And I guess he lied to me.

699
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,172
Go to the police, Nick.

700
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:10,271
There's plenty of evidence
for them to look into.

701
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,751
- Thank you, Simon.
- No problem. Thank you.

702
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:17,462
We'll definitely be in touch.

703
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,270
Your next appointment is here.

704
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:28,721
Send him in.

705
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:37,442
- Simon, glad we can finally do this.
- Been a long time coming.

706
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:40,632
- I'll say.
- Please.

707
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,043
Thank you. See you tomorrow. Hi.

708
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,740
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Where are they going?

709
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:52,412
Those are samples, dear.
We're not keeping them for three months.

710
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:56,801
Mommy. Mommy,
Freddy and I are moving the wedding up.

711
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,373
- Really?
- Yeah, well, why wait?

712
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:01,273
The time, she is a ripe.

713
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,301
All right, come on, baby.

714
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,543
Are you sure about this,
after everything that's happened?

715
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:13,882
Yeah. Yeah, you were right.
I don't want three people in my marriage.

716
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:15,852
I'm gonna move forward now.

717
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,061
I have to.

718
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:36,300
You can't deny this is
pretty strong evidence.

719
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:37,420
It is.

720
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:40,253
It proves Exley tampered with the plane.
He killed my father.

721
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,792
You're right.

722
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:44,661
I'm just sorry we can't
arrest him and ask him why.

723
00:41:44,896 --> 00:41:45,820
Why not?

724
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:53,083
Normal Exley was found dead in
his apartment this morning.

725
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:27,993
