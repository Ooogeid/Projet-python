1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,897
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,404
<i>we have wondered
how life began,</i>

3
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:12,209
<i>what our purpose is
and where we are headed.</i>

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,261
<i>We have struggled
to understand time,</i>

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,190
<i>matter, the infinite universe,</i>

6
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:25,681
<i>who we are
and if we are alone.</i>

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,513
<i>Great minds have imagined
the most wonderful</i>

8
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:36,610
<i>and the most terrifying answers
to these questions.</i>

9
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:41,574
<i>We invite you to join us
on this great expedition</i>.

10
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:19,396
<i>As we seek to improve
and refine ourselves,</i>

11
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:22,850
<i>to elevate humankind
to its consummate form,</i>

12
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:26,930
<i>what will become of those
who are less than perfect?</i>

13
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:40,087
You can't go out.
It's the first hand.

14
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,339
- I fold.
- You are so full of it.

15
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:47,766
Do it, Sharon. He's lyin'.

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,630
Play the game.

17
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:56,784
- I call.
- Read 'em and weep... four kings.

18
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,032
- Damn.
- I told you.

19
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,382
You didn't have to listen.

20
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,328
Shuffle the cards.

21
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,182
I can't take anymore.

22
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,174
All right!

23
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,622
Who the hell's gonna clean
this garbage up and blow it outta here?

24
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,758
Okay, okay. Volunteers?

25
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,639
All right, you...
You, you and you.

26
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,376
That's right, the Dullard sisters.

27
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:27,265
Get over there.
Cleanup on aisle 13.

28
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:28,964
Come on, move!

29
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,451
Seriously, I had one
of the very first geno-pets.

30
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,609
They hadn't worked out
all of the bugs, so...

31
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,154
it shifted species depending
on my mood, but...

32
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,094
It was a really good companion.

33
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,709
I named her Dolly,

34
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,089
after that sheep with the Big Hooters.

35
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,628
I miss that cat...
that dog... that thing.

36
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,443
You know what I miss?

37
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,509
A healthy bowel movement...

38
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,769
A real big, round cookie, baby...

39
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:01,389
One that only happens when
you've been eatin' real food.

40
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,998
- Do you rember real food?
- Not really.

41
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,327
One, two, three!

42
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,839
So long, Riila.

43
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,564
Mango. Very piquant.

44
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,544
Easy.

45
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,247
Thank you.

46
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,082
I am...

47
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,339
I am extremely whipped.

48
00:04:56,914 --> 00:05:00,266
Riila never manifested herself
for the K.P. shift.

49
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:03,296
Odious though it may be,
I worked both.

50
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,692
Do I make myself pellucid?

51
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,548
Eight detestable hours.

52
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,585
I may have to kill that woman.

53
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:14,726
You're too late.

54
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,033
Riila?

55
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,690
I was perturbed she didn't
wish to do her garbage shift.

56
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,966
Would you kindly be quiet?

57
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,939
Now it seems
she is the garbage shift.

58
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,928
Fortuitous
I didn't knock over the plant.

59
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:54,248
Well, if you had, there'd have been
two all-meat pizzas floatin' out there.

60
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:55,851
As I've always said, Bedzyk,

61
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,020
you're a kindly, thoughtful man.

62
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,630
Just passin' the time

63
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,626
till it's my turn
to go out the garbage port.

64
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:05,026
- I am Samswope!
- No, you loathsome creature,

65
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,917
I am Samswope!

66
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:11,472
Come on, Bedzyk,
it's not that bad.

67
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:17,011
At the very least,
we are still alive.

68
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:20,232
We'll find a landfall.

69
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,204
We will...

70
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,768
all in the fullness of time.

71
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,167
Come on, Sam.

72
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,682
Been to all six terraformed
sites in the system,

73
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,377
some of them more than once.

74
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,167
It's always the Same...

75
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:37,039
"Keep moving, scum.
Hit the road.

76
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,452
"Get lost, and take this
piece of junk with you."

77
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:41,794
If we had any sense,

78
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,491
we'd fly this garbage scow
right into the sun...

79
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,056
And better still,
crash it right up there.

80
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,274
Ah, yes...

81
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,831
Into the bosom of
our succoring mother Earth...

82
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,886
Up there, down there.

83
00:06:58,954 --> 00:06:59,964
Wherever.

84
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:03,150
Adieu and bide thee well,
dear, sweet Riila.

85
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,724
What is she, the third this month?

86
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,066
The fourth?

87
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,256
Sixth.

88
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:12,773
So we're down to what?

89
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,254
- 96?
- 93.

90
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,016
Two-thirds of
our original little party

91
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,453
of discarded freaks,
dead and gone.

92
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,563
It's tragic, just tragic.

93
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,613
We've been orbiting too long.

94
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,194
- What are you going to do?
- What am I gonna do?

95
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,562
In spite of your surly,

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,075
one might even venture taciturn,

97
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,495
nature, mon ami,
you remain an imposing

98
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,734
and, whether you like it or nay,

99
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,885
a de facto executive figure
aboard this enchanted scow,

100
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:49,487
the mutant horrors of which hold
you in the very highest esteem.

101
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,373
And I suspect,

102
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,908
beneath your snarls,

103
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:56,764
you actually care
what happens to them.

104
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,611
I'm just a passenger, pal...

105
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,825
Just another
steerage-class passenger,

106
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,552
and I got my ticket
to prove it.

107
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,397
I... I want to go home.

108
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:13,280
- Yeah, me, too.
- I wanna go home.

109
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,171
I wanna go home.

110
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:17,534
Off you go, then.

111
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:22,890
Ah, Bedzyk,
exit the mere passenger,

112
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:26,651
replaced by the sublime
poet-philosopher.

113
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,448
Oh, that's why everyone
looks to you, you know.

114
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:34,055
Apathy prevails here
on the good ship "gulag",

115
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,413
A.K.A. "The Riggum express."

116
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,255
But you're the one who gets up

117
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,315
and does something...

118
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,313
If not every time,
at least with sufficient frequency

119
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:46,970
that your nobility rises

120
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,224
like the rose mountains of Mars
above the apathy.

121
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,027
Everything I do, you could do.

122
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:55,823
You jest, sir. You jape. You jive.

123
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,200
I laugh at your Jackanapery, squire.

124
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,127
No, really,
you could run this place, Sam.

125
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,493
You got two heads.

126
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:04,392
Do you in fact know...

127
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,972
to get away from the previous
bull-pucky...

128
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,546
why we call the sickness that
condemned us to this floating prison...

129
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:14,164
What we affectionately
refer to as "the blood poop"...

130
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,655
Do you know why
we call it "Riggum",

131
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,097
as previous generations
called theirs "the pox"

132
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,667
or "yellow fever" or "A.I.D.S."?

133
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,934
I'm sorry, Sam.
I gotta get some fresh air.

134
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,599
Yes, well, we could all use
some fresh air.

135
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,065
I wanna go home. I...

136
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:31,539
- Smiler, my old friend.
- I wanna go home.

137
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,811
Do you know the etymological basis

138
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,447
of the nom de blood poop "Riggum"
for our communal sickness?

139
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,899
Well, it began

140
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,068
as transmutational blood poisoning...

141
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,161
Wildly stupid and inaccurate

142
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:49,625
just as chronic fatigue syndrome
was Epstein-Barr,

143
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,051
- or mono...
- Listen, I gotta go.

144
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:57,109
Then they abbreviated it
to T.B.P.,

145
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,921
whence came "Tepee."

146
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:02,806
But native Americans decried that
as racist, so they started

147
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:07,605
calling it "blood mutation"
or "blood poop"...

148
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:10,637
Utterly disgusting redneck term.

149
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,191
And finally,

150
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:17,041
after a million people had it
they took it seriously,

151
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,769
particularly when
the president of Uruguay

152
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,323
grew 11 extra noses
on the back of each hand,

153
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,854
and they called that... ta-da!

154
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,722
The birth of the blues!

155
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,740
I'm only kidding.

156
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:34,338
They called the sickness
what it really is...

157
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,200
Random Idiopathic genomic Mutation...

158
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:42,960
The acronym... R.I.G.M.,
or "Riggum."

159
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,805
Now wasn't that
an informative interlude?

160
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,231
Philistines.

161
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:08,745
I am festooned with Philistines.

162
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:13,721
I was just telling Sharon here
how much I miss whisper chips.

163
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,587
- Really?
- You remember, don't ya?

164
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,867
Opening the bag without a sound,

165
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,450
the feel of that first little
jumped right out of the bag,

166
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,961
and you caught it on your tongue,

167
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,462
and then the funny little hiss
when you bit down.

168
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:27,157
Of course, I rember
when chips made acrunch

169
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,030
and pissed off everyone around you.

170
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:30,561
- Barbaric.
- Exactly.

171
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:32,346
Excuse me.

172
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:34,698
I never tasted any kind
of chip at all.

173
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,515
Oh, darlin',
the things you've missed...

174
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,945
The popcorn,
the beer-battered flurge,

175
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,208
sonic potatoes!

176
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,315
Hi, Bedzyk.

177
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,288
Lookin' good, sis.

178
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,045
Now that, my friend, is an eye.

179
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:06,713
Some hell of an eye,
let me tell you!

180
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,747
Yeah, that is an eye
only to die for.

181
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:10,875
You could plotz from an eye like that.

182
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:13,461
Ah, the tuchis is not easily
dismissed either.

183
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,983
What do you mean, the tuchis?
What are you, a pervert?

184
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,629
Bedzyk, that you?

185
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,244
<i>No, it's somebody else.</i>

186
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,289
Come on, will you stop crankin' me?
Is that you, Bedzyk?

187
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,083
Harmony, this is Bedzyk.
What?

188
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:37,461
We got a ship comin' in,
dead-on trajectory from Earth.

189
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:39,922
<i>- Yeah, so?</i>
- So I checked the ephemeris

190
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,995
and the new E.T.A. readout, and
there's nothing supposed to be there.

191
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:45,437
All right. So our loving
friends and neighbors

192
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,988
have sent us an unscheduled
load of toilet paper.

193
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,265
Why bother me with it?
I'm a tourist here myself.

194
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:53,076
Come on, Bedzyk.
They'll dock in eight hours.

195
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:56,259
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Call me in eight and a half hours

196
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,160
if you're desperate for my company.

197
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,396
I'm gonna turn on the light.

198
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,186
- I want to turn up the light.
- Don't.

199
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:32,397
Don't. You know
I don't like that.

200
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,457
How long have you been here
on the gulag, Annie?

201
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:38,605
You know.

202
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,172
I can't remember anything.

203
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,276
Time just runs together out here.

204
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,556
Come on,
how many years has it been?

205
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,749
14.

206
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,323
I was 16 when they...

207
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,326
crashed the coventry on Callisto
and took me to the settlement.

208
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:52,905
You were a kid.

209
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,822
How long were you
on the "coventry"?

210
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,531
I was, uh...

211
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,260
22.

212
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,029
I think, when I was discarded,

213
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,607
so that'd be five or six,
something like that.

214
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:08,996
Do you ever wonder
why you were discarded, Annie?

215
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:12,787
Yeah, I do, but...

216
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,249
It's that thing about Malthus.

217
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,247
At least, that's how they always
explained it to me... Too many...

218
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:20,855
people on Earth, no place to stand,
the sheep look up.

219
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,339
That's what they always say...

220
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,088
"It's too crowded.
Somebody's gotta go.

221
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:26,159
"Why not send the infected ones?"

222
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:28,414
I don't buy it.

223
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,720
So what is it then, hmm?

224
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,443
You ever hear of father Damien?

225
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:36,349
No. Who is he?

226
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,083
He was a priest.
He worked with lepers.

227
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:44,174
See, they used to send people with
leprosy to this island to die, okay?

228
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:47,305
Like they shipped us up here,
to the gulag.

229
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,040
Where are you going with this?

230
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:53,024
The real reason
they sent us out here, Annie,

231
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,213
is because they can't stand
to look at us.

232
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,489
It's the ugliness
that scares the hell out of 'em,

233
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,822
not the infection.

234
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,295
We're just like those lepers.

235
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:08,909
You read too much.

236
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,366
Listen, love,

237
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,043
I'm no fan
of our neighbors from Earth,

238
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,729
but I don't think even
they could be that cruel to...

239
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,688
- No.
- To exile us...

240
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,444
with no landfall ever,
just because we repulse them.

241
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,751
Out of sight, out of mind.

242
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:29,150
- And there's a big ship coming in.
- Oh, yes.

243
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:30,643
Maybe it's good news.

244
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,662
Oh, good news!
Yeah, good news is comin'.

245
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,004
Yeah, next week.

246
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:40,123
- Let me turn up the lights.
- No, don't.

247
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:43,081
- Annie, I like to look at you.
- No. It's not...

248
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,074
It's me, this ridiculous arm.

249
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,163
It's not you, Bedzyk.

250
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,553
You are lovely.

251
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,642
Yeah, I'm gorgeous.

252
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,432
Really.

253
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,244
I love looking at you.

254
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,934
I just... I just have...

255
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,479
- Baggage.
- Please...

256
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:12,356
All over the system,

257
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,343
people make love to each other
with the lights on

258
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,273
because they like
to look at each other.

259
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,582
I'll tell you what...
I'll give you $2 in small change

260
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,415
if just once...

261
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,690
we could pretend we're normal.

262
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:53,887
Did you just say "normal"?

263
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,853
- Yes?
- It's Harmony Teat.

264
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:08,005
That ship is docking right now.
What should I do?

265
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,274
Why don't you take that ship and...

266
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,927
- Has it been 8 hours already, Harmony?
- Six, ship time.

267
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,726
I didn't figure it so good.
Sorry, boss.

268
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:21,579
Have they declared themselves?

269
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:25,207
Get that ham-fisted
jackhammer you call an arm

270
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,084
<i>and your fat ass over
to control now!</i>

271
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,965
It's an emissary yacht
from Earth central.

272
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,767
What's going on?

273
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:52,041
Ephemeris time 0-0-0-1,

274
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,064
and he's sweet.

275
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,354
- Nice. Very, very nice. Nice.
- Coupled and locked in.

276
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,999
Bam! Did I do a job,
or did I do a job?

277
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:02,795
I'm one hell of a navigator.

278
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,768
- Did they hail us?
- Not yet.

279
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,090
Guess we're being thrown
out of here. You think?

280
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,432
Yeah, probably.

281
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,384
All right, let's hail them.

282
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:15,631
Attention, Earth vessel.

283
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,610
Attention, Earth vessel,
do you read me?

284
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,370
- What are they, deaf?
- Could be.

285
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,980
Attention, Earth vessel.

286
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,960
Listen, guys,
save yourself the effort, okay?

287
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,793
We are leaving Earth space.

288
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,937
What is this?

289
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:37,145
Maybe they're all dead and purple
and full of maggots in there, you know?

290
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,508
Tongues hangin' out, guts
spillin' out of their noses,

291
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,952
eyeballs all...

292
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,367
One can only hope.

293
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:44,369
I don't get it.
They're here.

294
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,829
We know they're here.

295
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,626
Why won't they talk to us?

296
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,700
They've undogged
their debarkation port

297
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,791
and cycled ours.
They're boarding us.

298
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,529
Home. Home.
We'll go home.

299
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,059
All right, open it.

300
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,862
Hello. I was sent
from Earth central

301
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:23,051
to make you
a really terrific offer.

302
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:31,897
My name's Curran,

303
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,597
and you must be the captain.

304
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:45,600
Quiet!

305
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,220
Quiet!

306
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,660
All right, listen up!

307
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,435
Now you all wanted to go
to the terraforms.

308
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,942
- Have we been to the terraforms?
- Yes!

309
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,291
You wanted to go to Europa.
Have we been to Europa?

310
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:00,697
- Have we been to Mercury?
- Yes!

311
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:03,691
Have we been to Venus,
Callisto, Ganymede...

312
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:06,577
- Yes!
- Twice... twice...

313
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,202
We went to Ganymede.
All right, then back off!

314
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,793
Back off.
Let me talk to this guy.

315
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,472
I'll tell you everything
in five minutes.

316
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,670
Oh, yes, my captain.

317
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,063
Come on. We can talk
in the cathedral.

318
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:48,601
The cathedral.

319
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,043
Drop to your knees and pray.

320
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:54,572
Reminds me of the rain forests
my grandparents spoke of.

321
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,694
Plants are life...

322
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,187
The very air we breathe.

323
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,132
That's 'cause you bastards
never sent us new scrubbers,

324
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:05,427
and the original crap they put on this
garbage scow broke down years ago.

325
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,019
Harmony, make sure
we're left alone, huh?

326
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:09,640
All right, speak your piece...

327
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,346
Shove off.

328
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,393
Stop suckin' up our air.

329
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,176
I've been invested
with the most important mission

330
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,683
people of your home planet
have ever mounted.

331
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:24,238
I represent evy member
of the sanhedrin of Earth central.

332
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:26,955
Yes, how profoundly moving.

333
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:29,118
And your name is Curran?

334
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:31,118
You can call me Barney.

335
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:35,005
Well, mr. Curran,
or ambassador Curran,

336
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,562
or plenipotentiary
high-mucketty-doodle Curran,

337
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:40,942
we perceive
your vast importance.

338
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:43,018
Now just get on with it.

339
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:47,386
Captain, could you introduce me
to your associates?

340
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,887
Okay, Sam.

341
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:53,215
Well, uh, this is Harmony Teat.

342
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,152
I... uh...

343
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:57,472
we are Samswope,

344
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:01,108
- the captain's right arm.
- I am Samswope.

345
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:08,068
Let me see if I can guess,
Mr. Sanhedrin Earth neighbor.

346
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:11,785
You want us to move
our little load of misfits

347
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:14,770
off orbit l-5,
or we'll blast your asses away.

348
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,446
Oh, no.
No, it's not that at all.

349
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:20,281
And in fact, I don't think that
any of us have an idea

350
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,788
- of how hard it's been for you--
- Without the lubricant.

351
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:25,716
- Just spit it out.
- Bedzyk, let him talk.

352
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,937
You were the control
that skimmed us in.

353
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,487
Lovely job...

354
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,041
- Like a ballet.
- Hey, Curran... Riggum.

355
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,183
- I beg you pardon?
- R.I.G.M.

356
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:40,721
R...

357
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,177
I...

358
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:43,979
G... M.

359
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:45,470
The blood poop.

360
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:49,235
Random Idiopathic Genomic Mutation.

361
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,601
"The sickness."

362
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,140
The gift that keeps on giving...

363
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:54,952
like another head.

364
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,769
Do you think that
Earth central hates you,

365
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,501
that we don't feel you pain?

366
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,337
God, it's been 37 years.

367
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:05,414
You have to believe
that we feel the guilt

368
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:07,800
and torment of what the former
generation did to you.

369
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:12,513
Oh, that's why you never send
get-well packages or toilet paper?

370
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:16,139
Mr. Bedzyk and I need to tell
our happy little band

371
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,749
why you're here, sheriff.

372
00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:19,311
So go ahead.

373
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:23,107
Uh, by the way,
I notice that you're

374
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,975
a healthy, arrow-slim normal lad.

375
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:29,025
Did they pick you preferentially,

376
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,302
to give us a little tweak
of the antennae?

377
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,168
Oh, god.

378
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,835
- You're one of us.
- The runnies.

379
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,295
That's how darting priest went.
Remember, Bedzyk?

380
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,637
And Gary what's-his-name,
the one that drank the can of lye.

381
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:57,720
They sent you to be a passenger.
What'd you do, steal the yacht?

382
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:02,715
It's getting worse...
much worse...

383
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:05,100
The sickness... Riggum.

384
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:07,229
But why'd you come to us...

385
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,573
What, to tell us we were
gonna have to double-bunk?

386
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,103
Th're gonna send a...
a couple of hundred more discards

387
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,327
up here to our floating swamp?

388
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,764
If it were that, we wouldn't send 100's.
We'd send hundreds of thousands.

389
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,341
It's spreading...

390
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:22,332
changing us
like a tidal wave every day.

391
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:25,715
There is no day here...
also no night.

392
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,130
Every day is every day.

393
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,299
Sam, let him tell it.

394
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:33,594
After the first wave of discards

395
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:38,878
after all of you... left,

396
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:40,809
it spread from continent
to continent.

397
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:43,615
We don't know how. We didn't know
the vector of contamination--

398
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,092
If it was fleas, ticks,

399
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:48,442
animals, people. We didn't know.
But there was a spray...

400
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,702
Germicide or pheromonic,
I don't know.

401
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:54,025
I'm not a biologist.
But the sanhedrin

402
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,960
sprayed the entire planet,
and it worked...

403
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,012
for about 11 years.

404
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:01,518
And then the sickness
mutated around it...

405
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,956
Got stronger, smarter.

406
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,621
- Damn riggum.
- Got even tougher.

407
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,302
The rigmarole.

408
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:11,940
Something in the spray itself
activated a trigger

409
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:15,004
in the nucleus of the plague virus.
Everyone was hit.

410
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,222
There's no chance to isolate it
or for quarantin.

411
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:21,058
So what, we're the ones
who got off easy?

412
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:24,050
- Is that what you came to tell us?
- That is a bit rich.

413
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:27,224
It got so bad,
people evacuated the cities,

414
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,619
started living
in sterile shelters

415
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,230
and domes underground.
We thought it was all over.

416
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,278
And then a doctor,

417
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,687
a hungarian,
came up with a serum.

418
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,136
Do you hear what he's saying?
don't you get it yet?

419
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,815
A cure.

420
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,841
The only thing that
stops it from sprding.

421
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:47,240
It's a... It's a serum

422
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,033
synthesized
from prepandemic enzymes

423
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,946
that are only found in blood, in...

424
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:53,730
In the blood of...

425
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,585
Of discards.

426
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:58,755
Of us!

427
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,661
Are you kiddin' me?

428
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,346
You want our blood!

429
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:10,941
Here I thought I'd lost my faith
in the wickedness of mankind.

430
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:13,110
You want us to save you?

431
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,785
Hey, Barney...
You got a world

432
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:17,500
full of freaks up there, huh?

433
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,115
Why don't you use them?
Better yet,

434
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:21,368
why don't you pop into one
of your own puky veins?

435
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:23,164
You could save
the whole world yourself.

436
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:25,564
We're no good.
The sickness changed

437
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,527
our blood doesn't secrete
the Same enzymes.

438
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,685
Well, then you and the world
have crapped out,

439
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,785
because I wouldn't
take a whiz on you

440
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,141
if there were flames shooting
out of your eyeballs.

441
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,967
If you listen to my proposal,
I think you might well reconsider.

442
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,163
It could change the lives
of everyone aboard this vessel...

443
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:42,152
- Sure it will.
- If you would just listen...

444
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,578
I'm not gonna listen to you.

445
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,755
You got nothing
I want to listen to.

446
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,280
Comin' home! Comin' home!

447
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,520
Baby Jesus... Jesus loves me!

448
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,989
- Grab him!
- Hallelujah, Jesus!

449
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:57,029
Hallelujah! I'm goin' home!

450
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,654
- Smiler, no!
- I cannot wait!

451
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,502
I'm goin' home!

452
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:06,122
I'm goin' home, baby Jesus!

453
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,199
You want to talk to the captain?

454
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:27,401
Well, talk to her.

455
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,569
You know how to use this thing?

456
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:45,085
Yeah, Harmony taught me.

457
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:47,588
What happened?
Smiler lost it...

458
00:27:48,073 --> 00:27:50,622
- Tried to bring us down.
- Tried to kill the cathedral...

459
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:53,168
Merely succeed in killing Harmony Teat.

460
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:54,443
Where is he?

461
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,227
Chucho Red's got him locked up
in the lazarette.

462
00:27:58,215 --> 00:27:59,755
Well, you're still here?

463
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:02,427
It's important that I finish
what I was going to say.

464
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,868
Well, if it's important,
you'd better finish.

465
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:09,526
You all need to know
that we care.

466
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,813
What happened to you is
happening to us, only faster.

467
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,477
We've watched people change
right before our eyes.

468
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,175
No family is untouched.

469
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:19,695
My wife...

470
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,300
On behalf of terran central,

471
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,112
if you agree to help us,

472
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,520
we're prepared to let your ship land
and house all of you on Earth.

473
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,527
You'll be home again.

474
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:36,405
You'll breathe real air,
feel real land.

475
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,752
What happens if we decide
not to give you our blood?

476
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:43,106
That's right.
He wants our blood.

477
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,313
You'll come out here and take it anyway?

478
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,531
No, of course not.
No, we'll send an emissary

479
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,802
to another ship, but I hope
that won't be necessary.

480
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:54,719
What do you think,
we're a bunch of idiots?

481
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,066
- You won't give us anything.
- Yes, we will. I swear.

482
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,738
You're a liar, Curran.

483
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,221
You're an errand boy
wearing a sailor suit.

484
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:04,073
You're their lapdog
with a bad case of the mange.

485
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,595
- You'll say whatever takes.
- Please.

486
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:09,953
I suspect that I'm not isolated

487
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:13,173
in my naked, desperate,
pain-filled need

488
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:14,958
to return to the planet
of my youth.

489
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:18,253
This isn't home, Bedzyk.
We want to go back to Earth.

490
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:21,420
All of us...
We want to go back home!

491
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,175
There is no Earth!

492
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:26,535
Not for us. Not now, not ever.

493
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,581
It's what these people do, Sam.
They lie to get what they want.

494
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:34,623
How could it possibly be
to our detriment, old friend?

495
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:36,393
He said we could go back home!

496
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:37,606
And he's lying!

497
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:41,827
Let him screw around with
somebody else's ship... Not mine!

498
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,188
- "Mine"?
- Get out of the way.

499
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:46,742
I'm gonna throw this lying
pissant off the ship.

500
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,628
They are not gonna let us
get any closer to Earth!

501
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,453
Can't you pathetic freaks
ever realize that?

502
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:57,147
You must disabuse yourself
of this paranoia, this hatred.

503
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:01,202
Simply put, they want what it is
that only we can provide.

504
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:04,238
We need what they have...
Our home!

505
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,515
Home?

506
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,735
Are you really that stupid?

507
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:14,566
You are as close to a friend
as anyone I've known,

508
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:18,284
and whether you like it or not,
I consider you to be an equal.

509
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,763
I don't mind if you think
I'm a fool,

510
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:23,420
but don't ever talk to me
as if you think I'm one.

511
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,758
Oh, come on, Sam.
You're smarter than this.

512
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,296
They're nothing but a bunch
of backstabbing, arrogant liars.

513
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,164
Cease and desist.

514
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:33,328
Your authority
has been superseded,

515
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:35,493
and you have been supplanted.

516
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,159
So now we're a democracy, eh?

517
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,061
Yesterday, it was "Aye, aye, captain."

518
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:43,676
Today "You're supersed."

519
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:46,563
As distressing as it may seem, yes.

520
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:49,709
How about you, Annie?
Where do you stand?

521
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:54,967
I'm sorry, Bedzyk.

522
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:56,835
Look, you're so angry,

523
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,957
you're not seeing
any of this clearly.

524
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,853
I see it real clear.

525
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,277
You people...

526
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,310
Anytime anything
ever went wrong,

527
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,134
you came runnin' for me,
didn't you, huh?

528
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:12,960
Something had to be done,
some decision had to be made...

529
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,016
"Where's Bedzyk?
Go get Bedzyk. Get Bedzyk."

530
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:18,332
And this... this Earth scum
shows up with the runnies.

531
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:22,452
He holds up this bright
and shiny new lie,

532
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,574
and you all sit up
and wag your tails.

533
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,942
It is not my most fervent wish

534
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,592
to expire on this galactic latrine.

535
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,503
Lien to me. We will
take care of all of you.

536
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:35,235
We have huge plots of land
in South America...

537
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,204
Rugged land, I'll admit...
but there's plenty of room

538
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,045
- For all of you.
- Don't listen to him!

539
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:41,377
Never trust an Earthman.

540
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,345
- Never!
- Bedzyk, shut up!

541
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:48,070
- Annie?
- It's what we all want, Bedzyk.

542
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,315
- Get off my ship!
- Bedzyk, stop!

543
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:03,401
Sam...

544
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,212
Annie...

545
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,407
Now you've done it.

546
00:32:40,228 --> 00:32:43,749
Get your medical teams up here
and start with the bloods.

547
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:47,335
We wish to go home,
ambassador Curran.

548
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,714
We wish to go home now.

549
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:22,199
Ah! Once again,

550
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:25,185
the manifestation
of the venerable,

551
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:29,156
idiom-precise Dr. Janet Goldstein.

552
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:33,605
Savior of our misbegotten compatriots,

553
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:35,484
both here and on Earth.

554
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:38,305
Samswope.
It's good to see you.

555
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:41,660
Your work here approaches
a denouement.

556
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:43,947
We finally hit our quota today.

557
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,236
The rescue vessel is on the way.

558
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,454
I wonder who's more excited...

559
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,604
your people or mine?

560
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,500
- What?
- Oh, I admit,

561
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,443
before this operation commenced,

562
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,100
I felt a flourishof cynicism...

563
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,715
A touch of the old vampire,
don't ya know?

564
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:06,922
You've done well, Samswope.

565
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,556
You've saved the world,

566
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:11,584
and you've saved your people.

567
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,985
We couldn't have done this
without you,

568
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,334
and no one's
ever gonna forget that.

569
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:18,616
Well, shucks, doc.

570
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:21,185
I'll be superamalgamated.

571
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,490
Are you ready
to give one last time?

572
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:40,148
Old girlfriend?

573
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,359
Could we just finish this?

574
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:05,037
I have an update
on the rescue vessel...

575
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:06,540
E.T.A. Six hours.

576
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:09,655
- Thank you, Annie.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

577
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:15,903
You don't seem
particularly excited.

578
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,947
Ah, but I am.

579
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,276
Six hours...

580
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,849
There's more than enough time.

581
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,821
Barely enough to master
all thoutlandish

582
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:34,160
permutations
of this connubiation custom.

583
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:35,828
Steve's wedding?

584
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,673
But of course, my darling.

585
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,053
- This is a first, isn't it?
- Truly.

586
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,757
Never happened when Bedzyk
was running things.

587
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:46,891
Then again, we didn't have
much to celebrate.

588
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:50,642
What?

589
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,974
It was not my intention...

590
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:58,055
I didn't mean to kill him, Frenchy.

591
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,696
I swear to god.

592
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:12,416
He was going
to ruin everything.

593
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,335
You did what you had to do.

594
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:16,839
You gave us hope.

595
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,805
You gave us back our home, Sam.

596
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,163
Here we go.

597
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,658
Just a little bit right there.

598
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:55,940
Brothers and sisters,

599
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:57,909
<i>Mesdames et monsieurs,</i>

600
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,430
freaks and frogs,
flotSam and jetSam,

601
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:05,429
we are aggregated here
to witness the tri-binding

602
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:09,418
of a trio of our assembly
in holy matrimony...

603
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:12,157
Steve, Sharon, Bucky.

604
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:15,063
It would be remiss of me
not to make mention

605
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:18,358
of the fact that this moment
is without precedent

606
00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:20,451
in the annals of our ordeal.

607
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,859
This is the first wedding
we've ever had here...

608
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:33,367
A symbol of new beginnings

609
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:36,062
bespeaking
our imminent departure

610
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:39,793
for a home to which we feared
we might never return.

611
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:48,666
do you take these other two
to be your lifelong lovemates?

612
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,983
I do.

613
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:55,096
Bucky, do you take these other two
to be your lifelong lovemates?

614
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:56,622
I do.

615
00:37:56,961 --> 00:38:00,829
Sharon, do you take these other two
For your lifelong lovemates?

616
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,824
All of which have the merit
of being acceptable answers

617
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:07,768
to the query just posed.

618
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:12,371
Steve, Sharon, Bucky,
I have the distinct pleasure

619
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,290
in pronouncing you men, women,

620
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,281
bisexes, bivalves, baby-blue
husbands and/or wives.

621
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:30,587
Sam? They're here.

622
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:32,080
They're docking.

623
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:37,148
Come! Let us greet the engines
of our salvation!

624
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:54,074
Ambassador Curran, welcome back.

625
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,207
You arrive at
the most appropriate moment.

626
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,924
The very thought
of our repatriation is...

627
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:40,220
Am I Samswope?

628
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:59,238
Somebody clean that up
and blow it out the garbage port!

629
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:21,409
