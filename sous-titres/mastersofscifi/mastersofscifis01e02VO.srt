1
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:05,624
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

2
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:08,075
<i>we have wondered
how life began,</i>

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:11,831
<i>what our purpose is
and where we are headed.</i>

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,975
<i>We have struggled
to understand time,</i>

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:21,806
<i>matter, the infinite universe,</i>

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,365
<i>who we are
and if we are alone.</i>

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:32,207
<i>Great minds have imagined
the most wonderful</i>

8
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:34,693
<i>and the most terrifying answers</i>

9
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,395
<i>to these questions.</i>

10
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:41,153
<i>We invite you to join us
on this great expedition.</i>

11
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:41,952
Stitch!

12
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,121
Don't move!

13
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,662
I said don't move!
Put down your weapon!

14
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,083
I said put it down!

15
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,497
I don't speak iraqi, towelhead!

16
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,339
Drop it!

17
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,669
Put it down!

18
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,220
I need to get to my friend.

19
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:25,931
My friend!

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,229
I don't want to shoot you, okay?

21
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:37,985
You understand me?

22
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:42,572
Yes.

23
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:49,871
I don't know.

24
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,239
Whatever that thing is,
the Colonel needs to see it...

25
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,544
posthaste.

26
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:14,528
Where was he?

27
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,724
Thrown about 60 feet
from the wreck, Sir.

28
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,950
- Found him unconscious.
- And his partner?

29
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,563
Can you tell me what happened,
Captain?

30
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:33,415
They've been like that
since we found 'em, Sir.

31
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:35,927
Take 'em both back to H.Q.
and wait for further orders.

32
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:37,053
Sir.

33
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,802
<i>The impulse towards violence
may be hardwired</i>

34
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,324
<i>into our genes,</i>

35
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:55,685
<i>but so is the dream that someday
we might rise above it.</i>

36
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,587
And there was no sign of another
craft from the wreckage?

37
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,099
No, Sir.

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,959
Then where the hell
did it come from?

39
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,583
We're looking into that, General.

40
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,043
And exactly what am I looking at?

41
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,992
We're looking into that, too, Sir.

42
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:19,286
This is a karyotype
of a normal human,

43
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:22,835
showing the 23 pairs
of chromosomes we all have.

44
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:27,550
<i>Now we took scrapings from what
appears to be the exoskeleton,</i>

45
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,230
<i>and despite its appearance,</i>

46
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,948
<i>it is biologically
identical to humans...</i>

47
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:35,778
Except for one difference.

48
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,063
The 23rd pair of chromosomes
is missing.

49
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:41,816
Please explain, Captain.

50
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,923
It appears to have no gender,
Sir, no sex.

51
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,112
Well, how is that possible?

52
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,616
Well, any one of a number
of gender mutations is possible

53
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,185
<i>in nature,
but to have no 23rd chromosomes</i>

54
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,655
I've never seen that.
I doubt anyone has.

55
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,191
Captain, has, um,
has it moved yet?

56
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:01,860
No, Sir.

57
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,608
So do we even know
if it's dead or alive?

58
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,756
It's not dead, Mr. President.

59
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,636
<i>Though it's cold to the touch,</i>

60
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,098
we've detected a pulse.

61
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:14,802
Then, uh, what is this thing?

62
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,713
<i>By strict definition,
it's humanoid.</i>

63
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,867
- "Humanoid"?
- Yes, Sir.

64
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,965
Well, where do humanoids
come from, captain?

65
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:25,637
Are you going to use
the "a" word?

66
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,998
It does pose
the puzzling question

67
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,739
of how this thing buzzed
one of our choppers at 400 feet.

68
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,411
I know what it did, captain.

69
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,491
I'm asking you
where you think it came from.

70
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,704
Not from this neighborhood, Sir.

71
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,917
Captain, isn't that, um,
well, a little premature?

72
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,727
<i>I want to make it clear...</i>

73
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,412
we ran a large battery of tests

74
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,074
on the cell's samples we took.

75
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,454
<i>This did not react anything like
any known biological organism.</i>

76
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,062
<i>It wouldn't burn.</i>

77
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:55,972
<i>We even tried irradiating it</i>

78
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,853
<i>with PU-239.
Weapons-grade plutonium.</i>

79
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,517
It denatured the isotope.

80
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,975
"Denatured"?

81
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:04,060
It made the plutonium inert.

82
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,182
Whatever this is,

83
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,861
<i>it seems impervious
to most things of this world.</i>

84
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,821
I can't explain that.

85
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,212
<i>Oh, and, uh...</i>

86
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:17,242
it glows in the dark.

87
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,022
Get me Skynner.

88
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,760
Major Skynner has retired, Sir.

89
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,533
We don't even know
where he is.

90
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,837
Well, then you find him,
and you unretire him.

91
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:35,913
Yes, Sir.

92
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,245
I'm not interested.

93
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,028
Excuse me?

94
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,599
I said, I'm not interested.

95
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,376
You don't even know who I am.

96
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,331
I don't need to.

97
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:00,997
Those shoes aren't
flip-flops or sneakers,

98
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,127
so you sure as hell
aren't from around here.

99
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,540
Ergo, I'm not interested.

100
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,879
Well, Sir, you certainly
live up to your reputation.

101
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,781
What reputation is that,
Lieutenant?

102
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,435
Your formidable
deductive reasoning.

103
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:17,195
How did you know
I was a Lieutenant?

104
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,069
They wouldn't insult me
sending anyone ranking less,

105
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,717
and anyone ranking higher would've
thought it was beneath him,

106
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,051
or her, as the case may be,

107
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,405
and I haven't been
called "Sir" in two years.

108
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,608
I said I wasn't interested.

109
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:34,262
They were insistent that I seek
you out and show you this, Sir.

110
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:36,230
Why? What'd they find,
a weather balloon

111
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,679
or some fairy lights
stuck in a tree?

112
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:48,146
If you could rat the significance
of that on a scale of 1 to 10,

113
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,977
- how would you...
- Ten, Sir.

114
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,404
- Ten being...
- Little green men.

115
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,111
It's always interesting what books
a person is drawn to in a collection.

116
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,385
Of all the Lieutenants
they could have sent,

117
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,947
why did they send you?

118
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:30,135
I was selected
by the NASA program

119
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:31,460
to join this inquiry, Sir.

120
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:34,193
So... you're an astrophysicist?

121
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,188
Amongst other things.

122
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,262
I also work for S.E.T.I.

123
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:43,970
You're a believer.

124
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,300
I think that it's narrow-minded
to discount the possibility

125
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,699
of life outside of
this solar system, yes...

126
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,111
Sir.

127
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,398
So you've decided.

128
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,103
It's hard to ignore
the laws of probability.

129
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,692
Well, except...

130
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:02,240
with no evidence, all you're left with
is your faith in the idea.

131
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:05,494
"Men are probably
nearer the central truth

132
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,081
"in their superstitions
than in their science."

133
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:09,581
Thoreau.

134
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,857
But when superstitions
become convictions,

135
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,690
that only leads to fanaticism.

136
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:17,900
And when governments surround
a subject with such secrecy...

137
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:20,955
You know,

138
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,524
the one critical piece of logic
that U.F.O. conspiracy

139
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,354
freaks the world over
always neglect to consider?

140
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,684
Man's propensity
to make enemies.

141
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:32,665
- Sir?
- If we really knew

142
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,959
there were aliens out there,
we wouldn't keep it a secret.

143
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,608
We'd be turning 'em into an enemy
and going to war with 'em.

144
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:38,930
The Pentagone would like

145
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:41,887
nothing better than have
a whole new frontier to battle with.

146
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,540
I've come to dread

147
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,812
the day they find something.

148
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,852
That was my job, Lieutenant,

149
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,692
to find something.
I'm glad I never did.

150
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,618
Really? So you think that there's
an explanation for all of this?

151
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,609
There always is.

152
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,407
They said
that you'd say that, Sir.

153
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,084
May I?

154
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,427
Log these notes, please.

155
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:38,628
Yes, Sir.

156
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,197
How long has she been like this?

157
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,139
They found her
about 6 hours ago.

158
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:49,716
And the others?

159
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,284
36 hours.

160
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,517
And nobody's gotten a word
out of any of them?

161
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:55,803
That's right, Sir.

162
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:57,794
Major. Lieutenant.

163
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:59,091
Just call me Bert, will you?

164
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:00,400
Yes, Sir.

165
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:03,038
I thought you might
want to see the patients first.

166
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,197
They're in what's called
a waking coma...

167
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:08,073
Nonreactive reflexology
with arresting tremor...

168
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,040
- Common for people suffering...
- Posttraumatic stress disorder.

169
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,611
Well, that's the odd thing.

170
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:16,836
Their E.C.G. and E.E.G. results
suggest the opposite...

171
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:19,178
An extreme state of relaxation.

172
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,973
They're not traumatized.
They're extremely calm.

173
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,733
It's like they're being held
in a state of bliss.

174
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,590
Held by what?

175
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,200
I'd love to show you.

176
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:13,698
Have you run an M.R.I.?

177
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:16,646
Both C.T. and M.R.I.
yielded no results.

178
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,749
You mean, non-conclusive results.

179
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:21,748
I mean no results.
It gave off no image.

180
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:23,956
Its cocoon somehow protects it

181
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:27,284
from any magnetic field
or x-rays.

182
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:28,726
Albert.

183
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,248
Walt.

184
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:31,966
Strange, isn't it?

185
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,393
You spend your whole career
searching for something, and it...

186
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,014
winds up running smack
into one of your choppers.

187
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:41,252
Except for the fact that you spent
my whole career looking for something

188
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,397
I agree...

189
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,318
It's strange.

190
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,522
So what do you think?

191
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,191
I'm thinking it's a dawn good hoax.

192
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,942
- Come on, Bert.
- I'm thinking, where's its craft?

193
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,765
Why Iraq? Why now?

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,865
We're much more interested
in what now.

195
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,027
If you know what you got here,
General, what did you bring me for?

196
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,130
I'm not pretending
to know what it is, Major.

197
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:03,944
We just need
to assess its spread.

198
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,720
So far, it's put 3 people in the coma
and it hasn't even woken up yet.

199
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:10,546
For all intents and purposes,
General, they are not in comas,

200
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,080
and they are
in no immediate danger, Sir.

201
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,394
Let's just say I need
a bit more convincing

202
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,307
before I let it shake hands
with the President, Lieutenant.

203
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,035
I'd be careful there.

204
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,355
Don't get too close to its eyes.

205
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,103
We believe
this is how it's done.

206
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,834
I have a theory about skeptics...

207
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,234
Deep down inside, they're bigger
believers than the rest of us.

208
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:53,902
They're just
too scared to admit it.

209
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:55,826
Scared of what?

210
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,241
Of what it would mean to believe.

211
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,356
A few years ago,

212
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,371
at a family picnic,

213
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,586
my wife fell over
and couldn't get back up.

214
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,636
So I took her to the hospital,
and I found out she had...

215
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,780
the beginning
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease...

216
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:22,272
Uh, an extremely rare
disease of the brain

217
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,930
where some foreign protein
gets into your body,

218
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,718
and it screws up
all your proteins.

219
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:31,547
And she caught it from a piece
of contaminated dental equipment

220
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,336
when she was in
for her regular checkup.

221
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:35,547
How's that for random?

222
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:37,841
A microscopic spec

223
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:41,160
on a piece of metal
gave my wife dementia.

224
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:43,639
So you're right.

225
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,474
I... would be scared to believe

226
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,601
there was any greater
meaning in that.

227
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,214
But something's keeping you here.

228
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:00,711
What do you see?

229
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:51,959
It's communicating.

230
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,181
They're writing
the same repeated message

231
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,555
in their own language.

232
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,853
"Hear this,
you foolish and senseless people."

233
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,754
What does that mean, Major?
Hear what?

234
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,660
We have cryptologists
combing through it, Sir, but...

235
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,049
What do you think, Bert?

236
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:45,637
What does it want?

237
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,906
I don't even know what it is,
let alone what it wants.

238
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:53,182
"Hear this, you foolish
and senseless people"

239
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,018
doesn't sound like
"Glad to meet you."

240
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:17,556
Do you ever sleep?

241
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,293
<i>...reports worldwide a bizarre
phenomena in the skies...</i>

242
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:22,666
<i>Thousands of sightings
of unidentified objects</i>

243
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,603
<i>dropping from out of the clouds
are rushing in from around the world.</i>

244
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:28,148
<i>Including sightings in Israel,
Lebanon, Taiwan,</i>

245
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,196
<i>Cashmere, Ireland and Russia.</i>

246
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,846
<i>The soldiers were fighting.</i>

247
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:39,081
<i>There was gunfire, and then this thing
fell from the heavens there.</i>

248
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,723
<i>There was a flash,
and I covered my eyes.</i>

249
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,568
<i>When I opened them, everyone
was on the ground unconscious.</i>

250
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:48,621
<i>U.S. authorities have
made no comment so far</i>

251
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:51,454
- <i>about the nature of the objects...</i>
- When did this start?

252
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,916
Skynner?

253
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,211
The last thing my wife
ever said to me made no sense.

254
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,189
I thought it was her dementia,

255
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:08,249
neurons misfiring.

256
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,499
But...

257
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:13,023
she sat right up in the bed,

258
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,520
and she looked like she knew
what she was talking about.

259
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,930
And she said,
"they are watching".

260
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,274
This is what they've been
writing for hours.

261
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,542
"We are watching."

262
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,882
What do you think they want?

263
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,489
You're asking me?

264
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,695
I...

265
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,789
I'm fresh out of explanations.

266
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,543
Not everything
has an explanation.

267
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:15,935
I wasn't brought here
to have some...

268
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:19,344
personal experience.

269
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,393
But you're having one.

270
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:33,116
I think our job as scientists

271
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,708
is to stay open to all
possibilities. Isn't it?

272
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,136
I don't know what they want,

273
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:47,433
but I'm keeping my eyes open.

274
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,913
Get Skynner.

275
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:17,928
Hear us, you foolish
and senseless people...

276
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,627
who have eyes but do not see,

277
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,974
who have ears but do not hear.

278
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,050
You must listen to him.

279
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:27,452
Seek peace and pursue it.

280
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,440
Nation shall not lift up
sword against nation.

281
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,359
Neither shall they
learn war anymore.

282
00:21:33,748 --> 00:21:36,753
Hear this, you foolish
and senseless people

283
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,875
who have eyes but cannot see...

284
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,186
Who have ears but cannot hear.

285
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,318
<i>You must listen to him.</i>

286
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,907
<i>Seek peace and pursue it.</i>

287
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,497
<i>Nation shall not lift up
sword against nation.</i>

288
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,295
<i>Neither shall
they learn war anymore.</i>

289
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,508
That, uh, that last line...
I've heard it somewhere.

290
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,917
Isaiah, chapter 2, verse 4.

291
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,096
The Bible.

292
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:05,194
It's a mishmash of quotes
from the Koran, the Torah,

293
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,058
the gospels of Bhagavad-Gita...

294
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,729
All the major religious works,
from what we can tell.

295
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,565
You're saying this is
a message from God?

296
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,061
It's for you all to draw
your own conclusions.

297
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm...
only relaying the message.

298
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,074
What does that make you, Major...
Moses with the tablets?

299
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,644
Maybe we should
look at it this way...

300
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:27,747
that the creatures are using our beliefs
to communicate with us.

301
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:30,721
They're giving us back
our own words, so to speak.

302
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,673
The question is,
"our words or God's?"

303
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:41,177
Well, Sir, that's a matter
of personal belief.

304
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:44,348
The quotation does seem
to send a message

305
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:46,307
that transcends all creeds.

306
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,789
These other ones that have
fallen on the Earth...

307
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,248
What do we know of them?

308
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,679
Well, they seem to be
landing in clusters.

309
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,836
We have reports that they appear
to be physically identical

310
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,588
and use the same tactics
to stun people.

311
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,574
As far as we know, all the coma
subjects around the world

312
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:04,451
gave the same message
at exactly the same time.

313
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,578
What are you saying, Bert?
What can we interpret from this?

314
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,825
Their last quote sums up
their intentions, I think,

315
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,284
rather unequivocally...

316
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,083
"He can destroy you if he wills

317
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,222
"and bring into being
a new creation.

318
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,215
"That is no difficult thing
for him."

319
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:21,753
Regardless of who
or what sent this message,

320
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:24,790
if we ignore it, I think we can
safely assume what the threat is.

321
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,131
Are you seriously suggesting that...

322
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,956
that the world disarm itself?

323
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:33,719
We are saying that
they are suggesting it, Sir.

324
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,501
- Mr. President, may I?
- Certainly.

325
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,131
How do we know this isn't a ploy

326
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,423
to lay down our weapons
before these things attack?

327
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,174
Forget interpreting their words.

328
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:45,031
Let's look at their actions.
They have invaded us.

329
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,294
There are now thousands
all over the world.

330
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:49,429
We have a country on amber alert,

331
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,818
and you're asking us
to hand them the keys.

332
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:55,661
<i>Maybe God is asking us
to set things straight.</i>

333
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,182
<i>Maybe he's asking us
to set aside our differences.</i>

334
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,479
Or maybe we're being duped
by a civilization of extraterrestrials.

335
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,298
<i>And what are you suggesting,
General?</i>

336
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:05,996
I'm suggesting we prepare
to defend ourselves.

337
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,254
<i>Against, what exactly?</i>

338
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:11,959
Why are we assuming that
these things are laying dormant

339
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,146
and not lying in wait?

340
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:15,560
Their message is
anything but peaceful.

341
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,391
Major Skynner,
wouldn't you agree?

342
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,299
Major?

343
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:25,293
I'd have to agree.

344
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:33,891
<i>Well, then, this may be
your first war, General,</i>

345
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:37,667
<i>where you can be certain
that God is not on your side.</i>

346
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:41,808
Excuse me, Sirs.
You all need to see this.

347
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,808
<i>What you're watching is live
over Washington.</i>

348
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:48,359
<i>Eyewitnesses say the lights</i>

349
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,286
<i>you can see,
appear from out of nowhere.</i>

350
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:54,661
<i>It is unclear what they're made
of or what is causing them.</i>

351
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,548
<i>This phenomenon is apparently
occurring over major cities</i>

352
00:24:58,802 --> 00:24:59,947
<i>around the world.</i>

353
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:18,310
It's confirmed, Sir.
They're over all our major cities,

354
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,745
every city in the world.
All tv broadcasts have been interrupted.

355
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:24,374
We're scrambling aircraft now
to gather telemetry.

356
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:30,104
- Go to maximum force readiness.
- Yes, Sir.

357
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,146
Patch in all nations
with nuclear capabilities.

358
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:33,856
Mr. President,
you're jumping to conclusions.

359
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:35,092
Thanks for your help, Bert.

360
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:37,046
Lieutenant,
we all take it from here.

361
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,808
Wait a sec...
Are you dismissing us?

362
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,659
Sir! Sir,
you're making a mistake.

363
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,248
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, Sir.

364
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:45,533
Where's home for you?

365
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:51,072
Ohio.

366
00:26:58,265 --> 00:26:59,392
You okay?

367
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,536
You know,
when I was a little kid...

368
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:13,485
my dad used to describe God,
and it was...

369
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,325
so beautiful.

370
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,129
Maybe God looks better
from a distance.

371
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:25,825
I'm just not ready for this.

372
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,421
I think we all feel
that way right now.

373
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:33,425
I'm sorry
if you think I let you down.

374
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:39,097
I think you let yourself down.

375
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,895
I think you buried your hope
with your wife.

376
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,258
It's... It's not that
I didn't want to believe.

377
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,524
Where are you going?

378
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:39,941
They're shutting down
all our warheads, Sir.

379
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,327
What are you talking about?

380
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,945
Somehow, they're disarming
our bombs systematically.

381
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,103
- Systematically?
- State by state, Sir.

382
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,159
At the rate they're going,
we have one hour maximum

383
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,686
before all our warheads are down.

384
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:01,917
The presidents of Russia
and China are dialed in, Sirs.

385
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:30,694
We've all received
the same threat,

386
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,086
and we all face the same dilemma
of losing our defense systems.

387
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:38,027
According to our calculations,
we have less than 40 minutes

388
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,719
to act before all warheads
are decommissioned worldwide.

389
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:45,204
Considering this diminishing
window of opportunity,

390
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,196
I propose a temporary
suspension of the...

391
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,943
guidelines to all relevant
international treaties

392
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:54,427
so that we may act swiftly
and without encumbrance.

393
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:58,424
Mr. President, please
forgive my interruption.

394
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:00,879
By "act swiftly", what do you mean?

395
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:06,047
I mean to mount an offensive against
these invaders while we still can.

396
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:09,866
You mean to attack?

397
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:16,760
Then we respectfully disagree
with such a move.

398
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,304
"We"?

399
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:22,514
Russia, China,

400
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:25,595
Pakistan and North Korea
feel the best action

401
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,930
would be to comply
with the demands.

402
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,672
We are asking
to United States and her allies

403
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:35,347
to join us in a coordinated,
multiphased decommissioning

404
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:38,033
of all primary weapons
of mass destruction.

405
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,626
This should send a clear message

406
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,581
that we are cooperating
with their demands.

407
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:45,322
Disarmament would leave all of us wide
open to attack from these invaders...

408
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,115
or anyone.

409
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,072
What do you hope to gain?

410
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,828
<i>There is nothing to gain.</i>

411
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:54,344
<i>But a lot to loose if we do not comply
with their demands.</i>

412
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,069
Demands that are unreasonable.

413
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:58,635
<i>When does God has to be reasonable?</i>

414
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:03,887
God or no God, we feel
we are left with no other choice.

415
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,605
We have the choice to defend.

416
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:08,564
You mean to attack.

417
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:11,836
They're immobilizing our weapons.
This is an invasion, Sir.

418
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,455
Mr. President,

419
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:17,112
we don't even know
what these things are made of.

420
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:20,192
How do you wage an attack
against the unknown?

421
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,701
How do we know
what reaction we may provoke?

422
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:25,998
So France also
would deny our right to...

423
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,951
to protect ourselves
from these invaders?

424
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:32,593
The way to protect yourself
and the world

425
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:35,834
would be to cooperate,
to disarm.

426
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:37,227
And if we don't comply?

427
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:41,672
We could only view your nation

428
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:43,925
as a threat to the world safety.

429
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:45,308
"Threat"?

430
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:47,260
What are you saying?

431
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,630
If the United States
fails to comply,

432
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:57,104
we will regretfully
have no recourse

433
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:58,558
but to take actions.

434
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:01,479
Actions?

435
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,792
To destroy your weapons.

436
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:07,024
President Jing,

437
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,211
consider the gravity
of what you are saying.

438
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:13,202
You are threatening
first strike on America.

439
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:19,160
We're being threatened
with annihilation.

440
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,168
Either you lay down

441
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:23,341
your arms with the rest of us,

442
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,769
or we will do it for you.

443
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:36,561
We have ten minutes maximum
before all our weapons go down.

444
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,434
It will take at least 3 min from
the time you give your command

445
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:41,614
till the time we launch, Sir.
We need to commit.

446
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:46,188
Mr. President, we are quickly
running out of time.

447
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:48,519
We need to make
a gesture of compliance.

448
00:32:49,855 --> 00:32:51,597
You are leaving me with no choice

449
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:53,761
but to give the command
to launch on your country.

450
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,630
President Jing, all of you,

451
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,188
I have a duty to my people
to protect them.

452
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,974
I cannot in good conscience
do nothing.

453
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,809
I beg you,
reconsider your convictions.

454
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:06,712
I beg you to do the same.

455
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:11,342
You are putting
the whole world in jeopardy.

456
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:14,211
Demanding compliance
through force is not diplomacy.

457
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,647
Yet the United States...

458
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:22,904
has demanded the compliance
of many countries through force

459
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:25,148
and called it diplomacy.

460
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:27,298
Are you trying
to provoke a retaliation?

461
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,579
Of course not.

462
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:33,645
If they launch...

463
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:35,239
can you intercept?

464
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,476
Yes, Sir, but we're limited
to the warheads left.

465
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,996
There is also the issue
of fallout, Sir.

466
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,727
If we move now,
we still have the capacity

467
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:45,085
to knock out China
and the invaders.

468
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,579
You want to fight a war
on two fronts?

469
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,765
Mr. President, if we're going to commit,
we need to commit entirely.

470
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:51,889
General,

471
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:55,609
I'm weighing certain destruction
against potential destruction.

472
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,777
Respectfully, Sir,
do you want to be remembered

473
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:01,163
as the President who sat back
and did nothing?

474
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,166
We've got five minutes, Sir.

475
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:31,975
I'm asking all of you for...
for some solidarity.

476
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,824
So are we.

477
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:34,991
Please!

478
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:37,762
Is there nothing I can say?

479
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,305
Are there no words?

480
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:47,397
Alert all control systems
to await my command.

481
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,295
Yes, Sir.

482
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:52,605
I'm giving the order to launch.

483
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:56,146
President Jing, please!

484
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,705
You have brought this
upon yourself.

485
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:27,762
Bertie.

486
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,651
Come to me.

487
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:34,849
Margaret?

488
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:36,665
Wonderful...

489
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,481
Oh, my darling.

490
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,248
Darling?

491
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,210
I can't hear you.

492
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:58,978
It's...

493
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,706
beautiful, Bertie.

494
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:06,564
They're showing it all to me...
Everything...

495
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:09,428
The universe.

496
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:12,840
Listen.

497
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,240
Can you hear?

498
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:20,616
That's its sound.

499
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,153
One day, you'll hear it.

500
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,228
One day, they'll all hear it.

501
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:32,572
They're listening.

502
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:35,491
They're watching.

503
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:42,143
Skynner, wake up. Skynner!

504
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:46,058
I hear it.

505
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,290
I hear it.

506
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:50,707
Mr. President?

507
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,688
Okay, I'll speak the truth.

508
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,050
I don't trust you.

509
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:03,698
I don't trust your countries.

510
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,655
I don't understand
your cultures.

511
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,913
I'm afraid of you.
That's why we build the bombs.

512
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:13,389
Right now, you're proving that all
my fears are... are well-founded.

513
00:37:14,136 --> 00:37:15,666
I tell myself I should have no...

514
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,709
no prejudices, but I do.

515
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,493
We all do.

516
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:21,807
We are no different from you.

517
00:37:22,512 --> 00:37:25,066
Let them hear it.
Let them all hear it.

518
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:29,759
We're all the same.

519
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:31,627
We're all the same!

520
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:38,024
Everything is... connected.

521
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:39,505
Everything is...

522
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,861
connected.

523
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:47,631
We all want the same things,

524
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,788
and we're all afraid
of losing them.

525
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:52,185
That's become our commonality...

526
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:54,410
Fear.

527
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,259
We imagine fearsome Gods,

528
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,894
and we build fearsome weapons.

529
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:03,354
We're lost to fear.

530
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,199
- We must...
- Stop...

531
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:09,946
...stop.

532
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,731
The fear must...

533
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,182
...must stop.

534
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:55,836
I give the order to stand down.

535
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,239
Is anyone listening?

536
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:11,268
What was that?

537
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:15,991
I can understand you!

538
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:21,905
<i>How is this possible...</i>

539
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:42,054
Oh, my God.

540
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:38,423
<i>We've been
given a choice today...</i>

541
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,225
<i>a choice to listen to each other</i>

542
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,335
<i>and hear the heart
of humanity...</i>

543
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:48,411
<i>A choice to change things
by ourselves,</i>

544
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:50,266
<i>for ourselves...</i>

545
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,773
<i>...in the knowledge
that we are not alone.</i>

546
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,973
Do you think it'll last?

547
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,333
We can live in hope.

548
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:22,201
