1
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,631
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

2
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:09,093
<i>we have wondered
how life began.</i>

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:12,839
<i>What our purpose is
and where we are headed.</i>

4
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:20,036
<i>We have struggled
to understand time,</i>

5
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,853
<i>matter, the infinite universe,</i>

6
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:26,393
<i>who we are
and if we are alone.</i>

7
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:33,361
<i>Great minds have imagined
the most wonderful</i>

8
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:37,335
<i>and the most terrifying answers
to these questions.</i>

9
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:42,153
<i>We invite you to join us
on this great expedition.</i>

10
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:04,995
Almost done.

11
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:34,089
<i>Are there events
so impossible to forget</i>

12
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:37,320
<i>that they become too
painful to remember?</i>

13
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,725
Forgot to shave this morning.

14
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,781
Sorry to hear that, Doctor.

15
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:03,959
Gail?

16
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:11,236
This is hard, Deanna.

17
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:15,490
Let's see if I can make it easier.

18
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:18,882
The cancer has metastasized.

19
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,229
H.E.R.-2s are through the roof,

20
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,872
and treatment prospects are poor.

21
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:28,560
Sorry.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,415
It's not your fault, Charles.

23
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:33,831
Feels like it is somehow.

24
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,953
So what do you think,
three to four months?

25
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:40,460
Sure.

26
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,319
You're a better doctor
than you are a liar.

27
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,596
See you next time.

28
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,748
If I can work it in.

29
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:02,936
Come in.

30
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,049
I'm not sure I'm in the right place.

31
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,925
You are. Please sit down.

32
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,540
Want some water?

33
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,314
No, I'm...

34
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,373
Did I have an appointment?

35
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,016
You're right on time.

36
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:27,304
I pride myself on that...
being punctual.

37
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,135
It's a lost art.

38
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,576
I've always said so.

39
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:34,682
And you are?

40
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,020
Dr. Evans.

41
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,978
This is... a hospital?

42
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,402
May I ask you some questions?

43
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:45,548
The nurse's station.
They directed me.

44
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,707
I'd like to start
with a little game.

45
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,286
Game? What sort of game?

46
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,168
I want you to watch
what I'm doing.

47
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,467
Are you going
to make that disappear?

48
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:01,035
What's under the handkerchief?

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,697
Can we place a bet on it?

50
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,511
Not this time.

51
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,895
Let's see. A paperweight?

52
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,892
Wonderful.

53
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,378
There.

54
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,617
You're not recording this, are you?

55
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:25,232
- Would that matter to you?
- I simply want to know.

56
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,820
Matter of common courtesy.

57
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,276
You're being dig'ed.

58
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,885
These are cameras, are they not?

59
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,340
You're very observant.

60
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,135
<i>I'm being observed.</i>

61
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:41,553
<i>We're both being observed.</i>

62
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,133
Do you like it here?

63
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:56,743
Well, honestly, I haven't been here
long enough to form an opinion.

64
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,772
How long have you been here?

65
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:07,437
Tell me...

66
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,806
what you were doing
before you got here.

67
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,679
Before I...

68
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,589
I was at work.

69
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,467
And where do you work?

70
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,035
I.S.T. worldwide.

71
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:21,817
That's a technology company.

72
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,498
- That's correct.
- Government work?

73
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,417
- Pentagon.
- And what do you do there?

74
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,053
I run the company.
I suspect you know that.

75
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,531
Well, why do you assume I know?

76
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,886
It's hardly a secret.

77
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,720
What we work on...
That's another matter.

78
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,586
<i>Something you can't discuss.</i>

79
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,634
<i>Suffice it to say that we're</i>

80
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:40,770
<i>an indispensable part
of this nation's defense.</i>

81
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,500
Well, I wouldn't want you
to compromise

82
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,304
any state secrets.

83
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,412
Confidentiality is part
of your work, too, Doctor...

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,004
Doctor/patient privilege
and all that hokum.

85
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,002
Excuse me.

86
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,847
so your job seems
quite important...

87
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,421
Lucrative, too, I guess.

88
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,933
That's a little personal.

89
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:08,569
I could retire before I turn 45,
but I doubt that I will.

90
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,734
What about your family?

91
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:13,246
- What about them?
- Children?

92
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,930
Look, for the life of me,
I don't know what you're getting at,

93
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,283
but for the record, I have
been married for 13 years.

94
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:22,943
My wife is named Dorothy.

95
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:26,037
I have 2 children...
Margaret, 12, and Peter, 7.

96
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:29,103
We live in
a 10,000-square foot colonial.

97
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:30,562
I drive a 2-seater.

98
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,393
I'm a Redskins
season ticket holder.

99
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,186
I don't eat quiche,

100
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:37,355
and I loathe pointless small talk.

101
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,343
- What's your name?
- You obviously know my name.

102
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm Robert Havelmann.

103
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,288
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

104
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,833
- Lots.
- Am I being interrogated?

105
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,382
Is that what's going on?

106
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,110
What's under the handkerchief?

107
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,467
How in god's name should I know?

108
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,379
- How old are you?
- This is absurd.

109
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,803
It's a simple question.

110
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,812
I'm 41 years old.
How old are you, dDctor?

111
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,311
What year is this?

112
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,635
- Are you seriously asking--
- Year, Mr. Havelmann.

113
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,738
It's 2007. Maybe you should
pop for a desk calendar.

114
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,172
So it's 2007,
and you're 41 years old.

115
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,344
- That's what I said.
- Take a look in the mirror.

116
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:17,807
- What?
- Please.

117
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:19,244
The mirror.

118
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:27,997
My god!

119
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,432
What have you done to me?

120
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,255
What did you do to me?!

121
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:42,281
But you agree
there's no significant change.

122
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,717
You watched.
Did you see any sign of progress?

123
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,940
The old man is losing
his patience with us.

124
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,367
How does he think I feel?

125
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,142
Maybe
we ought to try another tack.

126
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:55,471
I need more time.

127
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:02,727
Thanks. So you still think
there's a chance he'll remember?

128
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,134
I don't think he's forgotten.

129
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,155
On some level, he knows.

130
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:09,188
You'll have a hard time
convincing Geslow of that...

131
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,907
- Or me, for that matter.
- That's why I need more time.

132
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,291
Just a few more sessions.
I know I can break through.

133
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,756
You know how much
I respect your work...

134
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:22,263
You think
I've lost my objectivity.

135
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,441
Presumes you had it
in the first place.

136
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:27,324
Not with Havelmann, anyway.

137
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,830
- That's not even the point.
- Then what is the point?

138
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,394
Accountability. The truth.

139
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,626
He can't just keep pretending
to disappear into the ether like this.

140
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,804
Two number twos, nice and hot.

141
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,380
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thanks.

142
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,914
So what should I tell Geslow?

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,792
Buy me a week.

144
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:55,525
He wants closure on this.

145
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,889
Not as much as I do.

146
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:02,730
Deanna, there are so many other
people here who need you...

147
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,086
People in pain,
people who've lost hope...

148
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,776
Lives you could be saving.

149
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,609
You're a gifted Doctor, and...

150
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,930
Well, I honestly think
you're throwing away

151
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,737
the chance to make a difference.

152
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,307
I care about these people.

153
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,335
That's why I'm doing this.

154
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,011
I'm doing this for them.

155
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,668
I need one more week.

156
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,995
I am so over vegetable lasagna.

157
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:44,267
Hold on here.

158
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,609
Oh! Behind you!

159
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,580
- Will!
- Gotcha!

160
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,370
Over here! Gotcha!

161
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,522
No, you got my shirt.
That doesn't even count.

162
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,752
No, no, no, no.
He got you. He got you.

163
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,014
I got you. Oh.

164
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:10,040
Will, be careful.

165
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,364
Come on! Hi, Dad!

166
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,113
Oh! You got me.

167
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,497
That's because you're it.

168
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,303
Come in.

169
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,310
- Hello?
- Mr. Havelmann.

170
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,320
They told me down the hall...

171
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,516
Come in.

172
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,166
What can I do for you?

173
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:56,495
I thought we could have a talk.

174
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,588
I'm sorry. Have we met?

175
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:00,368
Dr. Evans.

176
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,956
I was due for a checkup...
annual thing.

177
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,599
- Is that why I'm here?
- You tell me.

178
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:09,544
You're what kind
of doctor, exactly?

179
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:10,858
A psychiatrist.

180
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,911
Then I'm definitely
in the wrong office.

181
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,079
I don't think so.

182
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:18,889
What's this about?

183
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:21,584
I think you can answer that,
Mr. Havelmann.

184
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:23,508
It's pierce.

185
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,036
It's that S.O.B. Pierce.
Am I right?

186
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:29,903
Niles!

187
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:32,566
Not now, Jerry.
We're late already.

188
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,709
- I need your support.
- Yeah. Always.

189
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,136
Tell me I got you in my corner.

190
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,366
Yeah, yeah, always.
Let's get to that meeting.

191
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,090
I'm going after Havelmann.

192
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,849
I thought we agreed the strategy
was to let him self-destruct.

193
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,164
We can't wait for that.

194
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:48,089
I don't think it'll be long.
The man's a ticking bomb.

195
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,872
He's a lot smarter than you think.

196
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,350
You give him way too much credit.

197
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,003
He canned Seidman this morning.

198
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,998
He smells rebellion
in the ranks.

199
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,542
He's dangerous to us...
to this company.

200
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,138
We have to move now.

201
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,815
We wait till we go public,
He consolidates his power.

202
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,276
You take your shot, Jerry.

203
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:13,178
I will not be joing you
in this suicide expedition.

204
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,828
- Niles...
- Say what you like about Roberts.

205
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:17,815
He has friends in high places.

206
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:20,289
We all have friends
in high places.

207
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,876
Happy hunting.

208
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,588
I need to know
if I can count on you

209
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,422
to help me take
this son of a bitch down.

210
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,887
Jerry pierce was
my right-hand man

211
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:39,596
until he made a very
serious miscalculation.

212
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:43,117
- What happened?
- He went off the reservation.

213
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:45,748
Let's call it an aborted <i>coup</i>.

214
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,880
- But you stopped him.
- I fired him, yes.

215
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:51,640
But I don't know
if that stopped him.

216
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,575
- Because?
- Because I'm here, aren't I?

217
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:57,866
Somebody is still gathering
information against me.

218
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,497
Do I detect a little note
of paranoia?

219
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:04,699
<i>You don't know the corporate
world very well, do you, Doctor?</i>

220
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,398
<i>- No, suppose I don't.
- It's not going to work.</i>

221
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:09,878
I built I.S.T.

222
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,869
I have a game plan.

223
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,615
I'm not about to see it derailed.

224
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:17,667
You believe strongly
in maintaining your objectives.

225
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,169
That's what it's all about.

226
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,676
You chart a course,
and then you stick to it.

227
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:23,864
No... self-doubt?

228
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:27,381
As a leader,
first thing you learn...

229
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,568
Inconsistency

230
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,666
invites disrespect.

231
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,911
Respect.
That's important to you.

232
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,269
Respect, honor,

233
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,935
loyalty, old-fashioned values...

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,857
All in painfully short supply
these days, I'm afraid.

235
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,824
How would you describe your values?

236
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,571
The fundamentals...

237
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,158
God, the family, Constitution,

238
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,524
- doing what's right.
- What's right.

239
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,620
It's not a dirty word, Doctor.

240
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,601
No. No.

241
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,713
If we ent a little more time

242
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,854
protecting the fundamentals,

243
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,954
we wouldn't be as vulnerable
to our enemies.

244
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,725
Sounds like a man
ripe for politics.

245
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:09,456
Don't laugh. I've thought about
throwing my hat in the ring...

246
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,821
State legislature.

247
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,192
Of course, there's a little
empire-building to take care of first.

248
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,784
You're an ambitious man.
Is that fair to say?

249
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,747
I only want what's due me.

250
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:21,888
I think we both want that.

251
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,429
- I'm sorry?
- Let's just drop the charade,

252
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,945
Mr. Havelmann.
It's really getting old.

253
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:30,476
You make it sound
as if we've met before.

254
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,715
Imagine that.

255
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,668
Look, whatever this is about,

256
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,668
we've got ten minutes
to conclude it.

257
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,194
I'm due at my daughter's school
at 11:00.

258
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,033
She's in a play, and I promised
dorothy I wouldn't miss it.

259
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,128
Promises like that...
they mean a lot to you?

260
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,268
If you had children,
you'd understand.

261
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:48,557
If I had children?

262
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,482
I had two children,
Mr. Havelmann...

263
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:55,288
A boy and a girl,
just like you.

264
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,740
Only I don't have them anymore,

265
00:15:58,106 --> 00:15:59,552
because somebody killed them.

266
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:02,585
You killed them.

267
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,205
You killed my babies!

268
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:12,110
We ran Havelmann through
the synaptical scanner.

269
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,922
That's digned to detect
brain abnormalities, am I right?

270
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:17,067
For the most part, yes.

271
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:19,283
But I had them adapt
the program in a way I believe

272
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,025
amounts to
a very sophisticated lie detector.

273
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,019
And let me guess.

274
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:26,039
This proves that he's lying.

275
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,722
No, not definitively,

276
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:30,989
- but it does prove that there's...
- But what? What? Deanna...

277
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,948
You've been banging your head
against the same wall for a year.

278
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,613
Don't you see what he's doing?

279
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,087
He's hiding.

280
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,618
He's cocooned himself
into a dream world.

281
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:43,016
I don't know what's crazier,
him taking refuge inside his head

282
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,662
- or you thinking that this matters.
- But there are moments.

283
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,608
It's almost like he's reaching out,

284
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,778
as if he senses
a whole different reality.

285
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,008
Oh, come on.

286
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,665
You just have to talk to him.
He's lost his mind.

287
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,840
It's not as if he hasn't
already paid the price.

288
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,676
He has to be held accountable.

289
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,929
He can't just get off scot-free.

290
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:08,277
You have until the end of the week.
Then we put this thing to rest.

291
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,481
It's wednesday.
That's only 2 more days. Warren,

292
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,225
if I push him too hard,
we might never get him back.

293
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,168
Deanna, we have to move on.

294
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,835
We can't afford

295
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,721
to endlessly tie up
ouresources on Havelmann.

296
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:22,533
You know the difference between us?

297
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,832
You've given up.

298
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,484
I haven't.

299
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,270
I haven't.

300
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,375
My, uh...

301
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,431
My colleagues...

302
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,764
think they have a possible diagnosis
of your condition.

303
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,219
My condition?

304
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:46,726
I wasn't aware I had a condition.

305
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,550
They think you exhibit
symptoms remarkably similar

306
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,212
to Korsakoff's syndrome.

307
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,770
You ever heard of that before?

308
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,267
No doubt there was
an "Oprah" devoted to it.

309
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,390
Korsakoff's syndrome
is a rare form of memory loss.

310
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,703
There was a famous case
back in the 1970s.

311
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:07,215
A marine sergeant
by the name of Arthur Briggs...

312
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,691
He was in his late 50s,

313
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,155
good health, generally.

314
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,077
But somehow he lost
his memory of any event

315
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,995
which occurred to him
after September

316
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,381
1944.

317
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,650
I don't know
what this has to do with me.

318
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,466
I remember everything
that happened to me

319
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,113
right up until the time
I walked into this room.

320
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:26,343
And that's precisely
what Briggs told his doctors.

321
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,345
And to prove it, he told them
that world war ii was going strong,

322
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,679
that his unit was being
deployed to the Philippines,

323
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,216
- and that he was 20 years old.
- Fascinating.

324
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:37,744
Couldn't rember anything that happened
to him for longer than 40 minutes.

325
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:41,036
He was permanently stuck in 1944.

326
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:42,830
Very distressing, no doubt.

327
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:46,419
Now can weet on with it?
Where's the questionnaire?

328
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,179
What questionnaire?

329
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,761
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

330
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,634
To answer questions like,
do I sometimes feel

331
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:55,353
as if there were
a tight band around my head?

332
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,343
And do I agree
with the statement

333
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:00,661
that these days I don't believe
we have much to hope for?

334
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,632
- Oh. Do you?
- Do I what?

335
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:04,773
Believe we have much to hope for?

336
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,284
I'm not going to be forced
from my position

337
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:10,678
by a handful of young turks

338
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:13,973
who don't know cutting-edge
from cutting farts.

339
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,409
Your colleagues
didn't send you here.

340
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:20,108
Then who did?

341
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,654
I envy you, Mr. Havelmann.

342
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:27,648
- You don't even know me.
- You never have to grow old.

343
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,662
You never have to watch
your friends die.

344
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,401
You can still enjoy
the music you love,

345
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,153
the pleasures of a good meal,
good sex.

346
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,217
- You'll always be 41 years old.
- Not in 4 months, I won't.

347
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,028
You can create misery,

348
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:42,111
but you don't have to feel it.
You made a clean escape.

349
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,107
I don't have to put up with this.

350
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,960
You don't have to put up
with any of it.

351
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,176
That's what's remarkable
about your deception.

352
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:50,750
You are blissfully insulated
from who you are,

353
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,805
from what you've done, or maybe,

354
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:54,726
just maybe,

355
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,994
it's just what
you want us to believe.

356
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:00,071
Go to hell.

357
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,183
What was the weather like
this morning?

358
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,564
Do I really need to tell you?

359
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,917
It was
a glorious spring morning.

360
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,881
68 degrees.

361
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,299
Red buds on the trees.

362
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,552
- Is that so?
- Good day.

363
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:19,693
Take a look out
the window before you go.

364
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,235
That's not possible.

365
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,491
I've been very careful
with you up to now.

366
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,395
But that wall
between you and your memory

367
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,216
is coming down.

368
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,054
There's nothing wrong
with my memory.

369
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,368
No, nothing,

370
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,509
except that little ellipsis...

371
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,783
the 24 years that are missing.

372
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:56,824
To...

373
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,237
this morning.

374
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,934
I don't remember
discussing this morning.

375
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,718
That's... of course.
We're beyond our window.

376
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:09,251
Your attention span,
it's shorter than sergeant Briggs'.

377
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:10,819
Who's sergeant Briggs?

378
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:14,532
Never mind. This morning.
Tell me about this morning.

379
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,089
I got up at 6:30,
just like every morning.

380
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,464
Dorothy made me breakfast...

381
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,370
oatmeal, one slice of ham.

382
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,117
I kissed the children.
I picked up my briefcase.

383
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,328
You were going to the office?

384
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,588
Of course. Where else would I...

385
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,429
But you wound up here...

386
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,367
at the...

387
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:38,964
hospital.

388
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,280
All right, I did.

389
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,323
How did you get here?

390
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:51,041
If you know the damn answer,
then tell me.

391
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:55,587
The answer
is you were already here.

392
00:21:58,669 --> 00:21:59,829
That's absurd.

393
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,267
What do you remember
before walking into this room?

394
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:05,024
There was a nurses' station.
I got directions.

395
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,657
There's no nurses' station.

396
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,122
I'm quite certain. I...

397
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,360
There is... no...

398
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,116
nurses' station.

399
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:18,939
All right, I...

400
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,329
I could be wrong about that.

401
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,737
Maybe we're finally
making some headway.

402
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,955
I'm glad you see it.

403
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:34,449
The technology your company
supplies to the government...

404
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:35,930
You don't like talking about that.

405
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,174
I'm forbidden from
discussing the details

406
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:40,019
of our proprietary patents.

407
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,257
Okay, well,
you have my permission.

408
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:45,346
Really.

409
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,597
All right.

410
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:56,545
We managed a breakthrough
in impulse beam weaponry.

411
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,943
Satellite delivery,
intelligent targeting.

412
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,268
- Intelligent targeting?
- That's right.

413
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:05,561
Ah, I bet that's winning you
some points on the hill.

414
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,408
It never hurts to have the support

415
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,709
of those who control
the purse strings.

416
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,483
Actually,
you might be happy to know

417
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,389
that you sold your interest
in the company

418
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,385
for nearly a billion dollars in 2009.

419
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,223
Is that so?

420
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:26,397
You cashed in
your political chits as well...

421
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,542
to run for a seat in
the maryland state legislature.

422
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,284
Maybe you could tell me
who to bet on

423
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,858
in the world series in 2010.

424
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,037
Oh, 2010?

425
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:46,110
If I'm not mistaken,
it's the braves in six.

426
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:50,102
You are a deeply disturbed woman.

427
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,540
You have no idea.

428
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,793
So how does the fairy tale end,
Mother Goose?

429
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,035
<i>- Get your hands up.
- That's my wrap.</i>

430
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:02,058
- Did you wash these?
- I don't want that.

431
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,184
What? You told me you wanted a...

432
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,573
No! Not mine.

433
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,047
- Did you wash these hands?
- Look, look, look.

434
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,028
- Now he took mine.
- Easy.

435
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:11,915
Why does he get chicken?

436
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,830
Sir.

437
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:26,139
Major, we're at defcon one.

438
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:28,691
- Defcon one?
- You've been ordered to the bunker.

439
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:31,895
I'm gonna decline.

440
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:35,020
It's not about saving you, Major.
It's not your call one way or the other.

441
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,942
We're not launching?
It hasn't come to that?

442
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:39,764
You'll be briefed at the appropriate
time. Now get in the vehicle.

443
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,271
well, I'm not going alone.
I'm gonna take my family...

444
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:45,025
My children, my husband.
We just need an hour.

445
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,389
You don't have an hour,
and even if you did,

446
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:49,358
there's no provision
for you bringing anyone.

447
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:52,144
Now please get in the vehicle.
discussion is over.

448
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,559
- Mom? Mom!
- Deanna!

449
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:07,837
That's how it started...

450
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,941
An international crisis.

451
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:12,100
Not the first, certainly,

452
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,681
but it was the last.

453
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,283
If you have a shred
of decency in you, Dr. Evans...

454
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:21,058
It's Major Evans.
I work for the NSA.

455
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:22,282
Whoever you are,

456
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,400
I just want to go home.

457
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:25,838
Is that asking too much?

458
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,020
You don't have a home.

459
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:30,374
None of us do.
Our homes are gone.

460
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:33,837
Our families are gone.

461
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,853
Anything that ever mattered to us...

462
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,740
is gone.

463
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,472
You're talking in circles.

464
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,641
I-I don't know
where we are anymore.

465
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,049
Well, then I'll tell you...

466
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,175
We're stuck here,

467
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,564
1,000 meters under a hillside

468
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:55,226
in Virginia.

469
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,778
That doesn't make any sense.

470
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,144
I don't care
what year you say it is.

471
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:01,408
You just showed me
the view out of that window.

472
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,679
It's quite obvious.
We're not underground!

473
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,599
It's not a real window.

474
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:08,341
It's a projection,
a digital display.

475
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:09,541
Then you admit,

476
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,077
you have been
playing with my mind!

477
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:14,583
We're not underground!
It's not winter!

478
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:18,033
Oh, it's winter, all right...
Nuclearwinter.

479
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,122
That was a view
from a robotic camera

480
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,962
3,000 feet above us.

481
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,938
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Havelmann.

482
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,134
I am going to see
my daughter's play.

483
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:39,571
I am going
to see my family now.

484
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,519
And I'm going to report you

485
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:46,831
as unconscionably abusive
to your patients.

486
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,662
Your family is dead,
Mr. Havelmann.

487
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,018
That is a horrible thing to say!

488
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:53,910
Not as horrible
as the way they died.

489
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,421
This has gone far enough.
You're a lunatic.

490
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,711
I just saw my wife
less than two hours ago!

491
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,147
And so you've been telling me
for ten months.

492
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:05,273
Game's over, Havelmann.

493
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:07,505
You never showed any pity.
Why should you get any?

494
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,881
You're not a doctor
at all, are you?

495
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,287
Deanna,
what the hell are you doing?

496
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:17,793
Deanna, put the gun down.

497
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,531
<i>Deanna, please, just put it...</i>

498
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:28,620
Nobody's gonna save you now.
Nobody.

499
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:32,255
- Now where were we?
- Somebody help me!

500
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:34,271
You will remember,

501
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,252
Mr. Havelmann,

502
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:38,538
or you'll die trying.

503
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,034
I had a feeling something
like this might happen.

504
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:48,230
- What you gonna do?
- Find a way to that room and stop her.

505
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:51,162
- What do you expect me to do?
- There is an alternative.

506
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:57,245
What are you talking about?

507
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,959
You could let things
take their course.

508
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,439
Maybe she isn't the only one
who's cracked under the pressure.

509
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,450
Justice would be served,
one way or the other.

510
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,407
The justice of naked revenge?

511
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:11,518
Is there another kind left?

512
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,262
I don't believe you.

513
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,420
Not a single thing
you've said.

514
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:22,795
Then I suppose that puts us
on equal footing,

515
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,178
except that I can prove
that what I'm saying is true.

516
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:27,986
Fine.
Then by all means, prove it.

517
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,857
- Just put down the...
- Get back!

518
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,253
That's New York.

519
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,457
Former population, 11.3 million.

520
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:48,866
No survivors.

521
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:52,420
That's Tokyo.

522
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,714
Sao Paulo.

523
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,698
Beijing.

524
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,714
And that's London...

525
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,620
Eight hours after the bombs hit.

526
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:09,259
The first few weeks,

527
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:12,498
we had reports
of pockets of survivors

528
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:15,888
in Central America,
North Africa, Australia.

529
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,251
But we lost contact with them.

530
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,374
As of now, we're not sure
if there's any more

531
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,857
than 871 people alive,

532
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,620
all inside this bunker.

533
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,193
You're asking me to believe
that I left home this morning,

534
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:31,727
kissed my wife and kids

535
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,915
and then stepped through
some kind of time tunnel

536
00:29:37,413 --> 00:29:39,789
into a post-nuclear holocaust?

537
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:43,376
You're not listening to me,
Mr. Havelmann.

538
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:47,184
You never really did hear me,
did you?

539
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:50,489
You couldn't even hear
your own experts

540
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,565
when it might have
made a difference.

541
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,880
We have a potential problem
with the I.B.-8, sir.

542
00:29:58,307 --> 00:29:59,561
What sort of problem?

543
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:02,532
It may be more...

544
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:05,255
More powerful
than we intended it to be.

545
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,978
We're designing the weapons
system of the future, Nate.

546
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,836
The more powerful, the better.
Or am I missing something here?

547
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:15,759
Group 5 ran the beta
through 10,000 sims.

548
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:17,604
Every possible scenario,

549
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,435
including the targeting
of nuclear sites,

550
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,763
missiles, power plants.

551
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,343
And?

552
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:30,072
We think the beam
could unintentionally trigger

553
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:34,188
all fissionable material
within a radius of 60 miles.

554
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,086
You think, or you know?

555
00:30:39,897 --> 00:30:42,323
We're not certain,
but given the danger...

556
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:44,553
- Of course.
- The potential...

557
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,093
I-I mean, if we don't solve this...

558
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,731
I'll read this immediately.

559
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:51,162
Mansur blew the whistle,
didn't he?

560
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:52,708
You had ample warnings.

561
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,138
You just wouldn't heed them.

562
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,961
There was a timetable in place.

563
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:02,115
A timetable.

564
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,602
Do you think the competion
calls a time-out?

565
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,292
- So you ignored the warnings?
- Of course not.

566
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:10,203
We tweaked the design.
We built in safeguards,

567
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,260
but we didn't veer off course.

568
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,096
Right and now
you're looking at the result.

569
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,052
You're showing me a simulation
to manipulate--

570
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:17,177
It's not a simulation.

571
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:20,489
- There's a sea of corpses--
- How stupid do you think I am, Major?

572
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:21,893
You're not stupid.

573
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,753
No one ever suggested
you're stupid.

574
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:27,190
There've always been
people like you, Major...

575
00:31:27,472 --> 00:31:29,641
People who don't understand

576
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,699
that progress is our birthright,

577
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:33,492
that the greatest danger is...

578
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:36,384
that we shackle our genius
as a people.

579
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,469
If it had been up to you,

580
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,428
you would've outlawed
electricity,

581
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:44,071
the automobile,
the personal computer.

582
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:45,268
Oh, maybe I would've.

583
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:47,975
There. You've proved my point.

584
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:50,183
One day, it's the greenhouse effect,

585
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:53,320
and then the next day,
we're poisoning the oceans.

586
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,349
You live in a world
of paralyzing fears

587
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:58,531
and irrational paranoia.

588
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,441
If we surrender to that fear,

589
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,174
we might as well
be back in the cave.

590
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,033
We are back in the cave.

591
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll give you points
for cleverness, Major.

592
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,072
You really had me going there.

593
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,570
So what are you going to do,
Mr. Havelmann?

594
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:16,216
Are you going to walk out
into the crisp, blue sunshine

595
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:17,986
and congratulate yourself

596
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:20,242
for making the world safe
for democracy?

597
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:23,735
I think I've earned
a certain measure of contentment.

598
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,731
Well, it pains me
to disappoint you,

599
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,868
but you're not going
to walk out of here.

600
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,783
By my watch, you have
less than ten minutes

601
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:34,577
before you cycle back
to square one,

602
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:37,995
before you tell me
we've never met before.

603
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,624
Oh, I hardly think I could
forget you, Major Evans.

604
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:43,763
You know,

605
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:46,592
maybe I should put a hole
through your brain right now.

606
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,531
The threat alone
could end your career.

607
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:52,439
If I picked up the phone
right now,

608
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,629
you'd be toast.

609
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,458
Really?

610
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:59,087
Who would you call?

611
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:01,275
I think it's fair to say
I've accrued some friends

612
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,270
you would not
want to tangle with...

613
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,919
Frankly, some of the most
important people in washington.

614
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,054
Mr. Havelmann,

615
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:11,490
you are the most important person
in Washington.

616
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:16,292
I've made my contributions,
certainly,

617
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:19,260
but there are a couple
of hundred movers and shakers

618
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,673
who might take issue
with your assessment,

619
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,033
not to mention
the man in the oval office.

620
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,313
Mr. Geslow took over
shortly after we arrived

621
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,790
due to your diminished capacities,

622
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,808
but he was never sworn in.

623
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:33,667
You were,

624
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:35,110
and still are,

625
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,272
President
of the United States.

626
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,815
It's designed
to be impervious to attack.

627
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:56,219
It's the President's safe room
in case the facility is breached.

628
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,147
There's no way
we can bust in there?

629
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:01,157
Not without the kind of firepower that
would put the whole facility at risk.

630
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:02,617
There's got to be
something we can do.

631
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:04,508
There are 4 inches
of case-hardened steel.

632
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,896
- So?
- We could use plasma torches.

633
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:08,735
- It could take some time.
- Do it.

634
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:16,826
We're in the President's office

635
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,389
at the strategic
emergency command bunker.

636
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,982
You should've made things
a little more spartan

637
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:23,608
if you wanted me
to believe that.

638
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,116
The appointments are all yours,
Mr. President.

639
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,938
Lavish, self-indulgent,

640
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:29,378
personalized.

641
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,369
If I'm the president
what does that make you,

642
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,155
the secretary
of assassination?

643
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:34,967
I was your psychiatrist.

644
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,348
You shared the most intimate

645
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,564
details of your life with me.

646
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,670
And I cared about you, sir.

647
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,080
You know what's crazy?

648
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,984
Part of me,

649
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,909
even after all you've done,

650
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:54,139
part of me still does.

651
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:59,819
I ordered a retaliatory strike,
is that it?

652
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,108
It was a preemptive strike.

653
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:05,867
You went against the advice
of virtually all your advisors,

654
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:06,988
including...

655
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,893
your Vice President.

656
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:11,532
You attacked with I.B's...

657
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,913
First time they'd ever been used.

658
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:17,237
The one-minute war,
you called it.

659
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:20,024
The I.B. is a deterrent.

660
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:21,329
Who would've...

661
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,042
What are you saying happened?

662
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:27,079
You wound up
triggering nuclear explosions

663
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,069
from the Caspian sea
to the Persian gulf.

664
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:34,071
Six countries answered in kind.

665
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,130
And then...

666
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:39,069
Well...

667
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,114
all hell broke loose.

668
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,204
Why are you doing this, Major?

669
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,331
Is it possible you're actually
a patient in this hospital?

670
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:57,966
More pictures.

671
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:00,266
I told you
your family didn't make it.

672
00:36:02,984 --> 00:36:05,340
<i>They were at the western
white house at the time.</i>

673
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,828
<i>You had the arrogance to think
they wouldn't be in danger.</i>

674
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,109
What the hell is this?

675
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:13,813
You had a robotic camera
deployed

676
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,510
before the Korsakoff
tightened its grip on you.

677
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:42,267
What kind of sick joke is this?

678
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,126
You watched this footage.

679
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,250
I was in the room when you did.

680
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,461
You cried like a baby.

681
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,035
That's Dorothy's ring.

682
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,903
Who gave you this?

683
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,653
The remote found an inscription.

684
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,986
It also confirmed her D.N.A.

685
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,593
Do I need to show you the children?

686
00:37:28,404 --> 00:37:29,761
<i>Oh, god.</i>

687
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,038
Is it coming back now?

688
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,231
What do you remember,
Mr. President?

689
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:38,297
- I have to know.
- All of it!

690
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:40,879
All of it!

691
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:45,460
Do you remember
ordering the strikes?

692
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,741
I believed in what I was doing!

693
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:50,678
Protect the country,

694
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:53,913
protect our way of life,
protect the democracy.

695
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:55,557
I had a duty...

696
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,086
A sworn obligation.

697
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,333
<i>Of course, there'd be consequences!</i>

698
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:06,956
<i>You can't succumb</i>

699
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,820
<i>to emotion!</i>

700
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:11,719
<i>Reports...</i>

701
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:13,967
Three million dead...

702
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,751
40 million...
A billion...

703
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,575
Numbers...
Incomprehensible numbers...

704
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:29,620
I considered the options.

705
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:34,093
I thought things through.

706
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:38,149
I... didn't back down.

707
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,755
I believed in what I was doing!

708
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,941
The democracy,

709
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,698
the nation you protected...

710
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,525
It prevailed.

711
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:00,142
It's 871 strong.

712
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,928
Mission accomplished,
Mr. President.

713
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:13,138
There was reason, Robert...

714
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,496
A reason for what must seem
like my unspeakable cruelty.

715
00:39:18,802 --> 00:39:20,464
The people will survive.

716
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:23,121
The world will start again.

717
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,795
<i>And they will look back
to this moment</i>

718
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:29,029
and they'll be reminded

719
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:30,663
that none of us

720
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,752
can surrender our individual
responsibility.

721
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,736
Not those who lead,

722
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:38,343
not those who follow.

723
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:41,998
It's all we have, sir.

724
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,097
It's all we'll ever have.

725
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,317
We still have audio,
but we lost picture.

726
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,397
It's time now.

727
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,381
I wish there was another way.

728
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:08,587
Please.

729
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:10,599
Good-bye, Mr. President.

730
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:12,055
Deanna...

731
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,579
You can't do this.

732
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:43,291
Come in.

733
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,153
Hello.

734
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,429
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

735
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,582
Yes.

736
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,163
Please sit down.

737
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:57,844
I hope this doesn't take long.

738
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:01,529
I've got to be
at my daughter's school at 11:00.

739
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:05,135
My wife will kill me
if I'm late.

740
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:13,770
<i>When the fate of so many
rests in the hands of so few,</i>

741
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:17,571
<i>can the failure to be
accountable ever be forgiven?</i>

742
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:19,656
