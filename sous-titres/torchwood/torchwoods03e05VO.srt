1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:06,412
ALL: We are coming. We are coming.

2
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:10,780
<i>We are coming. We are coming.</i>

3
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:17,496
<i>THE 456: We want ten percent
of the children of this world.</i>

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,017
<i>FROBISHER: And if we refuse?</i>

5
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:23,177
<i>THE 456: We will wipe out
your entire species.</i>

6
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,260
I can survive anything, but you can't.

7
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,580
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not him!

8
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:32,021
<i>THE 456: And tomorrow,
your people will deliver the children.</i>

9
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:47,453
<i>There's one thing
I always meant to ask Jack.</i>

10
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,703
<i>Back in the old days.</i>

11
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,697
<i>I wanted to know
about that Doctor of his.</i>

12
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:57,096
<i>The man who appears out of nowhere</i>

13
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:00,699
<i>and saves the world.
Except sometimes he doesn't.</i>

14
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:05,453
<i>All those times in history
when there was no sign of him,</i>

15
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,616
<i>I wanted to know why not.</i>

16
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,421
<i>But I don't need to ask any more.</i>

17
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,696
<i>I know the answer now.</i>

18
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:17,941
<i>Sometimes the Doctor
must look at this planet</i>

19
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,254
<i>and turn away in shame.</i>

20
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,541
<i>I'm recording this
in case anyone ever finds it,</i>

21
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:27,943
<i>so you can see...</i>

22
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,013
<i>You can see how the world ended.</i>

23
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:41,494
<i>PRIME MINISTER: Today, we're taking
steps to safeguard your children.</i>

24
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,540
<i>The schools are being opened again.</i>

25
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:45,740
<i>And we urge all of you
to send your children</i>

26
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,054
<i>back to their classes straight away.</i>

27
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:51,375
<i>Government representatives
will be visiting certain schools</i>

28
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,694
<i>to discuss a series of inoculations.</i>

29
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,582
-What's inoculations?
-Injections.

30
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,780
-I don't want to go to school.
-You're not going, either.

31
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:01,458
You're staying put.
Just like your Uncle Ianto said.

32
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:03,182
''Don't trust any of them.''

33
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:06,654
-But the man said we got to go.
-And I know for a fact he's lying.

34
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:10,373
<i>These inoculations
are to protect your children.</i>

35
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,420
<i>These inoculations are safe.</i>

36
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,620
<i>These inoculations will guarantee</i>

37
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:17,776
<i>no repeat of the problems
of the past four days.</i>

38
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:19,502
David, on your feet.

39
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:22,337
Go to the Baxters opposite,
then go to Sally's,

40
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:23,459
then go to Mrs Singh.

41
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,853
Tell 'em we'll have the kids,
only free of charge.

42
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:29,254
-It's 1 0 quid a kid!
-Shut it, you! And run!

43
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,574
RHIANNON: Tell them
my brother works for the government,

44
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,143
he said it's not safe.

45
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:34,213
Yes, Mum!

46
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,818
So, I ask of you now, to cooperate,

47
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:41,694
to send your children back to school,
and to resume your lives as normal.

48
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:44,696
-We'd better get ready for school, then.
-No, darling.

49
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,014
Your father said stay at home with me.

50
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:51,015
Why? What's so different about us?

51
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:54,422
<i>And as ever,
I thank you for your patience,</i>

52
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:56,256
<i>your understanding</i>

53
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:58,421
<i>and your faith.</i>

54
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:05,142
We've isolated
2,600 primary schools, sir.

55
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:07,294
I'm sorry, but you'll address me
in all matters concerning

56
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,453
this operation.

57
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,853
This information is for Mr Green.

58
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:13,583
You and Mr Green and this government

59
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:16,974
have proven yourselves
incapable of handling this crisis.

60
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,101
All decisions will now go through me.
You were saying?

61
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,692
We have
2,600 primary schools listed here.

62
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,573
We're mobilising transport.

63
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,779
At 1 200 hours,

64
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,173
the British Army will
take the children from their schools

65
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:36,663
to the designated rendezvous points.

66
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:39,702
What if they refuse, the soldiers?
We could have a mutiny on our hands.

67
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:41,103
They've been told.

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,859
Any soldier refusing to do his duty
will make his own family liable.

69
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:48,220
So we take them
to the rendezvous points, but what then?

70
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:52,499
We're about to find out. They're
entering Thames House right now.

71
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,898
(INHALES DEEPLY)

72
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:12,699
Disinfectant doesn't work,
you can still smell it.

73
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,582
There were bodies lying
1 0 deep around those doors.

74
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:19,177
Mr Dekker, I take it.
You managed to survive.

75
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,933
I just stood back, sir.
A strategy that's worked all my life.

76
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,458
Now then, best not keep it waiting.

77
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,972
I seek audience with the 456.

78
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:59,818
My name is Colonel Augustus Oduya
of the Unified Intelligence Taskforce.

79
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:01,579
If I might speak.

80
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,939
We have no choice
but to initiate your plan,

81
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,616
may God help me.

82
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:18,943
But I need to ask.

83
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,532
We have designated rendezvous points,

84
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,218
selected army bases
in all participating countries,

85
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:28,216
but once the children are assembled,

86
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:29,896
what then?

87
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,054
<i>ODUYA: How do you collect them?</i>

88
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:36,101
<i>As we arrived. Observe.</i>

89
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:45,937
Some sort of transportation device
taking them God knows where.

90
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:52,823
Then let me ask,
not as a representative,

91
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,983
as a father.

92
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:58,700
You need these children.

93
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,972
We've seen you hooked up to that boy,
but why?

94
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:06,376
<i>-Are they keeping you alive?
-No.</i>

95
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:10,575
<i>-Then what are they for?
-The hit.</i>

96
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,173
I don't understand.

97
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,223
<i>The hit.</i>

98
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,899
<i>They create chemicals.</i>

99
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:26,342
<i>-The chemicals are good.
-Good in what way?</i>

100
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:29,179
<i>We feel good.</i>

101
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,217
<i>The chemicals are good.</i>

102
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,102
They're like drugs?

103
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,299
(ROARING)

104
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,260
They're trading in drugs?

105
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,262
You're shooting up on children?

106
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,462
Our children?

107
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,576
Let's not forget,

108
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,852
your government started this trade.

109
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,663
You opened the market over 40 years ago.

110
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:09,462
-Are the troops on standby?
-Yes, sir.

111
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,896
Then we begin.

112
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:23,937
<i>The government claims
it's Britain back to normal.</i>

113
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,413
<i>Schools across the country
are being reopened</i>

114
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:29,098
<i>and parents are being urged
to return their children</i>

115
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,663
<i>to a normal routine.</i>

116
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,338
<i>The inoculation programme
will begin at midday,</i>

117
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:37,257
<i>and the World Health Organisation
has issued a statement</i>

118
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:40,302
<i>guaranteeing the safety
and beneficial effects</i>

119
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,817
<i>of the treatments.</i>

120
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:44,213
<i>Critics are still demanding
more information</i>

121
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:47,660
<i>but the government
is simply asking for trust.</i>

122
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,421
The threat still stands.

123
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:13,732
Haven't we gone past that?

124
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:14,859
My husband is still out there

125
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,902
with everything you've done
recorded on his laptop.

126
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:21,021
One word from me and he will
release that information to the public.

127
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,935
What do you think Torchwood is now?

128
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:27,061
-Do you think you're still players?
-We can try.

129
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:29,533
We're at a tipping point right now.

130
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:33,018
Civilisation's about to fall into hell.

131
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:35,982
You wanna start that descent
a little earlier? Go ahead.

132
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,179
He's right.

133
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:45,778
Look what happened.

134
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,093
Phone Rhys,

135
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,183
tell him we've lost.

136
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,658
Hello? Yeah, me, I'm bloody freezing.

137
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,416
Where are you? You all right?

138
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,735
<i>-Do you want me to send the files?
-It's too late, sweetheart.</i>

139
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:23,381
They've killed him.
Not just Clem, they've...

140
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,656
They've killed Ianto.

141
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,097
He's dead.

142
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,139
What about Lois?

143
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,658
I'm afraid Miss Habiba
is in police custody.

144
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,257
Charged with espionage.

145
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:45,093
Then what about my daughter and her son?

146
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,537
They're free to go.

147
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:53,901
Ianto Jones,
he's got family back in South Wales,

148
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,417
a sister, has she been told?

149
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,813
We're not releasing any of the names,
not yet.

150
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,103
Then let Gwen tell her.

151
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:02,458
You said yourself

152
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,175
the world is going to hell any second.

153
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,617
Before it does,

154
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,062
give us a moment of grace.

155
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,139
Just take Gwen home, please.

156
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:22,422
I can't look at her any more.

157
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:14,897
Cell M-3, Captain Harkness, 9:50 am.

158
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,693
LOIS: Captain, is that you?

159
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:22,372
Captain Harkness, it's me. It's Lois.
It's Lois.

160
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,418
Captain?

161
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,533
What are they doing?
What's happening out there?

162
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,623
Can you hear me?

163
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:36,217
What do we do?

164
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,699
Captain?

165
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,573
You might want to take a look at this.

166
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,015
-Steven, come on.
-I want to see.

167
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,298
Not now, darling, this is for grown-ups.

168
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:01,500
Suzanne, get him a Coke or something.

169
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,983
WOMAN: ...received and confirmed.

170
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:07,656
It's inside Thames House.

171
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,021
JOHNSON: All recorded by Torchwood.

172
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,894
They're inventive, I'll give 'em that.

173
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,502
That's a child, abducted in 1 965.

174
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,620
Now they want more, millions more.

175
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,257
And in two hours' time,

176
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,981
the government is handing them over.

177
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:04,413
PRIME MINISTER: Yes?

178
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,102
You asked to see me, sir?

179
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,139
Take a seat.

180
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:16,939
(CLEARS THROAT)

181
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:22,978
A terrible day.

182
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,658
-Sir, I was wondering...
-Your name was chosen, John.

183
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,819
Right. Good.

184
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:39,977
In what way chosen?

185
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:44,972
The inoculation story
seems to have gained some currency.

186
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:47,336
Might even be called popular.

187
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,463
Indeed. And what's that got to do
with me?

188
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,694
Your children will be inoculated.

189
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:55,893
I see.

190
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,102
In two hours,

191
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,778
there will be selected news media
at your house.

192
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:06,140
You'll be seen
to offer your children for treatment.

193
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,294
This will be broadcast
on every network channel

194
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,976
at 12:00 midday.

195
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,255
But there is no inoculation.

196
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:18,698
This action will help the public
and show them no cause for unrest.

197
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:23,423
You mean, I pretend
they're going to be inoculated?

198
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,497
Your children will then be taken

199
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,542
to one of the designated
rendezvous points

200
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:38,824
and they'll become part of the...

201
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:42,023
the process.

202
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,773
It's our duty now
to think beyond this terrible day.

203
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:54,740
And once it's over,
the government must be seen

204
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:57,422
as victims of the 456.

205
00:14:57,504 --> 00:15:01,258
We must be seen to have lost.

206
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,663
If you put me on camera,
I will tell people the truth.

207
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:11,503
Then your daughters
would know where they're going.

208
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:14,292
Best not.

209
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,817
I can't do it! I won't!

210
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:21,099
You can't make me!

211
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:24,096
In which case,
your children will be taken without you.

212
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,615
But you've seen what they do to them!

213
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,541
They're just girls, sir!

214
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:35,255
They're just girls! They're not...

215
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,543
-They're not... They're not...
-I'm sorry, John.

216
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,298
I'm really...

217
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,934
I'm really very sorry.

218
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,297
And I'm really very busy.

219
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,772
What did he want?

220
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,855
Bridget, I need a Requisition 31 .

221
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,138
What for?

222
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,138
-Quick as you can.
-But what for, sir?

223
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:30,782
Requisition 31 , thank you.

224
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:54,983
BRIDGET: Requisition 31 .

225
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,858
Just sign there.

226
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:46,976
<i>Croeso I Gymru!</i>

227
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,063
ANDY: Everyone's on standby.

228
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,260
It's red alert.
Riot gear and everything.

229
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:56,700
All ready to mobilise,
except no one's saying why.

230
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,615
-What's going on?
-I can't tell you.

231
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,739
I am the police!

232
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,701
Right now, Andy,
I need you to drive this car.

233
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:03,695
And if I told you...

234
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,577
What? Well, come on, then. What?

235
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,459
Don't you bloody hate people
who don't finish their sentences?

236
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,262
Hey, she's pregnant.

237
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,460
Oh, thank you.
Who's she when she's at home?

238
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,182
Bloody hellfire.

239
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:20,502
-Who's the father?
-Oh, I'm slapping you, yeah?

240
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,582
GWEN: It's Torchwood.

241
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,097
That's what did it.

242
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:30,377
They give you retcon and chemicals

243
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:33,103
and radiation and God knows what.

244
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:35,539
Bloody Pill didn't stand a chance.

245
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,698
That's what Torchwood does, you see.

246
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:42,579
It ruins your life.

247
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,302
How is it ruined?

248
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,978
You wanna have kids
in a world like this, Rhys?

249
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:52,423
-You're not getting rid of it.
-Is that right?

250
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:57,458
Take the next left.

251
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:00,452
Ianto's sister lives
off the Cromwell Estate.

252
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,293
DENISE: 11 :00. One hour to go.

253
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,142
Are we in position?

254
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,498
Troops are moving in, sir.

255
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:31,693
CHILDREN: 2, 4, 6, 8, 1 0,

256
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:34,901
1 2, 1 4, 1 6, 1 8,

257
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:38,943
20, 1 8, 1 6, 1 4, 1 2,

258
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:42,221
1 0, 8, 20, 1 8,

259
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:45,899
1 6, 1 4, 1 2, 1 0,

260
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,897
8, 6, 4, 2, 0.

261
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,292
Thank you.

262
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:32,054
I've come to tell you how we met.

263
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,258
Who?

264
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,902
How I met John Frobisher.

265
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:42,773
It was 30 years ago.
You weren't even born.

266
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:47,821
I was on attachment
to the civil service,

267
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,462
only for six months.

268
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,936
<i>And just down the corridor,
there he was.</i>

269
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,336
You wouldn't think it
to look at him now,

270
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,016
but he was a clumsy thing.

271
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:04,259
Always losing his keys.

272
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:07,776
Mr Swales never thought
he'd amount to much,

273
00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:09,773
but I thought,

274
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:14,733
''Well, keep an eye on that one.''

275
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:20,060
And all the others came and went.

276
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:22,021
<i>The high flyers,</i>

277
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:26,859
<i>they burnt out
or went on to something better.</i>

278
00:21:26,944 --> 00:21:29,060
<i>And do you know what John Frobisher did?</i>

279
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:33,415
He kept working.

280
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,854
Head down, worked hard, all his life.

281
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:46,217
It was another 1 0 years
before we actually worked

282
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,022
in the same office.

283
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,783
He asked for me.

284
00:21:52,824 --> 00:21:55,019
<i>I didn't think he even knew my name.</i>

285
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,654
And we made quite the team.

286
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,181
I'm not saying he was perfect.

287
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:08,053
You know that better than me.

288
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:12,335
But he worked hard.
He always worked hard.

289
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:15,382
I don't think that's
valued enough these days, hard work.

290
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,581
<i>And he was a good man.</i>

291
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,260
I want you to know that.

292
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:31,702
John Frobisher was a good man.

293
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,495
Because when the history
of this is written,

294
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:41,018
they'll talk about the ministers,

295
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:44,301
and the soldiers,
and the things with numbers for names.

296
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:47,456
And I think people will forget

297
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:51,253
how very good he was.

298
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,574
<i>I want you to remember him like that.</i>

299
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:11,583
If ever you think of John Frobisher,

300
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:15,862
just remember that it wasn't his fault.

301
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,578
Now,

302
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,454
I think I should get back to work.

303
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,742
GWEN: Rhys, you stay here.
Give us a shout if anything happens.

304
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:23,054
-Like what?
-Just keep an eye out, yeah?

305
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,063
-You know Ianto?
-Mmm-hmm.

306
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:28,543
-Was he gay?
-Shut up.

307
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:31,775
-They might not know.
-Well, in which case, do not say.

308
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:33,058
Well, that proves my point.

309
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:35,055
Look, listen,
there's a lot more going on.

310
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:36,133
You've just got to trust me.

311
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,863
Okay. She's got two kids.
We need to find out where they are.

312
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,013
That's why we need a car.

313
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,219
We might have
to pick them up from school

314
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,373
and take them back to mine, okay?

315
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,499
Back to yours? What for?

316
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,893
Andy, we've got to look after
these kids. Just do what I say. Please.

317
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:54,175
-Hello, I'm Police Constable Andy.
-You're not shutting me down.

318
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:56,619
They've got food,
they've got drinks, proper drinks.

319
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,660
And I got permission off their parents.

320
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,622
Come on, have a look.
I'm not apologising.

321
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:09,333
Johnny.

322
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,255
(SIGHS) Go and do a proper job.

323
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,416
I know I need a licence for a creche.
I'm not thick.

324
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,699
This is emergency circumstances, right?

325
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,137
I'm not trusting the telly.

326
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:20,339
If we could have a word in private...

327
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,142
They're not even paying,
so it can't be illegal, right?

328
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:25,296
No. I know. It's not about the kids.
I just need a word, if we could.

329
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:26,737
-How many are there?
-Nineteen.

330
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:27,859
But what are they doing here?

331
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,696
Well, they're not gonna go to school.
No way.

332
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,615
If they want 'em,
they'll have to come and get 'em.

333
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,023
ANDY: I just need a word.

334
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:38,056
They've got kids.

335
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:41,773
Ianto's niece and nephew. Save them.

336
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:51,098
-Do we begin?
-We've got no choice.

337
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,814
You don't give the orders, Mr Green.

338
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:59,221
Stage one. Mobilise.

339
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:32,258
I don't care who you are,
you haven't got the authority

340
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,255
to just march in here and...

341
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,494
Mr Patel, they can't just...

342
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:39,496
They said inoculations, not...

343
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:44,055
Where are you taking them?
Excuse me, where are you taking them?

344
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:50,736
What's going on? What you doing?

345
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:52,496
SOLDIER: Stay on the other side
of the road. Thank you.

346
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:53,699
But my boy's in there.

347
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:57,094
Taking them off the school premises,
you just can't!

348
00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,863
Where are you taking them? You can't!

349
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:03,333
Christopher! Christopher!

350
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:11,337
That's my son! That's my bloody son!

351
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,177
You can't take them
off the school premises!

352
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,979
It's okay.

353
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,572
It's okay. Let it out.

354
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:42,863
He didn't say anything about my car,
did he?

355
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:44,263
-No.
-Sorry.

356
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:47,222
No. There's something else.
Something he wanted me to tell you.

357
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,772
-And I'm sorry, it's kind of urgent.
-You can get out.

358
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,932
I knew Ianto properly.
I've worked with him for years.

359
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:54,377
-Come on. Leave her alone.
-No.

360
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,534
I did. I really... I did.
We were a team.

361
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:59,340
We did all these things together.

362
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,263
And he'd always be fussing about
his bloody coffee, yeah?

363
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:03,697
-Yeah.
-And he'd be talking about you.

364
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,581
All the time. You and the kids.

365
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:07,537
And his dad.

366
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,455
That's Ianto, he was always
so proud of his dad.

367
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:12,138
-What did he say about him?
-About his job and things.

368
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,580
-What job was that?
-He said he was a master tailor.

369
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,939
He worked in Debenhams.

370
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:22,097
If Ianto gave you that old shit,
then you didn't know him at all.

371
00:28:36,544 --> 00:28:37,613
Here you go.

372
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:39,413
Thanks.

373
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:43,183
It's started.

374
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,053
Jesus.

375
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:50,979
Numbers?

376
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,461
We're looking at an uptake of about 60percent .

377
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:57,820
As predicted, a lot of the children
in the target area have stayed at home.

378
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:01,135
Then we'd better go and get them.
Stage two.

379
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,223
Mobilise.

380
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:17,540
I swear on my life,

381
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:20,422
you have to get those kids
out of this house.

382
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:23,018
Is there anywhere you can take them?
I don't know, anywhere safe?

383
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,253
-Gwen. Now, come on.
-What?

384
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:26,738
They're here.

385
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,022
Oh, God. Look, I haven't got time
to explain, okay?

386
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:38,503
But they are coming for your kids.
I swear.

387
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:39,653
-Don't be stupid.
-Shut up.

388
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,212
They're going to come into your house
and they're going to take your kids,

389
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:43,373
and I'm sorry, but you've got
to believe me.

390
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:44,738
That's why Ianto died, okay?

391
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,940
He was trying to stop them.

392
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:49,413
They're gonna come
and they're gonna take your kids.

393
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,779
You'll never see them again.

394
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:53,058
Never.

395
00:29:53,944 --> 00:29:55,741
STEVEN: Hey.
MAN: Hey.

396
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,853
He'll be fine. The nice kids are safe.

397
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:07,021
If you're gonna get rid of 1 0percent ,
then take the 1 0percent  you don't want.

398
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,574
All those kids on street corners,

399
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:13,740
we've finally got rid of them.

400
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:16,213
While everyone else just stays indoors?

401
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:18,534
Ninety percent just hugging their kids,
not making a sound,

402
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,137
just like they did before.

403
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:25,819
I don't even know your name.

404
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:27,974
I protect the state.

405
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:32,943
I was brought up to believe in
and protect the state.

406
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:35,094
Not much good now, are you?

407
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:38,943
Even if 90percent  look the other way,

408
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,219
what sort of world
are you leaving behind?

409
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:45,621
I swear to you,

410
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:50,776
if your duty is to protect the state
above and beyond any other authority,

411
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:53,583
then the one person you need right now
is Jack Harkness.

412
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,140
On the floor! On the floor!

413
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,703
SOLDIER: Stay down!

414
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:07,733
SOLDIER: Go! Go! Go!

415
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,536
-What's going on? Hey!
-SOLDIER: Move.

416
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:10,773
Captain!

417
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,092
SOLDIERS: (SHOUTING) Go, go!

418
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,378
What's happening?

419
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,217
LOIS: Captain Harkness!

420
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,012
Captain Harkness!

421
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:40,543
Here, what are you doing?

422
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,660
GWEN: Yeah, they're spies.
Hush now, darling.

423
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,177
Nice and quiet.

424
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:49,902
Don't make a sound,
just like a game, yeah?

425
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:52,214
Alpha 1 86 to Control. Is anyone there?

426
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:53,373
Fingers on lips.

427
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,258
Now, you don't make a noise
until we get there, okay?

428
00:31:57,344 --> 00:32:00,177
You stay nice and quiet,
and I'll get you some sweets, yeah?

429
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:01,822
-Where is this place?
-It's down by the field.

430
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:02,893
It's all boarded up.

431
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:04,497
Right, look. We've got to go right now.

432
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:06,415
RHIANNON: Okay. Come on, everyone...

433
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:08,222
ANDY: Alpha 1 86 to Control.
Can you hear me?

434
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:10,534
RHIANNON: We're playing spies.
Now, come on.

435
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,852
That's it. No one makes a sound.

436
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:13,502
GWEN: Are you coming? Andy?

437
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,859
Control, this is Alpha 1 86.

438
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:23,343
What's going on?

439
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,337
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.

440
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,172
Hurry, come on. Come on.
Keep walking. Rhi!

441
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,142
WOMAN: (YELLING)
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:37,658
You take them. I'm going out the front.
Somebody's gotta stop them.

443
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:38,972
No, Johnny. Don't be stupid.

444
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:41,259
It's not just us, you daft sod.

445
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:53,335
Danno! Where's Richie?

446
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,735
Go get him, get Sammy,
get all the boys.

447
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:57,223
-What's happening?
-What is it?

448
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:58,657
What's wrong? What's wrong?

449
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,304
All that stuff on the news, all that
inoculation stuff, it's bollocks, right?

450
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,739
The government has sold us out.
They're coming to get our kids,

451
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:06,292
and we're not getting them back, boys,
right? We got to stop them!

452
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,181
We got to stop them...

453
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:45,417
WOMAN: No! Give him back! Give him back!

454
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:39,257
-Oh, it's stinking!
-(WHISPERING) Keep your voice down.

455
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:47,176
Yeah, what I need you to do is to be
as quiet as you possibly can, like mice.

456
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,057
-Uncle Jack!
-(CHUCKLES) Hey, soldier.

457
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:58,577
-Whoa!
-We haven't got time!

458
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,178
Listen. Stay with your mom, okay?

459
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:05,737
Sorry. Would you...

460
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,017
I'll be back.

461
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:30,336
This should be everything you need.
And if it's not, we'll find it.

462
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:33,018
-For what?
-Wavelengths.

463
00:35:33,104 --> 00:35:34,981
The 456 are named after a wavelength,

464
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,861
and that's got to be the key
to fighting back.

465
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:40,061
You're wasting your time.
There's nothing you can do.

466
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:43,377
I've analysed those transmissions
for 40 years and never broke 'em.

467
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:50,220
What do you think, Captain?

468
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:53,341
She told me you were good.
Was she right?

469
00:35:59,064 --> 00:36:00,543
Let's get to work.

470
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:11,217
Get me access
to the Torchwood software.

471
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,064
Log on to the servers and...

472
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,297
Welcome back.

473
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:24,740
It still won't work.
There's nothing on there.

474
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:26,416
It's useless.

475
00:36:26,504 --> 00:36:28,813
We've got technology way beyond you.

476
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:32,692
We hacked into Torchwood years ago,
you idiot. There's nothing.

477
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:34,456
Bring him over here.

478
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:36,023
Dad, come and look at this.

479
00:36:38,304 --> 00:36:40,977
It's some sort of pirate station.
They're trying to get the story

480
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:43,419
out to the public.
But they're taking the kids.

481
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,182
<i>WOMAN: We're broadcasting this
on Digital 1 4 1.</i>

482
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:51,098
<i>It's the kids!
Tell everyone to tune in to 1 4 1.</i>

483
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:50,901
There's one thing
I always meant to ask Jack.

484
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,822
Back in the old days.

485
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:59,062
I wanted to know
about that Doctor of his.

486
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:03,500
All those times in history
when there's no sign of him,

487
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,540
I wanted to know why not.

488
00:38:06,304 --> 00:38:08,340
But I don't need to ask any more.

489
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:12,015
I know the answer now.

490
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:16,942
Sometimes the Doctor
must look at this planet

491
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:18,980
and turn away in shame.

492
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,739
I'm recording this
in case anyone...

493
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:25,416
(SIGHS)

494
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,177
...in case anyone ever finds it,

495
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:31,893
so you can see...

496
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,858
<i>You can see how the world ended.</i>

497
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:49,300
RHYS: (STUTTERING)
You didn't mean it, did you? About...

498
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,417
Getting rid of it?

499
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:56,017
No, of course I didn't.

500
00:38:56,744 --> 00:38:58,257
Okay.

501
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:00,541
I would never...

502
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:03,934
Never. I wouldn't do that
to you, sweetheart.

503
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,860
No, I wouldn't, and I'm sorry.

504
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:16,061
I'm sorry. All right, darling?

505
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:21,175
Illegal broadcast on Digital 1 41 .
Close it down.

506
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:23,414
And take out the whole network
if you have to.

507
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:27,139
We're up to 80percentper.
The people are starting to fight back.

508
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:32,257
Colonel, we're predicting 80percent .

509
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,735
<i>Is that acceptable?</i>

510
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,455
We have up to 80percent
of the designated children.

511
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:44,943
Is that enough?

512
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:52,262
<i>THE 456: All of them.</i>

513
00:39:56,264 --> 00:40:00,052
<i>All of the designated to us.</i>

514
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,734
<i>ODUYA: Not acceptable, sir.</i>

515
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,542
We need the rest.

516
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:16,058
Authorising maximum force.

517
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:20,335
The latest report from Germany.

518
00:40:20,424 --> 00:40:23,655
Old-fashioned hard copy, I'm afraid.
The system's gone into meltdown.

519
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,655
You don't have to be here.

520
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:27,382
It's what he would have wanted.

521
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:32,094
Do you think so? I can't imagine anyone
wanting to be in this bloody room.

522
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:47,374
Yes. Yes.

523
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:54,093
If we cycle the wavelength
back at them...

524
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,617
I know what you're trying to do.

525
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:58,500
A constructive wave.

526
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:02,533
Do you think people aren't working
on that all over the world?

527
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:03,898
But it's never going to work.

528
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:09,103
The effect would be like
shouting at the 456, that's all.

529
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,981
Just shouting.

530
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:13,901
Why did Clem die?

531
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:16,143
It was the 456 that killed him.

532
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:22,183
But how did they do it?
Why did they do it?

533
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,216
We've got the recording here.

534
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:27,772
His mind must have synced to the 456
back when he was a child.

535
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,934
But they didn't need to kill him.
He wasn't any threat.

536
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,982
Unless maybe that connection hurt them.

537
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,538
This is the 456
at the moment of his death.

538
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,694
We've lifted the sound
from the Thames House link.

539
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:47,259
That sound, Mr Dekker,
what's that sound?

540
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,496
I don't know. It's new.

541
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:54,134
Exactly. It's new.

542
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,017
We don't have to analyse the wavelength,
just copy it.

543
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:31,572
Turn it into a constructive wave.

544
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:34,098
But we've got no way of transmitting.

545
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,776
Of course you have.

546
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:41,778
-Shut up.
-Same way as them.

547
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,302
I'll find something else.

548
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:46,295
What does he mean?

549
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:47,933
Don't listen to him.

550
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,582
Dekker, tell me.

551
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:52,454
The 456 used children.

552
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:55,294
-To establish the resonance.
-JOHNSON: Meaning what?

553
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:58,097
We need a child.

554
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,217
What do you mean?

555
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:02,735
DEKKER: Centre of the resonance.

556
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:07,052
Oh, that child's going to fry.

557
00:43:15,264 --> 00:43:18,813
No, Dad. No, tell them no.

558
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:22,055
JOHNSON: One child or millions.

559
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,975
Dad, no.

560
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:27,539
-Dad, tell them no!
-We're running out of time.

561
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,862
Dad, no! No, Dad!

562
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:32,623
JOHNSON: Captain!

563
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:36,702
ALICE: (SCREAMING) Steven!

564
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:45,972
Rhys. Quick.

565
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:52,623
Incoming! Everybody out!
Quick! Everybody out!

566
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:53,693
Quick! Come on! Let's go!

567
00:43:57,464 --> 00:43:58,579
Quick! Come on!

568
00:43:58,664 --> 00:44:00,859
Quick! Come on. Quick, out.

569
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:03,182
GWEN: Come on.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

570
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,532
Come on. Come on. Come on.

571
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:07,819
Come on, quick.

572
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:22,416
GIRL: Get away! Get away!

573
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:29,494
Steven! Steven!

574
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,017
-Steven!
-Mummy!

575
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:32,173
ALICE: No!

576
00:44:32,264 --> 00:44:34,141
-Steven!
-Mummy!

577
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:37,055
-Mummy!
-My baby!

578
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,578
Mummy!

579
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:41,097
Steven, run away!

580
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:53,579
Run! Run!

581
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,462
What are we doing, Uncle Jack?

582
00:45:03,224 --> 00:45:04,816
What's happening?

583
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,058
What do you want me to do?

584
00:45:09,144 --> 00:45:10,862
Steven, get away!

585
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:24,253
No!

586
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:40,098
Steven! Steven!

587
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:47,133
Run! Run!

588
00:47:55,424 --> 00:47:58,382
Colonel, do we have a report?

589
00:48:04,944 --> 00:48:07,583
Colonel, what happened?

590
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:11,217
<i>Colonel?</i>

591
00:48:13,104 --> 00:48:14,856
It's gone, sir.

592
00:48:14,944 --> 00:48:16,980
<i>The 456 has gone.</i>

593
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,854
What did you do, clever girl?

594
00:48:37,944 --> 00:48:40,299
What did you do?

595
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,696
-What did you do?
-RHYS: Hey?

596
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,221
Oh!

597
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:52,899
JOHNSON: Let her in.

598
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:13,740
No, no, no, no, no!

599
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:18,054
No! No!

600
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:21,261
Somebody help him. Help him!

601
00:49:25,304 --> 00:49:27,295
No, please, no.

602
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:45,613
Why? Why?

603
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,496
Oh, please...

604
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,856
Prime Minister.

605
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:10,262
The public will be wanting
a statement, sir.

606
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,142
I suppose you could say we were lucky.

607
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:18,335
A bit soon to tell.

608
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,056
We don't know exactly what happened yet.

609
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:22,260
Lucky with the Americans, I mean.

610
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:25,814
General Pierce took charge without
ratification from the United Nations.

611
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:29,692
We can say that today's events
were in American hands.

612
00:50:30,304 --> 00:50:32,260
And do you think that's lucky?

613
00:50:32,344 --> 00:50:36,383
Yes, I do, rather.

614
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:39,576
Your first thought now
is to save your own skin.

615
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:44,099
In which case, you might like to know,

616
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:46,652
I paid a visit this morning, sir.

617
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:50,699
I went to see Lois Habiba.
You might remember her.

618
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:55,093
I sat with her a while.
We had a number of things to discuss.

619
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:58,534
<i>And while I was there,
I used the emergency protocols</i>

620
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:01,297
<i>to sign out
a particular piece of evidence.</i>

621
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:02,703
POLICEMAN: Thank you.

622
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,180
Contact lenses, sir.

623
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,615
The Torchwood contact lenses.

624
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:11,381
<i>And Lois was very helpful.
She told me how they worked.</i>

625
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,695
I can hardly feel them, sir.

626
00:51:17,904 --> 00:51:21,214
But everything that happened
in this room

627
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:23,260
has been recorded, sir.

628
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:28,258
All waiting to be made public, by me.

629
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,222
Including your statement just now

630
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:34,056
that after the events of today

631
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:38,422
you feel, as you said
in your very own words, sir,

632
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,782
lucky.

633
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,976
You wouldn't dare.
I can have you arrested.

634
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:47,895
I don't think so.

635
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,456
Thank you, Bridget. You're free to go.

636
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:54,014
And Miss Habiba will be released.
I'll see to it myself.

637
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:58,534
I think I'll be taking charge
of very many things

638
00:51:58,664 --> 00:52:00,302
in the days to come.

639
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,462
Is that all, sir?

640
00:52:45,504 --> 00:52:48,257
<i>STEVEN: Uncle Jack!
JACK: Hey, soldier.</i>

641
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:42,701
There's no more road.

642
00:53:42,824 --> 00:53:44,542
We'll have to walk from now on.
You all right?

643
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:46,535
You fuss over me one more time...

644
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,933
-I'm just saying.
-Well, don't.

645
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:07,500
Couldn't have
just chosen a pub, could you?

646
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,540
RHYS: It's bloody freezing.

647
00:54:11,144 --> 00:54:12,179
My feet.

648
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,983
Oh, I miss that, the Welsh complaining.

649
00:54:16,224 --> 00:54:18,499
-You look good.
-I look huge.

650
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,698
She's bloody gorgeous.

651
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:33,337
You okay?

652
00:54:34,264 --> 00:54:35,617
Yeah.

653
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:40,663
Did it work?

654
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:44,455
Travelled all sorts of places.

655
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,381
This planet is too small.

656
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:52,098
The whole world is like a graveyard.

657
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:55,816
Come back with us.

658
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:58,262
Haven't travelled far enough yet.

659
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,938
Got a lot of dirt to shake off my shoes.

660
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:07,577
And right now,
there's a cold-fusion cruiser

661
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:11,054
surfing the ion reefs
just at the edge of the solar system,

662
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:15,223
just waiting to open its transport dock.

663
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,256
I just need to send a signal.

664
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,702
They found it in the wreckage.
Indestructible.

665
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:31,574
Like its owner.
I put on a new strap for you.

666
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:34,132
-Cost me 50 quid, that.
-Bill me.

667
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:35,862
Are you ever coming back, Jack?

668
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:39,582
-What for?
-For me.

669
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:46,975
It wasn't your fault.

670
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:48,656
-I think it was.
-No.

671
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:51,622
Steven and Ianto

672
00:55:51,704 --> 00:55:54,138
and Owen and Tosh and Suzie and...

673
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:58,374
All of them, because of me.

674
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:00,855
But you saved us.

675
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,023
Didn't you?

676
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,775
I began to like it.

677
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:08,940
And look what I became.

678
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,137
Still,

679
00:56:13,584 --> 00:56:16,052
I have lived so many lives.

680
00:56:18,104 --> 00:56:20,379
It's time to find another one.

681
00:56:29,504 --> 00:56:31,096
They died.

682
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:35,655
And I am sorry, Jack,
but you cannot just run away.

683
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:37,655
You cannot run away.

684
00:56:38,424 --> 00:56:39,823
Oh, yes, I can.

685
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:42,463
Just watch me.

686
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:08,898
Let's go home, yeah?

687
00:57:14,624 --> 00:57:15,898
Yeah.

688
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:21,177
Yeah.
