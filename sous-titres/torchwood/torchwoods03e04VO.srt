1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,640
We are coming. We are coming.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,800
Where's the camera?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,080
In my eyes.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,080
When you wear these they'll transmit a picture back to us.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,800
More than that, we've got lip-reading software.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,120
If anybody finds out what I'm doing, it's treason.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Gran always said there'd be trouble.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,280
He's got a daughter.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,240
And now Alice Carter's got a child of her own, his grandson.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,280
Bring her in.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,080
We are here.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,880
But what do you want?

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
We want 10% of the children of this world.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,880
They want to take them, like they did before. Like the man did.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,360
You were there?

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,720
1965. I gave them 12 children.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,520
This is the location they specified.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,560
A set of instructions, coming through

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,760
on a wavelength combination designated 456.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,320
 Did they give a name? All we've got is that number. 456.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
According to our alien friends,

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,160
in four months time, the virus will mutate.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a brand-new strain of Indonesian Flu.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,800
They claim it could kill up to 25 million people.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,520
All our research seems to back up their figures.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,600
In 1918, the Spanish Flu outbreak

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
killed something like 5% of the human race.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,720
I know. I was there.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,840
Well, this time, we're being offered a cure.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,800
They'll send the antivirus.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
In exchange.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,120
How many children do they want?

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,640
12.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,120
It's like the sacrifice to the ancient Gods, twelve virgins.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
Just 12?

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,720
Sounds like a good deal, what do they want them for?

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
They say they'll live forever.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
Yeah. Sure.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,160
Why d'you need me?

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Well, assuming twelve children can be found,

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
then we need someone to deliver them.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,280
In case the aliens are hostile? You need someone who can't die.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,720
Actually, we need someone who doesn't care.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,600
1965.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I gave them 12 children.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,920
You just handed them over, and hoped for the best?

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
You just come with uncle Jack.

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,200
We're gonna go on an adventure, Yeah?

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Everyone off.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
Here we go.

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,560
All right children, you follow me.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Adventure.

53
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,600
OK, children. Walk into the light. Do as I say.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
What's in there? What is it?

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Just go.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
It's safe though, isn't it?

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Isn't it? Isn't it?

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Yeah. It's safe.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Keep going.

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,120
You don't want to be left out, do you?

61
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,600
 Everyone OK? Yes, sir.

62
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,800
The information's coming through now, on the 456.

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
It's the antivirus, just as they promised.

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Good night's work.

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Maybe the Gods were kind.

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
Maybe they are in paradise.

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,640
No such thing.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,520
You are in every nightmare I've ever had.

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm sorry...

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm really sorry...

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,640
I...

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
Gwen!!

73
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,920
 OK. It's over now. Stay away.

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
Just give me the gun, Clem. Come on.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,320
You're on his side... Give it to me. 

76
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,280
..and he's on their side.

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
You're all involved.

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Gwen, let him go.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,080
I'm not dangerous! We know... 

80
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,440
We know you're not!

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,760
We know that.

82
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,000
But that's a lie,

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,760
isn't it? Isn't it?

84
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,880
We both know I..

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
I killed a man.

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,480
I am dangerous.

87
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
Can I take that?

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,880
There we are.

89
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
But it's wasn't my fault.

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,720
There is something up there. They do want children.

91
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
That man held my hand...

92
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
..and took me to them.

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,840
HE GASPS

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
This is normal, OK?

95
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,480
This is what he does. I told you he was going to be OK.

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,360
No! Come on... Clem? No.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,480
 Clem! No, no!

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,000
He's all right, Clem.

99
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
This is too much!

100
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Oh, too much... too... too... oh.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh. You get to shoot first, 

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,240
and ask questions later.

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,400
How good is that?

105
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
This is too much!

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,560
Isn't it? Isn't it?

107
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,760
HE GROANS

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,640
Watch your head.

109
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,760
I can't believe you didn't mention this before.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,000
They didn't speak through kids back then.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
I didn't recognise the signs at first.

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
That's not what I meant.

113
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
They're coming back.

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,320
The man who sent me and my friends to die,

115
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,560
can't die himself.

116
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,080
This is to do with Uncle Jack, isn't it?

117
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,840
It's a mistake. We'll be out soon.

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Will he get us out?

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
Yeah.

120
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,000
In here.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,520
He doesn't know Harkness is his grandfather?

122
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,800
No.

123
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
I suppose it would take some explaining.

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,600
Why Mum looks older than Granddad.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,440
I can only assume that you're holding me here

126
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
as insurance against my father.

127
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,400
But let me warn you. If you've angered him, then God help you.

128
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,480
This from the woman who's spent her life running away from him.

129
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,800
And why d'you think I did that?

130
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,000
A man who can't die has got nothing to fear.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
So you watch it. And you keep watching.

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
It was a protection racket. You must've known they'd be back.

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,520
 It was a possibility. But you still gave them their pay-off?

134
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,840
We had no choice!

135
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,000
Why us?

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,600
You wouldn't be missed.

137
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,320
I can see that.

138
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,040
All this time the one consolation I had, was the deal seemed to work.

139
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,800
It worked for 44 years.

140
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,600
That's not a bad breathing space.

141
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,920
Why was I left behind?

142
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
What's wrong with me?

143
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,320
We know they only want pre-pubescent kids.

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,520
Maybe it's that. Maybe you were just on the cusp of puberty.

145
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,800
Not quite adult, not quite child...

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,520
Saved by your hormones.

147
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,440
Everyone follow us please, thank you.

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,680
Is this still recording, Ianto? I need every second of this.

149
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah.

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,120
Hello again. Before we consider your request,

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,280
I've been asked for a point of clarification.

152
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,520
Before we even discuss your...

153
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,480
your request, we need to know exactly what it is

154
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,160
you intend to do with the children.

155
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,480
Somebody is watching.

156
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,880
Some remnant.

157
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
It knows I'm here!

158
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,720
It knows!

159
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,080
Somebody is watching.

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,240
I told you! It knows! Turn it off!

161
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,000
It's talking about the other camera. It doesn't know about us.

162
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,240
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

163
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,560
is watching through this camera here and he needs to know

164
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,960
what would happen to our children if we were to hand them over to you.

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,120
It is...

166
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
off the record?

167
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,720
Yes.

168
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,520
Come in.

169
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,560
Come in.

170
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,040
In there?

171
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,520
With your camera.

172
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Come in.

173
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,800
It's hiding something.

174
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,000
Right. Is that OK? Uh-huh. Yeah.

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,720
Now you'll be able to hear us and we can hear anything you say...

176
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
OK, hand me a mouthpiece...

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
There you go.

178
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
Don't take it off until the light in the airlock goes green.

179
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,240
OK? Yes, Sir. Camera.

180
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,120
I'll be monitoring you throughout.

181
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,360
Good luck!

182
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you, Ma'am.

183
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,280

184
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
BEEPING

185
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,120
BEEPING

186
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

187
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
SPORADIC BEEPING

188
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm getting three heartbeats.

189
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,920
It's got three heads?

190
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
No, there's...

191
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,080
There's three distinct forms of life in there.

192
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
Get closer.

193
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,400
HEAVY BREATHING

194
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,800
RAPID BREATHING

195
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,880
No, no, no, no, no, no!

196
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
Is that a child?

197
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
Where'd he get him from?

198
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,520
It's one of the kids from 1965.

199
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,280
He's still just a child.

200
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,360
Do you think he knows?

201
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,800
Is he conscious?

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,960
 What's happening? It's Lois.

203
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,200
She's crying.

204
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,640
What have you done to him?

205
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Get him out of there!

206
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,360
HE SCREAMS

207
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,520
Get him out!

208
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,360
It would ensure the smooth running of diplo, diplo, diplo...

209
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,640
between earth and 456, 456, 456, 456 if that previous encounter was kept off the record...

210
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,400
off the record...off the record.

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,760
What's it saying? That's John Frobisher's voice, what's "off the record"?

212
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
By off the record I mean private...

213
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,320
Private, private, private, pr-r-r-i-i-vate.

214
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,520
This is unacceptable.

215
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,440
We do not harm the children.

216
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,280
They feel no pain.

217
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,280
"We do not harm the children."

218
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,920
"They feel no pain."

219
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,000
"They live long beyond their years."

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,080
Oh, well that's OK then(!)

221
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,240
But we still don't know.

222
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,720
What does it do with them?

223
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
What does it want them for?

224
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
Bit late to ask now.

225
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,680
"We have answered your question."

226
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,760
"You have one day to select and deliver your 10%."

227
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,120
And if we refuse?

228
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,600
We will wipe out your entire species.

229
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,880
Am I to understand,

230
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,080
this country has had dealings with these creatures before?

231
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,560
Apparently so.

232
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,040
I would point out, I was only a child myself in 1965.

233
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,960
Nonetheless, you made the decision, only this week, sir,

234
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,520
to keep those previous negotiations secret?

235
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,920
It could be said, that perhaps it was...

236
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,760
convenient, for the moment, until further consideration.

237
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,800
You'll give us all files on 1965, immediately.

238
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
And the United Nations will decide what measures

239
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,160
to take against you, Mr Green.

240
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,040
This must have been eating away at you.

241
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,240
Why didn't you tell me?

242
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,080
I could've helped.

243
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,280
No, you couldn't.

244
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,480
I tell you everything.

245
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,400
Yeah? So tell me, what should I have done?

246
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,520
Stood up to them?

247
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,680
The Jack I know would've stood up to them.

248
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,520
I've only just scraped the surface, haven't I?

249
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
Ianto, that's all there is.

250
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
No, you pretend that's all there is.

251
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,240
I've lived a long time.

252
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,360
I have done a lot of things.

253
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
I've got to go. I won't be long.

254
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
You're doing it again!

255
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,760
Speak to me, Jack! Where are you going?

256
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,760
To call Frobisher. I can't make the call from here,

257
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,000
cos they'll be able to trace it. Is that OK?

258
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,480
You're the boss.

259
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
And just so you know, I have a daughter called Alice

260
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,120
and a grandson called Steven

261
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,440
and Frobisher took them hostage yesterday.

262
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,720
You two should get a couple of hours sleep, while you can.

263
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,360
So should you.

264
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,720
PHONE RINGS

265
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
It's Harkness. Ring Ashton Down.

266
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,320
See if you can get a trace on it. Strong coffee. Loads of.

267
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,600
Hello.

268
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,080
Have you thought about what I said?

269
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,320
Bit busy, to be honest.

270
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,680
'Let me put this right.'

271
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,560
Release my family, and we can work together.

272
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,760
Give yourself up, and they won't be harmed.

273
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
'I wish I could believe that.'

274
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,360
'You can.'

275
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
'You've spoken to the 456, haven't you?'

276
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,040
They want more children.

277
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,080
What makes you think that?

278
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,120
They're on to it now.

279
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,440
'It doesn't take a genius.'

280
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,760
And with them going so public this time, I think they want a lot more.

281
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
'Millions even.'

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,200
If I have to stop you then I'll tell the world what's really going on.

283
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,160
There's too much at stake not to.

284
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,760
Lost him. I'll try the echelon satellite data.

285
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
It's gonna take some time.

286
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,640
They'll let us know when they get a location.

287
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
He'll be gone by then.

288
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,600
Why don't you get your head down on the couch for an hour?

289
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,760
Sorry, um...

290
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,560
the Prime Minster wants to see you.

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Take notes. Facilitate. Generally make sure it all runs smoothly.

292
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
Most importantly, blend into the background.

293
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,880
No-one should know you're there.

294
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Cabinet Office Briefing Room A. COBRA.

295
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Where all the emergency planning takes place.

296
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,840
Gold Command meeting's about to start!

297
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,080
They'll sell us out, just like they did last time.

298
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm sorry to hear about your family, by the way.

299
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,240
We'll get them out.

300
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
I know we will.

301
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

302
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,120
it's been decided that we're going to make the 456 an offer.

303
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,640
A realistic number.

304
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,360
Something we can manage.

305
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,880
And then we see what happens.

306
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,120
D'you mean we're going to haggle?

307
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,240
What about the military option?

308
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,280
There's nothing to take action against.

309
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,920
Evidently, the 456 must have some sort of

310
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,880
base of operations, in orbit.

311
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,600
But our satellites are showing nothing.

312
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,760
Whatever's up there, it's beyond our technology.

313
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,040
There's a target sat in Thames House.

314
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,840
Taking that out would be a declaration of war.

315
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
A war we can't win.

316
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,120
That's why I've invited John to address Gold Command.

317
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
In terms of managing the figures,

318
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
what could we offer and get away with?

319
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,160
We need to know how many units would be available by tomorrow morning.

320
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,120
Isn't it? Isn't it? It's happening again.

321
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,720
My God! They're really gonna do this.

322
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,480
It won't just be Britain, will it?

323
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,560
The idea is that every country makes a camouflage-able contribution.

324
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,400
Can you pass me the F. A. S. file, please?

325
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,240
S. A. S?

326
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,520
Now you're talking!

327
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,640
Right. Well, erm...

328
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,520
..for a start, there are 21 children in Oakington right now.

329
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,320
21 units. Unaccompanied asylum seekers awaiting deportation.

330
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
F. A. S.

331
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
Failed Asylum Seekers.

332
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,680
Orphans in 65, asylum seekers today.

333
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,640
There's progress for you.

334
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,680
And no-one would miss them.

335
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,480
We need more.

336
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
Can you bump the numbers up to sixty?

337
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,120
I think so.

338
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,680
We could have them all in Oakington by first thing tomorrow.

339
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,320
Thank you, John. Now go back to Thames House

340
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,960
and consult with the 456.

341
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,800
Make them an offer of sixty units and no more.

342
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,640
PHONE RINGS

343
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
Hello.

344
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
'It's me.'

345
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
Well...how did it go?

346
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,520
All you need to know is, there's nothing to worry about.

347
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm sorry I can't explain, but trust me, don't worry.

348
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
Well, have you slept yet?

349
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,000
No. 'Are you on your way home?' 

350
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,560
No time for that, sweetheart.

351
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm afraid it's a matter of utmost national security.

352
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,400
Are you safe?

353
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,360
Course I am. You know me, I'm just pushing papers around.

354
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,000
They just need me to make sure all the documentation's in place.

355
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
Did the bodyguards turn up?

356
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
They're outside.

357
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
'Good'

358
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,120
'Good.'

359
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,400
I just wanted to say, I love you, and I love the girls.

360
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,360
When will you be home?

361
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
Soon.

362
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,680
Look, I've got to go.

363
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,720
'I love you.'

364
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,360
I love you too.

365
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
I'm sorry, but we have discussed your demands...

366
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,840
And we've arrived at a solution that might satisfy both parties.

367
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,600
I've been authorised to offer you

368
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
one child...

369
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,840
for every million people on planet Earth.

370
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,280
That's about...

371
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,960
6,700 in total.

372
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
62 from the UK alone.

373
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,520
That is not acceptable.

374
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
6,700.

375
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,840
Six. Seven. Zero. Zero.

376
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,160
That's our final offer.

377
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,920
It's more than generous. I'll give you some time to think.

378
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Three... Two... Five...

379
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,360
Zero... Zero... Zero...

380
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,720
Three... Two... Five...

381
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,000
Zero... Zero... Zero.

382
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,440
You are turning this house into a bloody playschool!

383
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
Ten quid a kid, more like charity!

384
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
And who's doing all the work?

385
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320
Muggings here, that's who, I don't see you lifting a bloody finger.

386
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,720
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

387
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
Oh, my God, they're doing it again. Mica? Where's Mica? Mica!!

388
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,480
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

389
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,920
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

390
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,360
What is it?!

391
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,800
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

392
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,080
What you going on about?

393
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,680
Lottery numbers, or what?

394
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,120
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

395
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,240
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

396
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,640
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

397
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,240
Coordinates? A grid reference, maybe?

398
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,160
'Children in different countries are saying different numbers.'

399
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,200
'Ici en France le nombre est de quatre, quatre, huit, zero, zero, zero.'

400
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,160
The children of America are saying,

401
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,120
"Two, three, four, zero, zero, zero, zero."

402
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,880
But what is the meaning of three, two, five,

403
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,360
zero, zero, zero?

404
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,880
It's confirmed.

405
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:05,120
325,000 is 10% of the children, the, er, units, in this country.

406
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
Every country is saying a different number,

407
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,840
which in each case, amounts to 10%.

408
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,240
I think it's fair to say that our "final offer"

409
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,320
has just been rejected.

410
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,680
OK, thanks, everyone, let's take a break.

411
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,120
PHONE RINGS

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,120
It's worth considering, sir,

413
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,720
the world's population will be nine billion by 2050.

414
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
That's a two and a half billion rise.

415
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,680
The UK'll go from 61 million to 77.

416
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,880
Every one of them needing food and water,

417
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,280
a home, transport, fuel, TVs and fridges...

418
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,560
Rick, Rick, Rick. What are you suggesting?

419
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,720
A cull of 10% would do us good?

420
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm just saying, if we need to spin this to the public,

421
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,320
and God knows, at the moment, spin is all we can do,

422
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
then in an age when we're terrified by the planet's

423
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,040
dwindling resources, a reduction in the population could possibly,

424
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,440
just possibly, if presented in the right way,

425
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
be seen as...good...

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,480
..sir.

427
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,440
Anything?

428
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,360
It's all gone quiet. All our usual sources from the government,

429
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,760
the army, Whitehall, all gone silent.

430
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,920
Whatever's happening in London, no-one's breathing a word.

431
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,360
It's about time I found out what's going on...

432
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,160
I'm taking a squad to London, are the roads still blocked?

433
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,720
Only in the centre. Then patch me through a clear route. 

434
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,040
And keep watching for Harkness. If it's happening in London, then that's where he'll be.

435
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,960
With regrets, ladies and gentlemen,

436
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,960
I have to tell you that we're now facing the worst case scenario.

437
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,040
And right now, we don't have time for a discussion on ethics,

438
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
the hand-wringing will have to wait.

439
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,600
All we can do at the moment,

440
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,080
is to address a number of vital and practical questions.

441
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,080
Namely, how do we select the 10%?

442
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,560
Who would go?

443
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,320
How would we transport them?

444
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,280
And how could we sell it to the voters?

445
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,520
John?

446
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,640
Well, the selection's not down to me.

447
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,200
Nevertheless. Practical solutions, please.

448
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,440
Once the selection has been made,

449
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
then my department can arrange to bus all the children

450
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,160
to the rendezvous points together, school by school.

451
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,800
My staff are compiling various school databases.

452
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,080
"You just need to decide what criteria you'd use for selection."

453
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,840
Which is out of my hands. Over to you, sir.

454
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,680
Anyone?

455
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,040
Might I remind you, the clock is ticking.

456
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,480
It would have to be random.

457
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,280
No-one'll believe it was random.

458
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,480
Not unless some of us are seen waiting at school gates for empty buses to return.

459
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
If the criteria we use is demonstrably fair

460
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,680
and entirely random, then at least we could defend ourselves against accusations...

461
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,400
So you're willing to risk your kids? To make it look fair?

462
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,200
 Then how else could we choose? We could do it alphabetically. 

463
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,080
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Mr Yates!

464
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,920
I didn't mean... I've got no kids.

465
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,040
 I wasn't... No kids, and no consequences.

466
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,400
And yours have grown up... Let's keep this civil. 

467
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,560
Oh, yes, let's discuss the loss of millions of innocent children,

468
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,800
and let's be civilised about it?

469
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,280
If you wouldn't mind, yes.

470
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,840
Could we limit it to one loss per family?

471
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,920
 Every second-born child? That would take time and organisation.

472
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
Time we don't have.

473
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,560
So it would have to be one school at a time.

474
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,520
Look, I'm going to say what everyone else is thinking.

475
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,600
If this...

476
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,640
this lottery takes place, my kids aren't in it.

477
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,600
I'm sure the families of Gold Command would be exempted anyway.

478
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,120
In fact, isn't that official policy?

479
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,560
..Isn't it?

480
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,160
..during a major civil emergency we're also dealing with deeply debilitating personal grief.

481
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,920
Listen to them!

482
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,360
It'll be hard enough as it is. I'm right aren't I?

483
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,320
It is official policy our families get protection.

484
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Course they bloody do!

485
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,000
So, we could have a show of hands.

486
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,760
I hate to be crass, but in the circumstances...

487
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Well, who votes?

488
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,440
Those with kids, or those with no interest to declare?

489
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
No-one votes.

490
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,440
It's down to me to make an executive decision.

491
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
 Do you need some time? No.

492
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,360
Whatever happens, the children and grandchildren

493
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,160
of everyone round this table will be exempt.

494
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,360
What about nieces and nephews? Don't push your luck! 

495
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,720
You seriously expect me to look my brother in the eye?

496
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,200
We need to limit the number of people who know.

497
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,360
And what just give him a condolence card?

498
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
That's the responsibility of government, Denise.

499
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,640
No, the first responsibility

500
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,520
is to protect the best interests of this country. Right?

501
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,960
Then let's say it.

502
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,600
In a national emergency, a country must plan for the future

503
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,280
and discriminate between those who are vital to continued stability

504
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,320
and...those who are not.

505
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,360
And now that we've established that our kids are exempt,

506
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,600
the whole principal of random selection

507
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,680
is dead in the water anyway. Only so far as... 

508
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,000
Let me finish. Now look, on the one hand you've got the good schools.

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
And I don't just mean those producing graduates,

510
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,320
I mean the pupils who will go on to staff our hospitals,

511
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,440
our offices, our factories, the workforce of the future.

512
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,200
We need them. Accepted, yes?

513
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,120
So. Set against that, you've got the failing schools.

514
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,960
Full of the less able, the less socially useful,

515
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
those destined to spend a lifetime on benefits.

516
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,960
Occupying places on the dole queue and, frankly, the prisons.

517
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,400
Now look, should we treat them equally?

518
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,560
God knows, we've tried, and we've failed.

519
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,600
And now the time has come to choose.

520
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,440
And if we can't identify the lowest achieving 10%

521
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,280
of this country's children,

522
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,600
then what are the school league tables for?

523
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,000
Anyone want to speak against that?

524
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Then there we have it.

525
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,360
John, you have your criteria.

526
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,240
We have selected the 10%.

527
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,640
We've got enough evidence recorded here to destroy every person in that room.

528
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,880
And we can use it to force our way into Thames House.

529
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,040
Finally get face to face with this thing.

530
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,400
And get your family released.

531
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,200
 Everyone know what they're doing? What if I can't get Lois to agree?

532
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,160

They're from another planet.

You've got to go, now.

Two miles to the south, there's a warehouse area.

00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,640
It used to be an old holding facility for Torchwood 1, back in the 90s.

Can you pinpoint which warehouse?

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,440
'I'll get onto it now.'

590
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,560
We need a cover story to explain why

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,480
the operation is happening and to encourage participation.

592
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
So the suggestion is,

593
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,280
we announce that the children will be given some kind of inoculation.

594
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,360
A jab to stop them speaking in unison.

595
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,720
We stress that there's no immediate danger.

596
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,440
That everyone will be seen in due course.

597
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,120
Then when it goes wrong,

598
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,880
and the children disappear, we blame the aliens.

599
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,800
Claim ignorance, and face the music.

00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,280

Oh, yeah, you and whose army?

Torchwood has been recording all these meetings.

Face down! Hands on your head!

You'll be in the very next cell.

652
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,240
Second thoughts, maybe I'll just have you shot while resisting arrest.

653
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,480
 That would be a mistake. Why?

654
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,160
Look at what we've been recording.

655
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,440
'And how exactly are you going to make us do this?'

656
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,200
Torchwood's been destroyed.

657
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm afraid not, sir.

658
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,520
Right now Captain Jack Harkness, head of the Torchwood Institute,

659
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
is in the reception of the MI5 building.

660
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,960
So you're gonna stand aside, and let him do his job,

661
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,320
and deal with the 456, immediately.

662
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,920
And, er...

663
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,560
..I think that's it.

664
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,120
What she's telling them is, my gorgeous husband

665
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,400
has recordings of them all secretly agreeing

666
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,840
to sacrificing millions of innocent children to the aliens.

667
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,600
Now, him, and his laptop, at this very moment,

668
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,240
are in a secret location

669
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,400
and he's ready to press send and tell the whole world

670
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,120
exactly what's been going on, unless you do exactly as we say.

671
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,520
Take a seat.

672
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,480
Maybe you'll learn something about the people you've been working for.

673
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,000
Come on, Clem.

674
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,360
I want to feed the live TV pictures direct to this number.

675
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,120
 Can you do that? I can do it.

676
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,960
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.

677
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,640
I've dealt with you lot before.

678
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,440
I'm here to explain why this time you're not getting what you want.

679
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,480
You yielded in the past.

680
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,320
And don't I know it?

681
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,920
I was there.

682
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,480
In 1965.

683
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,240
I was part of that trade.

684
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,200
And that's why I'm never gonna let it happen again.

685
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,040
Explain.

686
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,360
There's a saying here on Earth.

687
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,480
A very old, very wise friend of mine taught me it.

688
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,440
"An injury to one is an injury to all."

689
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,360
And when people act according to that philosophy,

690
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,280
the human race is the finest species in the universe.

691
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,720
Never mind the philosophy.

692
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,880
What he's saying is, you're not getting one solitary, single child.

693
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,240
The deal is off.

694
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,800
Er, I like the philosophy.

695
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,720
I gathered.

696
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,320
You yielded in the past.

697
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,120
You will do so again.

698
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,880
In the past the numbers were so small they could be kept a secret.

699
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,240
But this time that is not gonna happen.

700
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,960
Because we've recorded everything.

701
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,480
All the negotiations, everything the politicians said,

702
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,560
everything that happened in this room.

703
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,080
And those tapes will be released to the public.

704
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,920
Unless you leave this planet for good.

705
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,200
You yielded in the past.

706
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,680
You will do so again.

707
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,320
When people find out the truth, you will have over six billion

708
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,920
angry human beings taking up arms to fight you.

709
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,160
That might be a fight you think you can win,

710
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,440
but at the end of it,

711
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,680
the human race in defence of its children will fight to the death.

712
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,360
And if I have to lead them into battle, then I will.

713
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,240
You've got enough information on this planet, check your records.

714
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,440
His name is Captain Jack Harkness.

715
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,520
Go back 150 years and see what you're facing.

716
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,520
This is fascinating, isn't it?

717
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Isn't it? Isn't it?

718
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,520
It knows I'm watching!

719
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:24,280
The human infant mortality rate is 29,158 deaths per day.

720
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,040
Every three seconds, a child dies.

721
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,760
The human response is to accept and adapt.

722
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,960
We are adapting, right now.

723
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,120
And we're making this a war.

724
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,200
Then the fight begins.

725
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,560
We're waiting for your reply.

726
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,880
Action has been taken.

727
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,040
ALARMS BLARE

728
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,440
What have you done?

729
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,160
You wanted a demonstration of war.

730
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,520
A virus has been released.

731
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,480
It will kill everyone in the building.

732
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,880
 Can they override it? I don't know.

733
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,600
The building's designed to withstand chemical and biological attack.

734
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,440
Nothing or no-one can get in or out.

735
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,560
Oh! Happy now?

736
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,840
The air's poisoned. Call someone. Shut down the air conditioning.

737
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,680
Block every air vent. Get gas masks, hazard suits, oxygen cylinders.

738
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,880
If there's a virus, then there must be an anti-virus.

739
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,160
Release it now or I'll blow a hole in that tank,

740
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,600
and we'll all die together.

741
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,760
You've made your point. Now stop this, and we can talk!

742
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,200
You are dying, even now.

743
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,640
SHRILL SCREECHING

744
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,200
What's that noise?

745
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,080
What's it doing?

746
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Turn it off! Turn it off! Clem?

747
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,720
Clem?

748
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,440
HE SCREAMS

749
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,040
We've gotta get you out of here.

750
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,000
I can survive anything, but you can't.

751
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,200
Too late.

752
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,000
I breathed the air.

753
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,440
There's gotta be something, an antidote.

754
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,280
You said you would fight.

755
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,880
Then I take it back, all right?

756
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,360
I take it all back. But not him!

757
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Ianto.

758
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,240
No.

759
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,160
HE SCREAMS

760
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,640
The remnant will be disconnected.

761
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,200
He's dead.

762
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,680
What about Thames House?

763
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,360
They can't get out.

764
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,200
It's all my fault.

765
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,680
No, it's not...

766
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,840
Don't speak. Save your breath.

767
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,360
I love you.

768
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,760
Don't!

769
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,840
Ianto, Ianto, Ianto!

770
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,400
Stay with me!

771
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,640
Ianto, stay with me please. Stay with me. Stay with me.

772
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,400
Hey.

773
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,120
It was good, yeah?

774
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,560
Yeah.

775
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,880
Don't forget me.

776
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,240
Never could.

777
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,240
A thousand year's time...

778
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,600
..you won't remember me.

779
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,200
Yes, I will.

780
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,640
I promise. I will.

781
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,600
Ianto.

782
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,800
Ianto.

783
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,960
Don't go.

784
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,400
Don't leave me, please.

785
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,480
Please... please don't.

786
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,680
You will die, and tomorrow your people will deliver the children.

787
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,000
What now?

788
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,120
Two choices. Either we go to war against an enemy we can't beat.

789
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,840
Or we go to war against our own people.

790
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,080
For their own good.

791
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,600
An injury to one is not an injury to all.

792
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,120
We have to surrender.

793
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,880
35 million children?

794
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,200
Or 6.7 billion people.

795
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,960
Start putting your plan into action.

796
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,360
13, 14.

797
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,080
HE GASPS

798
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,160
There's nothing we can do.

799
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,560
Civilisation is about to fall to hell.

800
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,040
Do you think you're still players?

801
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,200
We can try.

802
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,440
Captain Harkness it's me, it's Lois. What do we do?

803
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,640
But you've seen what they do to them. Where are you taking them? 

804
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,640
I'm recording this, so you can see.

805
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,920
You can see how the world ended.
