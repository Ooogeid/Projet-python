1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,040
We are coming. Every child in
the world is speaking English.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,520
We are coming.
And one man.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,800
You're pregnant.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,720
Have you told Rhys? 
I've only just found out myself.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,800
He is going to love that.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,920
We are coming.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,640
This morning it woke up.
Transmitting on the 456.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
It's a transmission,
a pulse, a broadcast.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,880
We are coming.You never
tell me anything these days.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Dad died, that was it.
He is very handsome.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
You're kidding me? Really though?

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,680
We are coming.It might be best if certain
historical events were taken off the record.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,800
You never told me. I
was never a part of it.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,240
There's a bomb in your stomach.
Stop it! Stop it! We are coming.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,880
John! There'll be nothing left
of you. I can survive anything.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
Back!

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Whoa! Whoa! You can't
go back there, love.

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
No, no, no, it's too dangerous.
My friend's still in there.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,920
Go back to the ambulance.
Walk as quick as you can, now.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,520
Let me go and get him. Let me go!

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Let me go! No!

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,280
Hold her down! Control
said no survivors.

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,960
Aaagh!

24
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
Sorry, I've got to take this.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Work? After what just happened?

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,080
Because of it. They're OK now.

27
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Get yourselves to bed, girls.

28
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
And don't worry.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Hello.Target one's eliminated.

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,080
Two and three have escaped, but
we're in pursuit.What went wrong?

31
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,640
They got lucky. But they won't
get far.We can't have witnesses.

32
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
"Call me when you've got them.

33
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,440
"And make it quick!"

34
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,960
Off to bed.

35
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,760
I've got the translations.

36
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,720
Instructions.

37
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,960
Specifications for something
they want us to build.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,360
And we haven't got
much time to do it in.

39
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,080
When they can communicate like
this, in this kind of detail,

40
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,280
why do the thing with the children?

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Because they can.

42
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,120
And because they want to scare us.

43
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,920
Who do you work for?

44
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Who do you work for?

45
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,200
The NHS.

46
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Who do you work for?!

47
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,520
You tried to kill me. My friends could
be dead. So don't think I won't use this.

48
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm working for the government. I just follow
orders, that's all. We're on the same side?

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,240
Aaaargh!

50
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,400
Why would the government want
to destroy Torchwood? Why?

51
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,960
I just do as I'm told. I'm just
following orders, that's all.

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,280
RADIO: "Please come in."

53
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Jackson, keep the police back.

54
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
You, come with me.

55
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,640
If she's anti-terrorist, I would
not mind being Uncle Terrorist.

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
Get some back up. Two escaped suspects.

57
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,040
Ianto Jones, Gwen Cooper.
Armed and dangerous.

58
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,760
I know Gwen Cooper. She's an ex-police
officer, she's not a terrorist.

59
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,680
Haven't you got tape to tie?

60
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Fine, I'm just saying. You're
barking up the wrong tree, that's all.

61
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,800
I want their homes raided.

62
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,960
Gwen Cooper is not a terrorist.

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
You must know where she lives.

64
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,560
Get up! Now! We've got
to go! Bloody hell, Gwen!

65
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,960
We've to get out of here. What's going on,
man?Listen, someone is trying to kill me.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,440
And if they're after me, they're going to come
after you. Now get up, and get dressed!What?

67
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,800
Come on Rhys, faster, faster!

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,320
All right, all right.

69
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,720
Down to the bottom, take a left.

70
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,320
I mean, shouldn't there be
some sort of briefing first?

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,680
Like a risk assessment?

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,360
Not that Gwen's a risk.

73
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,040
Rhys, car keys? Try the
top of the fridge, I think.

74
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
I've tried on the top of the
bloody fridge, man! Come on!

75
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,440
If you put the keys in the same place all the time we
wouldn't have to go through this time and time again!

76
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
What are you doing?
Packing.

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,640
You're not going to have time to
read! And they can trace us with that!

78
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,800
Well, I've not gone into hiding before!

79
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,800
So, er, you lot are some sort of
specialists from London. Am I right?

80
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
I mean, I totally
respect that. Really I do.

81
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
But sometimes, there's no substitute
for a little bit of local knowledge.

82
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,560
And let me tell you, Gwen'll
be absolutely no bother.

83
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
We're not going in there
all guns blazing, are we?

84
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,280
How far is it?

85
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Two minutes.

86
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,640
Come on, come on... Come on.

87
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
No! Rhys! Rhys!

88
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Hello.Jesus Christ,
Rhys! It's Ianto, right?

89
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,040
Christ's sake, man!

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,560
Ianto, are you OK?

91
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Yeah, have you heard from Jack?

92
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,240
No. No I haven't. Sorry, hang on.

93
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,960
Do you think he
survived? He usually does.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,120
"Who was it?"I had a run-in with one of
them. Said he was working for the government.

95
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,400
That doesn't make sense. How did they get
close enough to plant it inside him, Ianto?

96
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,960
It was him, that Dr Rupesh. He was
shot and killed in the hospital earlier.

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
"It must've been then."

98
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,680
Let's go. Take the
bag. Get the car ready.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
Er, where shall we meet, Ianto?

100
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Your phone, your phone could be bugged.

101
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,520
Erm, right... Er...

102
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,000
Remember the last time
we had ice cream together?

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
No. Yeah, you do. After the Grand Slam.

104
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,080
I don't like ice cream.
It gives me a headache.

105
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
I've got to go.

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
Gwen!

107
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Go!

108
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,520
Now do you believe she's a terrorist?

109
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
She shot the wheels.

110
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,800
What kind of terrorist
shoots your wheels?

111
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
A clever one.

112
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,640
Right. I think...we made it.

113
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,160
Let's go.Where?

114
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,120
Can't we just take a minute? Just to...

115
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,440
Number plate recognition. They can trace
us. We need to ditch it.It's a brand new car!

116
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
It's no good to us now,
OK? We need to keep moving.

117
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,280
Wouldn't it be better
if we gave ourselves up?

118
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,560
When I know what's happened, I'll tell
someone. Until then, we're going underground.

119
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
Let me carry the bag.

120
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,240
You want your trigger
finger free, don't you?

121
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
We're looking for Ianto Jones.

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't move! Don't move!

123
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,520
We're looking for Ianto Jones. Well, you won't
find him in my bed, will you?! I'm a married man.

124
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,640
What?Keep your phones on today.

125
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,640
Why? I want to be able to speak to you.

126
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,640
Since when?Since we were
possessed by the Devil.I'm serious.

127
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,840
If they go off during a lesson,
we can't get them back till Friday.

128
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,600
Keep them on mute.

129
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,120
Every suspicious phone call, every time you come
home late, you hide behind the Official Secrets Act.

130
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,680
And I put up with it. Don't
start on this. Not now.

131
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,040
I accept it. But this is different. When it affects
my kids, in my house. There is nothing to worry about.

132
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,840
I saw how scared you were last night.

133
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,520
I know.

134
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,320
It's frightening to see it first
hand, there's no lasting damage.

135
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,240
It's quickly over. This
isn't a hula hoop craze.

136
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,200
It happened to Brian and Wendy's kids in Canada.
You don't think this is over any more than I do.

137
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,480
Just make sure they keep their phones on.
And don't let them come home on their own.

138
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm off now, girls.

139
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll see you.Goodbye
kisses, it must be serious.

140
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,160
If you could get out of bed at a
proper time, you'd get plenty of kisses.

141
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,440
Have a good day.

142
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Dad?What?

143
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,240
We want a pony.

144
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
We want a pony.

145
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
We want a pony.See?

146
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Nothing to worry about.

147
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,120
TV:"Latest headlines.

148
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,920
"Further reports are coming in about
the explosion in Cardiff last night.

149
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,480
"No organisation has yet claimed
responsibility for the explosion,

150
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,760
"which went off in the
Bay area of the city..."

151
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,680
Isn't that where Uncle Jack
lives? It's a big place. Shh!

152
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
"Casualty figures remain low,
with two people reported missing."

153
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,640
TV: "Residents in Cardiff are
reacting with shock and outrage.

154
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,120
"The entire bay area has been closed
off and witnesses say the effects

155
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,440
"of the explosion last night
could be felt five miles away.

156
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,080
"No-one can say for sure why this area
was the site of such an unexpected attack,

157
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
"and the Prime Minister's office has refused
to speculate until more details are known.

158
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,120
"Fortunately, the
timing of the device..."

159
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,200
As you know, Harkness is
a difficult man to kill.

160
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,440
Current theories suggest that his longevity
is connected in some way to the Torchwood Hub.

161
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,880
Which necessitated taking
out the entire operation.

162
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
He can't still be alive, after that.

163
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,520
As I said, awaiting results.

164
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,200
What about these, er...
these specifications?

165
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
From the 456? I could barely
understand a word of them.

166
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,320
Nor me. But I'm told the
translations are excellent.

167
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,960
And they've started work. Dekker's called in the damage
control team, they're working as fast as they can.

168
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,280
Early reports are
looking, well, promising.

169
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,840
Can we see it? They'll be ready to
show us work in progress by 1600 hours.

170
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,400
We're building something and
we don't even know what it is.

171
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,840
Can I ask?

172
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,240
Did the 456 contact any other country?

173
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,640
Intel's been listening.

174
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,880
No chatter on the wires.
Seems like it's only Britain.

175
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
And how long can we keep it secret?

176
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Given the children's last
statement, "We are coming back".

177
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,080
That's what everyone
seems to be asking -

178
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,160
when were they here before?

179
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Yes.

180
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,680
Well, if that's everything...Sir.

181
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,280
Sir, I'd just, um...

182
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,080
I just wanted to say how...

183
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,280
grateful I am, sir.What for?

184
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,880
Well.

185
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,480
I know that I'm something of a
middleman in these affairs, but um...

186
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,440
I just wanted to thank you,

187
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,960
for trusting me with the responsibility.

188
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,560
All I've done is put
you on the front line.

189
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,200
That's what the front line's for, John.

190
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,720
First to fall.

191
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, sir.

192
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Yes, sir.

193
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,720
Come on, check the gas is turned off.

194
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,960
Get some breathing equipment down here.

195
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,720
Hang on! Stop! I've got something!

196
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,800
Hello? If you can hear
me, clench your hand.

197
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,320
It's not a body. It's just the arm.

198
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,680
ANSWER PHONE: "This is Jack Harkness.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you."

199
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,000
It's me. Call me.

200
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
When you get a chance.

201
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,320
Mum, there's no toothpaste.

202
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,960
Everything OK?Yeah. They're
expecting us, the car's waiting.

203
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
Well, come on then.

204
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Hello?

205
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
We thought there was a body,

206
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,800
but we've got an arm, a shoulder and the remains
of a head. It's almost a waste of a body bag.

207
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
Is it Harkness?Presumably.

208
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,480
Take him to Ashton Down.
Keep him under surveillance.

209
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,880
Sorry, sir, I couldn't help hearing.

210
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,760
That name. Harkness.

211
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,360
Is that Captain Jack Harkness?

212
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,920
From Torchwood? Only he was
trying to contact you yesterday.

213
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,560
I did mark it in the
log. Said he could help.

214
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,640
Not now, he can't.Are you
sure? He was very insistent.

215
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,040
He told me his team were the experts at
dealing with things like the children thing.

216
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,880
He told you that? Over the phone? Yes.

217
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,840
He always was an arrogant sod.

218
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,960
So, he can't help?

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,440
He's not really the expert?

220
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,160
That bomb in Cardiff last night. He was the
one at the centre of it. It tore him to shreds.

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,720
Does that mean whoever's behind the bomb's behind the
children thing? Like they wanted him out of the way?

222
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,640
Lois, your job -

223
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,480
you don't overhear phone calls.
You speak when you're spoken to. OK?

224
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,880
Sorry.

225
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,680
Thanks, mate.

226
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,400
It'll be from Uncle Ianto.

227
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,680
Ssh! We're probably bugged.

228
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,560
Innocent kids, fast asleep at home,

229
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,960
and a gang of uniformed thugs break
in and point guns at their head?

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,560
It's no wonder they're traumatised. It's
no wonder our poor David pissed the bed.

231
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,240
I didn't.Ha, you big baby!

232
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,560
It's the police state to blame, and I'm going to
rinse the bastards for every penny they've got!

233
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,920
Oh, shut up, Johnny!

234
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,880
What's he done?

235
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,200
Why's he bringing it to our door?

236
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,000
Hey, hey.

237
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
We're the only family he's got.

238
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,000
Put it in here.

239
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Come on, come on!

240
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,960
No. They've frozen mine, as well! Shit!

241
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,600
What now? How're we going to
manage without money, Gwen?

242
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,440
We need to get to London.London?

243
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Everything's dearer in London! That's
where all the decisions are made.

244
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,000
Whoever wants us dead, that's where they'll
be.Right. So where we should be is John O'Groats!

245
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,720
I need to speak to people, but I
haven't got anybody's numbers any more.

246
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,680
So we've got to go there, OK?
These things are all linked.

247
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,360
Soon as you put your card in, bells
start ringing somewhere. Come on.

248
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,960
Any change?No.

249
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,640
Complete waste of time.

250
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,960
The body next door, Rupesh Patanjali,

251
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,080
London wants to know if it's
OK to release him to the family.

252
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,080
Zip it open.

253
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,600
It was a bag of bits when it came in.

254
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,800
And I asked you to keep an eye on it.

255
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,200
Get it out of that thing
and cuff it to the wall.

256
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,880
Hello.The good news is, we don't
have to wait for the DNA tests.

257
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
This is definitely Jack Harkness.

258
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,560
And what's the bad news?His Lazarus
qualities remain undiminished.

259
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,360
Jesus Christ!

260
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,040
"If he can survive that,
what can't he survive?"

261
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,840
I haven't got time to
worry about this, Johnson.

262
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,240
I've got more important
things in my in-tray.

263
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,320
What about Cooper and
Jones? No sign of him yet.

264
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,640
We've had a sighting
of her at a Cardiff ATM.

265
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,920
We need that whole team out of
the way by tonight. Get it done.

266
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
Wait out here.

267
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Now me, I use an electronic seal, see.

268
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,240
Even the driver doesn't know the code. No-one
gets in until it reaches it's destination.

269
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,440
But this clown... Sure
he's going to London?

270
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,600
I don't question how you defend the world
against extra terrestrial infiltration.

271
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,800
Don't you question my knowledge
of the haulage industry.Sorry.

272
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,760
It's a small company, Gwen.

273
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Cardiff to London. Piss poor security.

274
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,560
And best of all, guaranteed food cargo.

275
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm absolutely bloody starving.

276
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,120
The smell from Tony's
is driving me crackers.

277
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,880
There is food. I can't
fault you on that.

278
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,960
I've got the smell of bacon in my nostrils,
and I'm looking at a lorry-load of raw spuds.

279
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,640
There might be other things at the back.

280
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Come on.

281
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
Have you got your pen knife?

282
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,960
Rhys, you are not
eating uncooked potatoes!

283
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,120
We'll need it to cut our way out.

284
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,640
What kind of snoops
are you? Dibble or dole?

285
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,760
Dunno what you're talking
about. So you're perverts, then?

286
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,960
Is it you making them do all the weird talking shit?
Everyone look, a couple of paedos on the estate!

287
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
We have observations in place.

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,480
He'd have been better off staying dead.

289
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,800
Oh, God, this is uncomfortable.
Bloody torture, man!

290
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,160
How are you, love?

291
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,040
My best friend's belly had a
bomb go off in it last night.

292
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,760
Someone's been trying to kill us.

293
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm travelling at 70mph on top of
potatoes, and I think I'm going to be sick.

294
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
Travel sick, is it?

295
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,400
When have you ever known
me to be travel sick?

296
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,680
Well, when have you
ever travelled like this?

297
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,920
On an empty stomach.

298
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,760
What?

299
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,600
You know some announcements, you...

300
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,440
rehearse in your head?

301
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,800
Yeah. And this wasn't...

302
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
quite what I had in mind.

303
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,560
What do you mean, announcements?

304
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,360
Oh, God, no!

305
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,840
Yes.Bloody hell, no!Yes.

306
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Oh, come here. Oh, my God!

307
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,440
I don't believe it.

308
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,680
Hang on...

309
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,760
The bomb, the guns, the
car-chase, The hiding from the law.

310
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,400
What am I like? Letting you do all that
in your condition! You carried my bag.

311
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,840
I'm serious. This changes everything.

312
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,160
No, it doesn't. We're up the same
creek, and we still need a paddle.

313
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,360
Yeah, but three of us in the boat.

314
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,800
Hey.

315
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, my God! What happened to you?

316
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm not sure yet.

317
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,760
I wasn't followed. Sit down.

318
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
You worked out my little code, then?

319
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,800
Dad didn't break your
leg on purpose, you know.

320
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
He pushed me too hard. He always did.

321
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,120
Well, you should've held on tighter.

322
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,560
Seriously. How did
you get in that state?

323
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,760
That bomb. It was meant for
me and the people I work with.

324
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
My God! Why?I don't know.

325
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,080
What sort of civil servants are you?

326
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,720
Unappreciated ones.

327
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,560
Are they OK?

328
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,760
The people you work with?
I don't know. Gwen's alive,

329
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,000
but I've just no way of contacting
her. I'm not sure about Jack.

330
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,520
Is he your boss?

331
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,960
The one Susan saw you with?

332
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,320
He'll be OK.

333
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
They won't get rid of him that easy.

334
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,160
I just need to find him.

335
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,640
If it's a boy,

336
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,880
Edward.

337
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Edward?Yeah.

338
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
After the king.

339
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,160
Come on! Out of the way! Come on!

340
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
We are coming tomorrow.

341
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,720
We are coming tomorrow.

342
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,240
We are coming tomorrow.

343
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,760
OK, I'll tell him.

344
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,880
It's happened again.

345
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,960
Shit.

346
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,240
What did they say? "We
are coming tomorrow".

347
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,560
We are coming tomorrow. We are coming...

348
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,480
..Tomorrow. We are coming tomorrow...

349
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,640
We are coming tomorrow.

350
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,000
We are...This has something
to do with it. It must do.

351
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,600
When they tried to blow us up, this is what
we were working on. We are coming tomorrow.

352
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,360
Tomorrow?Over and over
again. Are you sure?

353
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,840
Positive.

354
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Can you smell that?

355
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,640
They're coming!

356
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,240
I can smell them. They're coming!

357
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,240
Tomorrow, and they'll be here.

358
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Hey, hey, hello. What did it feel like?

359
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,400
Leave her alone! Go away!
They said the same thing here.

360
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,840
Leave her alone. Piss off, you perv!

361
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,960
Yeah, OK, bye. It happened to David
and Mica. What is it? What is it?

362
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,920
I don't know. But this is what we do. We deal
with things like this. So deal with it. Stop it.

363
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,520
I need to find Jack. Give me that.

364
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,720
How will this help?I took the
number of the van they put him in.

365
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,720
You can track any vehicle with the right computer
programmes. Really?Yeah. Give me the car keys.

366
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,040
Oh, Johnny'll do his nut!

367
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,240
Please! We don't have time to spare.

368
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,080
A "thank you" would be nice!

369
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,240
Look, I'm sorry. I've got
to go. Thanks for all this.

370
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
Be careful!

371
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,240
Hold the line, please.Hello, I'll
put you on hold if that's all right.

372
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,320
Mr Frobisher will be back in a moment.

373
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,680
I'll have to put you on hold... Hello?

374
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,560
TV: "'We are coming tomorrow',
repeated in total 38 times."

375
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,040
Sorry, it's chaotic here at the
moment with the children thing...

376
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,600
"Reports confirm that every
single child said the same thing."

377
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
Give me the name and I'll look
into it, and get back to you.

378
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Get my daughters on the phone. Ring
the school office if you haveto.

379
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
Then get me the Prime Minister.

380
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,520
There's a call waiting, sir.

381
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,160
Take a message! It's the Home Secretary.

382
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,720
And your wife wants you to call her. OK.

383
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,480
Hello. John Frobisher's office.

384
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,640
Can I speak to Mr Frobisher, please?

385
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,880
He's not available at the
moment. Can I take a message?

386
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,080
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.

387
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,680
I need to see him urgently.
Can you set up a meeting?

388
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,400
Erm... I'm not sure. Just
put me straight through, then.

389
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,080
He's very busy.

390
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,280
Yeah, he would be! Who is
this? Lois. Lois Habiba.

391
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,360
What happened to Bridget Spears?

392
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,080
She's on another line."Do you
know what Torchwood is, Lois?"

393
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,880
Yes.Then you should know that right now
you lot need us. The whole world needs us.

394
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,960
But someone's trying to kill us. They
claim to be working for the government.

395
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,960
Why would the government want to kill people
who can help? That's why I need to see him!

396
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,960
Look, I know all this sounds mad, but you
have to believe me. I do. I do believe you.

397
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,720
Hold the line, please.Call my
wife. I'm in a meeting with the PM.

398
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,480
I'll ring as soon as I can. I'm
putting the school through.Ah!

399
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,560
If you're tracing this call...

400
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,480
I'm not.

401
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,280
So you can set up a meeting, then?

402
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,160
Lilly, is Holly there?
They're both all right?

403
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
Are you sure?Yes.

404
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,520
The Prime Minister's on his way.
He'll be there in ten minutes.

405
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,000
OK, thanks. Ring ahead, let
them know we're coming.Right.

406
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
Simon, we're going back to Thames House.

407
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,280
Can we trust this guy?

408
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,000
He's our man in the government. If we can't, we
really are in trouble. Gwen, we really are in trouble!

409
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,160
We've got to trust someone, Rhys, OK?

410
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
Hi. I'm Lois.

411
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,920
Where's Frobisher?

412
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,200
He's not coming.Why not?

413
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,200
Oh, God, this is probably
the worst mistake of my life.

414
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,240
I've read your files. Some of the stuff you've
done, you're like unsung national heroes.

415
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,480
Listen, I don't do autographs and I don't want to be
rude, but why am I talking to you and not your boss?

416
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,400
Because if he knew you
were here you'd be dead.

417
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,440
He gave the order to
have Jack Harkness killed.

418
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,480
Are you sure?

419
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,360
I've seen it with my own eyes.

420
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,560
We really are in trouble.

421
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Do you know a Captain Andrew Staines?No.

422
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,400
A Colonel Michael Sanders?

423
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,320
Ellen Hunt?No.

424
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,320
They're all dead.

425
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,320
They were killed on the
same day as Jack Harkness.

426
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,720
I didn't sign the Official
Secrets Act to cover up murder.

427
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,840
But then, I didn't take the job
to commit treason on my second day.

428
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,400
What am I doing here? You tell me, Lois.

429
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,880
If you're the bad guys, why
doesn't it say that on your file?

430
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,560
And if you're the good guys, who am I
working for, and why do they want you dead?

431
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,440
Listen, this a lot to talk about.

432
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,720
And we're going to arouse suspicion.

433
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,040
And we haven't ordered.

434
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,160
When we went on the run,

435
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,040
we didn't have any money, see?

436
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,120
We put the last of the coins into
the phone boxto get through to you.

437
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
So If there's any
chance you could, er...

438
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
Thank you. Oh, great.
Thanks. That's magic.

439
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,960
I'll have steak pie and chips.

440
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,440
And a cup of tea. Just a latte for me.

441
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,680
OK, I won't be a sec.
I'll leave you to it.

442
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
Thanks, we owe you one. A big one.

443
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,040
Everyone in the office seems to think what's
happening with the kids is all to do with aliens.

444
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,840
And that they'll be here tomorrow.

445
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,760
And there's something big being built
on the top floor of the MI5 building.

446
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,120
OK, what do you mean
something? I don't know.

447
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,040
But it's like they're getting ready.

448
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,800
And if you lot... Torchwood...

449
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,680
if you're the alien experts, and
they really are coming tomorrow,

450
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,960
why does Mr Frobisher want you
out of the way all of a sudden?

451
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,280
I've no idea. But I'm going to find out.

452
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,560
Can you tell me anything about
Jack Harkness? Or Ianto Jones?

453
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,160
Jones is missing.

454
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,960
I've been told Captain Harkness
is dead.Well, that can't be true.

455
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,680
Well, that's what I thought.

456
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,280
I overheard Mr Frobisher say to keep him under
surveillance. Why do that to a dead person?

457
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,600
Come on! Who's the
genius behind the camera?

458
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,600
Come on, come on out and take your bow!

459
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,040
Show yourself! Face me like a man!

460
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm not a man.

461
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,600
Who are you?

462
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,800
What's all this about?

463
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,600
Apparently you can't die,

464
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,240
so it would be foolish
to tell you anything.

465
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,920
But I will say this.
If I can't kill you...

466
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,000
..I can contain you.

467
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,520
GWEN: Do you know where
they're keeping him?

468
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,160
I've got a floor plan in my bag.

469
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Steak pie and chips, twice?
Oh, lovely, thank you.

470
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,840
It's, um...

471
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,640
it's a military compound.

472
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,200
Are you sure?

473
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,280
That's where Mr Frobisher told them to take
him. Salt? Thanks. This is brilliant work, Lois.

474
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,200
Can you? Oh, thanks.The only
problem is, how do we get inside?

475
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,880
Well, Mr Frobisher's just authorised
the release of a body from Ashton Down.

476
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,760
This is Rupesh Patanjali.

477
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,040
They must have thought he was one of us.

478
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,440
The undertaker's name
is Richard Rossiter

479
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,400
and he's got an appointment
to pick him up at 5.30 today.

480
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,360
I was thinking, access to a funeral director would be
easier than access to a secure military compound. So...

481
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,480
He'd have to pass through
here at some time between

482
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,160
5 and 5.15 to get to Ashton Down for
5.30, and there'd be no witnesses.

483
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,280
The name of the contact at the
compound is a Corporal Camara.

484
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,240
His number's on there, and
he'll be expecting you. Sugar?

485
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,120
I'm a PA. It's what I do.

486
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,200
When this is all over, and you
want a job, come and see me.

487
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,680
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,520
I don't suppose you'll believe it.

489
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,960
But this is all in
the national interest.

490
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,040
Prime Minister.Ready?

491
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,400
Let's go.

492
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,560
Have they sent us any
further information?

493
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,280
Not since they sent us
the designs for this thing.

494
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,760
I've got two radio operators
working round the clock.

495
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,080
We're sending out continuous
messages on the 456 wavelength,

496
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,560
but we're getting nothing
back. Don't mind me.

497
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,840
What's the latest from Jodrell Bank? Any signs of
their approach? No. But then there wasn't last time.

498
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,120
What's that for?

499
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,320
It's for them.

500
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,320
Hi, we're here to pick up a body.

501
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,520
5.30 appointment. Corporal Camara?

502
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,120
Kodak's dead!? When did that happen?

503
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,800
No, he's the contact.

504
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,360
The name of the deceased is
Patanjali. Rupesh Patanjali.

505
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,200
Jesus!

506
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,920
Shit meself then!

507
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,560
He owes me money.Sorry. I'll
have to look in the back.

508
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,680
Kodak, got a couple of body-snatchers
down at the gate for you, over.

509
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,560
OK, let 'em in. Over.

510
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,560
We're not going to get away with this.

511
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,640
You really shouldn't be here,
Rhys. I shouldn't?! Hello?!

512
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,400
If Jack needs carrying,
you're going to need me here.

513
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,680
See that fire exit? Do
you wanna back up to that?

514
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,120
Save you having to wheel
him round the block.OK.

515
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,680
So there's an upside to this place

516
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,080
being turned into a
mortuary all of a sudden.

517
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,440
So you don't get many bodies, then?

518
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,200
Not usually.

519
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,000
But we've got in three at the moment.

520
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,480
Do I know you?No, I don't think so.

521
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,920
You don't look like an undertaker.

522
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,560
If more undertaker's looked like you,
there'd be more of a demand for bereavement.

523
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,320
Ooh, ooh, hang on. I'm just going
to open the fire door for your mate.

524
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,240
Corporal Camara at the west corridor. I'm just
opening the fire door for the body-snatchers. OK?

525
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,080
OK.

526
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,240
She's shy, isn't she?

527
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,640
I just prefer the
company of dead people.

528
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,840
Is she seeing anyone? She's married. Married
and pregnant, so you can forget it, mate, right?

529
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,880
You're a couple, aren't you?

530
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,520
No offence. You can't
blame a man for trying.

531
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,560
Do you want to check this
is the right one?Yeah.

532
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,040
Corporal Camara?

533
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,840
Yeah.

534
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,320
Everything OK? The camera's not working.

535
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,480
Yeah. Just checking the
paperwork. No problem.

536
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,840
What's going? I've lost two cameras now.

537
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,120
That's the one. Come on.

538
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,280
ALARM

539
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
Intruders. Two of, west corridor.

540
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,960
Intruders, two of, west corridor.

541
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,800
Shit. Leave it, Rhys. Out the way!

542
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,600
What the hell is that?

543
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,640
Move! Move! Move! Positions.

544
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,280
We'll have to surrender.

545
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,760
I'd lay down your
weapons, if I were you.

546
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,200
You're as trapped and helpless
as the man in the concrete cell.

547
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,960
Put the guns down!

548
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,440
OK.

549
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,320
Run!Positions. Come on!
Positions. Come on, get on.

550
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,560
Ah, Ianto. You took your time. Come on.

551
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,120
Come on!

552
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,120
Move it!Take your positions.

553
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,440
They're going to catch up. Rhys,
get out and move that truck.

554
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,720
Hold on tight.

555
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,960
Move, Rhys!

556
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
Come on.

557
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,240
We've got a problem.

558
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,840
Cooper and Jones stalled
us at a roadblock.

559
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,440
How did that happen?I'm sorry. There's a chopper
on the way, but they've got a head start on us.

560
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,720
If he talks, we're in deep, deep
shit. I'll have to call you back.

561
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,440
Where the hell are you taking us, Ianto?

562
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,280
What are we doing?

563
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,920
You'll see. Get the car started!
We've only got a few minutes. Come on!

564
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,040
(Come on, come on, come on.)

565
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,200
Told you I'd be back.

566
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,840
With a little help from us.

567
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,960
What the hell is going on?Dunno yet, but the latest
from the kids is that it's happening tomorrow.

568
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
I'm just in time, then. Get in the car.

569
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
Come on, we've got work to do.

570
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,320
TV:"..United Nations has issued a statement
asking parents and guardians of children..."

571
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:25,920
TV: "..still remains why every child in the
world is giving their statements in English..."

572
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,160
TV:"..no theories as to why and how..."

573
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,240
TV:"The focus now is on tomorrow.

574
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,240
"With every child in the world claiming that
tomorrow is the day, the world is left wondering."

575
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,040
Mr Frobisher, sir.

576
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,480
Seals locked and...

577
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,680
..release.

578
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,040
As per the 456 instructions.

579
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,200
A combination of 25% nitrosyl chloride,

580
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,360
22% hydrogen chloride,
20% nitrogen, 12% fluorine,

581
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,600
9% hydrogen cyanide,
6% acetone, 6% phosgene.

582
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
In short...

583
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,960
poison.

584
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,480
I'd hold on to your nose, Bridget!

585
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,200
Though, come to think of it, you've been doing
that for years. And that's what they breathe?

586
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,400
Breathe? Eat? Fart?

587
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,880
We know nothing about them! Excuse me,

588
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,640
if we know the composition of that gas, can't we
work out what sort of creature could live inside it?

589
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,240
Could do. If we had all
the time in the world!

590
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,280
So they arrive...

591
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,480
and then what?

592
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,560
The whole room's laid out,
according to 456 instructions.

593
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,720
Something of an
ambassadorial suite, I'd say.

594
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,920
Or a throne room.

595
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,600
Who knows,

596
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,360
maybe a slaughterhouse.

597
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,640
But if they arrive tomorrow, then how?

598
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,880
How do they arrive inside that?

599
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,560
No idea.

600
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,040
Who else knows about
this? For all we know,

601
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,400
they've sent the same instructions
to every country in the world.

602
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,040
We've said nothing, maybe everyone
else is keeping quiet, too.

603
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,720
Oh, I don't think so. Whoever they
are, they're coming for Britain.

604
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,400
Well, why?
Exactly.

605
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,040
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?

606
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,680
John Frobisher's a good man.

607
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,240
And better than that, he's expendable.

608
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,960
If anybody finds out what
I'm doing... It's treason!

609
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,400
You're the only friend we've got left,
Lois. We are coming. We are coming.

610
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,000
It's them, it's all of them
- the kids.We are here.

611
