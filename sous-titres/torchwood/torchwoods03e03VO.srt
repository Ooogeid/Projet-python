1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,600
Target one's eliminated.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,280
Two and three have escaped,
but we're in pursuit.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,960
We can't have witnesses.
He gave the order to
have Jack Harkness killed.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,560
Are you sure?
I've seen it with my own eyes.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,080
ALL: We are coming.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,280
We are coming.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,800
Whoever they are,
they're coming for Britain.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
Well, why? Exactly.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,600
He keeps saying the same thing,
over and over. We are coming.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,720
I don't mean to scare you.
You're perfectly safe but I think
aliens are using you to speak.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,560
What do you think?

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
There's no such thing.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,400
How do we know that
the 456 will keep quiet? We don't.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,520
All we can do,
is hope to cover ourselves.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,680
This is us.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,000
This is Torchwood.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
This is home.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,240
The children promised tomorrow
and tomorrow is here.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,160
Our correspondents have
been measuring the situation...

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
Le President a declare avoir ordonne
la fermeture de nos ecoles.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,160
The Senate have pointed
out that we are now
living in fear of our children.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,920
In fear of what they will say next.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,200
In fear of who or what
is speaking through them.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Whoa! Almost lost my eyebrows!

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Still, I'm good for something, see?
Old Boy scout!

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
I'm freezing. Is anyone gonna
see us in here?

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,840
With all this firelighting stuff?

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,960
It was abandoned in the '90s.
Used to be a Torchwood holding
facility, Torchwood one.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
Been rusting away for years.
So what do we do?

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
Just sit here?

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Worse than that, do I have to stay
in these clothes? I mean, come on.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
Tracksuit bottoms. Not a good look.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,320
Jack, they're arriving today.
That alien voice-thing

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,200
said today and we're stuck in
the back end of beyond.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,080
Yeah. But we're together.
The old team.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,800
We're down, but not out, yeah?

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
We've survived worse than this.
Yeah.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
Besides, I don't know how much
fighting you should do,
in your condition.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
What does that mean?

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Christ. Jack!
He knows you're pregnant?

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,720
You told him before me, didn't you?

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,640
Rhys, he happened to be there,
and it happened really, fast.

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,400
Last to know! Last to bloody know!
Thank you very much!

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
Don't be stupid, man.
Hey, don't be so...

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
Couldn't you just keep it shut?

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
All together.

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
The old team.

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,040
Tension is mounting as
the population of the entire
planet waits for the next incident.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,520
..le Parlement Europeen semble fige
au regard de ces...

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,080
We've been given no answers,
no hope, no assurance that
our children will come first if...

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
The Government has refused
to speculate about the origin

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
of the voice or the importance
of the word "tomorrow".

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,200
Let's take you live
now to Downing Street.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,800
In light of what's
happening with our children,
we've temporarily closed the schools.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,880
As a further precaution,
we have introduced a temporary curfew
for everyone under the age of 18.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,040
Keep your children at home,
where they'll be safe.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
The curfew takes effect immediately

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,120
and will continue
until further notice.

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
But rest assured.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
We are doing everything in our
power to find out what's going on,

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,400
to safeguard our children
and all the people of this nation.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,400
In the meantime, we are asking
everyone to stay calm,

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,440
and to go about your lives as normal.

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,320
There's nothing to suggest we
are in any danger,

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,920
and as soon as we find out anything
more, the public will be informed.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,120
And as always,
I thank you, for your trust,

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
and for your faith.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah, it's me, listen, I can't talk,
just give her the thumbs up.
She'll know what it means.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
Oh, brilliant! Thanks, Mac!

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
Mac says, thumbs up, Ianto's alive!

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
Is that it? You daft sod,
well where is he, what's he doing?

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,960
Thumbs up, that was all.
This is Eliza, and she's
lactose intolerant, so no milk.

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh, right. You take your coat off,
you go in there and play, all right?
That's it now, Johnny.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,280
No more kids! I'm full to bursting.

76
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,080
It's a public service!
The schools are closed,
people still got to work.

77
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,640
Life goes on!
Yeah, with you making a profit.

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,360
Ten quid a kid. Look, that could
be our slogan, ten quid a kid!

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,200
'This is Jack Harkness, leave
a message and I'll get back to you.'

80
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,600
So, we've got...
Guns, OK, and a pen knife.

81
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,320
Laptop, now dead. Credit cards
and a phone, which they can trace.

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,920
Lemsip. Book of stamps.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,400
Pair of contact lenses.
And fifteen quid.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Plus 25p. With some bloody
alien thing turning up today.

85
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,880
We've got some Torchwood software.
We've lost the Hub, but the
software still exists on the server.

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
But we're gonna need some more
equipment, and electricity.

87
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,200
And how are we gonna manage that,
hidden away like criminals.

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,320
Well that's it. Brilliant!

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
What? Criminals. Thieves.

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,160
Us. Well, they're treating us
like criminals, let's be criminals.

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
Listen, I trained with the police,
I know every trick in the book!
I've seen the lot! Come on, boys.

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
You're gonna learn some tricks!

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah, fine, thanks very much.
That'll be £15.50, please.

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,480
Hey, come back, that's my car.

95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm just going to pop over the road.

96
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,640
I won't be a minute, OK?

97
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,960
Excuse me, could I borrow your phone?
I just want to call my sister,
she's a bit worried.

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,640
It's all this stuff with the kids.
My mobile's not working. Is that OK?

99
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,160
Yeah, sure.
I won't be long. Brilliant, thanks.

100
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,320
'Hello, Cardiff Bay police station.'

101
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,640
Yeah, I'm trying to contact
Captain Jack Harkness,
he works for Torchwood.

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
I know it's not your department,
but...

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I think he was in that explosion,
I can't get in touch with him.
He's got this private number...

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
I'll need your name and address.

105
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,760
I just want to know where he is.

106
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll need your name and address.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,800
'Name and address, please.'

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,640
Lovely, thank you very much.
Thanks.

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Name's Alice Carter,
maiden name Alice Sangster,
parents James and Mary Sangster,

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,960
significant because James and Mary
Sangster never really existed.

111
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,440
They were placeholder names,
used in the early '70s, for personnel
that went into deep cover

112
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,520
or witness relocation. In other
words, the whole ID's a fake.

113
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Can you find out who she is?
I'm on to it.

114
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
Let there be light!

115
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, yes! Britain's most wanted!
Hey, how about that?

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Guess that makes you an
official member of the team.

117
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,440
You can stick it, mate. Get on those
computers, and get me home, yeah? I
see we've got a new car outside.

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,760
Nice, very smart. Where've you been?!
We thought you'd got arrested.
Just buying essentials.

119
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,080
Technology's one thing, but let's not
forget the creature comforts.
Coffee, obviously. Got some do da...

120
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
Thank God.

121
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
And more importantly...

122
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,440
I didn't know your exact sizes,
but I reckon I've got a good eye.

123
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh, brilliant, I am stinking!

124
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,200
Nice one! And for you, sir...

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Army surplus special.
Oh, you are kidding me!

126
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm back!

127
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Such a long time ago.

128
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
But it's all coming back. Isn't it?

129
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,320
Cos of that smell...

130
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,400
Closer and closer. Happens today,
well, it's always today, isn't it?

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
Same as yesterday.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Today and yesterday.

133
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,680
I knew they'd come back.
Bastards always come back.

134
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,640
I can smell them.

135
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,560
Just like last time, isn't it?

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,360
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop! Stop! Stop!

137
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Stop! STOP! STOP!

138
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,720
That's him... No. Oh, no,
don't take me, they'll get me.

139
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,200
Hold on. No, don't take me,
get out of the way! That's it.

140
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Come on...you're making it worse.

141
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,000
STOP! Stop! Stop!

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They'll get me, they'll get me.

143
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,520
And we're in!
Just like the old days!

144
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,320
I'll patch into the new channels,
see what's happening. Black,
no sugar, yeah? That's the one.

145
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,600
No sign of anything. Empty skies.
Right, what are we looking for?

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,360
Run a check on
that Clement MacDonald.
And those names Lois said,

147
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,400
Captain Andrew Staines.
Was it Ellen Hunt?

148
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,320
Michael something.
All assassinated the same time
they tried to kill Jack.

149
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders,
mean anything to you? No, nothing.

150
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,120
We need to get inside Whitehall.

151
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
Have you got the I5 software, Ianto?
Yeah, it's still on the site, why?

152
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
Download it onto the laptop...

153
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,600
cos these are
not just contact lenses.

154
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
These are Torchwood contact lenses.

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,720
But what do we use them for?
Who's gonna wear them? Well, there's
only one person still talking to us.

156
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,760
Hello.

157
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,880
Is there a Lois in here?

158
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,240
Lois Habiba?

159
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
That's me.
We're not a call centre, hurry up.

160
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,640
Hello? 'Lois, look to your right.'

161
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,720
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.
I need five minutes.

162
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
'Just five minutes.'

163
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,480
I've helped you once.
And that's enough.

164
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
If anybody finds out what
I'm doing... It's treason.

165
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,240
It's literally treason. Offences like
this can be tried without a jury.
They could do anything to me.

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
You said they're building something
at Thames House. We need to find out
what it is.

167
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,760
That's the most secure building in
the whole country. I can't smuggle
you in! You don't have to.

168
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,920
Just keep your eyes open. Like this.

169
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
But...

170
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,360
where's that coming from?

171
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,400
That's not a webcam,

172
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,960
that's you. And to the right.

173
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,480
And to the left.

174
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,240
And back.

175
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,320
Where's the camera? On your jacket?

176
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,160
In my eyes.

177
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,440
Oh, my God. When you wear these,
they'll transmit a picture
so we can see what's going on.

178
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,400
And more than that,
we've got lip-reading software.

179
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,040
Just look at someone when they're
speaking, and it'll translate it.
Press enter now.

180
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
Go on.

181
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,720
Now it's working. Say something.

182
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
Like what?

183
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
COMPUTER: 'Like what?'

184
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,320
Oh, my God, that's weird.

185
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,320
'Oh, my God, that's weird.'

186
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,200
And we can send messages to you.
Type something.

187
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,720
Go on, anything.

188
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,240
Hello Lois. You can see that?

189
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,680
In your eyes? It's good, isn't it?

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,800
If you wear these, we can find out
what's going on. And then,
we can help.

191
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,680
But I can't. What if they...I don't
know, scan for bugs, or something?

192
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,880
They won't register. I promise.
I can't, though. That's putting me
right on the front line.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,720
You're the only
friend we've got left.

194
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,320
Even if I get into Thames House,
I can't get on to Floor 13,

195
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,880
where they're building this thing,
but Frobisher only takes Miss Spears
with him, I'm just the office girl!

196
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,120
Well, you'll have to find a way
inside. But how?! I don't know,

197
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,880
you'll have to think of something.
I can't! I'm sorry, I've got to go.

198
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Just take them with you, I am
begging you, just think about it.
I've really got to go. Please, Lois.

199
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
I can't.

200
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,920
Please.

201
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,480
Frobisher's the key to this. He's
just a civil servant, he's nothing.

202
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,520
What makes him start authorising
executions?

203
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,400
What did it feel like?

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,840
I mean, getting blown up.

205
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,680
It wasn't the best of days.

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
No, but...did you feel it?

207
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,080
Or did everything just go black?

208
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,280
I felt it.

209
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,400
Shit.

210
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah.

211
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,720
D'you ever think that, one day,
your luck'll run out?

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That you won't come back.

213
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm a fixed point in time and space.

214
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,400
That's what the Doctor says.

215
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,800
I think that means it's forever.

216
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,080
So...one day,
you'll see me die of old age.

217
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,440
And just keep going.

218
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,320
Yeah.

219
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,760
Better make the most of it, then.

220
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,520
Suppose.

221
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,960
Like right now?

222
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,560
Ianto, the world could be ending.

223
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,280
World's always ending.

224
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
And I have missed that coat.

225
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,440
Rhys, d'you wanna take
the car and go to those shops,
down by the Wharf?

226
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,080
We need some disks for these things.

227
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,920
Should take about...20 minutes?
30 minutes. 30.

228
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,440
I'll go later,
the beans are almost done!

229
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,560
The beans are almost done.

230
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Bloody beans.

231
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
Whoa, that's nice, look at that...

232
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,320
face recognition software.

233
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,920
And...

234
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,240
arrested two hours ago in London.

235
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,880
Wouldn't give his name, but that is
Clement MacDonald. From the hospital.
Could be useful.

236
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,000
Gwen?
I've given her the contacts, but God
knows, I think she's too scared.

237
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
'We've got a new mission for you.'

238
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,000
That Clem's turned up, in Camden
police station of all places,
arrested for theft and minor affray.

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,480
Could you get him out?
How am I supposed do that?!
'You were a policewoman.' Oh, OK.

240
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,360
Bloody hell, anything else while I'm
at it? Fillet steak would be nice.
Yeah, don't push it, see you later.

241
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,000
So Ianto, what's his story?

242
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Well, according to Gwen,
it was your classic
alien abduction, as a kid.

243
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,720
1965. He was living ten miles outside
Arbroath, the Holly Tree Lodge,
it was an orphanage.

244
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,640
I looked up the files, the kids
were taken away in November 1965,

245
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,760
the Lodge was closing down, they were
being taken to a second care home
called Harbour Heights in Plymouth.

246
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,600
Except,
that's where the records stopped,
there's no trace of them arriving.

247
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,360
It was the '60s, a lot of
the paperwork's gone missing.

248
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,960
But if what he's saying is true,
maybe they never got there.

249
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,160
Show me those people. What people?

250
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,200
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders.

251
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Why, d'you think there's
a connection? Show me!

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
No, give me their history, show
me them 40 years ago. What for?

253
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
Just do it!

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Who are they, Jack?

255
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,760
Did you know them?

256
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,080
I never knew their names.

257
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,160
Who were they?

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,680
Jack, tell me. Did you know them?

259
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Jack!

260
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
Oi! The beans are ready!

261
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Alice Carter.
I've broken the security wall.
You're gonna love this.

262
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,080
What is it? Any sign of Harkness?

263
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Sins of the past. Did you
know that he's got a daughter?

264
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
Since when? Alice Carter.

265
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,680
She was put into deep cover
way back in 1977,
at the request of her mother.

266
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,480
Seeking to distance herself
from the life of Captain Jack,
can hardly blame her.

267
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Who was the mother?
'Woman called Lucia Moretti.'

268
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,520
Italian,
Torchwood staff, 1968 to 1977.

269
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Deceased, heart disease, 2006.

270
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,040
Natural causes,
that's rare for Torchwood.

271
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,640
'And now, Alice Carter's got
a child of her own, his grandson.

272
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,480
'Could be useful, what d'you
want me to do?' - Bring her in.

273
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,200
Just the answer I wanted.

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,720
Nothing from Jodrell Bank,
but we might as well get ready.

275
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Bridget, get everything you need,
we'll transfer to Thames House.

276
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,680
What d'you want me to do?
Exactly what you're doing now.
Just answer the phones.

277
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,640
Well... I could come with you
to Thames House. I could help.

278
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,760
I don't think so.

279
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,840
The thing is...
Mr Frobisher asked me to come.

280
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,000
When was that? He said he wanted me.

281
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,840
At his side. What for?

282
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,520
Why on earth would he need you?

283
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
It was a...

284
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,040
private conversation.

285
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,240
You're not the first, you know.

286
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,440
Don't go thinking you're the first.

287
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,680
Then I can come? 
Apparently so.

288
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Andy Davidson. 'Andy, listen.'

289
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,080
You're alive?
'Yes, I'm still alive.'

290
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,560
Now shut up, I need some help.
We need you!

291
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
All those kids saying, we are coming.

292
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,360
And that's today!
What's it gonna be?

293
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
'A spaceship?' Aw, Andy. 'Godzilla?'

294
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,880
Just listen, I need you to release a
prisoner from Camden police station.

295
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
'The address is Albany Street.'
What are you doing in Camden?!

296
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
Does it matter?!
'It does to me, I...'

297
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,920
Yes. I know, I'm sorry. Look, just
listen, I've got no ID, so I need

298
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
you to vouch for me, he's only on
minor charges so I can stand bail.

299
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,080
'You need to phone them,
and fax a WC242A.'

300
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't use my name,
use Lynda's, I'll say I'm Lynda..

301
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,280
'Can you do that for me please?'
OK. 'Like now?'

302
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,880
Clem?

303
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,120
Do you remember me?

304
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,240
It's all right.

305
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
I've got you.

306
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
It's boring. I want to see aliens.

307
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah. Be careful what you wish for.
Put some cartoons on.

308
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
Steven, come on,
we're going out, quickly now.

309
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,760
But the telly said
we've got to stay inside.

310
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,200
Never mind that, now listen to me.

311
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
We're going to go out,
and you're gonna be quiet, OK?

312
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Don't make a sound.

313
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,440
Just like those games your gran
taught you, remember?

314
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,720
Gran always said,
there'd be trouble.

315
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
Then do exactly what she said.
Just like the games. Nice and quiet.

316
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
And don't let me out of your sight.
Come on.

317
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,200
Clear! Clear!

318
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Get out of the way. Go on then.
Shoot. Let's see what happens.

319
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,440
Are you as immortal as your father?
Is the boy?

320
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,960
We can put it to the test.

321
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,440
Take me. Let him go.

322
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,000
No.

323
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,640
He's only a child.

324
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,520
So?

325
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,640
Alice. If we wanted you dead,
we'd have opened fire by now.

326
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Just put down the gun.

327
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,160
Who are you? Put down the gun.

328
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,120
If you harm him. I will kill you.

329
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,680
Understood.

330
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
And the knife.

331
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,640
Certainly your father's daughter,
I'll give you that.

332
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Come on, sweetheart.

333
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,320
Steven, what is it,
what are you doing?

334
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,120
Steven, what is it?
What's he pointing at?

335
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,160
Steven, stop it.

336
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Please stop it! Look at me.

337
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Steven, stop it!

338
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,960
It's them.

339
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,640
I charge extra for cleaning, tell
your mum, it's another two quid.

340
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,440
What is it?

341
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,040
Stop it.

342
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,400
Can you hear me?
Lilly, it's Mum.

343
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,080
just look at me. Just look at me!

344
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,080
What is it?

345
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,800
Clem?

346
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,880
It's them, it's all of them,
the kids. What are they saying?

347
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,960
I don't know, just pointing.

348
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,360
Yet again, every child has stopped,
every single child in the world.

349
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
There seems to be
no reports of speech.

350
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Only that they seem to be
indicating something in the sky.

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,040
It's on the news, they're pointing.

352
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,640
I know,
but they're pointing over there.

353
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,000
What's over there?

354
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It says, all the children in America
are pointing east.

355
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And all the children in Europe
are pointing west. It's us.

356
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,880
They're pointing at us.

357
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,200
If you
go far enough in that direction

358
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,560
that's London.

359
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,240
They're pointing at London.

360
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,640
According to reports,
children in London are all pointing
towards the centre of the city.

361
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,760
To repeat, children in London
all seem to be
pointing towards the centre.

362
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,440
They're pointing at Thames House.

363
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,040
Come on!

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,320
It's happening!

365
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,240
Sorry, you stay here. Mr Frobisher,
you haven't got the authorisation.

366
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,600
ALL: We are here.

367
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,520
It's them.

368
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,400
They're back.

369
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,560
Come on. You're connected to them,
we need to find out how.

370
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,360
 'Speak.'

371
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,240
My name is John Frobisher.

372
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,800
Permanent Secretary to the
Home Office, of the United Kingdom
and Northern Ireland.

373
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,320
Earth.

374
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,600
On behalf of the Human Race...

375
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,200
Is there something wrong?

376
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,440
Do you want me to continue?

377
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,280
Then...

378
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,680
..if I could request,

379
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,040
for the purpose of communication...

380
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,000
We've no name for your species.
What are you called?

381
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
'You call us 456.'

382
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,960
That's correct.

383
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,720
'Then that is our name.'

384
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,160
If I could request,

385
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,000
on behalf of my government,

386
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
what is it that you want?

387
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Can you hear me?

388
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,920
I'm sorry, but I need to know,
before I approach my superiors,
what exactly do you want?

389
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,880
I must ask the 456, officially,
your purpose in visiting...

390
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
'Speak.'

391
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,120
I AM speaking!

392
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,040
'We would speak.'

393
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,640
With who?

394
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
'The world.'

395
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
Why?

396
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
'We would speak.'

397
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,880
Well, perhaps we do
things differently here.

398
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,200
But we would consider this
to be a diplomatic liaison.

399
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,760
Does that make sense?

400
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,440
We are both, in a sense, ambassadors.

401
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,400
And according to protocol,
ambassadorial procedure
is not made public.

402
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,400
You wouldn't be speaking
to the entire population, but to
their elected representatives.

403
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,760
That's, that's, that's how it works.

404
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,480
That's all I can offer.

405
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,120
Is that acceptable?

406
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,040
'Yes.'

407
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,800
Good.

408
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,440
Thank you.

409
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,200
'Bring them.'

410
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,800
Thank you.

411
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,760
I have one condition.

412
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,000
Does that make sense, d'you
understand that? A condition?

413
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,000
The 456 have made contact
with this country before.

414
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,520
Many years ago.

415
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,880
It would be better if...

416
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,680
I mean, given the
nature of that meeting...

417
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,080
It would ensure the smooth-running
of diplomatic relations
between Earth and the 456

418
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,640
if that previous encounter
was kept off the record.

419
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,840
By off the record, I mean, private.

420
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,200
Between us.

421
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Can you do that?

422
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,560
'Yes.'

423
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,400
Thank you.

424
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,520
'Soon.'

425
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,800
I'm sorry?

426
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,640
'Return.

427
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,720
'Soon.'

428
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,240
I will.

429
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,200
Thank you.

430
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,120
The area around Thames House
is being cordoned off
while the Government has...

431
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,680
It's all kicking off now.

432
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,040
Just when we need Jack.
'..at Downing Street.

433
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,040
'These images are from
five minutes ago.

434
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,240
'That's been identified
as Colonel Oduya

435
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,600
'of the Unified
Intelligence Task Force'

436
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,320
'and this is coming live
that's General Austin Pierce,

437
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,960
'representing the
American Armed Forces,

438
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,520
'he's heading
inside Downing Street right now.'

439
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,360
I have been asked to convey,
from the President of the United
States, his absolute fury.

440
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,720
Is that understood? Very much so.

441
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,440
That landing wasn't spontaneous.

442
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,880
It was planned,
it was prepared, by you.

443
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,240
And don't go calling
this diplomacy, Mr Green...

444
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
you have established a court.

445
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,240
The sovereign court
of Great Britain.

446
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,280
In direct contradiction of the
statutes of the United Nations.

447
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,360
We were acting under orders.
Did they threaten you?

448
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,360
I think we can say, the mere
existence of the 456 is a threat.

449
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Nevertheless, you have an
alien ambassador, on British soil.

450
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,560
It has to be said, that Britain
has claimed no rights of territory
or ownership over species 456.

451
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,280
But it's here! You've damned
well got it, right here!

452
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,440
And at every stage of
these negotiations,
you have excluded UNIT.

453
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,280
When we're specially trained
to deal with these situations.

454
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,080
And I apologise.

455
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,600
But the President's welcome to
enter Floor 13, as is every
other leader of the free world,

456
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,040
I'd be honoured.
Except that's impossible.

457
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,880
And you know it. We will not move
the President into a location
that's had no security screening.

458
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,160
That would take days to organise,
weeks!

459
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,360
Then I offer to withdraw.

460
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,440
What does that mean?

461
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,840
I won't usurp the United States,
or any other nation.

462
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,560
I suggest that dialogue with
the 456 is taken out of my hands.

463
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,600
And conducted by the civil service.

464
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,760
They're still British.

465
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,680
But not elected,
with no authority of State.

466
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,160
And that's exactly what we need.

467
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,320
Middle men.

468
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,360
John Frobisher's already spoken
to the 456, I suggest he continues.

469
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,320
I'd suggest that UNIT steps in.

470
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,600
I wish it were so.
But the 456 chose Britain.

471
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,040
They designated the location.

472
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,440
It's out of my control.

473
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,440
What d'you want to do, anger them?

474
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,000
Look...

475
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,400
John Frobisher's a good man.

476
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,680
And better than that,
he's expendable.

477
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
So what d'you say?

478
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,040
Do we have your absolute guarantee

479
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,560
that you won't enter the room?
My absolute guarantee.

480
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
Then that's agreed.

481
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
Agreed.

482
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,880
'John?' 
Prime Minster, Sir.

483
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,480
'We've consulted with the military,

484
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,480
'they've demanded that from
now on you become our spokesperson
in all negotiations with the 456.

485
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,720
'Simon can give you a security
briefing, thank you.'

486
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,960
Shit.

487
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,080
Oh, but I'm the last to know.

488
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,120
My own husband, and he
won't tell me what's going on.

489
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,680
I've got the girls, pointing
at the sky, and he won't say!

490
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,520
No, there's nothing, I've been
flicking through the news channels,

491
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,400
no-one's saying anything...

492
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
Yeah, yeah I know.

493
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,080
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

494
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
OK. Bye.

495
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Lilly! Downstairs, please,
I want you where I can see you.

496
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,400
The so-called pillar of fire has
brought central London to a halt.

497
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,880
All roads leading to the
river have been closed off,

498
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,920
as a result all major thoroughfares
have ground to a standstill.

499
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,800
Motorists are being asked
to stay out of the city centre
except for emergencies.

500
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,920
Oh, that's so bloody Jack,
you should've stopped him!

501
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,440
Well, I don't know!
We're gonna be ages, it's gridlock.
Bloody London!

502
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Half the people are panicking
and trying to get out,

503
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,600
the other half is trying to get in.

504
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,800
Look, I'm going to have to go, OK?
Bye.

505
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,160
Ey, it's all right, Clem.
You're safe. You're with me.

506
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,840
You're all right, you're safe.
I keep remembering more.

507
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,520
It's not just them, up there.

508
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,400
It's the man.

509
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,880
He's come back.
After all these years.

510
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,360
I can smell him. What man?

511
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,200
Who is he?

512
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,840
The same man.

513
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,920
I knew he'd come back for me.

514
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,840
All right. It's time
I got you a nice cup of tea.

515
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,040
And a hot dog. D'you like hot dogs?
I bloody love 'em.

516
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm recommending we start at 19.00.

517
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,120
Gives us another two hours. now
this is Louise, she can advise on

518
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,320
international diplomatic protocols,
same goes for Samuel...

519
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,000
There's a creature in that room.

520
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,840
It's powerful, and it's toxic,
and it's capable of God knows what.

521
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,720
I bet you're glad to be
trotting after John Frobisher now.

522
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Stuart's the linguistics expert,
he can help out, if there's
a problem with translation.

523
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,120
Excuse me, I'd better take this.

524
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,680
I was gonna phone you.
God, I wish I was home right now.

525
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,800
Look, just tell the girls that
there's nothing to worry about.

526
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,880
Oh, I'll tell them that, Johnny boy.

527
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,400
I'll tell them that their
father tried to have me killed,
how about that?

528
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,040
That's my wife's phone,
how did you get my wife's phone?

529
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,960
This is 1965, isn't it?

530
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,840
All of this, because of 1965.

531
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,560
Frobisher, tell me, is it them?

532
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,920
Have they come back?

533
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
Yes.

534
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,320
That's why you tried
to have me killed.

535
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,240
Along with Andrew Staines
and Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders.

536
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,600
All of us dead, so no-one
could say anything, is that it?

537
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,400
I had no choice.

538
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, I've got a choice...

539
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,240
'D'you want to hear my choice?'

540
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,000
I could blow this thing sky-high.
I could tell the world!

541
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,600
'Unless you get me
into Thames House.'

542
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,360
I demand to talk to the 456 myself.

543
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,640
'Think about it.'

544
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,000
The fact that they've come back
proves that they can't be trusted.

545
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,520
You need me.

546
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,880
Captain, we have your daughter
and grandson,

547
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,840
'Alice and Steven Carter
in our custody.'

548
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,160
You what?! I promise, nothing will
happen to them. My absolute promise.

549
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,640
So long as you agree to say nothing.

550
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,160
Well, how about I go back into that
house, right now, and get your wife?

551
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,520
'And your children?'

552
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,440
Except you won't,

553
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,520
cos you're a better man than me.

554
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
I'm sorry, Jack.

555
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,120
'The world is still waiting
for any news from Thames House.

556
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:30,120
'So far, the British Government
is maintaining a policy of absolute
silence. And the waiting continues.'

557
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,560
There you go.

558
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,840
Save some for the rest of us, mate!

559
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,000
He's your husband?

560
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes. Yes, my beloved.

561
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,040
Nice house, isn't it?

562
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,560
Well, we do our best!
It's got shower facilities.

563
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,800
Just stand under the skylight.
HE LAUGHS

564
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
I've stayed in worse.

565
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,120
And who's the queer? Oi!

566
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,840
It's not 1965 any more.

567
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,240
He's queer. I can smell it.

568
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,760
If the support staff could take
the stairs, the lift is reserved for
Mr Frobisher and his personal staff.

569
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,480
Fast as you can.

570
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,880
Best of luck, sir.

571
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,680
Big moment.

572
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,840
History.

573
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,120
What d'you think's in there?
God knows. That's why we need Lois.
No sign of her. Lenses inactive.

574
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,480
Two minutes!

575
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,920
Um. I'm just gonna...

576
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,200
Pay a visit.

577
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
Online! She's doing it!

578
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,280
Oh, good girl! I knew she would!

579
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,720
Oh, God! Don't do too much of that.

580
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,320
Sorry.

581
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,400
She can't hear you. I know.

582
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,320
'Is that you, Gwen?'

583
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,960
Right then. Good luck.

584
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,600
Oh, don't do that, I hate smileys.

585
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,640
Took me a while to get
used to those things.

586
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,040
What, you've used the lenses?

587
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,240
That's why Gwen had them. I took
them home for a bit of fun.

588
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,520
Fun? Yeah.

589
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,280
Y'know. Fun.

590
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,880
Yeah, well been there, done that.

591
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,920
It is fun. Yeah.

592
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,480
That's him, that's John Frobisher.
Bastard!

593
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,800
Fat lot of good that is,
back of his head, how do we know
if he's saying anything.

594
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,200
I suppose it's an honour.

595
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,120
Given this position. Then again

596
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:58,080
the Prime Minister has
guaranteed that diplomatically,
he can't enter Floor 13,

597
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,680
so whatever happens in there,

598
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,560
whatever goes wrong...

599
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,240
history will say that
it wasn't his fault.

600
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,600
D'you mean he's using me?

601
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,160
You don't get to be
Prime Minister by accident.

602
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,200
What the hell is that?

603
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,320
Some sort of tank.

604
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,480
There's something inside the smoke.

605
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,960
Clem, come and see this.

606
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,200
Oh, come on.
Don't be scared, it's miles away.

607
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,080
What d'you think?

608
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,680
Anything you've seen before?

609
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,720
Can't smell it from here.

610
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,160
Is that what tried to take me?

611
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,800
Yeah, I think so.

612
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,360
Seen anything like it before? Never.

613
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,520
If I might bring into session,
the first diplomatic congress

614
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,480
between the representatives
of Planet Earth, and
the representatives of the 456.

615
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,720
I bring you formal greetings from
the United States of America, from
the People's Republic of China...

616
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,640
He's got his back to us!

617
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah, I can see that!

618
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,080
..from the Holy Sea of Vatican
City... Need his moth? Shut up!

619
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,560
..from the Russian Federation
and associated...

620
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,280
..of Australia,
from the provinces and territories...

621
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,560
..and Japan, and the Hellenic
Republic, from the Islamic Republic
of Iran and the Republic of Iraq

622
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,320
from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and it must be stated on the record

623
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,960
that any country not named herein
does not indicate their
withdrawal from this... That's it.

624
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,360
Come on, good girl.

625
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,360
..reflects only the time span within
which this summit has been declared.

626
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,160
You've got eyes.
You've got eyes in the room.

627
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,600
Software's not so good in profile.

628
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,800
And according to the rules
of protocol, as established...

629
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,280
It's not too bad. It's working.

630
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,040
You hate smileys. Shut up.

631
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,640
I must ask you to state
whether these greetings are accepted.

632
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,360
Do you understand me?

633
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,800
 'Do you understand me?'

634
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,480
I repeat,
according to the rules of protocol,

635
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,640
as established by the United Nations
in the directives of... 'Yes.'

636
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,200
Then I thank you on behalf of...
'Then I thank you on behalf of
the United Kingdom.' Did it speak?!

637
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,240
It hasn't got a mouth,
it's got bloody speakers!

638
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,400
It hasn't got a mouth!

639
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,280
'The Russian Federation,
the Commonwealth of Australia...'

640
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,320
Citizens and territories
of Canada and Japan
and the Hellenic Republic,

641
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,360
the Islamic Republic of Iran
and the Republic of Iraq...

642
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:45,240
It's bloody shorthand!
No, I can read it, it says "yes".
This is a nightmare!

643
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,320
..and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It might be easier if we take those
names as read from now on, don't you?

644
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,640
What's it doing? I don't know.

645
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,640
"What's it doing?"
What, is that what it said?

646
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,560
No, that's Lois, saying that!

647
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,040
Are you all right?

648
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,720
I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?

649
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,280
'I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?'

650
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,480
Do you want me to continue?

651
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,320
'Yes.'

652
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,240
"Yes." 
'Right, then.

653
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,440
'In the spirit of co-operation...'

654
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,520
..we have a formal request to make.

655
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,880
We ask you not to use our
children for communication.

656
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,960
In case certain parties
or territories
might consider that a violation.

657
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
Is that acceptable?

658
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,800
'Yes.'

659
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,960
'Yes. Thank you.'

660
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,760
Ask it, why it came to Britain.

661
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,320
Hardly top of the agenda.

662
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,360
Ask the question.

663
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,880
'And, as a gift,
and as welcome to this world,'

664
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,600
we've prepared a document
summarising our culture and history.

665
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,600
This document can be made
available to you immediately.

666
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,800
Though its format remains
undetermined.

667
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:06,000
Said format remains of your choosing,
though this does not constitute
a request for information on,

668
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,720
or transfer of,
specific 456 technology.

669
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,000
I have been given a request
for specific information.

670
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,520
It has been asked...

671
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:38,120
..why the 456 chose Great Britain
as its chosen point of embarkation.

672
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,680
'We came here...'

673
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,760
"We came here..."

674
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,640
Because? That's all it's said!

675
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,240
'You have no significance.

676
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,960
'You are middle men.'
THEY CHUCKLE

677
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,800
"You have no significance,
you are middle men."

678
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,960
That's a lie, cos it's been here
before that's why it's here now.
Why's it lying?

679
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,560
It's Frobisher.

680
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,600
He's got that thing to lie.

681
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,520
They're on the same side.

682
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,160
Whatever happened in the past,
they're hiding it.

683
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,960
'We have a request.'

684
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,440
By all means.

685
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,080
'We want a gift.'

686
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,360
Of course.

687
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,920
But...

688
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,680
what nature of gift...
ON PC: 'What nature of gift exactly?'

689
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,320
- "A gift."
- Gladly.

690
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,120
But what d'you want?

691
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,000
'We want...

692
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,400
'your children.

693
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,360
'We will take your children.'

694
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,000
What does it mean, children?!

695
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,800
"We will take your children."

696
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,000
What the hell for?

697
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,040
I'm sorry, I think
that there might be a problem,
with the translation.

698
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,360
They want to take them,
like they did before.

699
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,120
Like the man did.

700
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,360
He's coming back.

701
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,720
He's coming back.
Not now Clem, just wait.

702
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,000
He's coming, he's coming.

703
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,200
He's coming.

704
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,120
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.

705
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,400
He's coming.

706
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,760
He's coming. He's coming. He's
coming. He's coming. He's coming.

707
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,320
By children, you mean...?
'Your descendants.

708
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,880
'The offspring of the Human Race.'

709
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,960
How many?

710
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,720
'10%.

711
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,640
'We want 10%.

712
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,320
'We want 10% of
the children of this world.'

713
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,600
He hasn't changed.

714
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,400
He's the same.

715
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,040
He's the same.

716
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,320
He's the same. All those years.

717
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,200
How can he be the same?
What's he talking about, Jack?

718
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,040
Clement MacDonald.

719
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,120
Just another name.

720
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,280
It was easier,
if you didn't know the names.

721
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,760
You were there?

722
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,600
In 1965.

723
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,920
Walk into the light. Go on.

724
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,000
He was the man!

725
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,160
No, no, this is what he does,
you see, he fights them.

726
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,920
He fights aliens,
isn't that right, Jack?

727
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,760
No.

728
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,640
Then what were you doing there?

729
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,520
I gave them the kids.

730
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,200
1965, I gave them 12 children.

731
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,520
What for?

732
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,680
As a gift.

733
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,240
A man who can't die
has nothing to fear.

734
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,240
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.

735
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,480
We need a cover story.
