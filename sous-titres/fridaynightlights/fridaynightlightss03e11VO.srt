1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,167
- I'm Madison, nice to meet you.
- And you.

2
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:04,586
- You're on a break with her, yes?
- OK.

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,397
That little bastard!

4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:09,006
The savings that we were keeping

5
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,592
for your college is the money
I used for the investment.

6
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:13,679
I lost all the money and...

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,179
Where are you going?

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,932
- Don't! Don't touch me.
- Please, don't leave me.

9
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,144
I need to ask you a favor.
I'm taking the SAT's on Saturday.

10
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,438
I was kinda hoping, if you weren't doing
anything, if maybe you could...

11
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,148
- Help you out?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,985
- Landry's kinda cute up there.
- Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,702
- Hey, what about a sangria set?
- Oh, that's great.

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,121
- Monkey, do you like that?
- If you like it, I like it.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,595
I love it.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,835
- Sangria, got it.
- I'm gonna head over to Automotive.

17
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,087
I think we can register
for a leaf blower.

18
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,881
- How cool would it be?
- Great idea.

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,675
- Why don't you take this with you?
- You will not take that with you.

20
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,516
I'll be back in a sec.

21
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:56,013
What, honey?

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,058
What's wrong? I feel like I'm the only
one excited about your sister's wedding.

23
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:03,747
I'm just thinking about my SAT's, OK?
I just have this feeling I did horrible.

24
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:06,273
Stop.
I'm sure you did fine, baby.

25
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,649
- You've been working so hard.
- That's the point.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,678
It's just important, that's all.

27
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:14,323
Hello, ladies. Are we here to register
for my wedding? Can we do that?

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,841
Bridal shower. Plans.

29
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,536
Yes, called all your girlfriends
and called Seven Señoritas.

30
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,246
No, I don't wanna go to Seven S...
We always go to Seven Señoritas.

31
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:25,459
The shower needs to be different.
Special.

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,095
Honey, it will be special.

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,392
All your girlfriends are gonna buy you
new thongs to replace the old ones.

34
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:31,630
Let's do a tea.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,427
- A tea?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,656
- As in "a tea party"?
- What?

37
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:40,765
That seems like
it's a little bit square.

38
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,349
Mama, it's classy.

39
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,103
Class... Something you know a lot about.
Are you serious right now?

40
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,726
My bridal shower's gonna be a tea.

41
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,406
Make that happen.

42
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:53,236
Ladies, look at this, a leaf blower.

43
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,780
Oh, my God!

44
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:59,660
Red, 58!

45
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,496
Red, 58!
Set, hut!

46
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,978
Good job.
Watch the move, watch the move!

47
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:08,209
Good job, J.D.!
There you go.

48
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,752
Good, run it again.

49
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,547
- Get down deep, get down deep!
- Attaboy, J.D.

50
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,019
There you go, there you go,
good work.

51
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,348
Let's go, pick it up, let's go!

52
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,227
Come on.

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,522
- All right, let's get some water!
- Let's get some water.

54
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,984
Pause, go!
You get dehydrated out here.

55
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,824
You look pretty hot out there.

56
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,201
Yeah, you know,
it's kind of warm out there.

57
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,828
What's that kid doing?

58
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,414
Looks like he got himself
a little plaything, Coach.

59
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:47,623
Hey, Wade!

60
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,202
Why don't you go get Romeo, tell him
to get his head back in the game?

61
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,048
Let's go, gentlemen, let's go!
Time's up!

62
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:55,966
Go!

63
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:57,937
- I'll text you.
- OK, yeah.

64
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,796
- J.D., let's go.
- J.D., man, let's go.

65
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,096
Bye.

66
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,597
Excuse us, little lady,
we have a practice. Let's go.

67
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:07,340
What's your problem, man?
You act like this is not State.

68
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,562
- Sorry.
- Get your head in the game, let's go!

69
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:14,525
On your own time.
On your own time, this is my time.

70
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:16,944
- Sorry, Coach.
- Let's go, gentlemen!

71
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,302
You don't have a chance,
you have no chance.

72
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:24,755
I am a chick, and I am winning.

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,579
- There's no rules.
- That's cheating!

74
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,941
There it is!

75
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,711
- 3 out of 3, she's schooling your ass!
- You can't push, you're in the middle.

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,130
Hey, you can, you can.

77
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,820
It's the first time she's ever played.
I used to think

78
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,717
she was prissy,
turns out you're kinda fun.

79
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,760
You're a cheater, Garrity.
You know what? I want a rematch, though.

80
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:46,223
You can have a rematch. Can you bring
me another one while you're over there?

81
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,158
I'm clocking out.

82
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,020
Hitting the sheets.

83
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:52,938
Wanna come?

84
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,887
No, I have a rematch.

85
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:57,827
Don't you wanna watch?

86
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,237
I'm good.

87
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:00,613
Night, grandpa.

88
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,741
- Push PLAY, push PLAY.
- I'm pushing PLAY. You ready?

89
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,328
- That's all that matters, here we go.
- Wait, wait, Billy!

90
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,038
You can't win.

91
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,296
3x11: A HARD RAIN'S GONNA FALL

92
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,343
Subtitles: Team Panthers

93
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,763
With the participation of:

94
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,600
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop, TVnut

95
00:04:58,956 --> 00:04:59,990
Hey, good morning.

96
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,384
- Hey, honey.
- What time is that meeting tonight?

97
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,051
That's at 6:00.
Man, I cannot make heads or tails

98
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,347
out of all this
redistricting business.

99
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,516
You know, they try
to do that every year...

100
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,772
redistricting, try to open up
East Dillon High.

101
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,272
- Never gonna happen. Where's the cream?
- You know what?

102
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,107
People are fed up this year,
people want a change.

103
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,568
I'll tell you one thing,
everything I'm reading tells me

104
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,654
we won't get any funding from the state
unless we do it through redistricting.

105
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,008
You know what?
People don't like confusion.

106
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:29,297
And splitting a town in half,
that causes confusion.

107
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,996
It's not gonna happen.
Where's the cream?

108
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:35,083
Honey, we're out.
You want some of mine? It's real good.

109
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,439
It's still hot.

110
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,337
All right, beer wolf.

111
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,883
I let you sleep in as long as I could
before we gotta go.

112
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,872
Before your favorite

113
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,019
day of academics.

114
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,492
I think you got, what? History?

115
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,381
Time to get up, let's go.

116
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:54,602
I'm not going.

117
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,075
You don't wanna go?

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,679
Fine, I'll stay here,
but you're not gonna get much sleep.

119
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,109
I don't want any company,
I just want to be in bed.

120
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,433
Last chance!

121
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,364
OK, train's leaving.

122
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,376
Seriously, train's leaving.

123
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,588
I'm off.

124
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,493
See you later.

125
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,377
I have seven kinds of tea,
all right?

126
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,556
It's gonna be magical,
I promise you.

127
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,632
Yes.

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,689
You need to stop worrying.

129
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,063
I have every... I have everything.

130
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,803
It's gonna be fine, all right?

131
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:32,105
No, I know, I know.
Don't...

132
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,559
I gotta go. All right,
thank you, bye-bye.

133
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,859
Excuse me, ma'am,
but management just told me

134
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,098
to escort you off the premises.

135
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,357
I wish somebody would.

136
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,698
You OK?

137
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,034
Yeah, totally, just planning
the bridal shower

138
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:53,747
from hell, you know.

139
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,956
Mindy wants a tea party.

140
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,874
That's good, that's exciting.

141
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,377
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing good.

142
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:04,630
I just found out the club owner asked
Crucifictorious back next week, so...

143
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,749
- That's great.
- And hopefully if that goes well,

144
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,751
we'll kinda do like a regular thing,

145
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,446
so, yeah, thank you again
for that, 'cause...

146
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,557
we couldn't have done it
without you.

147
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,394
You guys deserve it.
Good, I'm glad.

148
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,439
Thanks.

149
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,549
Well, I, uh...

150
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,109
I have to get going 'cause I have
to figure out how to make scones,

151
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:26,369
so...

152
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:29,405
My mom's got a scone recipe,
if you wanna use it.

153
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,570
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

154
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:33,588
Was that...

155
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,663
Was that, like, an offer to help?

156
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:40,333
I guess, yeah.

157
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,608
I guess that was an offer to help.

158
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,082
Thank you.

159
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,879
That would be awesome.

160
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,377
Sure.

161
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,543
I completely understand.

162
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:53,078
You bet,
I will definitely talk to him.

163
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,471
No problem.

164
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,308
Well, thank you for calling.

165
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,350
- Who was that?
- That was Wade Aikmen.

166
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,560
J.D. has apparently been...

167
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:03,482
half-assing it at practice,
last couple of days.

168
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,640
I just don't believe that,
you know how hard he works.

169
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:09,112
Well, not this week, baby.
Not this week, not today!

170
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:12,699
Today, he is, quote, "not himself,"

171
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,867
unquote, because
he is completely distracted

172
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,710
by a little 15-year-old minx
named Madison.

173
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,710
- That girl is a plague!
- Oh, please!

174
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,707
I cannot believe
that boy lied to me!

175
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,107
He said he would cool things off,
but no, he didn't.

176
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:27,115
And you know what else? I cannot believe
you don't think it's a big deal

177
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,842
he goes out and sneaks off
in the middle of the night.

178
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,943
- I do.
- You're not acting like it!

179
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,136
I don't think freaking out
is helping anything.

180
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:38,294
- I'm not freaking out, I'm parenting.
- You are freaking out, back off.

181
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:40,512
Hi, honey.

182
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,629
Gonna say hi to your mom?

183
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,104
How you doing?

184
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,275
- I'm good.
- You all right?

185
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,695
- How was practice?
- That was good, too.

186
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,489
- It was good, huh?
- Yeah.

187
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,491
Practice was practice, you know.
I got it under control.

188
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,166
It's all good.

189
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,244
- What's for dinner?
- Turkey burgers.

190
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,530
- Turkey burgers, really?
- Yeah, your favorite.

191
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:05,000
All right, well, cool, I'm gonna go
do some homework, all right?

192
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,038
"He's got it under control."

193
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:09,339
"It's all good."

194
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,762
{\- You good?
- }Get your seat belt on.

195
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,637
Well, I know how to wear a seat belt,
thank you very much.

196
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,390
- You need anything from the market?
- No, I'm good.

197
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,947
- Grandma, be nice, OK?
- And listen,

198
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:24,537
I know what we need at the market,
you didn't need to bother him.

199
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,731
I'm not bothering him, I just wanted
to see if he wanted anything special.

200
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,316
And I didn't want to go now,

201
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,568
I'm missing <i>Oprah</i>,
they're doing a life makeover.

202
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,803
You ought to watch it,
maybe you could learn something.

203
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,771
Well, I promise I'll get you back
in time for the makeovers.

204
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,681
My gosh, where's my purse?

205
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,156
Where is my purse?

206
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,705
- I left my purse on the couch!
- Oh, God, Lorraine!

207
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,369
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:51,364
Lorraine, are you OK?

209
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,512
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

210
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,966
- I'm sorry.
- Grandma, you OK?

211
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:59,110
- Oh, honey...
- Go call an ambulance. Grandma!

212
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,015
Are you all right? Let's try
and turn you over, OK?

213
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:06,182
OK, it's all right.
You're OK.

214
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,328
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. You didn't do anything.

215
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,942
- I don't wanna be in trouble.
- You're not in trouble, Grandma.

216
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,404
Just...
No, it's OK.

217
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,880
- Just try and breathe and...
- OK, honey.

218
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,324
and relax, all right?
We're gonna be fine.

219
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,587
I'm so sorry, honey.

220
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:31,362
- You want a soda or anything?
- No.

221
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,626
Hey, Matt.

222
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,405
It's OK, right, she's all right.

223
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,748
A few contusions, minor lacerations,

224
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:45,696
- but no stitches, that's the good part.
- Oh, thank God.

225
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,644
That's not the real
problem here, Matt.

226
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,272
Your grandmother's mental health
is deteriorating.

227
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,458
Now, look, we've talked about this.

228
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,360
I want you to seriously consider
other living arrangements.

229
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,323
- Other living arrangements, like what?
- Lorraine should be

230
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,867
in a place where there are professionals
who can be responsible for her.

231
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,119
She needs that level of care.

232
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,139
Well, let me get this straight.

233
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,374
You said we should be looking
for some sort of assisted living

234
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,981
- for Lorraine?
- We're not looking for anything.

235
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,656
OK, I know, but...

236
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,922
- The doctor just said...
- Just because she fell out of a car

237
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,027
that <i>you</i> were driving doesn't mean
she needs 24-hour assistance, it means

238
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:23,186
that <i>you</i> need to pay better attention
to her when you're taking care of her.

239
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,266
You're right, I will, Matt,
but you know what?

240
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,017
What the doctor said make me think

241
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,646
that even if I'm paying
great attention and you're there...

242
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,023
Look, if you wanna bail again,
go ahead and bail,

243
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,233
go back to Oklahoma,
we don't need you.

244
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,443
But right now,
my grandmother has a home

245
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,086
- and I'm taking her to it, OK?
- Come on, Matt.

246
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,824
- Where is she? Is she back here?
- No, Matt, wait. I'll take you.

247
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:45,070
- Just calm down a little bit, OK?
- All right...

248
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:55,631
Hey, Tim!

249
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:57,200
Come here.

250
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,346
We need to have a little man-to-man.

251
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,671
I'm pretty sure we have a good shot
against West Cambria.

252
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,530
Tim, you know I'm not here
to talk about football.

253
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,712
I'm here to talk about my daughter.

254
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,160
How's she doing?

255
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:23,235
She's hanging in there.

256
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,800
Tim, I need to get Lyla back.

257
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:33,048
Son, I don't know what to do,
I mean, I cannot go on...

258
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,336
thinking that she hates me.

259
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,590
And I cannot stand the fact
that I've hurt her.

260
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,634
And I miss her very, very much.

261
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:43,845
Well, I know she misses you too.

262
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,548
You know that?
Did she say that?

263
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,926
Yes.

264
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,566
- I don't know what to do...
- You gotta give her more time,

265
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,952
Mr. Garrity, that's what I think.

266
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,197
That's good, Tim Riggins.

267
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,417
That sounds like good advice.

268
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:07,145
That's what I'll do.

269
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,163
You're a good man.

270
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,623
Am I supposed to walk
from here, Mr. Garrity...

271
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,926
- Oh, no, no, I'll take you back.
- drive me home?

272
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,376
No, yeah, oh, yeah.

273
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,902
I'll take you back.

274
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,515
The current proposal

275
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,677
uses Collier Avenue
as the dividing line

276
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,248
between the two schools...

277
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,724
Dillon High School in the blue,
East Dillon High School

278
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,310
in yellow. Each high school
will have roughly

279
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,397
1,000 students,
with class sizes capped at 21,

280
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:40,943
and a 25 percent increase
in per-student funding.

281
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,363
Thank you, Elaine.
All right, I'd like

282
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,881
to open up the floor
to any questions at this time.

283
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,868
This whole thing sounds
like bureaucratic smoke and mirrors.

284
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,496
Where's the pot o'gold
that's gonna fund this pipe dream?

285
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,247
The state's funding this, Larry.

286
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,958
If the majority approves,
and I hope they do,

287
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,169
you'll see this
happening all over Texas.

288
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,172
They closed East Dillon for a reason,
the place was a cesspool.

289
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:05,010
I assure you, East Dillon will be
brought up to code

290
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,178
before a single student
walks trough the door.

291
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,806
- What does this mean for the team?
- Bailey,  hell if I know.

292
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,717
Are we gonna be
the Panthers anymore?

293
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,894
- Oh, yes, Barbara, the PTA President.
- Thank you, Superintendent Dunley.

294
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:18,731
Ladies and gentlemen, we're faced
with some really important decisions.

295
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:22,819
Principal Taylor, we respect you and
value your opinion, what do you think?

296
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,478
Is this a good idea?

297
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,309
Well...

298
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:28,783
Listen, y'all, you know...

299
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,535
Redistricting is...

300
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,003
is a complicated issue, and, uh...

301
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:38,048
let's face it, we've got a school
that's in dire circumstances right now.

302
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,295
We've got real, real problems,
and I think everybody's aware of that.

303
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,756
The way I read these documents,

304
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,676
it sounds to me that the only way
to get any funding from the state

305
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:50,012
is if we consider
this redistricting.

306
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,399
- There you go.
- Thank you, Principal Taylor.

307
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:57,719
You realize half of my team
lives east of Collier Avenue?

308
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:01,050
This thing goes through,

309
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,469
they're gonna end up
playing for the...

310
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:06,382
East Dillon Giraffes or whatever
they're gonna call themselves.

311
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,290
I know.

312
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,058
Dad?

313
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,072
{\OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS
AND FINANCIAL AID}

314
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,049
I'm happy to see you here.

315
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:04,818
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

316
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,144
You can start by congratulating me.

317
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,176
I got into Vanderbilt.

318
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:12,678
Congratulations, baby.

319
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,805
Not that I'll be able to go.

320
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:18,184
- Baby.
- Don't.

321
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,394
Lyla, please.

322
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,744
Hey, did you know that your dad
called my parents last night?

323
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,705
- What?
- Yeah, he called them and said

324
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,285
that I was a negative
influence on you.

325
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,127
Do you think
I'm a negative influence?

326
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,462
No, you're amazing.

327
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:47,672
Good.

328
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:49,440
What did your parents do?

329
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,677
My mom started crying, and then my dad
got on the phone and started yelling

330
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,848
at your dad... if he ever said anything
like that again, then he'd have to sue.

331
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:58,641
- It was kind of funny.
- Damn it!

332
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:01,959
Well, don't worry.
We're not in trouble or anything.

333
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,272
- You're not mad at me?
- No, I mean...

334
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,417
I'm amazing, right?

335
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,876
- No, yeah, you're amazing.
- Good.

336
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,960
- Really amazing.
- Good.

337
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,139
Tyra, do you want to remind me again

338
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,577
why Mindy thinks
that it's a good idea

339
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,559
to have a party outside in December?

340
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:24,250
Remind me again why my sister thinks
it's a good idea to marry Billy Riggins?

341
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:27,767
- That is a good point.
- That's a really good point.

342
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,754
Speak of the devil!
It's Lady Di herself.

343
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:32,258
Hey, what's up?

344
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:36,053
Well, no, I haven't heard back
from everybody yet.

345
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,141
Well, I mean, we're here,
but I don't know if I can change it.

346
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:44,335
- No, what are you trying to say?
- Let me see, this is ridiculous.

347
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,271
No, I...

348
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,373
I got it.

349
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,166
Excuse me, Mindy!

350
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,775
Hey, this is Landry.

351
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,366
Landry Clarke.

352
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:56,824
Yes, you do, you know exactly who I am,
that's not funny, stop laughing.

353
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:00,369
OK, Mindy, listen. Me and Tyra
have this whole thing under control,

354
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:04,415
we've got the chairs and the tables,
there's no need for you to keep calling.

355
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,126
OK? We've got it.
All right? Bye-bye.

356
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,010
Nice.

357
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,516
Got anybody east of Boyds Lane?
Anybody east of, what's this, Driskill?

358
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,636
- He's got a brother.
- They can have these middle areas.

359
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:21,515
We need to find out who's on
this other side of Michigan Avenue.

360
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:23,225
{\- And this here is... We got that, OK.
- }How 'bout this cross street here?

361
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,562
- We got anybody going up McAlister?
- They move, we just take more.

362
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,398
Hey, Lester,
this is my freakin' idea.

363
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,984
The Snyder boys
are gonna be freshmen in two years.

364
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:34,523
They're already as big as houses,
they gotta be Panthers.

365
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,197
- I got that.
- That's a good idea.

366
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,991
Hey, Joe, don't we still
wanna keep Charles White?

367
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,410
So we're gonna have
to bring this line over here,

368
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,288
- somehow we can compromise...
- Hey, what's going on?

369
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,355
- Hey, you made it.
- What's going on?

370
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,211
This redistricting vote came up before
we could do anything, but don't worry,

371
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:54,243
there's nothing we can't fix.
We're working on it right now.

372
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,927
- I thought the line was Collier Avenue.
- Well, the line is Collier Avenue,

373
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,956
but don't worry, the boosters

374
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:03,683
and Paul Dunley, the superintendent,
everybody's on the same page,

375
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,102
and the bottom line is,
we're all about the Dillon Panthers.

376
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,932
We're gonna make sure
that the Dillon Panthers stay intact.

377
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:10,731
Here's that beer you ordered, Buddy.


378
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,903
If I were you, I'd run his credit card,
'cause I hear his last tab was a doozy.

379
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,531
That's real funny, Joe.
I will say this,

380
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,970
that's the most expensive lap dance
I've ever had.

381
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,717
All right.
How about Hall? Jimmy Hall?

382
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:29,208
He was another defensive end, I think
that he moved out of that area too.

383
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,168
Matthew?

384
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,247
Yes?

385
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:34,493
Where are my slippers, honey?

386
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,965
Wh... What?

387
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,662
Where are my slippers, honey?

388
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:42,096
They're right there
on your feet, Grandma.

389
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,223
I need my slippers, Matthew.

390
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,102
I need my slippers, honey.
I need 'em now!

391
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,564
- Grandma, they're on your feet.
- Where are my slippers?

392
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,068
- Where are they?
- Grandma, they're right there.

393
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,056
All right, well, I...

394
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,994
Grandma, just sit down, OK?

395
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,415
Do you need
another pair of slippers, or...

396
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,703
I need my slippers!
Help me!

397
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,313
Here. Look, here.
Grandma, here, here.

398
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,563
Is that good?

399
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,791
That what you need?

400
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,800
Thank you.

401
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,160
Don't mean to step on your toes,

402
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,521
but you might wanna try
cutting those a little bit thinner

403
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:35,024
because cucumber sandwiches
are kinda delicate.

404
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:36,791
Really?

405
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,736
Did I just lose
a lot of man points for that?

406
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,114
I'm trying not to keep count,
but, yeah, yeah, you did.

407
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,241
Did I tell you
that I'm in a band, though?

408
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:48,036
See, there's like 40,000 man points,
so you're in the black.

409
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,916
- Did I tell you I got my SAT scores?
- No.

410
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,166
You gonna let me see 'em?

411
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,885
Well, you went up.

412
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:04,231
Yeah.

413
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:06,555
You went up like 100 points,
that's awesome!

414
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,468
Yeah.
I needed to go up like 200,

415
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,977
to make up
for freshman and sophomore year...

416
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,485
- It's fine.
- Well, this is still really good.

417
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,882
Can I say something?

418
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,299
Most girls that look like you do,
things are easy, they can just coast by

419
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:28,428
on their good looks for the rest
of their lives and not really have to...

420
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:31,577
not really have to worry.
I mean, I know it sounds stupid,

421
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:35,156
but I'm proud of how hard
you've been working for this, it...

422
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,211
I mean, it says something.

423
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,244
I think good things are gonna happen,
you just gotta keep going.

424
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:42,966
Thank you.

425
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,524
You still think
I'm good-looking, though, right?

426
00:21:49,165 --> 00:21:50,766
You still... you've still got...

427
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,276
you know...
Yeah.

428
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,058
I think you're still OK.

429
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:56,817
OK?
Thanks.

430
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,101
You see that truck right there?

431
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,812
It's been on the lot 18 months

432
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:05,696
and it just won't move.

433
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,413
I challenge myself.
I've said,

434
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:10,868
"By God, today, Buddy Garrity,
you're gonna sell this truck."

435
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,186
And here she sits!

436
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,414
I don't like what's going on between
the boosters and this remapping.

437
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,253
Well, that's not something
you need to worry about.

438
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,421
We've got that
taken care of for you.

439
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,107
I don't want anyone
taking care of anything for me.

440
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,252
Let me tell you something,
this is a whole lot bigger than you.

441
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:31,187
This is about the Dillon Panthers.

442
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:34,725
No one...
not me, not Joe McCoy,

443
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,594
not any other booster...

444
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:40,898
is gonna stand by and let
the Dillon Panthers get dismantled

445
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,402
because of some dang politics,
I'll tell you that right now.

446
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,336
So if you don't wanna know,

447
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,586
dont ask.

448
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,672
I'll see you tomorrow.

449
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,798
Good night.

450
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,425
Good night.

451
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,697
- What are we doing here, Tim?
- I know you were gonna ask that, so...

452
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,903
I know this is the first church that you
started going to with your whole family,

453
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,595
so I just wanted to come...

454
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,915
Just come sit down with me
for one sec.

455
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,829
Please, please, please...

456
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,124
Did my dad
tell you to bring me here?

457
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:44,629
No, your dad didn't tell me
to bring you here.

458
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:46,715
Of course not.

459
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:49,583
Are you mad?

460
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,277
I just don't understand
what we're doing here.

461
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,476
I thought it might just
cheer you up.

462
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,814
Maybe I don't wanna be cheered up.

463
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:07,109
- Well, I didn't bring you here...
- Just leave me alone, please!

464
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,653
- Garrity...
- Damn it!

465
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,640
Come here!
Look, Lyla, stop.

466
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,329
- Please, please stop.
- I don't even know what I'm doing here!

467
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,263
Why did I stay here?

468
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,375
Why did I let them go?

469
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,961
You didn't let 'em go.

470
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:27,351
What was I thinking?

471
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:29,652
Why didn't I go with them?

472
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,335
I have no family.

473
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:36,802
I have no family.

474
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,392
You can deal, come here.

475
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:40,861
Come here.

476
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:45,522
Baby, it's all right.

477
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,910
There's no way
that these are their real names.

478
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,913
I better get like a billion
sister points for this thing.

479
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,082
OK, what else do we need to do?

480
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:05,081
- Scones.
- OK.

481
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,052
You gotta be kidding me!

482
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,568
Take it inside!

483
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:28,649
- Mama, you all set over there?
- Yes.

484
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,852
- Perfect. Beautiful.
- All right.

485
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,489
Everything looks good, huh?

486
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,618
They're here!
Come in, sweetie, come in!

487
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:41,624
OK, Tyra, I really have to go,
I should have left 20 minutes ago.

488
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,291
Yeah, I wonder why you didn't.

489
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,876
You got everything you need?
Got a camera?

490
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,392
All right.

491
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,395
Thank you...
for everything.

492
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:53,592
You're welcome.

493
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,659
- You're very sweet.
- Well, I try.

494
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,770
Your favorite color and everything.

495
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:07,441
Nice, thank you, yes.

496
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,734
- And it goes with this.
- Of course!

497
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,069
Girl gets the heat?

498
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,452
You and Billy are forever, but this is
gonna help you keep things fresh.

499
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:22,135
- Is it? That's good news!
- It's all I'm saying.

500
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:26,000
OK, I need to make a toast, guys.

501
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:29,670
Thank you so much
for coming to my bridal shower.

502
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,548
You guys are the best friends
any girl could ever have.

503
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:35,374
And I really need to thank

504
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:37,094
my baby sister Tyra

505
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:40,762
'cause she put this whole day together,
and it's really perfect.

506
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:44,393
And even though she's the baby
of the family and my younger sister,

507
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,187
I look up to her.

508
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,475
- I love you, Ty-Ty!
- I love you.

509
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,029
And maybe,
one day, if you're really lucky,

510
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:59,367
you will find a man
almost as hot as Billy Riggins!

511
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,596
Now, listen to me.

512
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,559
- Are you listening to me?
- Joe, he's sitting right there.

513
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,893
Honey, he knows exactly
what I'm talking about, OK?

514
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,938
- Hey, what is with the attitude?
- What attitude? I didn't say anything.

515
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:34,069
OK, listen to me. In the rain, the name
of the game is ball control, OK?

516
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,685
Your first read is always
your short routes, your safe ones, OK?

517
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,451
On the run/pass option,
you pull it down and you keep it

518
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,117
unless it's a gimme.

519
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,577
You are running the football tonight,
do you understand?

520
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,085
- I got it.
- Are you sure?

521
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,206
- Yeah, I'm positive.
- Honey, we get it.

522
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,084
When it rains, things get
a little slippery, like the football!

523
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,529
You hear what your mama says? The ball
gets slippery. Now listen to me.

524
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:58,216
What I'm talking about is ball control.
Now you do that,

525
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:00,468
you win this game,
and we're headed to State.

526
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:03,513
- All right, I gotta go.
- Go get 'em.

527
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,344
- See you, honey.
- Run the ball.

528
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,092
All right.

529
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,689
<i>The gateway
to the State championship</i>

530
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,000
<i>is through a real
Texas toad strangler, folks.</i>

531
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,071
<i>It's wet, it's windy,</i>
<i>it's semifinal football.</i>

532
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,239
Listen up!

533
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,196
This is it, fellas, this is what
we've been working for, right here.

534
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,201
It's a beautiful night
for football, gentlemen.

535
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,539
Let's go out there and punch 'em
right in the mouth. What do you say?

536
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,336
Let's go!
Clear eyes, full hearts...

537
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,629
can't lose!

538
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,214
<i>Early in the 2nd quarter</i>

539
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,684
<i>and it is really coming down,
folks.</i>

540
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:43,053
<i>Mustangs have the ball.
There's a pitch left,</i>

541
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,279
<i>he's got an opening!</i>

542
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:48,139
<i>Big hit!
A fumble!</i>

543
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:50,685
There you go, baby!
There you go, baby!

544
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,979
- <i>Panthers have the ball!</i>
- Way to go, baby!

545
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,149
Let's go, let's go!

546
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,734
Come on now, J.D.!

547
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,152
Blue, 80.
Set!

548
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:01,129
Hut!

549
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,239
<i>McCoy drops back to pass.</i>

550
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:05,905
<i>He lets it fly!</i>

551
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:09,006
<i>Saracen has got it inside the 10!</i>

552
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,082
<i>What a fantastic catch!</i>

553
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:14,344
He got lucky.

554
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:16,711
He got lucky on that one.

555
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,635
<i>McCoy, draw to Tim Riggins,
he's got a lane!</i>

556
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:25,470
<i>Big Tim Riggins
powers into the end zone!</i>

557
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,305
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

558
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,688
Let's go, J.D., let's go, baby!

559
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,271
Run a regular throw!

560
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:38,441
- <i>McCoy rolls left.</i>
- What is he doing?!

561
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:40,527
<i>He's looking deep,</i>

562
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,424
<i>he fires a big, long ball...</i>

563
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,197
<i>Oh, and it is picked up,</i>

564
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,118
<i>intercepted by Cambria!</i>

565
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:49,847
<i>He's got blockers out front, folks,
he could score.</i>

566
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,831
<i>Oh, my, it's 6!</i>

567
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:56,127
<i>Cambria touchdown,
13-7 West Cambria.</i>

568
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,837
You don't throw in this mess!

569
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,964
Keep it on the ground!
Take the running lane!

570
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,967
- Keep it on the ground!
- What are you doing?

571
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,038
Use your head, run the ball!

572
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,599
J.D.!
Come here.

573
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,148
Listen to me. We're gonna stick
to the same game plan, all right?

574
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:20,191
We're down by 7.
The game hasn't even started yet.

575
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:21,744
- You got it?
- I got it.

576
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:24,874
Protect the ball, keep your head up,
and have some fun out there.

577
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:28,074
It's a beautiful night, son.
You're doing fine, let's go, come on.

578
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,869
Let's go, 1-2, you're on.

579
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,456
He is not doing
what he's supposed to be doing.

580
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,253
He's gotta do
what the coach tells him to do!

581
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:40,712
Let's go, offense, let's go!
Watch the left!

582
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,714
<i>I can't believe it, folks,</i>

583
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,936
<i>but McCoy is looking deep
and he lets it fly...</i>

584
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:49,661
<i>and that is out
in the middle of no man's land.</i>

585
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,767
Come on, come on, J.D.!

586
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,934
- Let's go, son!
- Run it!

587
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:57,713
<i>He takes the snap, opens left...</i>

588
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,231
<i>Fumble!
And the ball is on the carpet!</i>

589
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,636
<i>Cambria has got it!</i>

590
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,571
<i>J.D. McCoy fumbles,
and West Cambria recovers.</i>

591
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,367
You can't throw, you can't even pitch!
Pull his ass out!

592
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:15,206
Come on, Coach, pull him out
before he hits the spin thing!

593
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,208
<i>It's been a real
heart-stopper out there,</i>

594
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,626
<i>a lot of miscues
on both sides of the ball.</i>

595
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,997
<i>West Cambria lines up for the punt.</i>

596
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,840
<i>The snap is on the ground,
Riggins comes out!</i>

597
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,466
<i>He just takes him out!</i>

598
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,385
<i>The ball's on the ground,
Panthers pick it up.</i>

599
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,444
<i>He is gonna score, folks!</i>

600
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:34,349
<i>Oh, my!
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!</i>

601
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,243
<i>And the Dillon Panthers
are down by 1.</i>

602
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:40,396
<i>It is 13-14,</i>

603
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,358
- <i>with seconds left to go.</i>
- We're going for 2.

604
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,111
<i>And it appears
Coach Taylor is going for 2!</i>

605
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,915
 <i>He's going for the win,
he does not want the tie.</i>

606
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,662
Wait...
Go for the tie!

607
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,862
<i>This is for State, folks.
And here we go!</i>

608
00:31:57,987 --> 00:31:59,582
Three, 85!

609
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:00,961
Set, hut!

610
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,906
<i>McCoy drops back...</i>

611
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:06,172
<i>He's in trouble right away,
and he has got to scramble!</i>

612
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,551
<i>He cuts back to the right
and, oh, he...</i>

613
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:10,927
<i>No! He's still on his feet!</i>

614
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,345
Would you run the ball!

615
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:14,452
<i>He looks downfield...</i>

616
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,935
<i>He fires it in the end zone!</i>

617
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:23,274
<i>Caught by Tim Riggins
in the end zone, 2 points!</i>

618
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,193
<i>And the Panthers of Dillon Texas</i>
<i>are going to State!</i>

619
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,035
Come here!

620
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,372
Good job.

621
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,346
That was some game!

622
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:00,059
Look...

623
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,189
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's OK.

624
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:07,172
No, look, you were right.

625
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:11,029
I don't know how to take care
of Grandma anymore.

626
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:13,908
OK, well, we can figure that out.

627
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,325
I don't...

628
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,038
really want you to leave.

629
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,413
I was never going anywhere.

630
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:27,426
Thanks.

631
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:31,467
Come on,
let me give you a ride home.

632
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,181
- Good job, Coach.
- These guys are playing really good.

633
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:40,163
Hey, thanks very much.
Thanks, guys.

634
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,532
- Come on, this way.
- Hey, y'all.

635
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:44,855
Take care, guys.

636
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:47,358
Well, yeah, I know, it was cold.

637
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:49,923
I know, it was crazy.

638
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,814
No, it was good out there,
it was a lot of fun.

639
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,573
It's like playing on
a slippery slide.

640
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:58,660
What? You'd better stop.
You're gonna get it, all right?

641
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:01,508
- Hang up the phone.
- Yeah. What?

642
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:03,915
I said, hang up the phone.

643
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,644
- Why?
- Hang up the phone!

644
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,617
Joe, relax!

645
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:11,376
Can I call you back later?

646
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,504
Yeah.

647
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,271
Hey, listen.
I'm hearing that...

648
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,308
this whole redistricting thing?

649
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:26,480
They're completely changing the map.
You know how it had that straight line?

650
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,192
They wanna zigzag it all over the place.
Did you hear anything about that?

651
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,196
It's the craziest thing!

652
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,334
They're just talking about...

653
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:40,034
It's sounding like a jigsaw puzzle,
and I think it's all about football.

654
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,926
Can they even do that?

655
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:45,062
I don't know.

656
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:48,275
Well, I don't know either.
Guess we'll find out.

657
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,921
Isn't it weird to think that East Dillon
would be our main rival

658
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:53,937
if this all happens?

659
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,783
Big Texas storm!

660
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:00,818
You did a great job, honey,
I'm proud of you.

661
00:35:00,943 --> 00:35:02,808
- Thanks.
- You're gonna have fun, right?

662
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,685
J.D., hold up,
I wanna talk to you.

663
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,350
- Sweetie, just give us a second here.
- Why?

664
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,649
Why? That was a pathetic display
you put on this evening.

665
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,736
Pathetic display?
I got us to State, didn't I?

666
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,904
Boy, you got lucky, OK?
We talked about strategy,

667
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,784
we talked about running the football!
And what are you doing?

668
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:22,870
Pass, interception, pass!

669
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,960
- Joe! Calm down.
- Honey, stop it.

670
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,957
Like you never played
in a game in your life!

671
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:29,609
Why don't you go call Madison's parents?
Talk to them about it?

672
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:30,836
I will call them

673
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:34,339
every day of the week until that tramp
stops coming around our house.

674
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:35,799
You understand me?

675
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:37,038
You know what?

676
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:39,386
I don't care what you do, Dad.
Screw you!

677
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,054

You don't talk to me like that!

678
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:43,431
Hey, honey?
Look.

679
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:44,974
Is that...?

680
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:46,643
Good Lord!

681
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,315
- Stay here!
- No! No, I'm coming with you.

682
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,899
You don't talk to me like that!

683
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,238
- Stop it, Joe!
- Boy, you don't talk to me that way!

684
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,625
Stop it!

685
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,285
- Stop!
- You will respect me!

686
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,078
You will not talk to me
that way, ever!

687
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,661
Ever!

688
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:08,457
- Y'all OK?
- You all right?

689
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,427
Honey, how are you?
You OK?

690
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:15,368
Come here, let's go inside.
Come on, let's go inside.

691
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:24,651
You know what that was?
That was a game for the ages.

692
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:26,612
What a game!

693
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,401
Why don't you go out?

694
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:31,204
You guys are going to State,
there's probably...

695
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,271
tons of parties tonight.

696
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:37,957
'Cause the real parties
are when we <i>win</i> State.

697
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,292
That's when the real parties are.

698
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,471
And then there's
one little thing, too.

699
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,171
I think I'm OK...

700
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,121
hanging with my gal.

701
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,004
Especially

702
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,976
after a night like tonight.

703
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,296
You're not having
much fun here, are you?

704
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:00,975
Yeah.

705
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:04,637
- Why?
- Maybe I'm just stating the obvious,

706
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,159
but you seem to be

707
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,057
pretty down around here.

708
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:10,267
I mean, what...

709
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,980
What did I expect? To just
move in here, and you're gonna...

710
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,358
solve all my problems?

711
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,529
OK, you know what? I'm not here to solve
all your problems, Garrity. I'm not.

712
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:23,572
I'm here to support you
no matter what choice you make.

713
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,866
I'm your boyfriend,
I think I'm a pretty good one.

714
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,995
Your dad threw you
a good curve ball.

715
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:31,535
But this self-pity
that I've been seeing,

716
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,873
it's gotta stop.

717
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:34,542
You're better than that.

718
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:41,215
And you can still get into any college
you want. Any one you want, still.

719
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,509
- How am I gonna afford it?
- If you can't afford it,

720
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,345
there's scholarships to be had,
your grades speak for themselves.

721
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:49,337
And you know what?
If it doesn't,

722
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,934
there's San Antonio State,
and I would love to have you.

723
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,232
Did I just say I loved you?

724
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:00,245
Did I?
No?

725
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:05,364
'Cause I'm kinda madly in love with you,
and I'll be here no matter what.

726
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,074
I love you too.

727
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,316
He pushed.

728
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,542
He pushed him so hard.

729
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,712
- I should have stopped it.
- Honey, honey...

730
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,761
Listen, don't you go
blaming yourself, all right?

731
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,081
It's not your fault,
don't even go down that road.

732
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:32,381
- But he hit him.
- I know.

733
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:37,698
He hit my baby.

734
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:43,865
What am I gonna do?

735
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,280
You're not gonna do
anything right now.

736
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,478
You're just gonna

737
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:53,449
drink your tea...

738
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,454
Just leave it be for right now, OK?

739
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:59,393
I'm sorry, babe.

740
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,948
Nothing I do is ever
good enough for him.

741
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:11,973
I mean, it's always this or always that.
I can't take it anymore!

742
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,562
- He treats me like I'm some dumb kid.
- I understand.

743
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,271
I don't wanna see his face again.

744
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:22,108
I don't wanna go back to that house,
I hate it.

745
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,319
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

746
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,783
What's gonna happen tonight is,
you and your mom are gonna stay here.

747
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,079
You and your mom are gonna have
to talk this thing out,

748
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,308
figure out what the next step is...

749
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,710
The important thing to know is that
you're not alone in this, all right?

750
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,507
- Is it my fault or something?
- Listen, what he did was wrong.

751
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:47,794
There's no two ways about it,
that's just wrong.

752
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,718
Whether it's your father or not.

753
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,474
This will all work out
in the long run.

754
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,034
I need a second opinion.
Does this make me look fat?

755
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,864
- I need to know.
- You are sexy!

756
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,867
Thank you. See, she says I'm sexy,
so I don't know what to tell you.

757
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:14,355
I'm taking these,

758
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,590
those are hot, and this.
Let's go.

759
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,428
- Come on, baby.
- Bye, you two.

760
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:19,832
We'll see you kids later.{\
- Bye.}

761
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,085
- Thank you!
- Bye, sweetheart.

762
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:23,849
I love you!

763
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,838
- I love y'all, take care.
- Bye.

764
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:28,216
Oh, my God, this place...

765
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:31,463
Somebody just put their gum
right on the table.

766
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:34,535
Honey, what's the matter?

767
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,017
I don't know what's
wrong with me, Mama.

768
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,516
Nothing's wrong with you,
what are you talking about?

769
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,795
Why can't I want that?

770
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,936
They look so happy.

771
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,025
I mean, I spend all this time

772
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:55,807
trying to go to college, and
it's seeming more and more impossible.

773
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:02,282
Honey, listen to me,
let me tell you something, all right?

774
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,303
I love my Mindy.

775
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:08,222
You know, she was my first baby.

776
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:10,974
And she's so funny and darling,

777
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,232
you know, but...

778
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,264
she has never surprised me,
not one day

779
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,692
in her life, bless her heart.

780
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:20,694
But you...

781
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:24,647
You surprise me, honey.

782
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,783
Every day since the minute
I knew you were coming,

783
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,029
till right now.

784
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,109
You are a wonder!

785
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:38,349
I have no idea
what's gonna happen with you,

786
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:42,781
not a clue, I've no idea
what college you're gonna go to,

787
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,042
or anything.

788
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,962
But I know one thing,
with all my heart,

789
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:48,797
that you

790
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,888
are gonna have everything
that you are dreaming of.

791
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:57,390
You're gonna get everything
you're reaching for, honey.

792
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,574
You are!

793
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,228
And I want you to keep reaching,
you keep going.

794
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,563
One of these days, you're gonna
surprise yourself, you'll see.

795
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,067
I won't be surprised,
but you will be.

796
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,797
I know it.

797
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:15,198
- I love you.
- I love you, sweetie, so much.

798
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,004
Thank you, Mama.

799
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:13,047
I'm Mark Enderland, this is Jodie Russi,
we're with Child Protective Services.

800
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:15,050
We'd like to speak with your family.

801
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,263
What changed from 2 years ago?

802
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,140
Jason Street got paralyzed,
and it made me realize

803
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,809
that life isn't fair for anybody,
not just me.

804
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,396
Last game, 7.

805
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:30,022
No regrets.
