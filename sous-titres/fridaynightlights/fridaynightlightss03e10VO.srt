1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,876
- We should probably get going.
- We should.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,049
We're gonna go celebrate,
create some memories, all right, 1-2?

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:10,759
That is what I'm talking about,
young man!

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,638
Come on, now, we're gonna celebrate.
Come on. All right.

5
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,431
- Daddy got him on a leash!
- I bring you here as assistant coach

6
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:19,310
- until Mac gets back. What do ya think?
- Yeah, sure.

7
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,348
I'm going to college.
Only Riggins to get in.

8
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,272
- I told you.
- I'm in because of you.

9
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,357
- Where are you?
- I'm actually in Dallas.

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,985
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything is fine.

11
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,176
I wanted to hear a familiar voice.

12
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,743
I'm such an idiot, Julie.
There's no possible way on Earth

13
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:41,725
that I'm gonna be able to make up
everything I have to make up.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,900
I missed so much school, I'm...

15
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,961
I'll never get into college
at this point.

16
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,882
Look, OK. All you have to do
is just bribe your teachers

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,256
with some cupcakes
to let you make up the tests.

18
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,731
Cupcakes, really?

19
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:56,555
And then, they're having another
SAT this Saturday, Matt is taking it.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,809
So you just go to that SAT,
get really high SAT scores

21
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,836
and then your GPA
won't matter as much.

22
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,153
Yeah, the problem is,
I suck at tests, so there is that.

23
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,956
So then why don't just get
Landry to help you?

24
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,402
It's not like
he has anything better to do.

25
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:15,971
It's an idea.
All right, I'll see you later.

26
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,129
Bye, honey.

27
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,498
So, does anyone have a plan
or are we just gonna sit here all day?

28
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,755
'Cause I'd like to know
if that's the plan.

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,426
- Let's go to the Alamo Freeze.
- We've been sitting here for an hour.

30
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:31,131
- The Alamo Freeze is gross.
- You know what? I'm leaving.

31
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:33,066
Don't touch my door.
What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,500
- I didn't give you permission to leave.
- You're not my dad.

33
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,555
Another word about your dad,
I swear I'm gonna punch you in the face.

34
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,143
- Man, just relax.
- Hey, guys.

35
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,642
- How're you doing?
- I just wanted to let y'all know

36
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,270
Madison's parents are out of town,
she's gonna have some people over.

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,147
So y'all should definitely come.

38
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,580
Hey, who's Madison?

39
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:50,651
- Freaking perv!
- Would y'all shut up?

40
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,319
Yeah, keep it coming!

41
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:59,285
Hey, Charles,
how about using a fork, OK?

42
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,830
God, these guys are like cavemen.

43
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,031
- Do you want an appletini?
- No, uh...

44
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,031
I don't drink alcohol.

45
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:34,737
- Yeah.
- You don't?

46
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:37,200
How about a glass of milk?

47
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,290
- You know, I'm fine. Thank you, though.
- No, I insist.

48
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,836
No, this should be your thing,
you know.

49
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,957
You drink milk.

50
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:49,959
You're like this young,

51
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,552
wholesome,
milk-drinking quarterback.

52
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:58,787
You have some...

53
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:01,972
just a little bit on your lip,

54
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,921
just right here.

55
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:05,757
There we go.

56
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,150
Perfect.

57
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,191
Keep 'em coming, love.

58
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:22,057
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You like that.

59
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:24,967
You good, Buddy?

60
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,600
Yeah, I'm good.

61
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:29,559
Want anything else?
Buffalo wings?

62
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,401
Some chicken fingers with that little
spicy ranch sauce you like so much?

63
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,472
What I wanna know is,
when are you gonna tell me

64
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,592
- why you brought me here.
- That's what I'm trying to get to.

65
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,262
Remember that little investment we made,
a few months back, into the...

66
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,902
- strip mall?
- The sure thing?

67
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,958
It went belly-up.

68
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,706
It's OK, though.

69
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,840
I got a plan that's gonna put Dillon
on the map, and I want you in on it.

70
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:58,278
I'm gonna give you a chance
here tonight to be my first investor.

71
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,963
Now you tell me right now
that this isn't so.

72
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,742
- What I come up with...
- Tell me you didn't lose my $70,000.

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,984
- I'll make you so much more money...
- No, I was in this for 70 grand,

74
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,104
- it's gonna work out.
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.

75
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,957
You two lovebirds wanna
quiet down a bit?

76
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,655
I'll tell you what, cowboy,
you redneck son of a bitch,

77
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,257
you need silence to watch naked women,
is that what you're saying to me?

78
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,300
- Sit down.
- Now listen,

79
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,928
you tell me right now
that you did not steal my money.

80
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:24,809
You're not even gonna miss
that 70 grand!

81
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,266
Don't you talk to me about
that 70 grand. You gotta tell me...

82
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,102
- You kept begging for deals all year.
- Are you out of your mind?

83
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,311
Son of a bitch!

84
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,918
Get up, you son of a bitch!

85
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,475
3x10: THE GIVING TREE

86
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:15,522
Subtitles: Team Panthers

89
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,751
What the hell happened?

90
00:05:58,835 --> 00:05:59,840
Ah, well...

91
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,021
You oughta see the other guy.

92
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,762
No, I...

93
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:08,449
It's not anything
that you need to worry about.

94
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,120
You need to be thinking
about Friday night, Eric.

95
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:15,403
The Bisons play dirty,
everybody knows that.

96
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,459
And the refs don't like you,
so don't worry about me.

97
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,087
I'm not worried about you. You know
you're gonna spend the night in here?

98
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,027
'Cause they're not letting you out.

99
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:25,818
Yes, I do.

100
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,744
Just tell me what happened.

101
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,229
Oh, my Lord, that is awful.

102
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,534
- <i>What happened?</i>
- I don't know, honey.

103
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,823
He got into a fight over at
the Landing Strip or some crazy thing.

104
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:46,161
- I'm not quite sure what, but...
- <i>Oh, my Lord.</i>

105
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,657
Just listen to me real quick.
What he wants to know,

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,866
can you go over
and let Lyla know what's going on?

107
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,912
Well, yeah, you know,
I'm actually not far from there now.

108
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,582
I was supposed to pick up Jules
at Matt's house at 6:00.

109
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,901
- <i>Could you do that?</i>
- All right.

110
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,087
All right.
I'll go over there now.

111
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,148
- Hi, Mrs. Taylor.
- How are ya?

112
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,660
- Good.
- Good. I just, um...

113
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:25,693
Your dad asked me to drop by because

114
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,155
he got himself
in a little bit of a...

115
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,715
- a bit of a scrape, and...
- What do you mean?

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,585
Well, I guess there was some kind
of a fight or something, and...

117
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,266
- A fight?
- Yeah, and I think...

118
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:39,191
When? Where?
What do you mean, a fight? With who?

119
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:41,880
He was apparently
in a business meeting at the...

120
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,213
at the Landing Strip, and...

121
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,858
Anyway, so he's gonna have to spend
the night in jail, is the point,

122
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,069
but he's fine, sweetie,
he's fine, OK?

123
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:52,944
And he was worried about you,
he wanted me to let you know, OK?

124
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:57,596
I know you're a big grown-up girl
and all of that, but...

125
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,729
if you wanted to just come
stay with us tonight

126
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,791
at our house,
you'd be more than welcome,

127
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,841
in case you feel like you might like
to have some family around, OK?

128
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:16,494
I love you.

129
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:19,904
I love you, too.

130
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,193
We should probably get up.

131
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:32,135
Your mom is gonna be here
in like a half-hour, and

132
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:35,847
Grandma and Shelby will 
be back from the doctor's soon.

133
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,767
Or we could just listen
to one more song.

134
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,722
Yeah, we could do one more.

135
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,619
Dad, get out!

136
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,866
Now, that part, that's the part
where I wanted to clap.

137
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:21,597
Hey, y'all.

138
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,567
- How are you?
- Hello.

139
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,157
Can I talk to you for a sec?

140
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,005
- Yeah, that's...
- I mean, just for...

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,250
- Yeah, that's fine, just...
- Sorry, it'll only take a minute.

142
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,340
You always just pop up
at the most random times.

143
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:40,096
Yeah, you know.
You sound really good, though.

144
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,162
It's supposed to sound
a lot heavier than that.

145
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:44,361
My distortion paddle's
not even working, but...

146
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,730
And now is, like,
the first time that we've

147
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,147
ever really run through it
all together, but...

148
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,368
Cool.

149
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,145
Look, I need to ask you a favor,

150
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,154
if you can.
I'm taking the SAT's on Saturday

151
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,823
'cause I gotta get my points up
by, like, a thousand.

152
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,640
And I thought it'd be better
if I had a coach,

153
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,212
and you're really good at that,
so I was just

154
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,832
- hoping...
- So you want me to help you out?

155
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,026
If you could, that would be

156
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:11,974
amazing.

157
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,033
Yeah, that's fine.
I don't see why not.

158
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,677
But I just got band rehearsal,

159
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,764
- and practice, and school... 
- Right, of course. You're the best.

160
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:25,094
You are, thank you.

161
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,874
- So I'll call you tomorrow.
- We'll set something up.

162
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,813
- OK. All right.
- Thank you.

163
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:31,738
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye.

164
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:34,676
What?

165
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,268
It's like
you're her prostitute, right?

166
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,482
- Except you don't get paid.
- Or laid.

167
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,036
How many times have you gotten laid
in your timelife, Jimmy?

168
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,124
- He does have a point.
- How many times?

169
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,126
It's OK,
let's just work on the claps.

170
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,621
Sorry about the whole air mattress
thing, we don't have extra beds.

171
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,394
Look, I'm sorry about your dad,

172
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,619
really.

173
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,900
I mean, it sucks.

174
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,973
Do you wanna talk about it at all?

175
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:23,756
That's OK.

176
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:25,126
Thank you.

177
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,330
But just a heads up,
there might be some...

178
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,420
some drama with my parents, tonight.

179
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,341
- Why?
- Well, Matt and I were...

180
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,104
- What?
- We were doing stuff, and then

181
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,766
- my dad came in, and...
- Like, making out doing stuff, or

182
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,831
like, doing stuff?

183
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,590
- Like, you did it?
- It was, like, afterwards, and

184
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:57,247
then my dad walked in, and...

185
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,404
That sucks.

186
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,827
Yeah, welcome to my world.

187
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:23,912
Good Lord...

188
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,928
I found Matt and Julie
in bed together this afternoon.

189
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,830
What?

190
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:43,196
I found Julie and Matt
in bed together this afternoon.

191
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,911
Where?

192
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:50,481
Over at Matt's house,
when I went to pick Julie up.

193
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,610
- Where was that grandmother?
- I don't know.

194
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,090
What were they doing?

195
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,789
Honey, there were in bed together,
it was very obvious.

196
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,214
You walked in?

197
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,841
What did you do?

198
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,552
What did I do? I went outside
and waited for Julie, that's what I did.

199
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,293
I'm gonna go talk to her.

200
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:16,020
Before you go in there and talk to her,
you'd better know

201
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,785
what you're gonna say.

202
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,757
I have no idea.

203
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:39,807
What are you doing?

204
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,339
Just trying to see how long
they're gonna ground me for.

205
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,512
Well, at least
they have another daughter.

206
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:52,265
Sorry, bad joke.

207
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:02,709
Matt seems like a really nice guy.

208
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,173
Yeah, I know, it's...

209
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:07,973
it's not the problem,
he's a great guy. It's...

210
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,510
I just feel like everything
is different now.

211
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,182
Like I'm not
Daddy's little girl anymore.

212
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,070
So your dad told me about
what happened at Matt's last night.

213
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:54,478
Great.

214
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,591
Is there anything you wanna say?

215
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:02,764
He should have knocked.

216
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,405
All right, well, you...
I don't like your tone.

217
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,843
I'd like to be able to have
a conversation with you about it.

218
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:13,142
So let's have a conversation.

219
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,766
Well, I don't really know
what to say.

220
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:21,035
I don't really know
how to have a conversation about it.

221
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,268
You know, it's...

222
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:25,400
it's disconcerting,
and your dad and I...

223
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:29,362
- I don't know, Jules.
- Just tell me what my punishment is.

224
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:35,034
Your punishment is you're gonna have
to have a conversation with me about it.

225
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,829
Let's go to school.
Come on.

226
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:41,438
- You do realize I'm 17, right?
- I know how old you are.

227
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,337
Buddy Garrity, you have been charged

228
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:46,588
with drunk-and-disorderly,
assault and battery,

229
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:49,982
and inflicting $30,000 of damage

230
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:51,759
to the Landing Strip.

231
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:54,637
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

232
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,473
Bail is set at $10,000.

233
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:20,205
Have you really
not talked to your dad yet?

234
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,748
No, I haven't talked to my dad,
he hasn't said anything.

235
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,875
- Nothing?
- No.

236
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,752
Well, then, maybe...

237
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,969
maybe we should just meet at the movies
instead of me picking you up.

238
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,847
I'm not gonna meet you at the movies,
you have to come to my house.

239
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,224
- No, I really don't.
- Man up, Matt.

240
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,374
Is J.D. home?

241
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,458
I'm sorry.

242
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:55,948
You must be Mrs. McCoy.
I'm Madison.

243
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,668
- It's really nice to meet you.
- Well, nice to meet you.

244
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:01,793
- You have a beautiful house.
- Oh, thank you!

245
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,206
I know J.D. from school,
so I was just popping by.

246
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,342
- I hope that's OK?
- Oh, yeah.

247
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,592
- This is my husband.
- Mr. McCoy.

248
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:09,712
That's me.

249
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,366
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

250
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,045
Is J.D. home?

251
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,876
- He's upstairs studying, actually.
- Why don't you clatter right on up?

252
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,512
Thank you.
I'll find my own way.

253
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:20,598
Yeah, it's just...

254
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,477
Who the hell is that?

255
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:27,188
Didn't you hear, honey?

256
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,092
That's Madison.

257
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,859
"The other delegates
and him immediately

258
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,225
accepted the resolution
drafted by the neutral states."

259
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:37,886
So, if you break this down,

260
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,869
"the other" modifies the word
"delegates," so that one's not it.

261
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,579
"Him" should be "he."

262
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,680
- There you go.
- I'm smarter than I look.

263
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,961
- You guys working hard?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,963
Landry, we're so happy to see you back
around here, we missed you.

265
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,393
Didn't we, honey?

266
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,721
While you're here, can you take a look
at the pilot light in that wall heater?

267
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,265
- I just about blew myself up.
- Mama, Landry is...

268
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,226
He's helping me right now.

269
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,026
Well, whenever you have a moment,

270
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:10,392
there's no hurry.
See you later.

271
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,406
Sorry about that.

272
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:15,736
So, where were we?

273
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,631
When are you gonna tell me
what happened, Dad?

274
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,682
I had a business meeting.

275
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,638
- A business meeting at a strip club?
- Yeah, that's where he wanted to go.

276
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,687
This Russell Flaherty guy,
I've known him a long time,

277
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,373
I made an investment with him
because we needed the money,

278
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,548
I needed some cash flow, so...

279
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:55,317
Deal went south
and I lost all the money, and...

280
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:58,443
I lost my temper, that's all,
I lost my temper.

281
00:19:58,568 --> 00:19:59,947
The guy had it coming to him.

282
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,260
He swindled me for the last time,
I'll tell you that.

283
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,993
I thought it was an investment.

284
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,698
Investment.
It was an investment, but...

285
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,688
Basically, he just stole my money,
is what he did.

286
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,574
- But you don't need to worry about.
- Not for me to worry about?

287
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,672
Dad, I just saw you get arraigned
for being a...

288
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,758
crazy drunk man at a strip club.
How am I not gonna worry?

289
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,687
Please, explain to me.
What happened?

290
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:25,768
Listen.

291
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,922
Times have been tough,
business has not been good.

292
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:33,042
So your dad took the savings money
and made a risky investment,

293
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,593
it was stupid,
and I lost some money.

294
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:38,903
I tried to get some quick cash flow
with the savings money

295
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,947
and it didn't work out,
so basically we're in real big trouble.

296
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,921
- We're in big trouble.
- OK.

297
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,744
So I'll get a job and I'll help out
until I go to college.

298
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:50,947
- No big deal.
- I used the college money, Lyla.

299
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,297
The savings that we were keeping
for your college

300
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,972
is the money I used
for the investment.

301
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,765
And now...

302
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,698
Honey! It doesn't mean
you're not going to college,

303
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,075
I'll figure out a way to do this.

304
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,274
Lyla, don't do that.
Where're you going?

305
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,193
You're not going anywhere.
Wait a minute.

306
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,695
- Don't do this.
- Don't touch... Don't!

307
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,003
- Lyla!
- Don't! Don't touch me!

308
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,493
Lyla, honey, please don't leave me.

309
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,260
Will you please tell me
the lesson that you learned?

310
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:48,848
- Always lock the door.
- When having sex with the coach's

311
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:51,803
- daughter.
- You don't need to announce it.

312
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,688
Not that any of this really matters,
because as soon as Coach sees you,

313
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,150
that might be the end of
everything for you.

314
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,443
I'm basically looking
at a dead man walking.

315
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,696
Do not look him in the eye.

316
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:07,241
Hey, gentlemen, listen up!
Let me have your attention real quick.

317
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,454
We just got word
on Friday's game as far as the...

318
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,709
We lost the appeal on the referees,
is what I'm saying.

319
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,378
Here's what that means, gentlemen.
Means we can expect

320
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,881
a lot of miscalls and a lot
of late hits, come Friday.

321
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:25,888
But what we're not gonna do
is we are not gonna lose our tempers.

322
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,720
We will not lose
our tempers out there.

323
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,057
What we <i>are</i> gonna do
is we're gonna put our heads down

324
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,100
and we're gonna play our game
of football. Understood?

325
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,165
- Yes, sir!
- You leave the officials to me.

326
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,122
Two games...

327
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,281
- And we're in State.
- Then State.

328
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:55,236
<i>Loquacious?</i>

329
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,690
- Overly sad?
- Tal...

330
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:01,290
- Talkative?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,218
- Talkative.
- Lugubrious.

332
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:05,208
"Lugubrious" is "overly sad."

333
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:07,882
Polyphobic?

334
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,914
I'm so bored right now, Landry.

335
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,350
So bored.

336
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,353
Well, I'm sorry to bore you,
but we really need to...

337
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:20,564
You're not boring me,
this vocabulary is boring me.

338
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:24,652
Do you want a coke? I can make us
sandwiches, I just want a break.

339
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,696
- Let's take a break.
- Actually, I've got band practice

340
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,324
in a few minutes,
so we should probably finish these.

341
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,041
- Can't they just wait for a half hour?
- No, they can't.

342
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,916
- You guys cutting a record?
- No, but I'm not gonna just...

343
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:40,203
I'm not gonna just ditch them,
so I can have a sandwich with you.

344
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:42,654
I told you that I would help you
with your vocabulary words,

345
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,529
and that's what I'm doing.

346
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:47,912
Wait. You're leaving?
Why are you getting so mad?

347
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,121
Because you keep
taking advantage of me

348
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:52,888
because you know
how I feel about you, Tyra.

349
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,992
You do it like it's nothing,
and I just let you.

350
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,399
So...

351
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,189
Where are you going?


352
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:06,211
- Are you serious?
- Have you ever read <i>The Giving Tree</i>?

353
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,832
Yeah, when I was, like, five.
Why?

354
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:12,561
It's about this tree who loves
this boy more than anything, right?

355
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,869
And the boy just takes and takes

356
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:18,144
until there's absolutely
nothing left but a stump.

357
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:26,128
And I'm like the tree and you're like
the little boy, you just take and take

358
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:28,048
and then there's absolutely
nothing left.

359
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,427
That's exactly what I feel like,
just a stump.

360
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,972
'Cause this is not a friendship.
You're selfish,

361
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,770
you...
It's not a friendship, OK?

362
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:57,594
I'm in a world of hurt here, Eric,
there's no doubt about it.

363
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,820
I mean, do you know
that the dadgum Landing Strip

364
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,783
is charging me $30,000 for damages?

365
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,579
$30,000? That place
isn't even worth $30,000!

366
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,921
- I don't know what to say about that.
- Listen to me,

367
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:11,796
I don't even know how I'm gonna keep
the condo, I'm so damn broke.

368
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,134
Thank you.

369
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,347
You know, and Lyla...
Lyla is gone.

370
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,202
Lyla's moved in with Riggins.

371
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:22,226
God Almighty, can you imagine
what's going on over there?

372
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:23,854
I do not understand this.

373
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,672
We're in the middle of a family crisis,
and Lyla leaves in a huff.

374
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,539
When I was in college,
I had to work my butt off.

375
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:34,156
- I had to work for the money...
- Can I tell you one thing?

376
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:39,035
Money comes and goes, yeah?

377
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,618
These kids of ours,

378
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,419
that's a one-time deal.

379
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:12,069
Would it be all right
if we had this conversation now?

380
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,869
Do you love Matt?

381
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:26,213
I love Matt.

382
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:31,755
Does he love you?

383
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,760
- Matt loves me.
- He does?

384
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:43,642
- And what about birth control?
- Mom,

385
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:47,266
- I don't wanna talk about...
- Honey, that's the conversation.

386
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,341
Yes, we're using birth control.

387
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:53,770
What kind, specifically?

388
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,067
Condoms.
We're using condoms.

389
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:04,101
- Do you know how to use them properly?
- Yes, I know how to use them.

390
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:05,664
You have to use them every time

391
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,353
'cause sometimes boys try to tell you
that you don't need them all the time.

392
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,328
Matt's really good about it.

393
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,409
And you know that, just 'cause
you're having sex this one time

394
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,215
doesn't mean that you have to
all the time, and

395
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,182
if it ever starts feeling
like he's taking it for granted,

396
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:30,565
or you're not having...

397
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,609
you're not enjoying it,
you can stop anytime.

398
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:36,932
And if you have a break-up
with Matt, it's not like,

399
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,041
you know, you have to

400
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,952
have sex with the next boy,
necessarily.

401
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,239
Why are you crying?

402
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,622
'Cause I wanted you to wait.

403
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:53,818
And that's just
'cause I wanna protect you,

404
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:57,940
'cause I love you and I wanna make sure
that nothing bad ever happens to you.

405
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:04,473
And I want you to always
be able to talk to me,

406
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:07,317
even if it's something
so hard like this.

407
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,337
I didn't want to disappoint you.

408
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:37,614
So,

409
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,573
who's the redhead
who came by the house the other day?

410
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:42,636
- Madison?
- Madison, yeah. Who's that?

411
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,763
Just a cute girl I met at school.

412
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:47,349
- She's a good girl, I like her.
- Oh yeah?

413
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:51,770
- Are you ready?
- Remember you are in the middle

414
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,806
of the playoffs, my friend.

415
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:55,381
That was a good shot.

416
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,236
Listen to me, OK? Now is not
the time to be chasing skirts.

417
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,562
- Why?
- We're talking about the Texas State

418
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,767
High School Championship.
Look at me!

419
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,034
Madison
and a bunch of girls like her

420
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,312
will be waiting in the wings
when the season is over.

421
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,934
She's not gonna sit and wait around,
she's gonna find someone else.

422
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,167
She'll sit and wait around for 50 years,
if you win the State Championship.

423
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:18,132
She'll be sitting there with bells on,
believe me. Do me a favor.

424
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:19,752
Time-out, time-out.

425
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:21,333
Look at me.

426
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,676
Look at me!

427
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,678
You're on a break with her.

428
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:27,124
She's on the back burner.
Yes?

429
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,473
I'm asking you.

430
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,811
Good.

431
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,480
To win the game.

432
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,484
- Get outta here!
- Was that in your face?

433
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:41,779
What are we doing here?

434
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,937
You ever heard
of <i>The Giving Tree</i>?

435
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:46,520
You mean the little kids' book
with the little boy and the tree?

436
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:47,839
Yeah, that one.

437
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:51,352
Landry says that I'm the selfish
little kid and he's the tree.

438
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:53,027
Can you believe that?

439
00:29:56,408 --> 00:30:00,406
- That's an awful long pause, Julie.
- OK, promise not to be mad.

440
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,258
That's just kind of
your relationship, like...

441
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:05,260
He worships the ground you walk on,

442
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,723
he does everything you say, and
you allow him to be seen with you.

443
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:12,601
That doesn't help me.

444
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,667
Oh, this is it.

445
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,847
So, if you don't think he has a point,
why are we here?

446
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,322
Proving him wrong.

447
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:21,339
Come on.

448
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:26,345
They are so good.

449
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:30,952
I've told you. You don't have a demo CD,
you don't have any press to show me...

450
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,564
These guys have...
What are these guys called again?

451
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,541
- Crucifictorious.
- Right.

452
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:38,543
Crucifictor...
Awesome!

453
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,170
They <i>are</i> awesome.

454
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,757
And they have tons of fans, I mean,
this place will be completely packed.

455
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,830
Not to mention that I'll bring
all my girlfriends, who...

456
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,327
happen to all look like her.

457
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:12,536
Take it.

458
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:15,801
You and your stupid band
are playing at TC's on Saturday,

459
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:18,503
so don't say I never did
anything for you, all right?

460
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,918
And you know what?
Don't call me selfish.

461
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:25,948
Hurts my feelings.

462
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,110
I'm just here to pick up Julie

463
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,307
to go to the movies

464
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:50,173
and then bring her right back home.

465
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,082
Come on in.

466
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,514
Thanks.

467
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,457
In fact, Coach is out in the backyard,
if you wanna go wait out there.

468
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:00,571
Go on back.

469
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,630
- He's right back there.
- OK, thanks, ma'am.

470
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,516
How's it going?

471
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:27,442
Come here.

472
00:32:50,907 --> 00:32:52,855
I know your father's in Iraq,
but if he was here,

473
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,345
I think we'd agree
on one thing, he and I...

474
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,720
the both of us.

475
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:00,014
And that is,

476
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,371
women are to be respected.

477
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:06,998
Yes, sir.

478
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:16,929
That is my daughter!

479
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:22,277
Yes, sir.

480
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:48,030
Lyla, I know you're in there,
I see your car out here.

481
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:50,694
- I'm still your daddy.
- What do you wanna do?

482
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,571
I have nothing to say to him.

483
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:54,906
Lyla, come on out.

484
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,158
Riggins, let her out of there!

485
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:01,988
I don't care if I wake up
all the neighbors, get out here.

486
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,920
I'm not leaving
till you come out here, Lyla.

487
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,406
- What do you want?
- What I want is for you to come home.

488
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,082
This is no excuse for you
to play house with your boyfriend.

489
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,104
You're gonna lecture me on morals?

490
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,827
- Honey, we can work this out.
- How're we gonna work it out?

491
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:31,625
You're $20,000 in the hole
for tearing up a strip club,

492
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,695
what are you gonna do?
Rob a bank?

493
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:36,364
You know, you're acting
like a spoiled little brat.

494
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,117
- Excuse me?
- A spoiled little brat!

495
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,119
You are old enough
to know better than this.

496
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,799
Life is complicated,
it's not a bowl of cherries,

497
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:46,499
and right now, your mother
is out there in California...

498
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,251
You don't blame this on Mom!

499
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:51,624
You are the one who cheated,
the one who threw your family away,

500
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:53,673
and I was the idiot
who stuck with you!

501
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:55,852
And you don't dare call me spoiled!

502
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,152
We've been putting that money away
since I was a baby.

503
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,347
You said if I made those grades
that it was mine,

504
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,459
and you didn't even ask!

505
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:06,144
You just do whatever you want
and wonder why everybody hates you.

506
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:11,066
I'm not through, do not walk in there!
Get back out here!

507
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:21,368
Tim Riggins, I'm gonna talk
to my daughter, young man.

508
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,040
Not right now.

509
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,748
Tim, who the hell
do you think you are, son?

510
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:30,421
- That's my daughter over there!
- You need to go.

511
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,230
Please.

512
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:59,368
See you after the game, OK?

513
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,390
You know, maybe we...

514
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:07,621
Maybe we should just
lay off for a while.

515
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,647
Yo, man, what the hell
is that kid doing?

516
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:14,339
He's throwing away a nice
piece of tail, is what he's doing.

517
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,848
I bet his daddy told him to do it, man.
He split hard, dude.

518
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,297
I said I love redheads.

519
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,542
McCoy!

520
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,281
Way to go, Romeo!

521
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,205
- What?
- You...

522
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:36,677
You dropped that gal?

523
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,901
I don't know, kinda...

524
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:41,868
'Cause I'll tell you what,
you know what's good before a game?

525
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,504
Getting laid, a lot.
You know what I mean?

526
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,231
- That's not happening.
- Why?

527
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:49,153
My dad.

528
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,862
So let me get this straight,
you just

529
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:55,337
ended that whole thing with her
because of your old man?

530
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:57,670
Well... sorta.

531
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:00,381
How do you expect
anyone of these guys to battle

532
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:03,676
for you every night if you can't make
a decision like that on your own?

533
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,458
'Cause you know
you're a leader, right?

534
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:09,261
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

535
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,352
Start acting like one.

536
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,597
There he goes again!

537
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:55,440
They're not playing your own flag,
come on, Billy!

538
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,188
Come on, open your eyes!

539
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,341
<i>Tim Riggins gains a solid five,
before getting leveled by Ossum.</i>

540
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:03,677
<i>Sure looked like
another late hit by the Bisons.</i>

541
00:38:03,802 --> 00:38:05,905
<i>The Panthers have yet
to get a call tonight.</i>

542
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:07,114
Hold up!

543
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,159
- Oh, yeah!
- You good?

544
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:10,868
I needed that!

545
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,575
These dudes have been playing dirty
all night, what are we gonna do?

546
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,665
Suck it up, 5-2!
Let's go, call something, 1-2.

547
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,417
- 8, 27, Tiger, on one! Ready?
- Break!

548
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,051
<i>Just under 2 minutes to go
on the half</i>

549
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,259
<i>and things are getting
pretty ugly out there, folks.</i>

550
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,306
<i>Buckley is using
every dirty trick in the book,</i>

551
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:36,185
<i>and there's been a noticeable absence
of yellow laundry on that field tonight.</i>

552
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:39,107
<i>McCoy fires across the middle,
he's got Saracen!</i>

553
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:42,642
<i>That has got to be
pass interference.</i>

554
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:43,901
What is that?

555
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,448
How can you not see that?

556
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:49,182
You gotta be kidding me!
You gotta be kidding!

557
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,741
How can you not see that?

558
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,244
What do I gotta do
to get you to throw a flag tonight?

559
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,372
<i>Taylor is absolutely livid
on the sideline!</i>

560
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:59,333
<i>I mean, he is inconsolable,
and I can't blame him, folks.</i>

561
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,210
That stupid idiot!

562
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:05,047
<i>J.D. McCoy back to pass, he fires!</i>

563
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:08,972
<i>Late hit, roughing the passer,
oh my!</i>

564
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:11,053
How can you not see that?

565
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,573
- What is that, ref?
- Come on!

566
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,599
What? Come on!

567
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:18,456
You know what you are,
you're a no-calling son of a bitch!

568
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,147
That's what you are! Billy,
you're a no-calling son of a bitch!

569
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,774
- You want a flag? 
- Yeah, give me a damn flag!

570
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:27,569
Let me see it, I wanna see it, I'll do
anything to see you pull a damn flag!

571
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:29,780
I'd love to see...
Oh good, that's great!

572
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,036
That's great!
Here, you take your flag.

573
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:37,705
You're gone, you are gone!

574
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,832
<i>And Coach Taylor is gone, folks!</i>

575
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,391
<i>He has been ejected
from this contest.</i>

576
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,791
<i>He's handing the reins over
to Wade Aikmen,</i>

577
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,616
<i>and he will have to sit the rest
of this game in the locker room.</i>

578
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:01,415
<i>Wade Aikmen has taken over the offense.
Now, he's been a quarterback,</i>

579
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,449
- How you doing?
- <i>played a lot of college ball,</i>

580
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:06,076
<i>he's been with Coach Taylor all season,
so he should be fine.</i>

581
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,819
<i>Ball has definitely landed
in his court, it's a hot one.</i>

582
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,530
<i>He's bringing the Panthers out,
let's see what he's got.</i>

583
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:17,328
- Hello?
- <i>They're stacking the linebackers,</i>

584
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,163
have Riggins on the sweep.

585
00:40:20,194 --> 00:40:21,082
Coach?

586
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,568
You hear me now?

587
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:25,544
Can you hear me? I said,
they're stacking the linebackers.

588
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,505
I can't hear you, Coach!

589
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:37,428
Good!

590
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,896
- <i>7, 27 come on, go! Get out there!</i>
- Hello?

591
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,770
Get in there, get over there!

592
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:46,649
Coach, I'll call you back,
I can't hear you.

593
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:50,731
<i>Wade Aikmen's inspired play-calling</i>

594
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:53,768
<i>has put the Panthers
deep in Bison territory.</i>

595
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:57,493
<i>McCoy looking to pass,
oh no, and he is sacked!</i>

596
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:01,055
<i>And that is gonna be
a seven-yard loss on the play.</i>

597
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,791
<i>The clock is rolling, folks.
Panthers down by 3,</i>

598
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,850
<i>they cannot afford to make
any mistakes at this point.</i>

599
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,380
<i>Here we go!
J.D. McCoy is rolling left,</i>

600
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,680
<i>he fires back,
it's a screen play to Riggins.</i>

601
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:15,136
<i>He's got room, he's to the twenty,</i>

602
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,681
<i>to the fifteen,
to the ten, to the five...</i>

603
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,955
<i>Big Tim Riggins powers in!</i>

604
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,519
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

605
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:25,588
<i>Oh, mercy my!</i>

606
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,754
<i>This one is over, folks!
Panthers win,</i>

607
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,465
<i>Panthers win!</i>

608
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:34,071
You got scotch in here?

609
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,840
<i>You really gotta hand it
to Coach Wade Aikmen, folks.</i>

610
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:56,814
<i>He did a fantastic job,
under some terrible circumstances.</i>

611
00:41:56,939 --> 00:42:00,639
<i>A bright shining star
on the Dillon football horizon.</i>

612
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,090
Well, he's in bed, sound asleep.

613
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:07,741
Thank you.

614
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:09,909
You sound a little disappointed.

615
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:12,359
Yeah, I was kinda hoping
he might be out on a date.

616
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:14,545
That's not gonna happen.

617
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,483
We had a...
We had a little chat.

618
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,034
You did?

619
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:22,129
- Yeah.
- When?

620
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,558
Just the other day.

621
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:28,959
He saw the wisdom
on waiting until we won State...

622
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:32,048
You gotta quit making these unilateral
decisions without including me.

623
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,380
{\- Sweetie.
- }No, I am his mother.

624
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,716
- I know, but it's not such a big deal
- It is!

625
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:39,194
to take a break and then Mercedes
or Madison or whatever her name is,

626
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:41,300
she will be there
when the season is over.

627
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,807
You're really starting to freak me out,
I don't like it!

628
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,810
- What's the big deal? He takes a break
- This football thing's freaking me out!

629
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:50,356
from a girl who's distracting him from
the most important games of his life.

630
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,359
It's all football,
football, football, isn't it?

631
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:01,700
- What?
- Nothing.

632
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,035
Oh, man.

633
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:06,418
- What did you see out there?
- Nothing, I didn't see anything.

634
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:07,651
Excuse me.

635
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:11,845
Is that...?

636
00:43:14,684 --> 00:43:16,006
That little bastard!

637
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:26,976
Is this gonna be really bad?
'Cause I'm...

638
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:31,063
- I'm a little nervous.
- There is a strong, strong possibility.

639
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:35,985
Hey, everybody, we're Crucifictorious.
Thank you for coming out.

640
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,656
They're not that bad.

641
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,585
Landry's kinda cute up there...

642
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:14,505
Yeah, I know.

643
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:53,658
<i>Lyla?</i>

644
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:55,826
<i>It's me,</i>

645
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:58,057
<i>your dad.</i>

646
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,678
Please call me back.

647
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:01,979
I'm sorry.

648
00:45:05,532 --> 00:45:07,220
You were right, Lyla.

649
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,789
And I'm very, very sorry.

650
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,781
Please,

651
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:15,759
call me back, please.

652
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:18,892
I love you very, very much.

653
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,188
I love you, honey.

654
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:25,713
Bye.

655
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,625
Did you know that your dad
called my parents last night?

656
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,003
He said that I was
a negative influence on you.

657
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:42,463
What?

658
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,298
Do you think
I'm a negative influence?

659
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,387
- What's going on between the 2 of you?
- This is a whole lot bigger than you.

660
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,307
So if you don't wanna know,
don't ask.

661
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,475
Oh, my God!

662
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:57,686
Grandma, are you OK?
