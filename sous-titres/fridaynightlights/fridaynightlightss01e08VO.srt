1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,757
You and Timmy see a lot
of each other other now?

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:04,202
No, not really.

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:06,615
Something's up.
I can smell it.

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,024
I kind of think she might

5
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,143
be sleeping with my best friend.

6
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:10,382
Oh, wow!

7
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:11,912
You must be feeling
the pressure then.

8
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:13,630
Grady Hunt in the house.

9
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:14,461
Who?

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,770
Mr. Hunt's been scouting
high school ball

11
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,042
since before we were born.

12
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:18,262
Don't I got what it takes?

13
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:20,219
Hard to say yet
on strength and size.

14
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:25,570
On a night when we all expected
Smash Williams to shine,

15
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,010
it is Tim Riggins
who's stepped up.

16
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:31,511
Come on, baby.
You got game, Phil.

17
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:32,721
I'm coming.

18
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:39,653
Look, Jack--

19
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:41,362
I'm sorry I misfiled that invoice.

20
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,462
But I can get those--

21
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,512
I can get those drill bits
out to Rusty.

22
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:45,560
They can't--

23
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:46,933
My point is that there's no one else

24
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:48,153
that they can go to by that time.

25
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,231
There's no way that they can get it delivered

26
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:50,511
by Monday. It's $2.

27
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:52,102
What do you mean Lawerty already did?

28
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:53,233
That's impossible.

29
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,340
Back!

30
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:55,831
No, Sir.

31
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:57,520
Yes, Sir.

32
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:00,990
Come on.

33
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:03,862
Whoa, whoa, whoa--
You're kidding me, right?

34
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,462
No, you gotta start
eating better.

35
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:07,412
Why?

36
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:09,631
'Cause you had a hell
of a game this past week. All right?

37
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,623
We need to feed the beast.
Keep it up.

38
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,892
I'm not joking about this.

39
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:16,920
$96.50.

40
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:18,573
Uh...

41
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:20,061
Take that back.

42
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:22,413
And these and this.

43
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,310
$84.23.

44
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,732
I'll get this though.

45
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:28,092
No, you're not.
Put that back.

46
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,850
- This too, please.
- I am not paying for that.

47
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:30,933
We do not have money for that.

48
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,363
Put it back.
Billy, you got peas.

49
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,432
Why can't I get what I want?

50
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:34,582
We're not taking that.

51
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:36,063
Boys, boys--

52
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,142
I'll buy the damn magazine
if it comes down to it. Okay?

53
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,060
Billy, you go ahead.

54
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm gonna get a ride from, uh...

55
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,663
Tyra.

56
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,233
Feel that?

57
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:07,490
Yeah.

58
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,651
How about this?

59
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:15,561
You feel that?

60
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,751
No.

61
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,341
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,570
I gotta ask you something.

63
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,290
Okay.

64
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:43,892
Is there something happening
between you and Riggins?

65
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:48,830
No!

66
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,350
Why would you even say that, Jason?

67
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,493
'Cause I saw you in the parking lot

68
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:54,610
the other night.

69
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,733
You saw us?

70
00:02:58,246 --> 00:02:59,423
Doing what?

71
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,701
I don't know.

72
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:10,030
No--
Nothing, I guess.

73
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,530
That's crazy.

74
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,550
I love you.
Okay.

75
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,103
Okay.
Jason, you know that.

76
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,573
- Don't you?
- I do.

77
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:21,952
I just had to ask.
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,470
-  I love you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

79
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,682
I love--

80
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,692
And I'm here.

81
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm right here.

82
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,141
Okay.

87
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,601
Whoever told you
to take Nandro was an idiot.

88
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,063
What you need is Oxymetholone.

89
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,050
And you need to stack it with Boldenone.

90
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,461
Is this gonna show up on a drug test?

91
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,692
And how's it gonna affect
my personal life, I mean--

92
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,372
If you're that concerned
about your love life,

93
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,532
maybe you need to get
your priorities straight.

94
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,472
All right, how much?

95
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,093
- 300.
- A month?

96
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,252
Try a week.

97
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,151
All right, can I pay you
next week?

98
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:55,962
You're good for it.

99
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,153
$1,200.

100
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,643
You know, you've lost your mind.

101
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:02,521
Momma, come on.

102
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,583
- I need it for SAT prep course.
- Mm-hmm.

103
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:05,733
Think about it like this--

104
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,892
If I nail my SATs
and get my college scholarship,

105
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,841
you'll be saving yourself thousands.

106
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:11,673
I'm gonna say this

107
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,002
as plain as I know how.

108
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,981
I ain't got no $1,200.

109
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,602
How about you try studying for your SATs
the old-fashioned way?

110
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,550
Quit runnin' around
with them fast-tail gals

111
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,220
and get your lazy ass upstairs 
and start reading.

112
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,451
- Momma--

113
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,182
How's that for your SAT prep course?

114
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,060
I wouldn't come asking

115
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,881
for something like this
if I didn't need it.

116
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,242
Now, look. They tutor you.

117
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,431
They give you practice tests
and quizzes.

118
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,790
And teach you tips
you can't teach yourself.

119
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,033
I need help, Momma.

120
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,682
Please.

121
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,290
Get in there.
Yeah, that's it!

122
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:53,720
Nice work, Smash! 

123
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:54,360
Let's group!

124
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:56,370
Keep drivin' now!
Drive him, drive him!

125
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:58,590
Attaboy!

126
00:05:58,828 --> 00:05:59,643
Coach Taylor.

127
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:01,280
Coach Taylor.

128
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,343
Hey,  Billy.

129
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:03,211
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

130
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,792
Good to see you again.
How's everything going?

131
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,072
Good. Team's looking good.

132
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,571
Yeah,  I'm trying to keep 'em honest.

133
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,633
Coach, I was wondering

134
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:11,970
if I could talk to you
for a minute.

135
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,900
They had a hell of a game
last week, didn't they?

136
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,362
- Yes, they did.
- Hey, Steve!

137
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,203
We were kind of wondering
if we should start looking

138
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,731
into applying for school
applications and such.

139
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,530
We hadn't really considered it
before, but...

140
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:23,560
Coach...

141
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,573
I know there were scouts there last week.

142
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,971
And I'm not really sure
what we're supposed

143
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,080
to do in this kind of situation.

144
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,652
But if it means a future for him...

145
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,862
Hey, I'll tell you what.

146
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,439
You and Tim come out to dinner.

147
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,103
I'll talk to Tami, get the time.

148
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:40,602
- All right?
- Thank you, sir.

149
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:41,750
- Yeah.
- I appreciate it.

150
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:42,911
- All right.
- All right. Take care

151
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:44,221
Hey, Mike!

152
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:45,961
Get off the line.

153
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:46,900
Come on now!

154
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,360
Well, it looks like you missed
the first PSAT test date.

155
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,833
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:53,951
Oh, no, sweetie.
It's okay.

157
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:56,250
I mean, there's another one
coming up before Christmas.

158
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,360
You can do it then.

159
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:58,641
Do you have any ideas

160
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,610
what electives
you're interested in doing?

161
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,642
Do you have a sense of how you
want to, kind of, proceed?

162
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:03,443
No.

163
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,541
Are you okay, April?

164
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,380
My Panther wants me
to do a three-way.

165
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,171
- Yeah, and--
- Hey, you know what?

166
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,701
I'm just gonna close this door.

167
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:26,791
He says that
all the Rally girls do it.

168
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,270
You know, I know a ton who have.

169
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,830
I just, I--

170
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:31,200
I haven't.

171
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,183
But I really like him.

172
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,543
And, uh--

173
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,360
And he says that if I do it,

174
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,930
I'll be his girlfriend, so...

175
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,063
Matt, that's the thing--
You're not listening to me.

176
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,703
If you look at a girl
like a geometry proof,

177
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,280
the answer is just right in front of you.

178
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,562
It's your job to find
the missing variable.

179
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,833
You gotta solve for x.

180
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,441
Yeah, um, that's actually algebra.

181
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,552
Well, that's actually
not the point.

182
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:00,672
All right, y'all.

183
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,611
Do you want to go inside and eat?

184
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:03,892
- No, no, no-
- It's cool.

185
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,080
You're gonna go get it?

186
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,261
You want me to help you?

187
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,663
No, I'm good.

188
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:11,360
I'd like my social status
to stay intact.

189
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,391
Oh, hey.

190
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:13,960
Heads up, Matt.

191
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,052
All right.

192
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,580
I'm just trying to make you look okay.

193
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:17,711
Fix your hat.

194
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,203
Sharpen your pencil, buddy.

195
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,841
Pop quiz.

196
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,510
Hey!

197
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:24,661
Hey!

198
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,761
Um, uh, yeah...

199
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:28,733
Can I get three burgers,
two fries,

200
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:31,052
and three chocolate swizzlers?

201
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,572
Sounds like you're pretty hungry.

202
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:36,392
No, just really, really depressed.

203
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,023
Maybe you should get
some more fries.

204
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,060
Uh, it's gonna be $16.45.

205
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:43,992
Here you go.

206
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,560
Have you, um...

207
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,701
You haven't maybe
thought about, um...

208
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:52,261
Maybe what I'd asked you
the other night--

209
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:53,582
About maybe going out?

210
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:54,823
Uh-- Yeah, yeah.

211
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,602
Um, I'm considering it.

212
00:08:58,657 --> 00:08:59,862
Considering.

213
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:02,480
I--I just--

214
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:03,682
- No, no. That's great.

215
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:05,771
Um...
You know what happened to me today?

216
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:06,533
No.

217
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,000
This girl comes into my office.

218
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,602
Tells me she's contemplating
having a three-way

219
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,000
with a Dillon Panther.

220
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:14,752
She's a Rally girl.

221
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,031
Apparently,  it was suggested to her

222
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:17,311
that that might be part
of her duties

223
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:18,420
as a Rally girl.

224
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:23,231
Girl's a sophomore.

225
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,082
Well, you know what?
Our daughter's a sophomore.

226
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,752
- Oh, come on. Stop that.
- I mean, she's in there--

227
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,462
Stop that.
Our daughter reads Melville.

228
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,033
The only thing
she hates more than football

229
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,810
are football players themselves.
Stop that.

230
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:37,842
I'm just saying.

231
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,032
What do you need money for,
anyway?

232
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:41,111
Look, Noannie--

233
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,112
A man needs money.

234
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:45,131
- Hey, Mattie.
- What's going on?

235
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,952
What's up, baby?
Looking sharp in that hat.

236
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:48,562
Oh, man. Shut up.

237
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,042
Yeah, pimpin', pimpin'.

238
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:54,742
Listen, how long you been
workin' here?

239
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,312
I don't know.
About a year or so.

240
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,460
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:01,380
Brian!

242
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:02,581
Can we order?

243
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,690
I'm gonna deal with you
in one second.

244
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:07,680
How much money do you make
working here?

245
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,553
Everybody just starts out
at minimum wage, so...

246
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay, okay.

247
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,540
You think you can get
the Smash an application?

248
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:17,370
For real.

249
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,480
Yeah, I'll just talk to the manager.

250
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:20,312
Go talk to him.

251
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:21,651
I'll be right back.

252
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,370
Be serious, Brian.

253
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:25,591
You walkin' home.

254
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,382
Hi.

255
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,013
Hi.

256
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,393
He knows.

257
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:48,922
What?

258
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:50,563
Tim, he knows.

259
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,040
Jason knows.

260
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:00,613
Does he know because you told him?

261
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:01,760
No.

262
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,501
- He asked me.
- Well, I didn't tell him.

263
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:04,560
He asked me if something happened 

264
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:05,382
and I said no, but--

265
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,711
Then there's nothing else to do.

266
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:07,852
We're done.

267
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:09,800
You called it off, so it's off.

268
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:10,980
As far as I'm concerned,

269
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,691
you're Jay's girl and always have been.

270
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:14,151
So let's move on.

271
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,630
How?

272
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,181
Hey,  Lyla.

273
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:21,663
Hi.

274
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:23,843
How's Jason doing?

275
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,421
He's good.

276
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:27,840
He's real good.

277
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,043
Um, I just actually came by

278
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,980
to invite Tim.

279
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:33,633
Jason's doing a scrimmage thing

280
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,180
this Thursday at the center.

281
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,220
That's really sweet.

282
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,100
Yeah.

283
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,933
- Thanks for letting me know.
- Yeah, see ya.

284
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:46,940
Real nice of you to stop by.

285
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,712
The best one was that
i had this cigarette.

286
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:03,970
So I slap it out of his hand.

287
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,533
He leans into me.
He gets real close.

288
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:08,280
Right in his nose.

289
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,043
Blood everywhere, I bet.

290
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,432
Midget, toss you out the window.

291
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:21,992
Oh!
You tell the boys here

292
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,600
that I'm gonna come scrimmage
on Thursday?

293
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,110
I'm ready.

294
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,240
I told you I'm ready.

295
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,692
Jason, you're not ready.

296
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:31,760
Phil, come on.

297
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,360
Everyday it's about how great

298
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,232
my progress has been.

299
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:35,483
And how unusual I am.

300
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,800
What's the worst that could happen, huh?

301
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,240
I fall out of my chair,
break my neck--oh, wait.

302
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:39,531
That already happened,
didn't it?

303
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,211
You could tear your rotator cuff.

304
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,120
You can get a concussion.

305
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:44,890
Worst case scenario,

306
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,060
our fusion's still healing.

307
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:49,293
You don't seem to know
what that means,

308
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:50,623
so let me spell it out for you.

309
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,090
Those little bits of bone
are all that's protecting

310
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:54,883
your spinal cord at your injury sight.

311
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,461
You know how you can use your hands?

312
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,161
Screw up your fusion--

313
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,343
No more grip. Then what?

314
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,453
I want you to think
long and hard about this

315
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:04,953
before you do it.

316
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,793
You're really moving me, Phil.

317
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:12,993
If you hadn't noticed, we are crippled.

318
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,103
Kicking a boy while he's down.

319
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:15,381
Captain Bringdown!

320
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,530
I don't know why I do this.

321
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,682
Captain Bringdown,let's show
that super speed you got.

322
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,443
Lyla!

323
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:27,823
Hey, Lyla.

324
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,060
Hey, sweetie.
How are you?

325
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,380
- I'm good.
- Good. You know, I was wondering,

326
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,302
Would you mind
just telling your mom

327
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:36,851
I am not even halfway through
"The Secret Life of Bees"--

328
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:39,693
Sweetheart...

329
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,912
I'm sorry--

330
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,013
Is it over with you and Tim Riggins?

331
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,653
- Yes.
- Is it, really?

332
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:51,633
Yes, absolutely.

333
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,203
Can I give you a piece of advice?

334
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:55,580
Yeah, please.

335
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:01,631
Jason Street has been hurt...

336
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,483
worse than he has been
in his whole life.

337
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:06,413
I know.

338
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,811
Don't you hurt him more, girl.

339
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:10,990
But--

340
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,533
You would not be telling him for him.

341
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,842
You would be telling him for you.

342
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:18,901
You let him heal.

343
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,941
You move on with your life.
You let him heal.

344
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:32,312
What do you want me
to cook for dinner

345
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,620
when the Riggins boys come over?

346
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:34,782
Should I slaughter a goat?

347
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,853
Mmm, slaughtered goat would be fine.

348
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:38,772
Hey, kiddo.

349
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,312
What do you got going on this week?

350
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,441
Um, tomorrow is Lois' birthday,

351
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:43,982
so Katie's gonna make
some red velvet cupcakes

352
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:45,680
and bring them to school.

353
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,762
Probably go into
a sugar coma at lunch.

354
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,512
And Matt Saracen
asked me out on a date.

355
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:54,702
Just putting it out there.

356
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,493
What did you say to him?

357
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:01,023
I told him I was considering.

358
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:03,260
Oh...

359
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,612
All right.

360
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:06,603
See, Smash, the key with all this

361
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,290
is really in the swirl.

362
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,830
So that then you can get
all the candy in it

363
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,061
and what not.

364
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,061
Are you getting this?

365
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:14,902
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,171
I'm putting
my own little spin to it.

367
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:17,463
No, that's the thing, though.

368
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,441
We're trying to keep product
really consistent

369
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,781
'cause our manager's a real stickler.

370
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,420
Oh, man, I think'm gonna
like this job.

371
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,282
Why? 

372
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:25,023
Hey, look.
Check this out.

373
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,093
Take notes.

374
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:28,061
Hey, how you doing?

375
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:30,080
Um, could I get
a scoop of mocha, please?

376
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,243
No.

377
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:32,650
No, no, no.

378
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:33,800
You don't want that.

379
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:34,630
R eally?

380
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,343
Look, what you want is

381
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:39,170
a chocolate-covered
mocha cup with jimmies.

382
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:40,872
All right.

383
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,492
If that's what you say I want,

384
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,051
then I'll take that.

385
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,401
All right, well--

386
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:46,740
He'll get it for you.

387
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,063
Yeah--

388
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,771
How much to I owe you?

389
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,592
It's on me.

390
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:54,162
Are you sure?

391
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:55,551
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

392
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,021
See, that's what you do.

393
00:15:58,095 --> 00:15:59,212
No, that's what you do.

394
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:01,573
You don't ask someone
what they want.

395
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:02,283
You tell them

396
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,553
what they want.

397
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:05,590
You'll learn.
You'll learn.

398
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:14,392
Jules?

399
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,661
Brought you some clean.

400
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,203
How's Faulkner?

401
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:29,630
Good.

402
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:32,603
Good.

403
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:37,342
So, uh, can I talk to you for a second.

404
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:40,691
You're just freaking out

405
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:42,030
because I got asked on a date.

406
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,782
I'm not freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.

407
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,753
I think it's great.
I think it's nice.

408
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,011
I'm just, uh...

409
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,202
- Freaking out.
- No.

410
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,141
I mean, I sit in that
counselor's chair all day,

411
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:56,532
you know and I kinda get a sense
of what goes on over there

412
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:57,801
at that school.

413
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,690
And I just want
to make sure that you've--

414
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:01,643
You know--
Are comfortable.

415
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,653
I haven't even
told him "yes" yet.

416
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,260
Okay, good.

417
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:07,860
I mean, oh...

418
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:13,000
Hey, man.
You're worse than the IRS.

419
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:15,473
hat's what your
football name should be.

420
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:16,610
"The Accountant."

421
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,100
That's funny.

422
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,112
Dammit.

423
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,150
I'm short.

424
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:22,950
Oh, yeah? By how much?

425
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:26,353
-$1.10.
-You gotta be kidding me.

426
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,713
Wait, hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

427
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,283
Come on!

428
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:55,250
You ain't got nothing on me, baby!

429
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,331
I'll get your wallet, boy!

430
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:57,290
Come on, now!

431
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,762
Ain't you got
some medals or something?

432
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:07,922
Don't feel bad.

433
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,863
I was all conference last year.

434
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:13,021
Yeah, that don't mean you're
ready to get on the court yet.

435
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,731
I'm telling you.
Phil's telling you.

436
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:17,811
Your doctor is telling you.

437
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,952
Even your cute little cheater's
telling you.

438
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,701
She didn't cheat.

439
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:29,613
Oh, now, pal...

440
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,660
You and me both know that's not true.

441
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:34,562
- She is messing with you--
- Herc--

442
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,891
And you are letting her!

443
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,332
You're just trying to hold on

444
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,163
to something that don't exist anymore.

445
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,172
You told me what you saw.

446
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:42,912
Yeah?
Well, I saw wrong, huh?

447
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,173
Oh, you saw wrong.
That's pathetic.

448
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,001
That is pretty pathetic.

449
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,700
Oh, really?
You know what's pathetic?

450
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:49,430
What's that?

451
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,463
You're little obsession with trying to get me
to break up with my girlfriend.

452
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,500
You got a little crush on me?

453
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:54,481
You think as long as you

454
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:55,921
hold on to that girlfriend--

455
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,752
The girlfriend you had
when you could walk--

456
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,460
You could avoid the reality
of being one of us.

457
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:06,200
That's got nothing to do with it.

458
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh, so you admit it?

459
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:09,303
She's cheating, huh?

460
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,850
Where you going?
You running away, all star?

461
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,003
- Leave it.
- Leave it?

462
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:14,703
- Leave it!
- Leave it?

463
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,173
- Ugh! Ow!
- Dammit, Herc! Argh!

464
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:31,083
She's all I got, man.
So quit busting my balls.

465
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,111
Just 'cause we're crippled...

466
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,551
Don't mean we have
to take the crumbs.

467
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,743
You got some secret way

468
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,422
we get back up on our chairs now?

469
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,350
Uh, yeah, I do.

470
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:55,912
Call Phil.

471
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,521
Phil!

472
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,821
Phiiiiiilll!

473
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:04,443
Phi-il!

474
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,203
Phil!

475
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,482
Phil!

476
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:15,363
Jack.

477
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,712
No, that's not fair.
I shored those orders up.

478
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,461
Well-- Ask Ailene.
She filed the paperwork.

479
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:23,933
Come on, Jack.
I am telling you right--

480
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:25,403
Yeah?

481
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,272
Well, if that's the way you feel,

482
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:26,970
you know what you can do?

483
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,642
You can just go to hell,
you son of a bitch.

484
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:30,672
Let me guess--

485
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,792
Fired again, huh?

486
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,362
Jack Gordon wouldn't know
a good salesman

487
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:35,840
if one walked up
and smacked him in the mouth.

488
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,552
Why don't you just try
selling weed again?

489
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,391
Look, that was a short-term thing, all right.

490
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,033
What the hell are you doing eating that?

491
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,593
We got dinner in fifteen minutes.

492
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,873
I'm so tired of being
the damn man of the house.

493
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:49,072
Yeah, you really are
a good role model.

494
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,211
You're go into your room.

495
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,883
Comb your hair,
wash your hands,

496
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:53,822
put on a clean shirt!

497
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,933
And run a comb through your hair
for once in your life!

498
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:56,900
Will do, bro.

499
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,923
- Hey.
- Hey.

500
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,032
Smells good.

501
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:02,851
Thank you.

502
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,390
I hope you got that ice cream

503
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,341
because this
is all I had time to prepare.

504
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:08,341
Of course I got ice cream.
It's what you just sent me out to get.

505
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:09,133
How could I forget to--

506
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:12,683
Hey, come here.
Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong?

507
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,493
I think she's on the phone
with Matt Saracen.

508
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,760
Look, you gotta stop
with this Matt Saracen thing.

509
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,613
He's a good kid.
Don't worry about it.

510
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:19,760
Just relax, would you?

511
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:20,972
You know what, honey?
He's a good kid now,

512
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,443
but he's about to become
the star quarterback

513
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:23,243
of your football team,

514
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,072
where we know they like
to just use these girls

515
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,033
- and throw them away.
- Wait a sec.

516
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:26,753
Wait a second there.

517
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,441
First of all,
she's my daughter too.

518
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,670
Second of all,
I'm not the enemy.

519
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:31,411
Don't start lumping all of us

520
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,360
- into this culture you've created.
- I'm not saying--

521
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,291
What are you talking--

522
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:35,352
I'm not creating some kind of culture.

523
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,422
All I'm saying is you can't
do anything about them.

524
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,592
But you could talk to you daughter.

525
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:40,960
It would make me feel really good

526
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,152
if you could just talk to her.

527
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,560
- Is that what you want me to do?
- From your point of view as a--

528
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:45,980
I'll talk to her.
I will talk to her.

529
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,201
If you'll relax, I will talk to her.

530
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:48,320
I'll have a talk with her tonight.

531
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,863
- Wait--
- I gotta get the door.

532
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:51,221
You look beautiful.

533
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:52,933
Now, go answer the door.
Thank you.

534
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,761
Julie, get off the phone

535
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,110
Now!

536
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,272
How's that?

537
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh, that's very good.

538
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:01,582
- Hey!
- Hi, how are you doing?

539
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:02,852
Good to see you again, Tami.

540
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:03,893
Come on in.

541
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,371
Brought you a little, um,
dinner present there.

542
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,830
Thank you, that's great.

543
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,513
Come on in, get something to drink.

544
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,020
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you all.

545
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,001
You been on break all day,
it seems like.

546
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:15,861
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
when I'm done breaking.

547
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,143
All right, you let me know.

548
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:17,973
Oh...

549
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:18,740
What?

550
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,091
This is it.
This is the one.

551
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,671
- Uh, no--
- You do this--

552
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,171
- One more time.
- Dude, it's all on you.

553
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:27,111
Come on.

554
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:28,440
All right.

555
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,612
Hi, how's it--
What can I do for you?

556
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:36,231
Can I have an Alamo burger
and a root beer?

557
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,631
Uh, no--
I don't think--

558
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,222
I don't think you really want that.

559
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:43,311
I don't?
What do you want me to have?

560
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:46,792
I don't know.
Um...

561
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:50,430
Well, you wanted root beer,
so you like root beer.

562
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:51,502
And I make a--

563
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,182
I make a mean root beer float.

564
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,140
Is that so?

565
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:55,361
Mm-hmm.

566
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,870
- Make you wanna cry.
- Yeah, it's real mean.

567
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,430
Hmm, well...

568
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:02,341
Or a sundae...
With jimmies.

569
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,612
Hmm, tempting.

570
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:05,570
All right.

571
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:08,290
But I think I'll stick
with the Alamo burger

572
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:10,613
and just a plain root beer.

573
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:13,223
Okay, well...
Maybe next time.

574
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:15,093
Oh, here.

575
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,791
The drinks are just
right over there.

576
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:17,513
Thanks.

577
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,510
All right.

578
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,881
What do you think?
Think that went all right?

579
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:21,912
Hey, it's a start.

580
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,233
Now, it wasn't the best.

581
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:26,193
But, you know,
no shame in the game.

582
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,363
Yeah, all right, cool. Thanks.

583
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:28,321
Look on the bright side.

584
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,371
At least it's pay day.

585
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:30,540
Speaking of which, um...

586
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,303
Can I sign my check over to cash?

587
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,200
Actually, you're not gonna get
a paycheck today.

588
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,970
Man, stop playing with me, man.

589
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,210
This ain't no volunteer work.

590
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:39,100
No, no, but seriously.

591
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,763
We only get paid every two weeks.

592
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,281
And because of processing
and everything

593
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,350
they're always a week behind.

594
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:45,931
So, you're probably
not going to get a check

595
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,450
'til the end of the month.

596
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:48,650
- Maybe.
- What?

597
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,250
Sorry, man.

598
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,451
Oh, no--
This ain't right, man.

599
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:55,763
But you get free ice cream.

600
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:57,143
That's good.
That's a perk.

601
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,530
No?

602
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,332
So I grab that ball
and I just start running.

603
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:01,562
And I am running and running.

604
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,633
I am chugging down that field

605
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:04,032
and the whole entire crowd
is going nuts.

606
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:05,573
People were standing up and screaming.

607
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:06,763
I couldn't even hear anything.

608
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,320
I get all the way into the end zone.

609
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:10,520
After I throw the ball down
I realize--

610
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:11,773
I went the wrong damn way.

611
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:13,753
Oh, no!

612
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:16,052
That's an awful story.

613
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,643
Mmm, that's really nice.

614
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:20,533
Truth is I was never

615
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:21,683
much of a player.

616
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:22,982
Not like my little brother here.

617
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,161
He's got the gift.

618
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,001
He's good, he's good.

619
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:27,572
So, Coach, uh...

620
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:29,412
You think he's got a shot
at college ball?

621
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,322
Keeps playing the way he does, yeah.

622
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:34,372
I like to hear that.
Right, Tim?

623
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:36,341
You bet.

624
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:39,410
Do both parents live here
in Dillon?

625
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,543
Dad is down in Corpus Christi

626
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:44,540
He's working on a driving range..

627
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,823
Doesn't get home
a whole heck of a lot.

628
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,511
- He's a real hard worker, the old man.
- Yeah...

629
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:50,770
Shagging golf balls for a living--

630
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:52,860
It's real important work.

631
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:55,133
What I meant was...

632
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:00,613
He sends checks pretty often, so...

633
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:01,560
That'd be twice.

634
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:03,921
Two checks in six years.

635
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:10,991
So, what are you looking to do now?

636
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:12,461
Whattaya got going on, Bill?

637
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:13,770
You know what I've been looking into

638
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:15,150
is, um, real estate.

639
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,562
Real estate, yeah?

640
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:17,750
I've been in sales for years,

641
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,883
so I figured once I get
my real estate license,

642
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,603
I'll be selling the biggest things--

643
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,001
Dammit, Tim!

644
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:26,042
Um, sorry.

645
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:27,513
You know, the Riggins boys

646
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,472
came over for dinner last night.

647
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:31,802
You and Tim, you're still best friends,

648
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:32,871
aren't you?

649
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,251
I guess so.

650
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:36,580
You guess so?

651
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,260
Parents did a number
on those kids, that's for sure.

652
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:42,561
Yeah, well...

653
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,561
Everyone's got a sad story.

654
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,223
Doesn't excuse anything.

655
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,210
He played a hell of a game Friday.

656
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:53,331
I'll tell you that.

657
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,073
He'll make something of himself

658
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,061
If he doesn't become his own worst enemy.

659
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:58,403
So, uh...

660
00:25:58,617 --> 00:25:59,780
See these two cones behind me?

661
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,692
That's the goal line.

662
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:03,492
Why don't you try and get across it?

663
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:15,680
All right.

664
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:21,450
Try it again.

665
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:24,350
Everyone says
I'm not ready for this game.

666
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,730
Everyone says I shouldn't be
at the scrimmage tonight.

667
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:28,280
Doctors, parents...

668
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,611
Why, what--

669
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,842
What do you say?

670
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:36,032
I say I am ready.

671
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:38,390
I don't know, it's just--

672
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:39,653
My whole life I've been
thinking about football.

673
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,811
Football, football, football--
That's all.

674
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,170
Nothing else.

675
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:46,642
Think about what it
used to feel like.

676
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:47,951
Be able to compete,

677
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:49,150
be able to be a part
of something, you know?

678
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,441
I feel like...

679
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,672
Like that whole part of me
is just empty now.

680
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:53,970
It's just gone.

681
00:26:58,847 --> 00:26:59,920
Maybe they're right.

682
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,593
Maybe it's too soon.

683
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:07,702
16 years ago,

684
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:09,430
I wasn't ready to be a father,
I can tell you that.

685
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:10,791
I wasn't ready
for the responsibility.

686
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,780
You cannot be prepared
for something like that.

687
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,880
Believe me.

688
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,520
But you grab the bull
by the horns and you move on.

689
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,093
You...

690
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:23,903
No 17-year-old kid
should have to go through

691
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:25,311
what you're going through right now.

692
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,643
No, stop!

693
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,223
You're dealing with it.

694
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,303
You're doing what
you're supposed to do.

695
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:32,813
You're being a man about it.

696
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,780
Go with your heart.

697
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:39,633
Go with your heart.

698
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:06,780
Hey...
Smash...

699
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:07,812
It's all there.

700
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:09,552
You're good to go.

701
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,101
Hey, what's going on?

702
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:15,962
Hey, chill, Mattie.

703
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:17,360
No, no, no-
I vouched for you, okay?

704
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:18,541
Then I see you
messing with the drawer.

705
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:19,453
What's your problem?

706
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:20,801
Look, there ain't no problem.

707
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,243
But if you want to find a problem--

708
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:23,173
No, seriously--

709
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,063
If you lose this job,
I lose my job

710
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,383
because I vouched for you...

711
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,321
'Cause I thought I was
vouching for my friend.

712
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:31,850
Hey, look--
I had a bad game.

713
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,172
- So?
- I had a bad week.

714
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,932
Did you know that there was
a scout there last Friday?

715
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:38,213
Yeah.

716
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:39,850
Well, can you think
of one thing I did

717
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,582
to distinguish myself on the field?

718
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:44,911
Yeah.

719
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:46,273
But that was just one game.

720
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,490
Yeah, well I can't have
another one like it.

721
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:50,471
All right,
I can't afford it.

722
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:53,802
What do you need
all that money for?

723
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,193
I don't need it!

724
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:57,650
I thought I did,
but I don't, okay?

725
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:59,670
I see things
a little more clearly today.

726
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,341
How's your dating situation going?

727
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:11,043
Good.

728
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:16,262
I take it,
by that limited response...

729
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:20,743
You don't think
it's any of my business.

730
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:33,182
All right, listen up.

731
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:38,811
I'm supposed to give you

732
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:42,273
some fatherly and wise advice

733
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:44,150
at this time in your life.

734
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,600
Listen up.

735
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:51,120
If you're wondering
if a boy's thinking about you,

736
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:52,800
he's not.

737
00:29:52,986 --> 00:29:54,430
He's thinking about sex
or he's hungry.

738
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:55,793
Those are the only two options.

739
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:56,713
Are you trying to be funny?

740
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:57,562
No, I'm not finished.
Listen to me.

741
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:59,082
Boys think about sex

742
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:01,142
every single minute of the day.

743
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:02,213
That's what they do.

744
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,483
That's why they lie.

745
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:06,060
They're gonna leave you
waiting around for them to call.

746
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,552
And they won't call.

747
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:10,871
They're gonna be cruel
and they're gonna be misleading.

748
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:14,660
And your mother wanted me
to add this:

749
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:15,723
That, by and large,

750
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:17,611
football players
are the worst offenders.

751
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:20,592
However, I think that it
pretty much crosses all lines.

752
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:23,043
Are you done?

753
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:28,373
You are beautiful.
You are sensitive.

754
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:30,760
You are sweet, and I don't want
to see you get hurt.

755
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,783
I love you too, Dad.

756
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:37,061
You're a lousy ping pong player
though.

757
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:55,170
You mind?

758
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:56,112
I just cleaned up.

759
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:57,070
Least you could do

760
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:58,163
is put your crap in your own room

761
00:30:58,225 --> 00:30:59,202
and let it fester there.

762
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:01,162
Maybe you should just
get a job as a maid.

763
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:02,051
Yeah, maybe.

764
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:04,113
Least I'd have a marketable skill,

765
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:05,042
unlike you.

766
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:06,103
I mean, when you graduate--

767
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,790
If you graduate,

768
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:08,932
you'll be lucky if you can get

769
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,090
a job pumping gas.

770
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,351
Then again,
maybe Tyra will support you.

771
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:15,811
She's a real go-getter.

772
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,352
That don't bother you none, huh?

773
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:22,230
Trying to get second helpings
from my girl?

774
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,441
That's pretty sick,
to be honest with you.

775
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:26,200
Yeah?

776
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:27,552
I'm a real loser, aren't I, Tim?

777
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,533
Let me ask you a question.

778
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:29,602
Which one of us is banging

779
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,631
his crippled best friend's
girl friend right now?

780
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,640
That would be you, wouldn't it?

781
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:36,171
How's that real estate license coming?

782
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,672
You sell any condos today?

783
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:39,990
What's gonna happen to you, Tim?

784
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,362
You know what I see?

785
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:43,952
Another 40 pounds
and delinquent child support.

786
00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:45,393
Remind you of anyone?
Maybe Dad?

787
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,782
What's your problem with Dad, now?

788
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,160
What's my problem with Dad?

789
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,222
Yeah.

790
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:54,291
What's my problem with Dad?

791
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:56,540
What is your problem with Dad?

792
00:31:56,587 --> 00:31:57,621
What's my problem with Dad?

793
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:02,421
You want to know what my problem
with Dad is, Tim?

794
00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:05,492
You want to know
what my problem with Dad is!

795
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,253
God, Nick, I admire the guy.

796
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:09,663
Couple postcards every year,

797
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,422
and he gets off scott-free.

798
00:32:11,506 --> 00:32:12,690
Not me, though.

799
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:14,140
No, I get stuck with you

800
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:16,122
because nobody else wants you!

801
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,092
When's the last time
you heard from Mom or Dad?

802
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:21,453
Been a while, hasn't it?

803
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:23,123
Don't you forget, you little bastard--

804
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:24,701
I'm the one paying the bills
around here.

805
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:25,643
Buying the groceries.

806
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,382
Going out there and watching
your damn football games.

807
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,151
Not them!

808
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:39,902
Ow, you're pulling my hair!

809
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:41,582
Get off of me!

810
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:44,703
Get up!

811
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:49,861
You were never a real football player

812
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:50,681
and you know it.

813
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:51,881
Yeah, you're right.

814
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:53,591
You got more talent than I ever had.

815
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:56,591
And I got to sit here every day

816
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,242
and watch you throw it away.

817
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,772
And it makes me sick!

818
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,211
You're not my father.

819
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:07,501
You're worse than no father.

820
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:09,823
I'd be better off alone.

821
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,710
Go ahead and walk away.

822
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:15,473
Just like Dad!

823
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:31,950
You ready, Sparky?
You better be.

824
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,213
Get that ball!
Get it! Yeah!

825
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:13,883
That's what a QB does, huh?

826
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,083
Go, Street.

827
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:23,850
What you got!
You ain't got nothing!

828
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,302
How's that ground taste?
Feel pretty good?

829
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,933
Let's go!
Let's go!

830
00:34:42,107 --> 00:34:43,302
Come on, baby!

831
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:12,412
Yeah, Baby!
Yeah!

832
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:09,243
Did you talk to her?

833
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:10,473
- Yeah.
- And?

834
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:13,082
And, contrary to popular opinion,

835
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,101
I'm very good at communicating
with women folk.

836
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:18,422
Sweetheart, that is ridiculous.

837
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:19,950
Now, tell me what happened.

838
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm telling you.

839
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:23,412
You can rest easy.

840
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:26,333
She has now received
fatherly advice.

841
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,123
Are you sure--
Okay.

842
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:29,942
So, it's pretty obvious
that both of you

843
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:32,731
have a sudden, weird
curiosity in my social life.

844
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:34,260
So, in interest of full disclosure,

845
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,723
I would like to tell both of you

846
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:37,620
that I'm going on a date
with Matt Saracen.

847
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,581
Time and place to be announced.

848
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:40,522
Good night.

849
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:45,551
Good night, hon.

850
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:46,930
Good night, sweetheart.

851
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:57,463
* What a friend we have in Jesus *

852
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:04,991
* All our sins and griefs to bear *

853
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:12,720
* What a privilege to carry *

854
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:18,993
* Everything to God in prayer *

855
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,970
Come on, let's give God 
a handclap and pray.

856
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,131
Give him a hand.

857
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,031
Before we begin our Bible study,

858
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:28,513
there are some special prayer
requests that we have.

859
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:30,590
And I want us all to be praying

860
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,482
for these particular people.

861
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,453
Brother Moses London

862
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:36,211
is suffering with shingles.

863
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:38,263
And we pray that God

864
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,682
will give him a speedy recovery.

865
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:40,523
Amen.

866
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:42,671
Amen.

867
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,443
We also have
another prayer request

868
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,182
for a young leader
in our community.

869
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,883
He's a young man who shows determination

870
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:50,812
to be a scholar athlete.

871
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:54,383
Because he's so determined
to finish his education,

872
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:56,731
he's gonna need
a low financial assistance

873
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,802
because of exams
that he's gonna have to take.

874
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:01,350
And so what I want us to do

875
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:03,082
is to show this young man

876
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,842
that if you will humble yourself,

877
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:06,362
make your request known,

878
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,393
that God will provide
your every need.

879
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,761
Yes, yes!

880
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:15,181
I believe in this young man,

881
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:16,971
so I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor

882
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:21,082
and sow a generous seed
into this young man's life.

883
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,393
When you sow into him,
you're sowing into your life.

884
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,953
- That's right!
- Come on, let's be a blessing to this young man.

885
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:29,823
Let's show him how much we love him.

886
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:32,183
And how much we're rooting for him.

887
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:34,162
And we want him
to go all the way

888
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,381
and make us all proud.

889
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,833
Amen.

890
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,133
Good game, Sparky.

891
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,692
See you back at the ranch.

892
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,132
Hey, rookie.

893
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:51,462
You didn't suck, man.

894
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,812
That is the six I know.

895
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,891
Man, I tell you, those hits--

896
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,253
I gotta take some notes.

897
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:02,123
Great game, man.

898
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:04,221
Tell you what--

899
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:06,460

Jason!

905
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,341
Don't you dare, Lyla.
Don't you dare.

906
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:17,701
Come on, look me in the face.

00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:19,851
Come back here. Come back here!

908
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:21,451

- You gonna steal a cripple's girl,

909
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:22,600
but you won't fight a cripple?

910
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:24,342
You coward!

911
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,311
You're a coward, Riggins!

912
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:27,730
Always will be.

913
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:31,250
Jason...

00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:42,832

Go, go!

917
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:34,640
What happened to your eye?

918
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:38,871

919
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:46,260
