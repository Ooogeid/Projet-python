1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,623
You best take that off
before your father gets home.

2
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:05,136
Why you dressed like that?

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,408
- We wear that in Bresil.
- We're not in Brazil.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,494
That's your ex-girlfriend.

5
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:14,425
You're kicked off the team.
I'm sorry about that.

6
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:17,748
You wanted to play football?
Who doesn't want to be a panther?

7
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:22,141
You wanna come by tomorrow?
Come out and practice with us?

8
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:25,287
The coroner found upholstery fibers

9
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:28,522
from gmc wagons... just like this one.

10
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,425
I didn't mean to do it, dad.

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,315
Dear god, forgive us for this.

12
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,741
<i>The recruiting circus
has come to town, folks.</i>

13
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,201
<i>Today's the first day
that college recruiters</i>

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,776
<i>are officially allowed to talk
to the individual football players.</i>

15
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,366
<i>The question on everyone's mind
is who will our very own</i>

16
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,065
<i>Smash Williams talk to first?</i>

17
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:59,033
No, you cannot.

18
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:00,888
He's sleeping.

19
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:02,845
No, I will not!

20
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:04,554
Eh--good-bye.

21
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,665
Lord have mercy!

22
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,652
Georgia tech is on the phone.

23
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:17,524
- Take a message.
- I'm not your personal assistant.

24
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,649
Well that's good,
'cause you not getting paid.

25
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,634
Take this phone.
Mama gettin' irritated.

26
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,995
Smash train is pulling out the station.

27
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:26,396
You better hang on
before you lose your seat.

28
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:32,387
Jules, honey, I made pancakes.

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,002
Wanna come out for breakfast?

30
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:35,232
I'm not hungry.

31
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:38,133
We're gonna leave
in about 20 minutes, okay?

32
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:40,010
She still upset over Matt?

33
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,317
I think so.

34
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:47,017
Hi.

35
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,394
Don't look.

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,605
Where are your manners?

37
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:52,785
Sorry.

38
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,052
- I'll give you one, if you give me one.
- I'm not giving anything up.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,300
What?

40
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,909
So you want me to make some dinner?
I can make some beef stroganoff.

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,114
If you want to.

42
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:08,080
You've done enough around here.
The place looks great.

43
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,087
I'm blown away.
I don't think it's ever been this clean.

44
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

45
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:18,799
You okay?

46
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,529
I'm fine.

47
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,642
You just gonna stand there?

48
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:24,789
No...

49
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:36,573
What, are you packing?

50
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:39,903
- You don't have to leave. I'll leave.
- No, it's fine.

51
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,426
Don't be an idiot, okay?
Come on, look, this is stupid.

52
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,378
Where the hell you gonna go? Tim.

53
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,522
- You guys have your fun.
- Tim, I'm talking to you right now.

54
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:50,035
Listen, are you thinking about this?
What are you doing?

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,890
I can leave. You don't--
This is your house.

56
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,168
I know it is.

57
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,441
How's it going?

58
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,456
What's all this you got going on here?

59
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,903
It's my clothes.

60
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,127
That's nice.
Why are they right here?

61
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,249
Kinda need a place to stay.

62
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,565
Please.

63
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,405
48 hours, Tim.
That's all you got. 48.

64
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,083
I'll take it.
Thank you.

65
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:38,182
And don't even dream
about coming anywhere near my room.

66
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,324
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- Shut up.

67
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,197

71
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,954
Mrs. Taylor, excuse me.

72
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,927
I was told to see you
about getting a set of keys

73
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:36,306
for the activity lounge for
a staff meeting of the Dillon chronicle.

74
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:40,039
Sweetheart, you need to talk
to your faculty advisor about that.

75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,748
That would be me, ma'am.

76
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:44,174
- Did you just call me "ma'am?"
- I did.

77
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,654
Sorry-- Noah Barnett.

78
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,948
English lit, creative writing, speech,

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,783
and faculty advisor for the paper.

80
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,024
You're the--
oh, good lord.

81
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,121
How old are you, 12?

82
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,487
Don't answer that.

83
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,075
A lot's happened since I've been gone.
I was gone having a baby.

84
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,971
No, I don't even need to hit the ball
off the tee anymore.

85
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:04,197
I've graduated.
My dad pitches to me now.

86
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,477
In tee ball, when you're little
you hit the ball off a tee.

87
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,013
We're a football family, so.
You know what?

88
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,531
- Those keys will be in my office.
- I'll come by later.

89
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,453
- My office'll be great.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:16,993
- Nce to meet you.
- You too.

91
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:18,580
Listen up.

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,206
Stop what you're doing.
I want to talk to you a second.

93
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,372
A number of you today are gonna get
an opportunity to meet some recruiters.

94
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,291
These recruiters wanna try
to get you to commit to this, that,

95
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,815
or any other school any way they can.
They don't care how.

96
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:34,981
But the texas high school
athletic administration, they do care.

97
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm talking about
losing state eligibility

98
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,584
if someone gets caught
accepting anything.

99
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:44,527
Cell phones, concert tickets,
meals, rides home.

100
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:46,493
With that said,

101
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:49,172
any of y'all want to meet
with any particular recruiters,

102
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,318
you talk to me or the other coaches.
We work it through my office.

103
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,060
Anything you need, you will get.

104
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:58,101
Let's go have a good practice,
get outta here early today.

105
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,360
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

106
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,116
Smash Williams, how you doing, man?

107
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,945
Pete Kinderton, Miami South.

108
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,905
Look, I don't know about florida, man.

109
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,446
Y'all get hurricanes--

110
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,552
How are you?

111
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,826
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

112
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,708
How's owen's turf toe doing?

113
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:18,900
He's good.
He said he's gonna play through it.

114
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,223
Man, that guy is tough.

115
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:22,286
- You know Owen Davenport?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,579
- He graduated my sophomore year.
- That's right.

117
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,901
He's been starting for us
for the last couple years.

118
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,639
Guy's fantastic, yeah.

119
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,178
I'm sorry, do you guys know each other?

120
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,596
I've seen you around.

121
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:37,773
Listen, I gotta get out of here.

122
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,557
But I'll be here a couple days.

123
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,971
- Gimme a shout. Take care.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:44,022
- Good seeing you again, Noelle.
- Bye.

125
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:47,005
Hey, I didn't know Owen Davenport
had a little sister.

126
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,623
He does.

127
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,071
Well...we should hang out some time.

128
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:52,548
Yeah, definitely.

129
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,698
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

130
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:55,990
Okay, see ya.

131
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,085
You really gonna do this thing?

132
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,085
I don't know.
What do you think?

133
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,246
Santiago!

134
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,541
Come here.

135
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,696
Listen up--here's what I want you to do.

136
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,731
I want you to go to
the guidance counselor, Mrs. Taylor,

137
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:29,252
and I want you to tell her I sent you.
And I want her to check your credits,

138
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,876
and to see
that you're squared away academically.

139
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,951
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,897
And be nice to her; she's my wife.

141
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,587
- Yes, coach.
- Go do that.

142
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,916
Then we just stood there
and watched as--

143
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,877
as the car turned into, like,
a giant charcoal briquette.

144
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,128
Then what happened?

145
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,743
And then we just--
we went home.

146
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:53,258
But that's--
that's good, right?

147
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:55,056
My dad destroyed evidence.

148
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:56,845
He's a cop.
He can't do that.

149
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,242
Now I've got him into this thing and...

150
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,850
Landry, I don't know
what you want me to say.

151
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,478
I just wanted to tell you,

152
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,408
because I don't have anyone else
I can talk to about this.

153
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,564
Yeah, I know.

154
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,313
You been doing okay though?

155
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:10,414
Yeah, I mean...

156
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,955
about as good as I can be, I guess.

157
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,925
Hi, y'all. Can I talk to you?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

158
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,148
Can I talk to you for a quick second?
Sorry, I'm rushing around this morning.

159
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,321
- Sorry to interrupt you.
- That's all right.

160
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,983
Good to see you, Landry.

161
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:28,198
Honey, I need to ask you a favor.
I need a go-getter. And you are--

162
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:30,199
Hey, Lyla!
Come here, come here.

163
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:31,274
Perfect!

164
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:34,026
I need two go-getters.
Here's the situation.

165
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:36,662
They're all on me about
this whole pantherama thing.

166
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:40,465
Last year, I scheduled both the
entertainment and the silent auction.

167
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,777
This year, that is a burden
that I cannot bear.

168
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,890
So what I thought would be great

169
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,077
is to actually pass
on the entertainment part

170
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,974
of pantherama to a couple of students.

171
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,233
What do you think?

172
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,612
Yeah, you know, I--actually,
I've been studying really hard.

173
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,292
I would love to, but--

174
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,977
I've the christ teen messengers thing.

175
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:03,553
Oh, honey, you are not using
Jesus Christ our Lord as an excuse

176
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,554
not to help out your counselor, are you?

177
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:07,852
- No, ma'am.
- That's nice, thank you.

178
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,635
And Tyra, you too busy studying
to help me out?

179
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:15,609
Yeah? Oh, really?
Great. Oh, I appreciate it.

180
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:19,311
Y'all are gonna do a super job.
I'm not kidding. I mean, I'm excited.

181
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:21,763
All right, girls.
Thank you so much appreciate it!

182
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,098
Have a great day!

183
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,194
Okay, okay, so Tracy will do
the movie review, 250 words.

184
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:31,321
But what we really need
are feature stories.

185
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,401
Okay, so what do you got?
Anybody got any ideas?

186
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,271
People, this is your paper, not mine.

187
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,321
What stories do you think need telling?

188
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,988
Well, the knife has never played
anywhere in the state of texas.

189
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:45,697
Good, that's-- that's interesting...
if it's true.

190
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:48,087
Although I don't think
it merits 1,000 words.

191
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,314
Anyone else?

192
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,085
Julie.

193
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,502
What about pantherama?

194
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:55,046
Of course,
you're pitching a football idea.

195
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,857
I'm not pitching a football idea, okay?

196
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:01,879
Pantherama's an event that's held
every year by Dillon high, right?

197
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,836
And it generates a lot of money.
But where does the money go?

198
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,714
Who decided how to distribute the money?

199
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,144
Do all the sports get
the same level of funding?

200
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,854
I don't think so.

201
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,356
That's exactly the kind of thinking
I'm looking for.

202
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,861
Excellent, excellent.

203
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,316
You just talked yourself
into a feature assignment.

204
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:18,417
Well done.

205
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:22,741
Your grades look pretty good,
actually...

206
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,282
considering you transferred...

207
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:26,822
five times?

208
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,817
My uncle's work makes him move
around a lot.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
What about your parents?

210
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,251
They were deported.

211
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:35,058
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,208
But I was born here.

213
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:40,398
So did they leave you, then,
in the care of your uncle?

214
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,352
Is he your legal guardian?

215
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,347
Well, I'm not quite clear then,

216
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:49,184
why you put Garrity Motors
as your address here.

217
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,312
I just thought it would be easier,
you know?

218
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:53,855
Easier for what?

219
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:55,844
You never know when my uncle's work

220
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:57,995
is gonna have to make him
move again, so.

221
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,091
I am gonna need
to have your real address.

222
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:03,147
And I need to have a meeting
with your uncle,

223
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:05,643
just so we can sort of sit down
and talk about what we--

224
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,531
what would happen in the coming year.

225
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,254
Yeah, no--he--
he pulls double shifts all the time.

226
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:14,063
It's really hard to pull him away...
but I could have him sign whatever.

227
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,295
If you give me something,
I could have him sign it.

228
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:19,297
Well you know what?
It's gotta be face to face.

229
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,775
Go to your house after school one day,

230
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:24,511
- wherever's convenient for him.
- It's not gonna work.

231
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,346
How come, santiago?

232
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,754
It's just--
it's just not gonna work.

233
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:32,103
Hey, listen...

234
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,490
is there something
you'd like to tell me?

235
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,872
My uncle hasn't been home in a while.

236
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,742
How long is a while?

237
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,409
10 or 11 months.

238
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,300
It's no big deal. It's just this car.
This guy is selling a car.

239
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,573
And I was thinking about
maybe going and look at it.

240
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,773
But it's probably
too much money anyway, so.

241
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,092
Well, matthew saracen.

242
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,052
This is your lucky day,

243
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,306
because I happen to be
an exceptional negotiator.

244
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:10,657
Oh, is that right?

245
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:13,560
Did you used to work with Buddy Garrity,
or something like that?

246
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,125
No, I actually know cars.

247
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:19,032
I bet I could even get you a discount.

248
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,151
Oh, yeah?

249
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,712
I just--I need to keep the door closed.

250
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,587
Why's that?

251
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:44,068
Because my ex-boyfriend
and his new girlfriend are out there.

252
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,272
And they're--
they're pretty into pda.

253
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:49,888
So I just-- I thought it would be

254
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,721
less awkward, if I just avoided them,

255
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,767
and I didn't have
to really deal with it.

256
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:57,394
And I'm sure they'll be gone in a sec,
so I'll be out of your hair.

257
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,357
That's classic, isn't it?

258
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:04,027
He's the QBb1, right,
and she's the cheerleader.

259
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:05,942
She's, like...

260
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,083
this perfect doll.

261
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,978
And I'm just, like, some interlude.

262
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,485
And she's the real deal.

263
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,026
I guess I just...

264
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,528
I guess I just came in to cry.

265
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:25,204
You hungry?

266
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,485
I always eat when I get dumped.

267
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,448
That's classic.

268
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,807
It is pretty classic.

269
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,213
It's a veggie deluxe.

270
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,072
I guess it couldn't hurt, right?

271
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,527
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

272
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:52,614
I can't believe you're even talking
about eligibility.

273
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:55,995
What's important right now is the fact
that this is a boy who's an orphan.

274
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,025
That's what you should be
thinking about.

275
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,222
I got a great idea! You know what?

276
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,612
He joins my team, he's on my field,
he's got a family.

277
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,627
No, we get him a family,

278
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:07,672
then we can talk about him
being on your team.

279
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,163
Period. End of discussion.

280
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:11,344
That's just the way
it's gonna have to work.

281
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:15,394
So there's this girl dancin' to devil
went down to georgia--she's new.

282
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,050
And I walk up to her, and I'm all,

283
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,521
"bitch, that's my signature song.
Step off."

284
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:22,977
I'll kick her ass. I dance in boots,
and chaps, and a thong.

285
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:26,551
- What the hell is she thinkin'?
- I don't know, good costume though.

286
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,545
- I'll tell you that much.
- All I'm sayin'.

287
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,029
- Beer?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,608
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi, baby.

289
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,660
Tim, could I talk to you for a second?

290
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:40,292
Don't you dare screw my sister.

291
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,752
- What are you talking about?
- I swear to god, Tim.

292
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,326
I know that you like to create havoc
wherever you go.

293
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,669
I'm serious as cancer.
Do not... screw mindy.

294
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,678
That's my line. Don't cross it.

295
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,760
How's landry doing?

296
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,965
You're on hour 36 of the 48, okay?

297
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:57,899
Tick tock.

298
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:01,186
Find a place, Tim.

299
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,062
Let me ask you, Brian.

300
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,751
Have you given
any consideration to attending

301
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,572
a historically black college?

302
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:11,070
I'm mostly about my game,
know what I'm saying?

303
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,490
Can I get you some more coffee,
Mr. Gordon?

304
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,456
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

305
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,001
Let me cut straight to the chase, Brian.

306
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:20,789
Whitmore university doesn't offer
athletic scholarships,

307
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,883
but we do offer academic ones.

308
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,339
Should you decide to enroll at Whitmore,

309
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:27,542
we'd love to have you
play football for us.

310
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,204
But regardless,
you'll get a full year of education

311
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,897
from one of the top schools
in the country, guaranteed.

312
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,460
So I could be on a team
that was two and nine last season.

313
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,860
- Say, brian.
- Okay, look. Tell me this.

314
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,875
How many players were drafted last year?

315
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,638
- I think you know the answer to that.
- Yeah, none.

316
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:45,016
Look, I know you'll get other offers.

317
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:46,874
Yeah, you right about that.

318
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:49,816
I do understand the allure
of a big football university.

319
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,726
I just hope you'll give our college
real consideration.

320
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,987
The next four years
can change your life.

321
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,003
Mr. Gordon, college isn't the goal.

322
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,679
It's the means to an end.

323
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,746
I plan on going pro sooner, not later.

324
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,373
I don't want to waste your time or mine.

325
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:11,297
- You call about the dart here?
- Yeah, I did.

326
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:14,342
275 horsepower?

327
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,426
Yeah.

328
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:18,304
It's not a slant six, is it?

329
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:19,556
Ah, no.

330
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,312
Smart girl, pretty girl, knows her cars.

331
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,346
So what do you think?
What are you feeling?

332
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,192
What do you think?
You're the car--

333
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,181
- Yeah, I think it's great.
- This? You think?

334
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:32,846
Absolutely, I love it.

335
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,573
You can get a really good deal
on this, trust me.

336
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,962
Okay.

337
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:41,828
So you realize you're selling to QB1
of the Dillon Panthers, right?

338
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,913
I'll take $200 off the price.

339
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:50,753
Everything that you donated will be
on a silent auction table at pantherama.

340
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,373
Great. Thank you so much.

341
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:55,758
Okay, bye-bye.

342
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,844
- Hey, listen--
- Hello, gentlemen.

343
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,253
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

344
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,223
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?

345
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,059
We have been talking
about this santiago situation.

346
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:08,427
Look, santiago has been
working for me part-time.

347
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:11,170
Did you know that?
He's a great worker.

348
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,355
And when Eric told me
about his living situation,

349
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,570
I was appalled.

350
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:20,242
And so, I came up with this moment
of scintillating clarity.

351
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:22,679
He should move in with me.

352
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,834
Easy. Simple.

353
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,465
Can I talk to my husband for one sec?

354
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,409
- Absolutely.
- Just one quick sec.

355
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,583
I'll see you-- Thank you.

356
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:37,536
- Why would you go and--
- Don't whisper yell at me please.

357
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:40,072
Talk to him and bring him
into my office?

358
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,165
And you're suggesting that Santiago,

359
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:44,339
that poor child is gonna
go live with Buddy Gar--

360
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,126
- We're not selling puppies here.
- I know we're not.

361
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:50,110
This has got to go through
social services. That's the protocol.

362
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,556
It's not an ideal situation.
But that's the situation.

363
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:56,861
The protocol doesn't work, does it?
He didn't get the assistance he needed.

364
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,066
He fell through the cracks.
And the protocol?

365
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,886
This is not an alternative.
And I know what you're doing.

366
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:05,203
This is convenient for you, so that
you can have your football season.

367
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,382
Don't tell me I'm doing all this for
the kid just to get him on the team.

368
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,054
What I'm saying is yeah,
he won't be living in a trailer alone.

369
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,000
What I'm saying is yeah,
he'll have family.

370
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,225
What I'm saying is yeah,
we can keep an eye on him.

371
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,859
That's all I'm saying.

372
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,058
This is ridiculous.

373
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,897
How are we supposed
to figure out the entertainment

374
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:24,615
if we don't have a single name?

375
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,420
We're gonna get our names.

376
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:29,881
Follow me.

377
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,875
- That's the men's--
- I know.

378
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,242
Hey, y'all!

379
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,472
Listen up! Quiet down.

380
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,285
Lyla, why are we here?

381
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,946
Because nobody signed up for pantherama.

382
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:51,040
Nobody signed up for the pantherama!

383
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,259
I know, I know.

384
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:56,968
Hey, am I right to think
that tradition dictates

385
00:18:57,128 --> 00:19:00,029
that the players provide
entertainment for pantherama?

386
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,051
Is that right?
That's right.

387
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:03,680
All right, listen up, ladies.

388
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,430
Lyla and I, we have a job to do.

389
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,870
Okay,
so just make this easy on everybody.

390
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,546
You, freshman, pass this around.

391
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:11,551
What?

392
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,093
I'm gonna be spending
a lot of time with, um...

393
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,111
- what's your name?
- Carter.

394
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,266
Yeah, Lyla and I...

395
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,279
we're gonna be spending
the whole week with Carter.

396
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:31,936
Anybody else?

397
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:38,745
Well done.

398
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,290
This is good.

399
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,447
And it's also too long.

400
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,191
I didn't say we're not gonna run it,

401
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:49,640
I just think you need to cut it down
by 500 words.

402
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,889
- Well, that's half the article.
- Well, find the right half.

403
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,847
Well, I thought you said
the story's supposed to show range.

404
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,742
"On a blustery tuesday afternoon,

405
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:01,888
"one can find half a dozen
multiloquous rally girls

406
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:05,213
"selling raffle tickets,
and to what end? Pantherama."

407
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:09,243
- Multiloquous?
- It just means talkative.

408
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,484
Right.

409
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,904
Don't use a $10 word
when a nickel one will do.

410
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:18,294
And I think three angry paragraphs
about rally girls is kind of off point.

411
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,957
- But I thought you said it was good.
- It is, it is.

412
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:23,656
It's good.

413
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:25,844
But good is the enemy of great.

414
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,805
You know, the less a reporter says,
the more she hears.

415
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,974
So, what,
did you work at a newspaper too?

416
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,351
I did.

417
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:37,104
- You're just trying to prove a point.
- I am.

418
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,090
Columbia school of journalism

419
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,578
and then a year at the city desk
of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

420
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,696
It's a good article.

421
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,490
Cut it down, make it great.

422
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:49,496
Okay.

423
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:53,079
So when Owen was being recruited,
it was crazy. I was a slave.

424
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:55,790
Are you stuck taking messages
for Smash all the time?

425
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:57,456
No.

426
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,545
Owen played the recruiters
against each other.

427
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,359
He would listen to what UCC said,

428
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,591
and then go back to Miami Southern
and say "What are you gonna do for me?"

429
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:07,665
And then he ended up with a Porsche.

430
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,680
- For real?
- So, your brother likes Miami Southern.

431
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,599
Oh, yeah.
He's, like, the king of that place.

432
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,783
Are your parents happy
with his education?

433
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:18,980
I guess, sure.

434
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,461
My dad says the connection
he makes on the team

435
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,973
will serve him better than a Masters.

436
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:27,405
Your mother must be concerned
about him getting hurt.

437
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,821
You know there are no guarantees
in football.

438
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:33,536
Guys like Smash are blessed. That's
as close as you get to a guarantee.

439
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,689
Amen. You got that right.

440
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:47,530
He's here. Oh, my Lord, Matthew!

441
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,542
- Is this it?
- This is it.

442
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,913
- It's old.
- It's a classic.

443
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:56,630
- That's what the owner told me.
- Let's just check out the engine.

444
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:58,811
That is not bad for this age of a car.

445
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,565
- No, these engines, they run forever.
- Yeah, clearly.

446
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:06,903
I wanna go on a ride. Y'all move back.
Will you take us?

447
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,640
- You want to go for a ride?
- I want to go for a ride!

448
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:13,367
Grandma wants to go for a ride.
Let's all get in the car, go for a ride.

449
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,246
- Oh it's nice.
- You know how to drive?

450
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:18,873
I'm a good driver.

451
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,531
I'll be the judge of that.

452
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:24,016
- You good?
- I'm ready.

453
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,208
Here we go.

454
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,302
I know what you gonna say.

455
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,322
Shoulda told you ahead of time
that I invited a friend for dinner.

456
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,933
That wasn't even what I was gonna say.

457
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,685
I was wondering if

458
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:43,189
you had taken any thought to what
Mr Gordon said about Whitmore.

459
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:47,526
Mom, were you listening
to anything Noelle was saying?

460
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:50,276
Her brother worked it.
I ain't going to no tired school

461
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,532
when I got recruiters from Florida,
Texas, and California on the line.

462
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:56,160
What does that mean, "working it?"

463
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,206
- I'm gonna look for the best situation.
- What has gotten into you, Brian?

464
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:04,835
You were rude to Mr Gordon.
That man offered you a full scholarship.

465
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:06,963
And then you waltz in here with this

466
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,965
white girl and act like she a prophet.

467
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:12,551
- Is that what this is about?
- No, you tell me what it's about!

468
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:14,637
'Cause it's not even like that.

469
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,006
I wanna know is--

470
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:18,599
Is this what you think it's about?

471
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:20,226
Is this why you play football?

472
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:22,269
You have no idea how any of this works.

473
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:25,119
Noelle's seen the whole thing before.
You haven't.

474
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:28,444
You just want me to nod and smile and
say "yes, Mr Gordon" like a good boy.

475
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,862
- He can't give me what I want.
- I want you

476
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,330
to use your brain and think!

477
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,201
And what if you end up
like Jason Street?

478
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,454
Oh, he had the whole world.
He had everything until he got hurt.

479
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:44,000
That's not ever gonna happen to me.
That's what I'm saying. I'm going

480
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:46,335
all the way, all the way,
and all you can think about

481
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:50,589
is how I might fail? How I might not
make it? No, no, I won't let you.

482
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,925
Nobody's holding me back.
Not you, not anybody!

483
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,275
What part of "get into a straight line"
don't y'all understand?

484
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:12,153
Come on, guys, let's go! Come on!

485
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,488
Let's go, let's go! Come on,

486
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,241
- get up. Get up.
- You guys volunteered, right?

487
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,368
Let's just get in a couple
straight lines.

488
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,413
Let's try and figure this thing out.
It's gonna be really simple.

489
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:23,831
It's just a walk.

490
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:27,043
Just do what I do.
Five, six, seven, eight.

491
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,733
D.H.S.--

492
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,381
It's supposed to be funny.

493
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,875
All right, all right, take a break.

494
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,469
Five minute break.

495
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,554
We're not done. Just take a break.

496
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:41,582
Any bright ideas,
because I don't think that

497
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:44,992
- the cheering thing is gonna work.
- No.

498
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,272
Hey, hey you.

499
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,275
Put your shirt back on.

500
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,156
Oh, you got called out, man.

501
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:03,428
All right.

502
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,530
Take it off again.

503
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:16,634
Now see that? That is entertainment.

504
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,545
Put a little music to some moves.

505
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,460
You can choreograph, right?

506
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,689
If we're gonna do it,
let's make it fun, you know?

507
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,736
That is what I'm talking about.
All right, guys.

508
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,741
Okay, I get it, I get it. I get it.

509
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,743
Let's get in a straight line.

510
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,862
Okay, so that's pathetic.
I mean, how much vomit?

511
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,749
Don't laugh when somebody
confesses something embarrassing.

512
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,254
- Hey.
- Hey, y'all.

513
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,089
Hey, mom. Hi.

514
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,526
- Right on, keys.
- I brought Mr Barnett his keys.

515
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:01,887
By the way,
that whole story's off the record.

516
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,453
Incidentally, your daughter

517
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,642
has a feature
in the Dillon Chronicle tomorrow.

518
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:09,437
How about that? Good for you, sweetie.

519
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,864
- Thank you.
- That's great.

520
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,524
I'll see you later, mr. B.

521
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:14,692
Adios.

522
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:19,530
Everything okay in here?

523
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,130
Yeah, everything's good.

524
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:22,616
- Good.
- Thanks

525
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:23,826
for the keys.

526
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,745
- Appreciate it.
- Let me know if you need anything.

527
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,041
Julie.

528
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,009
Under over.

529
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,065
Snapping.

530
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,452
- Nice moves!
- No, it's not--

531
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,558
Shut up. No, it's just

532
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,535
this thing that I gotta do tomorrow
for Pantherama.

533
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,188
What's that?

534
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,420
It's that thing that you gotta take
my grandma to tomorrow night.

535
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,943
Lyla and Tyra made up this stupid dance.

536
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,488
And they think I need to be up
in the front row.

537
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,115
And then, I think
we even gotta take our shirts off.

538
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,881
Oh, like the Full Monty?

539
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,036
No, not like the Full Monty, but it's

540
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:10,366
pretty bad. I'm not even gonna do it.
I'm just gonna tell 'em I'm sick.

541
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,584
I have to stay home
and take care of my grandma.

542
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:15,704
- No!
- Yeah.

543
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:19,298
No, if you're going to dance
in front of people, you have to own it.

544
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,550
- It's stupid. Everyone's gonna laugh.
- So?

545
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,470
- Okay, show me the dance.
- No.

546
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:26,597
I'll help. I love dancing. Come on.

547
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,598
Whatever, fine. Here, watch.
It's like this. It's like, it's like...

548
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,620
Okay, okay, that's good. But loosen up!

549
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:39,722
It's loose, it's loose.

550
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:42,475
'Cause if you don't move your shoulders,
you look like a robot.

551
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,033
- But you have to move your hips.
- But what about the shoulders?

552
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:48,059
This is how you do it.
You march.

553
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,455
And then hips just side to side.
Do this.

554
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,480
Put your hands on my hips, go.

555
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:57,936
Like this, side to side.

556
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:02,675
All right.

557
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:04,760
See?

558
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,683
- You feel it?
- Yeah, I feel it. It's good, it's fun.

559
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:09,876
I mean, yeah.

560
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:13,143
So do it again.

561
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:15,604
That's good!

562
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:16,981
Look at those hips!

563
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,732
It's not good.

564
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,109
It's good.

565
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:41,380
- I got you all wet.
- That's okay.

566
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:45,665
I'm officially telling Whitmore no.

567
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,844
What?

568
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,430
I'm going pro, mama.

569
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,266
I won't need to finish four years,
'cause when I turn 21,

570
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,184
I'll be signing with the NFL.

571
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:57,688
I'm going pro and I'm gonna need
to be around people who believe that.

572
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,085
I'm thinking big picture
for this family.

573
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,278
So I'll be going
to my future recruiting meetings alone.

574
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:06,441
I'm not mad.

575
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:10,034
I just...
I'm gonna do what I need to do.

576
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,703
Is this because of that girl?

577
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:16,707
No. I told you it's not like that.

578
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:18,434
This is me.

579
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,512
I have been thinking about
this Santiago situation.

580
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,765
And I did a little research into him.

581
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:37,143
Into his background, and
kid has been in juvie twice.

582
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:39,415
And he's had some violent episodes.

583
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,464
Now what concerns me about
putting a boy like that

584
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:45,774
back into the foster care system is that

585
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,598
there's just a great risk there.

586
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:49,990
Especially if he gets into one of those
group homes...

587
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:53,077
- I understand.
- I mean, I know

588
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,647
that you're looking at him
like he's a great football player.

589
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:58,999
But I want to make something
clear to you.

590
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:00,897
This is a boy who needs a home.

591
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,611
- And this is a boy who's at risk.
- I know, Tami.

592
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,247
I mean, I've got three kids.
I know what it takes.

593
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,853
But this is not a kid
like your three kids.

594
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,682
This is a whole different situation.

595
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,982
It's true.

596
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,527
Even though I'm a little bit nervous
about it,

597
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,316
I know I can do this.

598
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,899
And... I really like the kid.

599
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:32,587
I think he's got a great heart.
I want him to have a chance.

600
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:35,940
I do too.

601
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,527
Morning, sunshine.

602
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:53,075
- Can't believe you just did that.
- This coming from the guy

603
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,526
who shows up on my porch
expecting a sleepover.

604
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:59,268
- Seriously, Tim, I want you gone.
- Do you want some breakfast, Tim?

605
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,354
- Sounds great.
- Shut up! No, he's leaving.

606
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:03,592
He's leaving.

607
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,593
I can't deal with you here, Tim.
I want you gone.

608
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:10,112
I'm serious.
I don't have anywhere to go, Tyra.

609
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:15,075
Oh, right, because your brother's
sleeping with the girl that you used to,

610
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:19,121
- screw around with? That old lady.
- Good morning, Timmy.

611
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:21,617
- Good morning, Min.
- I know a guy that's always

612
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,834
looking for people to help him
with his pets.

613
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:26,180
- I'll give you his number.
- See? There you go.

614
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,547
As good as that sounds,
I may have to check that out.

615
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:29,840
Today...

616
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:35,971
- Hey, sweetheart, how's your day going?
- Fine till I read this. You read this?

617
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:38,932
"Pantherama: Where does the money go?"
By Julie Taylor.

618
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:42,060
I know. She's been working really hard
on that with that Mr Barnett.

619
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:45,522
- Have you met that new teacher?
- "Athletic director and Panther's coach

620
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:48,275
had no comment."
She asked me through the bathroom door.

621
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:49,649
I was busy.

622
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:52,551
Sweetheart...

623
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:55,073
She does make some good points in there.

624
00:31:58,727 --> 00:31:59,703
Bye, honey!

625
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:04,833
Ms. Williams?

626
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:10,477
- How are you? Have a seat.
- I'm all right.

627
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:14,532
I need to know what y'all gonna do
about this recruitment insanity.

628
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:18,639
My phone is ringing off the hook day and
night. My kid is acting like he needs

629
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,134
a hollywood agent.

630
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:23,519
Now you told the parents
you were gonna keep an eye on this.

631
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:27,314
It gets pretty heated up around here
this time of year.

632
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:29,525
Now wait a second.

633
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:32,620
These recruiters are pretty aggressive.
I gotta tell you something.

634
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,762
When they see your boy,
they see a prize.

635
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:36,448
I mean, he's got the talent.

636
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,215
All I can hear about is
how fast he can go pro.

637
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:41,031
Not one word about his education.

638
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:44,295
- Not one.
- I can give recommendations.

639
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,077
I can give advice.

640
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,081
But in the long run,

641
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:53,549
that's a decision that Brian's gonna
be making, or Brian and yourself.

642
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:56,097
My dead husband was a triflin' man.

643
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:58,968
I couldn't count on him
to bring his check home,

644
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,556
or to be faithful.

645
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:03,467
But he was always there for Brian.

646
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,490
They could talk.

647
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,647
Now I'm not asking you
to be this boy's daddy.

648
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:12,067
I'm just here to remind you

649
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,112
he doesn't have one.

650
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:22,455
- There's gonna be a great show tonight.
- Ooh, good!

651
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,467
Carlotta helped with it.

652
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,374
- She did?
- Yeah, she's quite the choreographer.

653
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:28,917
What kind of show, Matthew?

654
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,753
- Kind of a variety show, I guess.
- Good.

655
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,306
Do you realize that Pantherama's

656
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,261
the first social event that Gracie's
ever been to in her entire life?

657
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:42,185
You really should start saving up
for therapy right now.

658
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:45,759
Pantherama is tradition,
and tradition is good, sweetheart.

659
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,270
Maybe you could use
some of that positive tradition

660
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,603
in the work
you're doing with your articles.

661
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:52,566
Noah says you can't have preconceptions

662
00:33:52,828 --> 00:33:54,914
- about an article.
- I don't care what he says.

663
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:58,330
- Does everybody call him noah?
- Mom, that's his name.

664
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,490
I would think it would be Mr Barnett.

665
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:04,182
As far as me impinging
on your freedom of the press,

666
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,784
how about you come out
with a little more balance,

667
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,874
more fairness.
What do you think about that?

668
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:12,501
Welcome everybody to Pantherama!

669
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:19,259
I want to thank you for coming out
supporting your Dillon panthers!

670
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,383
Is everybody having a good time?

671
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:27,655
You guys, listen up.
I'll be over here on the side.

672
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,312
If you get out of line
or you need me, I'll be right here.

673
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:31,855
Don't screw up.

674
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,023
Let's do it.

675
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,276
You guys are gonna be great.
Ready? All right.

676
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:38,654
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big round of applause for your

677
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,947
Dillon Panthers!

678
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,331
Did you like that?

679
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,731
I always said you had great feet.
You know

680
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:57,873
- how to move.
- Thank you, grandma.

681
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,249
And you got that from me.

682
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:02,905
I told coach that I'd stay
and help and clean up.

683
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,226
Well, that's nice.

684
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:06,241
So I'll be back
in a little bit, all right.

685
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:07,474
All right.

686
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:08,647
Here's the keys.

687
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:11,832
Okay, I'll take it from here.

688
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,540
You looked good out there.

689
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,219
'Cause of you.

690
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,051
I'll see you at the house.

691
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,658
You know, I think we can finish
those bulbs today.

692
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:38,964
Wouldn't that be great?
Next spring it would be so beautiful.

693
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:40,650
- Good morning, honey.
- Morning.

694
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,949
Everything looks so good.

695
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:44,738
This is a good breakfast.

696
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,476
I was thinking about some iris,
'cause we've got day lilies back there.

697
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:51,369
Y'all probably don't know,
but they look alike.

698
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,984
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

699
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,625
We need some bone meal.

700
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,960
Matthew, can you help me remember that?
Bone meal.

701
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:00,295
We might need

702
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,714
some more bulbs.
I don't think I've got that many.

703
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:05,008
The lady next door said
she'd give me some of hers.

704
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,041
You can thin 'em out.

705
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:11,765
And that's really a pretty good way
to do it. Just transplant 'em, you know?

706
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,223
Which might be better than bulbs
when you get down it.

707
00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:16,600
'Cause you've already got 'em started.

708
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,566
we're not talking about
a studio apartment here.

709
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:24,069
- We're talking 3 bedrooms, 2 baths--
- How you doing?

710
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,905
- Coach, how you doing?
- I'm doing fine.

711
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,615
- Good to see you.
- You too.

712
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,284
I make sure you
aren't picking up any of Brian's tab.

713
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,529
Of course, that'd be against
athletic admin rules, wouldn't it?

714
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:37,404
Yes, it would.
We don't break rules at Miami Southern.

715
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:41,169
Even if you were gonna buy one of
his tall tale that he's prone to tell,

716
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,838
that could screw up my season.

717
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:45,819
- It be a damn shame for you.
- Yeah, it sure would, pete.

718
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:47,212
Well listen, smash,

719
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,886
thanks for the time.
Let's do this again. You got my card.

720
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,162
Coach, always a pleasure.

721
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:58,879
- What the hell are you doing?
- Okay, fine.

722
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:03,191
I didn't set up this meeting
through your office. I set it up myself.

723
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:07,511
Nobody wants all that red tape, coach.
And I don't need you to hold my hand.

724
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:09,406
I'm grown.
I'm looking at all my options.

725
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:11,867
I'm trying to make the best decision
for my future.

726
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:13,918
You got heart...

727
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:15,969
charisma...

728
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,956
and a lot of skill.

729
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:21,710
You're probably one of the best athletes
I have ever coached.

730
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:23,895
Thank you.

731
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:29,249
My old man gave me a hard time,
every damn decision I ever made.

732
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:33,847
Every single day I lived

733
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,391
under the roof of that man,

734
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,314
we went head to head.

735
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,440
I'm here.
I just wanted to remind you of that.

736
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:45,924
You got money?

737
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,905
Good. You buy your own meal.

738
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:56,878
- Thanks now.
- Sure thing, Coach.

739
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:11,761
- Who the hell are you?
- Name's Tim Riggins.

740
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,803
What do you want?

741
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:17,057
Mindy Colette called you
and said I was coming by.

742
00:39:20,372 --> 00:39:22,729
Oh, damn, you're that football guy, huh?

743
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:24,564
Sorta, yeah.

744
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:27,228
So you need a place to crash.
So long as you help

745
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:29,402
take care of Roscoe and Coltrane,
you're welcome.

746
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:33,323
- Who's that?
- My ferrets. Ferrets better than cats.

747
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,452
Come on in. I'll introduce you.

748
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:40,497
Come, football boy.

749
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:45,502
Hey!

750
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:46,918
Hi.

751
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,881
So I was wondering
about my next assignment.

752
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,384
A glutton for punishment.

753
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:56,846
When you worked at the paper, how
did you keep coming up with good ideas?

754
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:59,015
How do you know they were good ideas?

755
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:02,686
I subscribe to the New York Times.

756
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:07,273
I read it every day, cover to cover.
You should start by doing that.

757
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:09,783
We can share this one

758
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:13,444
And start to get a sense of what makes

759
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:14,990
a good story.

760
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:17,498
Um, well, thank you.

761
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:19,661
Good. Glad I could help.

762
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:22,512
I'll see you tomorrow.

763
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,578
This is good.

764
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,261
This'll be masculine-lookin'.

765
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,980
Great, uh, hey, babe.

766
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:37,429
You wanna take these and maybe you
and Santiago can start making up the bed

767
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,390
- and setting up your room.
- Come on.

768
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:42,728
Buddy. Come here.

769
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,562
I want to see what you got
in the refrigerator,

770
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,852
I need to see what you've got prepared.

771
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,261
- Got everything we need.
- You got a lot of steak,

772
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:54,625
And a lot of sausage.
Get some vegetables in here.

773
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:00,243
You're a guardian now. You get me?

774
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:03,467
You gotta be home when he's home.
He's a kid.

775
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:06,249
- All right?
- All right.

776
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:11,185
Why don't you go on in? Make him feel
comfortable, make him feel at home.

777
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:12,589
Okay, all right.

778
00:41:12,857 --> 00:41:17,091
This is the last time I'm ever gonna be
making your bed.

779
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:21,348
- Good?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

780
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:25,435
So this is it.
It's not very roomy, but, uh--

781
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:28,813
And this was Buddy Junior's desk.
It's small. I'll try to get you a bigger.

782
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:30,940
But you can work there for now.

783
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:33,276
I think I'm doing the right thing.

784
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,437
You're doing the right thing.

785
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,159
Got your bathroom, and this is your bed.

786
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:42,578
Two beds.

787
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,880
I wish it was roomier, Santiago,
but when I moved in,

788
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:50,651
I really, to tell you the truth,
didn't think it was gonna be that long.

789
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:52,059
So, but...

790
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:54,267
This is the...

791
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,220
first real bed I ever had.

792
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,055
Well...

793
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,710
good.

794
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:05,762
Good then.

795
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:07,644
Make yourself like home.
