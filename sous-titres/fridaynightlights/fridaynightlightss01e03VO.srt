1
00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:02,913
<i>The MRI shows a damage to the cord</i>

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:04,602
<i>at the C7-T1 juncture.</i>

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,536
I just want to know if I'm
gonna be able to walk again.

4
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:09,070
Jason's paralyzed.

5
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:14,536
You are Jason Street,
and I am Lyla Garrity.

6
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,136
And everything is
going to work out

7
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:18,669
just the way we planned it.

8
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,569
<i>He's down on the ground.
He is down.</i>

9
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,003
<i>Who is that, Street?</i>

10
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:25,710
You think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,175
I don't want you thinking
out here.

12
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,179
I want you to throw the ball.

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,838
Dolia runs deep,
hit him deep.

14
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,000
He's open on the break,
hit him on the break.

15
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,563
You got four seconds
or a five-step drop!

16
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:35,171
That's all you got.

17
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:36,432
You up for this?

18
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:38,402
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:50,030
<i>We are live
from Panther Stadium,</i>

20
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,232
<i> in Dillon, Texas.</i>

21
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:52,601
<i>And we are ready
to play football.</i>

22
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:55,563
<i>It was just a week ago
this town was rocked</i>

23
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:58,603
<i>by the tragic injury to our
quarterback, Jason Street,</i>

24
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,432
<i>a young man who embodied
the hopes and dreams</i>

25
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,660
Jason, are you sure
you want to watch the game?

26
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:02,661
I can just...

27
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:04,360
Leave it, please.

28
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,132
<i>Now, the question is,</i>

29
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,033
<i>will Coach Taylor
be able to survive</i>

30
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,031
<i>without his star quarterback?</i>

31
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:14,303
<i>And can young Matt Saracen
step up to lead this team?</i>

32
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,633
<i>Saracen's only taken
about three snaps</i>

33
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:17,761
<i>his entire career..</i>

34
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,561
<i>We're going with I right, power.</i>

35
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:22,200
44 tomahawk, on one.
Ready, break.

36
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,502
<i>Tonight, it's all about
the ground game.</i>

37
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:26,101
<i>Coach Taylor's
gonna have to hope</i>

38
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,132
<i>Saracen can get the ball
into the hands</i>

39
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,603
<i>of their outstanding
running back Smash Williams,</i>

40
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,301
<i>if the Panthers are gonna
have a shot.</i>

41
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,563
Come on, Matt.

42
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,360
<i>Saracen's into the count.</i>

43
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:37,662
<i>Defense pushing in.
They're expecting run.</i>

44
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,832
<i>He opens to the left,
hand off to Williams.</i>

45
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,630
<i>Wait, Saracen keeps
on a bootleg.</i>

46
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,932
<i>Oh, and he gets drilled
as he lets that ball go.</i>

47
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,630
<i>He's got Dolia at the 45.</i>

48
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,633
<i>He makes the catch.</i>

49
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:49,871
<i>To the 40.</i>

50
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:51,833
<i>What an inspired call
by Coach Taylor.</i>

51
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,463
<i>He could go all the way!</i>

52
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,561
Go.

53
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:55,632
<i>He's to the 20,</i>

54
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,030
<i>to the 15.</i>

55
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,233
<i>I don't think
they're gonna catch him.</i>

56
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:02,003
<i>Oh, Dolia gets stripped
at the 10-yard line.</i>

57
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,532
<i>And the Rattlers come up
with the ball.</i>

58
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,231
<i>What a gutsy call
by Coach Taylor,</i>

59
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:11,231
<i>but, man, did that just
blow up in his face.</i>

60
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,402
Execution!

61
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,102
Where the hell's
the execution out there?!

62
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,560
<i>Huh?!</i>

63
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,301
My God, we oughta be
beating these bums

64
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,270
by 40 points!

65
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:29,803
Riggins,
you're supposed to be

66
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,430
one of the toughest guys
in the district!

67
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:34,001
They are handing your ass
to you, son!

68
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:36,270
You better get your head
in the game.

69
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,801
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

70
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:46,970
Smash...north, south.
North, south.

71
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,031
If you want to dance
with these boys out there,

72
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:50,433
you invite them
to the prom!

73
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,701
- They spottin' me every...
- What?!

74
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,173
You got something to say to me?!

75
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:55,001
Call some play-action
to open me up, Coach.

76
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,002
- They see me coming.
- What?!

77
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,802
I can't hear you.
What?!

78
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,361
<i>Our Dillon Panthers
are runnin' out of time.</i>

79
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,630
<i>Deep into the fourth quarter.</i>

80
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,633
Come on, coach!
Run the football now!

81
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:08,332
<i>There're only 15 seconds
left in this contest, folks.</i>

82
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:09,973
<i>And it is third and goal
from the 9.</i>

83
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,130
<i>The Panthers down by six points.</i>

84
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,131
<i>And they have all but
self-destructed here tonight.</i>

85
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,631
<i>Although you've got to
admire the courage</i>

86
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:17,901
<i>of young Matt Saracen.</i>

87
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,202
<i>This quarterback has really
played hard,</i>

88
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,300
<i>with a lot of heart.</i>

89
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,761
Read your defenses.

90
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,072
Come on, Saracen.

91
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,832
Hut!

92
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,233
<i>Saracen on the fake.</i>

93
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,531
<i>He drops back.
He's in trouble.</i>

94
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,271
<i>He beats 'em
out around the right side.</i>

95
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,433
<i>Oh, he's got legs on him.</i>

96
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,502
<i>The 15, the 10.</i>

97
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,203
<i>The 5.
He's gonna score.</i>

98
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,461
<i>He's down to the 3.</i>

99
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:36,402
<i>Bringing it hard
to the goal line.</i>

100
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,530
<i>And dropped
right at the goal line.</i>

101
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,700
<i>The Panthers are saying
touchdown,</i>

102
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,233
<i>but we are gonna wait to see</i>

103
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,332
<i>what the referee's call is.</i>

104
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>No touchdown.</i>

105
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,603
Damn  it.
They had it.

106
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,360
They had 'em beat.

107
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:52,202
<i>That is it
for our Dillon Panthers.</i>

108
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,530
<i>They have lost
a heartbreaker here,</i>

109
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,302
<i>in a game that they should have</i>

110
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,032
<i>easily dominated tonight.</i>

111
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,933
<i>And I'll tell you,
Coach Taylor is off</i>

112
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,132
<i>to a disastrous start</i>

113
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,630
<i>this season, folks.</i>

114
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:06,603
<i>Saracen!</i>

115
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,332
That was a good game.

116
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,601
But not good enough.

117
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:19,003
Not nearly good enough!

118
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,900
<i>It ain't hard, Tim.</i>

119
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,262
<i>Hell, it's not
rocket science.</i>

120
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,362
You beat the living dog snot

121
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:21,632
out of those guys.

122
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,563
You win the game,

123
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,931
then you go out and you get yourself

124
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:27,701
a little piece of tail.

125
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,532
What part of that equation
don't you understand?

126
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,232
You guys just bent over

127
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:32,962
and grabbed your ankles.

128
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,391
You shamed your good name.

129
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,362
Yeah, I feel really awful
about that.

130
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,832
Speaking of pieces of tail,

131
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,530
Lyla Garrity.

132
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,193
- You're not...
- What?

133
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,291
I can't understand you when

134
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,131
you're not moving your mouth,
Tim... you're not speaking.

135
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,263
Hi, is Tim here?

136
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:03,830
Uh, no.

137
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,061
Not at the moment.

138
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,262
Well, can you please tell him

139
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,063
that Lyla Garrity stopped by?

140
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,732
and I will be in the hospital

141
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:14,292
with  his best friend
Jason Street!

142
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,160
Today and tomorrow,

143
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:18,090
and the next day, and so on.

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,665
So whenever he wants
to visit is fine.

145
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,909
But Jason is asking for him,

146
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,768
so sooner is better.

147
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,802
Could you please tell him that
when you see him?

148
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,231
I'll give him
the message, sweetie.

149
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:30,800
Thanks.

150
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,760
Matt, I've been working
on this theory.

151
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:38,803
You know what?

152
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,993
Can you just
help me out?

153
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,393
I really don't want
my grandmother to see this.

154
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,602
Funny you should mention that,

155
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,731
because she's at the core
of my theory.

156
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:45,991
Tell me this.

157
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:47,160
Dillon hasn't lost to South Milbank

158
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,861
in what, like, 20 years?

159
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:51,231
- 17.
- 17, right.

160
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,800
So why do they lose now?

161
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,093
No, I know what you're thinking,

162
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,631
and that's not it.

163
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,332
'Cause you know you played
a good game last night.

164
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,831
I mean, that's not what
I'm talking about.

165
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:02,262
What I'm talking about is
the supernatural.

166
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:04,763
You're retarded.

167
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,503
In a lot of cultures,
they believe older women

168
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:08,231
to be very powerful witches.

169
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, you think
my grandma is a witch.

170
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:11,532
Look, my grandmother
can barely remember

171
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:13,290
how to work the phone
half the time.

172
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,532
How's she gonna put a spell
on the Dillon Panthers?

173
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:16,763
Plus, why would she
put a spell...

174
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,830
Matt?
Matt?

175
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,360
What are y'all doin' out here?

176
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:22,633
I'm just cleaning up
a little bit, Grandma.

177
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,432
Oh, well, when you get done,

178
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,360
I want you to go out back
and water the children.

179
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,901
Y-You mean the flowers,
Grandma?

180
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:29,862
Is that what you mean?

181
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:30,932
Yeah.

182
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,062
Just what I said, wasn't it?

183
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,461
Hey, losers!

184
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,293
Come on, you got it.
Lift it up.

185
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,993
There you go, give it a shot.
Lift it up.

186
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,360
Lift, lift, lift, lift, lift.

187
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,802
Unh! All right.
All right.

188
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:51,963
Relax.

189
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,632
I want to do this again.
I can do it again.

190
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,433
- You don't have to do it.
- I can do it.

191
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,933
Not today.
Not today.

192
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:59,463
Let's wait for tomorrow.
All right?

193
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,663
Down you go.

194
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:04,162
It's all right. Okay?

195
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,902
Thank you.

196
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,460
There you go.

197
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,262
- All right, you good?
- Yes.

198
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:11,901
Hey, baby.
Hey, Danielle.

199
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,063
Hey, Lyla,
how you doing?

200
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,191
Good. How are you?

201
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,363
All right, Jason,
same time tomorrow?

202
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:16,363
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,760
- I'll be here.
- All right.

204
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,390
Hi.

205
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,960
Boy, were you missed
last night.

206
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,230
We got spanked.

207
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,630
It's like no one knew
what to do without you.

208
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,132
I'll tell you what,
I would not wanna be

209
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,633
Coach Taylor right now,
that is for sure.

210
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,162
Just give him some time,
all right?

211
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,090
He'll be fine.

212
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,600
So,  we're expecting
a huge turnout

213
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,063
for the pancake supper
tomorrow.

214
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,463
The what?

215
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,632
The pancake supper.
The benefit.

216
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,902
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

217
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,032
To help with the cost
of the rehab facility.

218
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,761
Yeah.

219
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,630
It's exciting going
to that rehab place.

220
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,290
You know why?

221
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,832
Why is that?

222
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,800
Because that's where you're
gonna get your legs back.

223
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,460
Lyla...

224
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:00,700
You and me,

225
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:02,802
we can get through anything.

226
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:21,330
What's up?

227
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,902
- Oh--
- What?

228
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,761
Um, excuse me.
Nurse?

229
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,091
Lyla.

230
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,730
Something's wet down there.

231
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,162
Dolores,
what's going on?

232
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,992
Excuse me.

233
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,192
- Jason, it's your catheter.
- Oh, God.

234
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,701
We're gonna take care of you.

235
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:40,862
Can you give us a minute?

236
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:41,902
Can you give us a minute?

237
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:42,932
Um, I--

238
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,632
Just a minute.
Go ahead.

239
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,600
You're going to be fine, Jason.

240
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,033
Hey.

241
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,160
Tim.

242
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:04,501
- Hey.
- How you doing, honey?

243
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:07,963
Hi. I'm okay.

244
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,330
How are--

245
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,433
How are you and Mr. Street doing?

246
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,803
We're, uh--
We're holding out.

247
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,392
Jason's been asking about you.

248
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:16,663
Yeah.

249
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:20,163
I've been meaning to go
to see Jay, and--

250
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,933
I know, you're busy
with football and all.

251
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:27,133
Tim, just 'cause Jason's
in the hospital

252
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,163
doesn't mean
you can't come over

253
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,461
for Tuesday night dinner.

254
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:33,030
Thank you ma'am.

255
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:34,860
I'll, uh--

256
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,660
I'll call you.

257
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:39,502
Get some rest, okay?

258
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,931
Take care of yourself.

259
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,361
Yes,  ma'am.

260
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:44,963
Am I gonna see you tonight
at the pancake supper?

261
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:47,292
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,233
Good.
Bye-bye, honey.

263
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,561
I'll tell you what,
if she did let us get a dog,

264
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:58,931
the kind of dog
we're gonna get

265
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:00,603
is a brown Labrador.

266
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,033
And if it's not
a brown Labrador,

267
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,232
we're not getting a dog.

268
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,702
Then we can name it,
like, Fluffy, or Spike.

269
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey, Jill.

270
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,130
Two burgers, with bacon.

271
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:08,431
Onion rings, Diet Coke.

272
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,532
- Extra cheese.
- Spicy chicken

273
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,502
sandwich for mom. Get Mom's--
And Dad's.

274
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:12,530
Don't do it with
the three hamburgers.

275
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,190
- Go sit down.
- Too much dead cow.

276
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,600
She wants onion rings,
diet cola.

277
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:19,433
Um, we need two burgers.

278
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,862
I need a spicy chicken to go.

279
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:26,430
And I'll have the biggest
French fries you have.

280
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,501
You're Eric Taylor's girl, right?

281
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,163
Uh, yeah.

282
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:33,563
I was just wondering if y'all
had started packing yet.

283
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:34,861
Uh...

284
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:36,933
Things can get real
unpleasant around here

285
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:39,191
when you lose.

286
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,133
Can I help you?

287
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:45,563
I was just telling her
how it works around here

288
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:46,730
when you lose football games.

289
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,501
If you got a problem,
you can talk to me.

290
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,131
You don't have to talk
to my daughter about it.

291
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,861
I do have a problem.

292
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,031
I have a problem with you
pissing our season away

293
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,292
calling them dumb-ass plays.

294
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,363
I'm here with
my 15-year-old daughter.

295
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,060
You know?

296
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,433
So I'm just gonna
walk away right now.

297
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,700
That's really great
of you, though.

298
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,700
I sure appreciate that.

299
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,863
Come on, let's go.

300
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,700
You got no guts.

301
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,532
See, that's why you ain't gonna
never have one of these.

302
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,530
All right.

303
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:13,661
Don't listen to him.

304
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:15,993
Don't listen to that.

305
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,533
You won't even finish out
the year here, Taylor.

306
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:20,292
You will not last
one year.

307
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,443
These are some big horses
we're running up against.

308
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:31,720
Their offensive line averages
290 across the board.

309
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,260
Matt, how big's
our biggest guy?

310
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,363
Oh, Pudnick goes about 265.

311
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,560
When you run up against
the biggest boy on the block,

312
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:40,511
you gotta be faster.

313
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,642
Velocity kills,
gentlemen.

314
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,530
We need to be faster.
We will outlast them.

315
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,743
We will go above and beyond.

316
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,710
Smash, what the hell
you doin', son?

317
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,251
Hey, Coach, look, listen.

318
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,511
Me and the guys
have been talking.

319
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:58,453
Look, we got a tough game
coming up.

320
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,210
Shouldn't we work on
some hand-offs?

321
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,381
Give our QB some practice?

322
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,652
I mean, seriously,

323
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,083
we gotta get that boy
up to speed.

324
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,750
Maybe we should
get him a tutor.

325
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:08,681
We all know what the problem is.

326
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,683
Look, the guy's a weak link.

327
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,852
I'll tell you what.
Everybody listen up!

328
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,210
I was gonna let everyone

329
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,151
get out of here early
this morning.

330
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,283
But since you're
in such good shape,

331
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,711
What do you say
we run five more?

332
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,111
- Coach, are you--
- How 'bout ten extra ones?

333
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,851
- I don't see how this--
- 15 more!

334
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:24,910
I can count real high, Smash.

335
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,680
How high do you think
I can count?

336
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,951
You want to test me?!

337
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,081
Let's go!

338
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,283
Let's go!

339
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,782
Pick it up!

340
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:33,881
There he is.
There he is.

341
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,013
You wanted to talk to me,
Mr. Garrity?

342
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:39,212
Hello, Mr. Deitz,
how you doing?

343
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,851
Well, so there's this
stud quarterback

344
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:44,582
out of Louisiana.

345
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,410
He's displaced.

346
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,052
Katrina victim.

347
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,783
And he's over here now.

348
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:51,912
Name's Ray Tatom.

349
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,380
Voodoo Tatom?

350
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:56,283
You know him?

351
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,553
I know of him.

352
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,451
He's gonna be over
in Marlsboro

353
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:01,111
Thursday afternoon.

354
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,053
At that old lot over there,

355
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:04,680
about 2:00.

356
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:06,453
What I thought was
maybe you and I could

357
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,750
just kind of
ease over there.

358
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,353
You know, drive over there
and check him out.

359
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,812
See if he lives up
to the hype.

360
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,580
<i>Let's go, Smash!</i>

361
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,850
<i>Get on there!
Pick it up!</i>

362
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,312
Yes, sir.

363
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:24,511
Hey, you get the napkins
and stuff?

364
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,050
Yep, we're all set.
Good.

365
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,050
We better hurry.

366
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,251
All the girls are gonna
be there soon.

367
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:29,250
If no one's there
to tell 'em what to do,

368
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:30,650
they'll just fool around.

369
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,981
Slow down.
There's time.

370
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:40,312
So, your birthday's tomorrow.
What do you want to do?

371
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,681
I'm having dinner with Jason
in the hospital.

372
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,553
- Oh, honey...
- What?

373
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:47,581
You've been spending
so much time there lately.

374
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,050
I thought we could go out.

375
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,110
No, Mom, it's already
all planned.

376
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:52,253
Sorry.

377
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,452
Lyla, are you sure this isn't all

378
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:58,181
just too much?

379
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,553
I mean, you're at the hospital

380
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,013
every day.

381
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,911
You'd do it for Dad,
wouldn't you?

382
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,683
Well, yeah, but he's
my husband.

383
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:09,511
Well, I'm marrying Jason
someday.

384
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:11,181
Honey, you need to
accept the reality

385
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,613
of the situation.

386
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:15,052
I mean, this is a terrible thing

387
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:17,981
that has happened.

388
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,151
And  maybe you should
talk to someone.

389
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,852
He's coming back
from this, okay?

390
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,081
He just is.

391
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,581
That's all there is to it.

392
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,551
He needs me right now.

393
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,783
<i>*people are saying that time*</i>

394
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:35,552
<i>*Will take care of people like me*</i>

395
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,813
<i>*Say I'm livin' too fast, boy"*</i>

396
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,452
<i>*And no, I can't last*</i>

397
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,182
<i>*For much longer* *</i>

398
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:49,581
Yep, Matt, the river
of Rally Girls

399
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,652
- has pretty much run dry.
- Will you shut up?

400
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,151
Look at him go at it.

401
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,810
Ew, gross.

402
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,482
All right, wanna go get
a turkey burger?

403
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,112
Hey, Julie, I got you
some soy sausage.

404
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,412
Hey, Matt.

405
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,410
Thank you, but I'm actually
on my way out.

406
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:03,713
So you can have my pancakes.

407
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:05,781
All right, I'll see you later.

408
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,883
- All right.
- Bye.

409
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,812
Damn.

410
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,511
I heard about your new job.

411
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:12,952
- Mm-hmm. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

412
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:16,780
Jason Street is probably
never gonna play football again.

413
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,653
You know about as well
as I do.

414
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:22,082
And Matt Saracen is not
gonna take us to State.

415
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,350
The last school counselor
killed herself.

416
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,680
- That's right.
- I'm sorry?

417
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,682
Yeah, she killed herself
with pills, I think.

418
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:29,650
I was just thinking
it was about time

419
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,851
for us to move
on the Katrina kid.

420
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,480
Let me just say
one thing about that.

421
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:34,912
I hope this is
on the up and up,

422
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,480
because I really got
enough headaches going on

423
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:37,510
right now as it is.

424
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:38,652
Just let me handle it..

425
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,250
I just need you to
look at the tapes for me,

426
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,481
if you will.

427
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,512
Will you just look
at the tape, Coach?

428
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,811
Just look at it for me.

429
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,051
All right. All right.

430
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:53,352
Good. Look who it is.

431
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:55,510
My little ray of sunshine.

432
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:57,150
Not now, Smash.
Have you seen Tim?

433
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,512
He said he was gonna be here.

434
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,350
No, I haven't seen Rig.

435
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,311
He probably passed out
cold somewhere.

436
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,110
Let's talk about us.

437
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:07,080
I don't think so.

438
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,452
Hey, dumb-ass.

439
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,580
Just gonna ignore me?

440
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:34,310
Think I'll go away?

441
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,110
That's what I keep hoping,

442
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,652
but you don't seem to want
to get the message.

443
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,853
You know, you're such
a big tough guy.

444
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,151
You can't even go see Jason
in the hospital.

445
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,511
I mean, damn, it, Tim,
grow a set, why don't you!

446
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,480
'Cause we both know
that's what this is all about.

447
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,581
Hey, Tyra.

448
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,113
How's Smash?

449
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,750
Was he good?
Did you have a nice time?

450
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:06,850
Nothing happened.
Not really.

451
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,553
Besides, don't pretend like
you haven't slept with

452
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,112
half the Rally Girls.

453
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:13,310
We sure do have
something special here, Tyra.

454
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,453
You know,
maybe you're right.

455
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:17,013
Maybe I am wasting my time.

456
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,051
'Cause you are just another
mediocre football player.

457
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:21,652
who's gonna grow up
to drink himself to death.

458
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:23,551
Maybe we should just
end this right now.

459
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,283
I'll see you around then.

460
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:28,350
I am serious, Tim.
Are you listening to me?

461
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,452
If I get in that car
right now,

462
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:30,413
I'm never coming back.

463
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,012
Do you understand?

464
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,750
I get it.

465
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,782
That's it?

466
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,550
Breaking up for real,
and that's all you have to say.

467
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,552
That was great

468
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,183
All right, Tatom can
throw the ball.

469
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:01,583
Can he scramble under pressure?

470
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,282
Keep watching.

471
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,611
Kid's team went to the state
championship last year.

472
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,353
Broke three tackles
on a 40-yard touchdown.

473
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:11,111
You've seen this tape already?

474
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, I was over
at Buddy's last weekend.

475
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:17,181
Barbecue.

476
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:21,152
I didn't know y'all
were such good friends.

477
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,182
Hey, Tim.

478
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:29,380
Here's that paper on East of Eden.

479
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,453
I misspelled a bunch
of the words

480
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,282
so this time,
it'll look like yours.

481
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:34,811
And your biology homework
is on the bottom.

482
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:37,010
Thanks.

483
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:39,511
So I heard that you
and Tyra broke up.

484
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,183
Is it true?

485
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:44,483
I suppose it is.
Yeah.

486
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,311
Hey, Tim.

487
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,912
<i>Bye, Lyla.</i>

488
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:52,453
Tim? Hey.

489
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,882
We're having
a prayer meeting

490
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,282
for Jason this afternoon.

491
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,283
You wanna come?

492
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:01,582
What are we
praying for, Lyla?

493
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,611
A new spine for Jay?

494
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,081
Tim.

495
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,780
I know you never do anything
you don't want to do,

496
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,483
and I guess that's fine.

497
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:13,652
But don't insult me.

498
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,383
Excuse me, Mrs. Taylor?

499
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,410
Hey, Matt.

500
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,153
- Hey--oh.
- Come on in.

501
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,210
We'll do--
We'll do the rest later?

502
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:31,450
Yes, thank you.

503
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:32,410
Hey, Matt,
how are you?

504
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,151
How's it going?

505
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,183
I need to drop pre-calculus,

506
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,952
so that I can go
to morning practices.

507
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,582
Oh, okay.

508
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,753
When are you gonna take
pre-calculus?

509
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:44,912
Uh, next semester,
I guess,

510
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,080
when football is done.

511
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,511
All right, as long as
you take it.

512
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:49,953
Yeah, I'm gonna take it.

513
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,012
You sure?

514
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,452
Yeah.

515
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:53,983
Okay.

516
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,881
I know I saw drop cards
somewhere.

517
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,012
How have you been doing?

518
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,111
How are you holding up
through all this?

519
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,682
It's been kind of
a crazy time, has--

520
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:03,211
Drop card!
Here you go.

521
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,351
You can fill that out.
I'll sign it.

522
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:06,013
Yeah, we're gonna do
a lot better

523
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,212
against Arnett Mead,
so, you know,

524
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:09,850
don't worry about that.

525
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,453
No, but what I mean is
how are you doing?

526
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:12,681
I mean, you know.

527
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,512
I know your dad's in Iraq,

528
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:16,310
and that you're living
with your grandma, right?

529
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,511
Yeah, uh, I'm fine.

530
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,651
I mean, Grandma's
going through

531
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,180
one of her good spells
right now.

532
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:24,281
So that's--
that's good.

533
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:26,080
There are bad spells sometimes?

534
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,552
I mean, nothing, really.

535
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,081
Just, like, she gets
a little loopy sometimes.

536
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,881
I mean, she'll
put the ice cream

537
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,650
in the cupboard.

538
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:34,912
Or forget to take her medication,

539
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,111
that kind of stuff.

540
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:38,312
It's really not--
It's not a big deal.

541
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:39,752
Is it your responsibility

542
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,883
to make sure she takes
her medication?

543
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:45,883
Well, there's really
no one else around, so--

544
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,212
Boy, you got a lot on your plate.

545
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,980
I mean, I think
just football itself

546
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:51,551
is more than
a full-time job.

547
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:52,651
Yeah, well, I mean,

548
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,213
I really love playing football.

549
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:58,083
So I just hope
I get to keep playing.

550
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,382
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem.

551
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,181
You're doing a great job.

552
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:03,251
Yeah, but I keep hearing
that, like, they're trying

553
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:05,011
to bring in this Katrina
refugee, or something.

554
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,683
This quarterback
from New Orleans.

555
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,410
I never heard anything
about that.

556
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:13,251
Keep your head up.
Keep your head up.

557
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,211
Come on, Riggins, let's go.

558
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,312
Hold on to that ball.

559
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:21,953
Come on, keep digging your legs.

560
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,150
Come on, son.
What's your problem?

561
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,153
You do it again.

562
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:26,283
Keep your legs moving.

563
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,481
Keep your head up.
Keep digging.

564
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,410
Come on, son, let's go.

565
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:33,413
Let's go!

566
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:39,211
Keep your head up.
Keep digging your legs.

567
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:40,711
Keep your head up.
Keep digging.

568
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:44,611
Get over here.
Come here.

569
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:47,111
I don't see you preparing
for this game, son.

570
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:48,783
You go hard or you go home.

571
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:49,980
Come on, now, you're out here,

572
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:52,410
you give 110%, like everybody else.

573
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,711
You give 110% all the time.

574
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:56,350
Not just when you feel like it.

575
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,180
Now, come on, son, do it again.

576
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's do it again.

577
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:12,281
Don't do it, son.

578
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,213
Don't do that.

579
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,880
Don't do what I think
you're about to do.

580
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:18,981
Don't do that.

581
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:20,082
You don't want
to do that.

582
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,811
Son, don't--

583
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:24,983
Let him go, Coach.

584
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:28,982
Listen, he's been watching
the game film

585
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,353
from when Street got hurt.

586
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,950
I have a feeling he thinks
it's all his fault.

587
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:34,182
What the hell would he think
it's his fault for?

588
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:35,551
I don't know,
maybe he thought

589
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,082
he might have made
the tackle, or something.

590
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:38,951
The kid was 30 yards away.

591
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,880
Hey, hey, Coach, listen.

592
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:42,612
You can blame yourself
for just about anything,

593
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,251
if you think about it
long enough.

594
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:51,781
Hey, Coach.

595
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:54,512
Coach. What was that?

596
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:57,051
Did I just see Tim Riggins
just walk off practice?

597
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:58,250
You know, that is one thing
that never,

598
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,813
ever would have happened
in the old days.

599
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:01,812
Ever, you think?

600
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:03,113
- No.
- No way.

601
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:04,852
But you know, times have
changed, I guess, huh?

602
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,851
What can I do for you, Buddy?

603
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,651
Well, I just wanted to see
if you want to go with us

604
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,450
over to, you know,
talk to that kid.

605
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,510
That Ray Tatom kid.

606
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,682
Matt Saracen may be
a wild card.

607
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,452
You know one thing I like
about Matt Saracen?

608
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:18,051
- What's that?
- I don't have to be worried

609
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,181
about recruiting violations.

610
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,413
Who said anything
about recruiting?

611
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:21,681
I didn't say
anything about recruiting.

612
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:24,380
This is about that kid
whose whole family

613
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:26,410
has lost everything--
devastated by Katrina.

614
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:27,410
It'll help us out,

615
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,910
And we can help him out.
That's all.

616
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:30,381
That's all there is to it.

617
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:31,852
I mean, it's a win-win
situation.

618
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,683
Right, Mac?

619
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:46,282
Whoa! Hey, Coach.

620
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,283
Buddy.

621
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:49,111
Coach.

622
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,380
<i>What'd I tell you?</i>

623
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:55,010
I told you he'd be there.

624
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:56,282
Here it is.

625
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:57,751
We're here, Vic.

626
00:24:57,818 --> 00:24:59,553
You and everybody else.

627
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:02,251
Come on in.

628
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,880
Good to see you.

629
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:05,712
Hey, Voodoo.

630
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:06,751
Coach.

631
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,051
Good to see you.

632
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:09,880
How are you, son?

633
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,981
Look here.

634
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:16,211
This boy and his family have
been through a terrible time.

635
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:18,410
They lost everything in Katrina.

636
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:19,583
And they've been bouncing around

637
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:20,882
from place to place ever since.

638
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:22,451
The people of Dillon, Texas,

639
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:23,980
are here
to open their hearts.

640
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,981
We might be able
to provide housing.

641
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:29,212
Very fine,
very comfortable housing.

642
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,513
They need a fresh start.

643
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:34,781
We might be able to
get Mr. Tatom over there

644
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:36,411
a nice new job.

645
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:39,180
We could arrange that.

646
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,551
We might also even be able to

647
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:44,351
arrange a little fund.

648
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,611
You know, from some of
the local businesses.

649
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:49,451
Might be able to help a family

650
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,150
get back up on its feet.

651
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,510
We could set you up.

652
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,310
The town of Dillon
is a generous town.

653
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,010
It's a fine town.

654
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,082
It's a good place
to call home.

655
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,010
He gets a guarantee to start?

656
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:03,353
Oh, yeah. That's right.

657
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:04,410
Right, Coach?

658
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:05,410
You know what, Buddy?

659
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:06,451
Actually, I got
a problem with that.

660
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:07,682
I got a problem with that.

661
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:09,982
Well, now, you know,

662
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:11,553
the coach and I can work
on the details later.

663
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:14,383
The point is, you want to
go all the way, son?

664
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:16,082
I am going all the way.

665
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,883
You want to play college ball,
go to the pros?

666
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,480
That's the idea.

667
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,382
Then you want to be with
the number one team in Texas.

668
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:25,552
Your representation can squeeze
all it can out of this.

669
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:26,583
But it's not about new cars
and start-up money.

670
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:28,681
This is about your future.

671
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,112
And starting positions aren't
handed out in motel rooms.

672
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:31,252
They're earned on the field.

673
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:34,511
You want to play
with Arnett Mead, fine.

674
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:36,083
They're gonna have a short season.

675
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:41,012
- It's your choice.
- Ma'am.

676
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:42,210
It was nice to meet you.

677
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:46,551
I wish all the luck
to your family.

678
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,613
I am telling you
I need some help here.

679
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,411
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to do?

680
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,082
I want you to talk to her.

681
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,441
<i>You know, I love
how you can find time</i>

682
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:00,080
<i>to take an 80-mile road trip</i>

683
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,812
<i>if the Dillon Panthers
need something.</i>

684
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,083
<i>But if your own daughter--</i>

685
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:04,940
<i>Hey, hey, she is gonna be fine.</i>

686
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,310
<i>She's a smart girl.</i>

687
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:07,913
<i>She's got a good head on her shoulders.</i>

688
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,182
How is she fine?

689
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,711
<i>She's living in
a fantasy land..</i>

690
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:12,483
<i>She's not thinking
about college.</i>

691
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:14,141
She's not thinking
about her own future.

692
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,910
I mean, what's she gonna do?

693
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,580
<i>She's put all her eggs
in one basket,</i>

694
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:19,580
<i>and I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you and I let her.</i>

695
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,141
<i>Just give it some time.</i>

696
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,482
<i>'Cause she'll get bored,
and she'll move on.</i>

697
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,081
<i>- Mm-hmm. She will.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

698
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:31,312
<i>- Hey.
-Hey, kids.</i>

699
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:32,310
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

700
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,043
Did you eat any dinner?

701
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:35,980
Uh, no, I didn't.

702
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:37,313
But I think I can
find something here.

703
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:38,683
There's chicken in there.

704
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:40,511
Hey, you didn't tell me

705
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:41,780
that y'all are getting
a new quarterback

706
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:42,811
from New Orleans.

707
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:45,582
Where did you hear that?

708
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:49,813
Well, Matt Saracen
came in today.

709
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,083
He's feeling real
stressed out about it.

710
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:53,281
Really?

711
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:54,381
Matt Saracen's under
a lot of pressure, huh?

712
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:55,680
Yeah.

713
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:57,742
Maybe I should go over
to Matt Saracen's house

714
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,182
and make him some Omaltine,

715
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,680
read him a bedtime story.

716
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,843
I think you might want
to just try

717
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,841
a little compassion with him.

718
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,641
- Bye, Daddy.
- Hey, kiddo.

719
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:12,640
You don't need to be sarcastic.

720
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,441
You know what I think?

721
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:16,311
I think everybody
in this town is telling me

722
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:17,682
how to do my job.

723
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:19,111
And the one thing I think
those kids don't need

724
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:20,140
is that they don't need compassion.

725
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,582
That's what I think.

726
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:22,812
You want to know
what else I think?

727
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,510
What they do need to do
is they need to win.

728
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:25,941
And something else.

729
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,341
You and I,
we need to win, Tami.

730
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,981
We need to win.

731
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:32,080
Honey, there's Smash.

732
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:33,640
<i>Channel 13 Sports here
at Hermann Field,</i>

733
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:35,140
<i>where the Panthers had
a great season last year.</i>

734
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:39,211
<i>Hopefully they'll repeat
that success this year.</i>

735
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:40,580
<i>Been a lot of talk
around Dillon</i>

736
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,313
<i>that Taylor's not
the right guy for the job.</i>

737
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,010
<i>Oh, see, look, man,</i>

738
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,412
<i>I can't even mess with you.</i>

739
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:46,511
You're already trying
to get me in trouble.

740
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:47,712
<i>Oh, no.</i>

741
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,140
<i>I just want to know where you stand.</i>

742
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:50,780
<i>Come on, you must have
an opinion.</i>

743
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:53,480
<i>Oh, yeah, I got an opinion.</i>

744
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,512
<i>I mean, I would,
if I were you.</i>

745
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:55,541

746
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:57,813
<i>if the coach mismanages
this team.</i>

747
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,280
<i>Look, off the record,</i>

748
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:00,410
<i>I just think Coach T

00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:01,511

750
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:02,583
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

751
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:03,883
<i>See, I knew you had an opinion
about how things were going.</i>

752
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:06,380
Let it go.

753
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:07,783
How do you feel
about Friday night?

754
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:10,543
He's a stupid kid, honey.

755
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:12,041
Let it go.

756
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:15,813
Eric, what are you doing?

757
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:17,083
Just let it go.

758
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:18,783
Come on.

759
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,311
Mac, I want--

760
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,581
Yes, I did just see it.

761
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:24,710
I want you to
get the team together,

762
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,282
and I want you to meet me
at the field house

763
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,741
in a half an hour.

764
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,381
Yes, Mac, I know what time it is.

765
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:33,242
Mac, meet me at the field house
in half an hour.

766
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:35,543
Thank you.

767
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:39,743
Bye.

768
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,912
You guys have a nice night now.

769
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:47,443
Who's calling so late?

770
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,541
Who's calling so late?

771
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:53,210
I got--
I got it.

772
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:54,640
Hello?

773
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,343
Now?

774
00:29:57,646 --> 00:30:01,413
Coach is on the phone for you.

775
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:12,483
Hey...you better
get dressed.

776
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:15,780
Somebody gonna get that?

777
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,042
Noannie, get the door!

778
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,743
Hi, sweetie.

779
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:27,310
You get yourself dressed.

780
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:28,382
We're going on
a little field trip.

781
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:30,081
I'll see you in the car
in two minutes.

782
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:33,580
You tell your mother
I say hello.

783
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,612
What's goin' on?

784
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:47,343
I have no idea.

785
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:56,543
Let's go.
Everybody off the bus.

786
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,410
Let'go, gentlemen.
Let's go!

787
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:00,281
What's he gonna do,
kill us all?

788
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,282
Maybe.

789
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:02,810
Move 'em out.

790
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:05,011
Line 'em up!
Line 'em up!

791
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:07,541
Wind sprints,
up and down the hill.

792
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,081
Let's go.
Let's go.

793
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:12,742
Go, move it, come on.

794
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:17,512
If you think you're champions

795
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,981
because you wear
the Panther uniform,

796
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,443
you're wrong!

797
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:23,310
If you think you're champions

798
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:25,683
because they give you
a piece of pie at the diner,

799
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:27,413
you're wrong!

800
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,310
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

801
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:35,181
Champions don't complain!

802
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,711
Champions don't give up!

803
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,142
Let's go, Coach.
Send 'em now!

804
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:46,082
Champions don't give up!

805
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,710
Champions don't complain!

806
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:51,113
Champions give 200%!

807
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:57,740
You're not champions
until you've earned it!

808
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,513
Turn around.
Don't stay in them bushes.

809
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:18,740
Let's go! Let's go!
There you go. Let's go.

810
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:29,840
Coach, don't you think
maybe they've had enough?

811
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,781
I'll say when
they've had enough.

812
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:46,380
Clear eyes...

813
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,481
full hearts...

814
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:50,713
can't lose!

815
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:53,843
Clear eyes...
full hearts...

816
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,243
can't lose!

817
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:56,743
Clear eyes,

818
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:57,843
Clear eyes,
full hearts,

819
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:58,880
can't lose!

820
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:02,041
Clear eyes,
full hearts,

821
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:03,112
can't lose!

822
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:04,343
Clear eyes,

823
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,480
full hearts,
can't lose!

824
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:07,541
Can't lose!

825
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:09,783
Go!

826
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:20,890
Cute movie, right?

827
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,090
It was a pretty
sad birthday, huh?

828
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,893
No, it wasn't.

829
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:29,452
This was exactly
what I wanted, Jason.

830
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,190
Anyway, we'll go
to dinner next year.

831
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:34,420
When you're all better.

832
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:36,750
When I'm better?

833
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:37,820
Lyla, I don't know if you noticed,

834
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:38,950
but I'm not getting any better.

835
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,220
Can't you see that?

836
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:42,622
Come on, Jason,
you gotta have faith.

837
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:43,890
Lyla, stop.

838
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:47,893
Jason...listen to me.

839
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:50,352
This is just
a little hiccup.

840
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:53,793
That's all.

841
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:55,321
It's a year.

842
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:57,091
In one year, you'll be
back on track.

843
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:58,192
Lyla, stop it.

844
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,491
- You will go to Notre Dame--
- Stop it!

845
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,621
Stop!

846
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,622
My legs are never gonna get better.

847
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:06,793
Ever.

848
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:10,452
But there are cases,
lots of cases--

849
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,592
And those cases aren't me.

850
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:14,290
All right?

851
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,692
I don't even have
full use of my hands.

852
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:17,221
I'll be lucky
if I get that back.

853
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:19,451
I can't even put
my own shoes on and off.

854
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,851
How can you not see that?!

855
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:22,093
What the hell is wrong with you?!

856
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:24,321
I'm just trying to help.

857
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,691
Yeah, well, you're not helping!
You want to help?

858
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:26,951
Then stop pretending
that everything's okay!

859
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,452
Why are you getting so mad?

860
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,653
Because every night
when I go to sleep,

861
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:34,721
I dream that
I can walk again.

862
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:37,923
And every morning,
I wake up,

863
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:40,892
and I have to accept it
all over again.

864
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,750
And then you walk in here,

865
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:45,093
all smiles, and acting
like nothing's wrong.

866
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:46,620
And it's killing me!

867
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:48,122
So get this through your head.

868
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:49,192
All right?

869
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,722
My life as we knew it--
over.

870
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,450
Don't say that, Jason.

871
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:54,822
Football--over.

872
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:57,591
Notre Dame, going pro,
all that--gone.

873
00:34:57,655 --> 00:34:59,321
You and me?

874
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:01,092
We're not getting married.

875
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:06,290
So I need you to do
something for me, all right?

876
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,721
Get out.

877
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,491
Get out!

878
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,050
Don't just look at me,
go!

879
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:19,350
I'll be back tomorrow
for when they...

880
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:22,290
transfer you to the rehab facility.

881
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:42,052
What happened to Jason Street
was nobody's fault.

882
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:43,950
This is football.
Things happen.

883
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,920
It was an accident.
You understand me?

884
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:49,252
I didn't even try, Coach.
I didn't even--

885
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,692
You were on the other side
of the field.

886
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:51,822
It wouldn't have mattered.

887
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,292
It was an accident.

888
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:56,420
It was not your fault.

889
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:58,651
Look at me.

890
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,351
I want you to let yourself
off the hook, son.

891
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:03,451
I want you to let yourself
off the hook.

892
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:04,492
Yes, sir.

893
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,223
Be smart.

894
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:09,151
Yes, sir.

895
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:13,493
Now, you ever walk out
of one of my practices again,

896
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:16,452
and I will kick your ass
off the team.

897
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:18,523
That's a promise.
Understood?

898
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:19,693
Yes, sir.

899
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:23,323
You owe me a practice.

900
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,453
You walk home.

901
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,492
We'll call it even.

902
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:31,851
Coach.

903
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:53,691
<i>* If I keep holding out *</i>

904
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,551
<i>* Will the light shine through? *</i>

905
00:36:57,627 --> 00:37:01,421
<i>* Under this broken roof *</i>

906
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:03,422
<i>* It's only rain...*</i>

907
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:07,292
What are you doing here?
Do you want a ride?

908
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:10,900
Isn't it past
your bedtime, Lyla?

909
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:19,223
<i>* Come back *</i>

910
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:23,320
<i>* I have been planning on... *</i>

911
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,853
What, are you drunk again?

912
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,792
Soon enough, Lyla.

913
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,491
Soon enough.

914
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:32,290
You know, I thought
God would do me a favor

915
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,651
because I'm such a good girl.

916
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,491
Isn't that the stupidest
thing you've ever heard?

917
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,693
- It's not stupid--
- Shut up, Tim.

918
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:42,020
What's wrong with you?

919
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:45,401
Jason is in the hospital,
and you won't even go to see him.

920
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,790
You can walk!

921
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:50,503
You can walk on your two feet
to get another glass of beer

922
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:53,001
if that's what
you want to do.

923
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,452
Why don't you get it?

924
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,792
You make me sick.

925
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,651
Why won't you go see him?

926
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:05,251
He's your best friend.

927
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,453
He asks about you all the time.

928
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,490
Why don't you help me?

929
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:13,350
Why don't you got
and see him?

930
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,253
Don't hit me.

931
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:25,620
He's never gonna walk again.

932
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,392
<i>* And these days *</i>

933
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:30,121
<i>* They linger on *</i>

934
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:33,923
<i>* Oh, yeah *</i>

935
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,321
<i>* And every night *</i>

936
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:41,792
<i>* Been waiting for *</i>

937
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:44,852
<i>* A real possibility *</i>

938
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:50,890
<i>* That I may meet you
in my dreams *</i>

939
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,292
<i>* Sometimes you're there *</i>

940
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:58,052
<i>* And you're talking
back to me *</i>

941
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,822
<i>* Come the morning,
I could swear...*</i>

942
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:07,003
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Where have you been?

943
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:10,523
Practice.

944
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:23,550
<i>* It's okay *</i>

945
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,393
<i>* It's okay *</i>

946
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:55,093
Where's Lyla?

947
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:56,820
I thought she said
she was gonna be here.

948
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,392
All right, you ready?

949
00:39:58,456 --> 00:40:01,452
You gotta shift
your weight back...

950
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:10,000
- Hey, sorry, I'm late.
- Oh, there you are.

951
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:12,192
I was just asking about you.

952
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:15,192
Hey.

953
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,952
I'm real sorry
about last night.

954
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,651
Can we just pretend
like it didn't happen?

955
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:21,592
Okay.

956
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:22,951
You know I didn't
mean any of it.

957
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:29,103
- I love you.
- I love you too.

958
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:40,821
Oh. Thanks, Pop.

959
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:48,023
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

960
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,753
Okay, Jason, we're sure
gonna miss you around here.

961
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:52,851
I'll miss you, too.

962
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:54,991
Not the room, though.

963
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:57,293
I'll come back and visit.

964
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:06,751
Drive it up the field.
Official.

965
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:09,191
<i>Downfield. Visual.</i>

966
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:11,422
Good hands and feet, boys.

967
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:15,221
Good reaction.

968
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:17,251
Hut!

969
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:21,693
Do it again, do it again.

970
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:23,520
No, no, no, step back here.

971
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:25,622
That a boy.

972
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,321
Never underestimate the power
of a good spanking, Coach.

973
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:36,520
Yes, sir.

974
00:41:40,256 --> 00:41:43,303
Looking good out there, guys.
Looking good.

975
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:03,800
We got ourselves
a quarterback, Coach.

976
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:08,221
Nice speech, Coach.
Did the job.

977
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,823
Welcome aboard, son.

978
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,522
Jack!

979
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:20,393
Take care of this boy
for me, would you?

980
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,390
Let's go!
What's everyone doing?

981
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:30,423
What are you looking at?
Let's go, pick it up!

982
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:31,851
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

983
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,093
Keep your head up.

984
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:35,251
<i>Let's get back in it, boys.</i>

985
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:36,821
<i>Come on, now!</i>
