1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,699
What do you want to talk about, Tim?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,847
The fact that you're sleeping with
your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend?

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,046
Tatom, get over here

4
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,977
We gonna win, we gonna play my way.

5
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,298
<i>Oh, and it's picked off!</i>

6
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:13,079
Get outta my sight, son!

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,386
You are done!

8
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:15,840
- I don't care!
- You are done here!

9
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,141
Some questions have arisen about
about Ray Tatom's eligibility.

10
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,140
If he is deemed ineligible,

11
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,245
Ray Tatom won't be playing
football here anymore.

12
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:24,509
And Dillon will be stripped
of last night's victory.

13
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:31,541
<i>I'm here tonight at the Texas High School
Athletic Administration District meeting.</i>

14
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:34,440
<i>If it is found that district
regulations were violated,</i>

15
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:38,641
<i>Ray Tatom no longer be allowed to
participate in any varsity athletics.</i>

16
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,843
<i>More importantly,
last week's Dillon Panther win</i>

17
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:44,140
<i>over the Arnett Mead Tigers
would be ruled a loss.</i>

18
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:47,073
<i>- Can we change the channel?
...to see how this turns out for the Panthers...</i>

19
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,541
I don't get what the big deal is.

20
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:55,142
Kaster, she's just asking you
to turn your volume down.

21
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:57,650
It's not just me playing loud.
We're all doing it.

22
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,643
No, see, actually, she did
single out the bass player.

23
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,421
Hey, Saracen!

24
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:03,843
Get over here, man.

25
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:05,842
I'll be right back.

26
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,510
I'll count the seconds.

27
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,940
Hey, I want you
to meet some people here.

28
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,541
This is Tiff.

29
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:15,200
Look, I'm telling, Tiff.
This man right here is golden.

30
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,341
You better get him now before
somebody beats you to it.

31
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:19,423
Hey, that's not--
That's a Joke.

32
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,332
He's totally crossed over, man.

33
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,082
Would you calm down?
No, man.

34
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,403
Look at him.

35
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,350
Like the entire world
revolves around them.

36
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:31,400
Don't they know they're gonna
end up menial laborers one day anyway?

37
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,531
Virgin territory.
Smash, no. See, now that's--

38
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,213
I'm trying to help you out, man.

39
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,302
What you doing here, Voodoo?

40
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,503
Just getting a burger and fries, man.
You got a problem with that?

41
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,002
Yeah, I got a problem with that.

42
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,401
We all got a problem with that.

43
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,103
Why don't you find another
restaurant, man?

44
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,501
Why don't you go on back
cross that river?

45
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,000
What'd you say to me?

46
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,703
I said you should take
your wetback ass

47
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,603
right on across the river.

48
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:07,290
- It's not worth it.
- Just chill, just chill. Don't even listen.

49
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:11,401
- Don't even listen to him. All right, just chill.
- Everybody needs to just chill out.

50
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,730
Last thing you need right now
is to mix up with us, man.

51
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:15,073
Trust me.

52
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,461
Food sucks here anyway.

53
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,651
Move.

54
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:27,003
Take your bodyguards with you.

55
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,190
My man Rig.
Making the peace.

56
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:32,710
Hey, the news!

57
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:35,270
<i>We're live with Channel 8 Action Update.
We are here at the Texas High School
Athletic Administration District meeting</i>

58
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,272
<i>where board member Lance
Jennings is about to announce</i>

59
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:41,550
<i>the board's decision
about Dillon quarterback</i>

60
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,103
<i>Ray Voodoo Tatom's eligibility.</i>

61
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:46,501
<i>I would like to thank everyone
for their patience in this matter,</i>

62
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,520
<i>but I feel we need more time
for deliberations. Therefore,</i>

63
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,503
<i>we will not be issuing a final ruling
until some time later in the week.</i>

64
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:05,502
Hey, we're heading out.
You need a ride?

65
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:08,400
Uh, yeah.
Just gimme one minute, okay?

66
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,602
Get over yourself, man.

67
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,702
It's just a stupid football game.

68
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:15,900
In the large scheme of things,
do you think anyone's gonna give a crap?

69
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,101
Kaster, please, just go wait--

70
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,202
Am I right about that?

71
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,691
- Just go wait outside, all right?
- That's fine.

72
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,650
- Is this your buddy?
- Is he being serious right now?

73
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,530
He's joking.
He's making jokes.

74
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,810
I mean, I like Kaster okay
and everything.

75
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:31,212
But seriously, he's gotta learn
that he can't just talk to people like that.

76
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,960
I know.
I said that I'll talk to him.

77
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,240
What a dumb-ass thing to say, man.

78
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,613
Look, I'm sorry, man.

79
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,811
Sorry?

80
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,310
Look, man,
I'm sorry, all right?

81
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,911
You don't look sorry.

82
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:48,911
What's your problem, man?

83
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,113
Dumb football players, huh?

84
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,180
Man, chill. Come on.

85
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,580
You know that's not what I meant.

86
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,530
Is that what you heard?

87
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,371
Do you mean that?

88
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,333
Get off, man! Hey, Kaster!
Get off him! Kaster! Reyes!

89
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:12,531
Man, what the hell you doin'?

90
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,981
What the hell, man?
Let's turn him.

91
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:18,482
- Easy!
- No, just stay there. Just stay right there!

92
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,992
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe, man.

93
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:33,491
Friday Night Lights
s01e06 - El Accident

94
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,703
Blue, 52.
Hut!

95
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,530
Bring it back.
Hustle up, come on!

96
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,833
Coach, the board didn't come
to a decision.

97
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,212
So why am I not getting snaps?

98
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:28,152
All right, now, hey, coach!
Let's get 'em together. One minute, take a break.

99
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,191
One minute, bring it back
to the 30, let's go.

100
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,692
Hey, Reyes. Reyes.
What happened?

101
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:36,893
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:39,291
Last night with Kaster.
I know that kid.

103
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:42,393
He dissed us.
You heard him.

104
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,193
What are you talking about,
that stupid thing that he said?

105
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,141
It's done, man.
Get over it.

106
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,693
Let's go, gentlemen!
Let's go! Let's go!

107
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:49,812
Coach.

108
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:54,331
Sorry to interrupt your practice, Coach.
We need Bobby Reyes.

109
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,520
I've got a warrant on him.

110
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,193
What do you need Bobby for?

111
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,853
A ssault.

112
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:02,503
Get him.

113
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,252
Reyes!

114
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:06,871
Yeah, Coach?

115
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:10,193
Ron, you don't need
to use handcuffs.

116
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,532
Hell, come on.
Where's he gonna go?

117
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,193
Sorry about your practice.

118
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,763
Let's go. Come on.

119
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,163
Concentrate on the field.
Let that go, come on!

120
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,811
This is your job right here!

121
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:28,611
- Get under it, Saracen. Let's run this.
- It'll be all right, Reyes!

122
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,100
Tyra...

123
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,993
you're flunking algebra.

124
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,192
Ms. Kincaid hates me.

125
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,591
- She does not. Come on. 
- Yes, she does.

126
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,281
Well, if you fail it
with Mrs. Kincaid,

127
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:39,192
you're gonna have to go do it
next semester with Mr. Wendell.

128
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:40,491
Well, I'm not gonna be here
next semester.

129
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:41,791
Where're you gonna go?

130
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,693
California.

131
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:46,292
What are you gonna do in California
without a high school education?

132
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,591
I'm taking my GED.

133
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:50,693
Listen, I know.
I was just like you.

134
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:54,292
I was the pretty girl in school.
I was terrible at math.

135
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,493
I got myself through it.

136
00:06:56,496 --> 00:07:01,092
I don't wanna be you, Mrs. Taylor.

137
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:04,891
I don't wanna stay here.
Stuck in this small town...

138
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:07,090
in a job like this...

139
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,891
married to a coach.

140
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:12,393
Tyra, it's your choice.
If you wanna go off and take the GED, fine.

141
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,791
But you better bring me proof
that you did it.

142
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:18,491
Otherwise, you're taking algebra
with Mr. Wendell next semester.

143
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:20,150
Fine.

144
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,095
Mrs. Taylor?

145
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,099
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,491
I'm Kurt Kaster's mother.

147
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,291
Oh, come on in. Come on in.

148
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,990
I'm so sorry to hear about
what happened with your son.

149
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,023
Have a seat.

150
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:36,923
I was told to see you about
getting his homework

151
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,841
sent over to him at the hospital.

152
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,643
Yes, we've already arranged
that his daily assignments

153
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,521
are gonna be taken over there
every afternoon.

154
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:47,351
And then everything else that we need to do
academically will be taken care of.

155
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,571
I appreciate that.

156
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:49,552
Absolutely.

157
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,112
And just--if there's anything
else that I can do...

158
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,311
I raised my boy right,
Mrs. Taylor.

159
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,271
He's a good boy.

160
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,973
- Yes, he is.
- He doesn't get into fights.

161
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:01,493
A few days from now, that Reyes boy
is gonna be back on the football team

162
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:03,561
like nothing ever happened.

163
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,912
But I don't need
to tell you this, do I ?

164
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,901
You're the coach's wife.
You know how all this works.

165
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:10,143
Well, no, I don't actually.

166
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,250
Thank you for helping
about the homework.

167
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,300
You tellin' me the truth
straight up?

168
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,642
That's it.
They just talked.

169
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,931
Y'all are telling me
everything you saw?

170
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,232
That's it.

171
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:28,921
You have any idea how difficult it is
with these recruitment accusations

172
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:30,001
flying around right now?

173
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,262
Now I gotta deal with Reyes
and this Kaster kid situation.

174
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,510
It's just as much your fault
as it is his.

175
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:36,971
From now on, when you're out,

176
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,801
you hear something, you see something
you're gonna stop it.

177
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:43,100
As leaders of this team, that is gonna be
your job. Are we clear?

178
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,491
Yes, sir.

179
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:47,000
Good.
That's all I got to say.

180
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:50,091
You ever get an answer back
on that request we put in

181
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,790
for extra time
in the weight room?

182
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,043
Not yet.

183
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,332
Jason's making world-class progress.

184
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,192
I'll make sure and get you
an answer on that.

185
00:08:58,235 --> 00:08:59,461
Thanks.

186
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,460
What's so funny?

187
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,590
You know what they call you
around here?

188
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,001
- What?
- "Advocado."

189
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,730
I don't get it.

190
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:13,402
- It's like advocate and avocado.
- I don't find that very amusing.

191
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,890
It is funny.
Come on, think about it.

192
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,930
They pumping you
with nitrous or something?

193
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,390
What is going on with you?

194
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,801
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

195
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,093
Come here.

196
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,490
- Jason, we can't do this.
- Yeah, we can.

197
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:30,403
- We're in a public place.
- I knew it.

198
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,761
- I knew it!
- What?

199
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,263
We have a visitor.

200
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:35,990
Oh, my...

201
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:40,860
Lyla, I gotta tell you.
I am horny as hell right now.

202
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,031
- Jason!
- What?

203
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:45,792
I have never heard you talk
like this in my life.

204
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,293
- That's just naughty.
- Naughty.

205
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:55,360
You are one of a kind,
you know that?

206
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,491
Hey, Lyla.

207
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,332
Hi, Francine.

208
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,203
Is it possible that we could have
about 40 minutes of privacy?

209
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:10,302
No, Jason.
We don't need it.

210
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:11,833
Can I talk to him for
a second, Lyla?

211
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,193
Yeah, sure.
I'll just be outside.

212
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,661
You wanna make sure you don't get any dirt
up in this carburetor.

213
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,861
Mess your engine up something fierce.

214
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,162
Looks like we got company.

215
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,692
What's up?

216
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,413
Tim, we have to stop this.

217
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,433
Look at me, Tim.

218
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,153
Please.

219
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,602
Jason is getting out of there soon.
He's changing.

220
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:57,662
He's getting back to his old self.

221
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,610
So you're done with me?

222
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,943
- Tim, don't.
- Don't what?

223
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:07,503
Don't react like that.
You knew this had to end.

224
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:11,601
Look, I take full responsibility for
everything that's happened.

225
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,130
It's all my fault.

226
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:16,370
Sounds like it was the biggest
mistake of your life, Lyla.

227
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:19,103
I feel like I have to make
a choice here, Tim,

228
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:23,400
before things get more messed up
than they already are.

229
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,873
I care about you, Tim.
I do.

230
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,270
I just...

231
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't live
with myself anymore.

232
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:37,601
Bye, Lyla.

233
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,460
So you're telling me
I can't have sex?

234
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:48,040
No, I said it isn't
medically safe to ejaculate.

235
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:52,203
You see, that's funny 'cause I always
kinda put the two together.

236
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,501
Jason, look.

237
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:57,703
Semen can backflow into your bladder
and it can cause a whole bunch of things,

238
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:01,342
especially a severe
urinary tract infection.

239
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:04,063
You know, I like you
a lot, Francine, but...

240
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:08,403
you really know how
to break a guy's heart.

241
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,191
I'll check on you later, okay?

242
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,703
Mrs. Kaster came
and talked to me today.

243
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:20,072
I don't...oh, yeah.
How's the boy doing?

244
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,402
Well, he's not doing very well.
You know, Reyes really did a number on him.

245
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:26,401
I know. Listen, he's a good kid.
He just gets a little hot under the collar.

246
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,501
A little hot under the collar?

247
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,103
I mean, he put him
in a hospital, bad.

248
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,001
I understand that.

249
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,771
I guess I'm just a little
curious about what you think--

250
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,000
You know, what you're going to
do about that whole situation.

251
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,440
What do you mean, what am I
gonna do about it?

252
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:37,903
Well, I mean,
I think you're in a position

253
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,903
- where you might be able to--
- Wait, wait-- Let me ask a question.

254
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,072
Who am I talking to right now?

255
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,001
Am I talking to the guidance counselor,
or am I talking to my wife?

256
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,501
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

257
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,103
What do you mean, I'm either speaking to you
as a guidance counselor,

258
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,601
- as your wife.
- Sometimes I don't really know.

259
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:50,100
It doesn't make a difference
how I'm speaking to you.

260
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:51,801
Sometimes it does make--
There's something that I--

261
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:52,903
Well, I'm just curious about
how you're--

262
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:53,900
...involved in the situation.

263
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:54,870
This is a very serious situation.

264
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,241
Hey, honey.
How are you today?

265
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,741
Hey, guys.
You all good?

266
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,872
Gooood.

267
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,101
You have a good day at school?

268
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,202
Yeah, a blast.

269
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,341
Here, I got you something.
I got you something.

270
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:03,842
I got you an apple.

271
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,002
Oh. Gee whiz.

272
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:06,702
Apple of your daddy's eye.

273
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:18,300
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me.

274
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,223
Hi.

275
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,530
Thanks.

276
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:31,503
Come on in.

277
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:32,972
I just, you know,

278
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,603
wanted to stop by to let you know
that Bart Oliver asked me out.

279
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,771
- Bart?
- Hummm...

280
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,602
He's a defensive end.

281
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah, I know who he is.

282
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:45,902
Well, you know, I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

283
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:49,003
before anyone else ends up in the
hospital like that Kaster kid.

284
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:51,042
Don't flatter yourself, Tyra.

285
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:53,742
You know, I'm trying to be
the mature one here.

286
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,600
- Douche bag.
- That's classy.

287
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,440
Have a good day.

288
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,772
You're such a jerk, Tim.
You know that?

289
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,242
H ello?

290
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,503
I need you to come down here, Timmy.

291
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:09,103
J?

292
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,861
There's something I gotta talk
to you about.

293
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,153
Where?
The rehab center?

294
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:14,800
Where do you think?

295
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,840
Come on.
Just get down here, all right?

296
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,900
Yeah, man.

297
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:27,432
Well, i'm glad you called me on this, Eric.

298
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:28,800
It's the right thing to do.

299
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,952
I'll make sure this kid
gets a fair shake.

300
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,080
He's a good kid.

301
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:35,603
And the last thing this team needs
is having our star defensive player

302
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,150
sitting over here in the jail.
Oh, and another thing.

303
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:42,902
We may have to go back in again in front
of the Athletic Administration.

304
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:43,900
What?

305
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:47,303
Well, evidently, when they interviewed
Voodoo's family, somebody mentioned

306
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:50,203
the "academic council"
we had with Voodoo.

307
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,402
That's what you call that?
Academic council?

308
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,352
Yeah.
The meeting we had.

309
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,583
- Damn, Buddy.
- What?

310
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,213
When did all this take place?

311
00:14:57,255 --> 00:15:00,651
Look, he has to have 30 days
of established residence

312
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,901
- before he even puts a uniform on.
- Damn, Buddy.

313
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,912
The meeting took place in July.

314
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,001
The meeting took place two weeks ago.

315
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:09,300
- Hey, don't worry about it, okay?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

316
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,000
Every single team
in the district did exactly

317
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,863
- the same thing that we did.
- Don't ask me to lie.

318
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,603
I'm not gonna ask you to lie.

319
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:20,001
Let's just solve this crisis
right now, okay? One crisis at a time.

320
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,102
Let's take care of Reyes,
and then we'll do the other deal later.

321
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,732
Made a mistake, Coach.

322
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:30,763
I don't know what to do. I'm scared.

323
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,360
Yeah, well, it sounds like
you made a mistake.

324
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,700
Why don't you tell me exactly
what happened?

325
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:38,500
We're at the sandwich shop.
Just there, you know, hanging out.

326
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,392
We, uh--we were watching
the hearing on TV.

327
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,363
I guess I was a little pissed.

328
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:47,201
Then Voodoo comes in... comes right in,
like nothing even happened.

329
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,902
All right, that's all great.
How'd the Kaster kid get involved?

330
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:54,201
When that guy came on TV and said that
they were coming up with a decision,

331
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,402
you know, we all got upset.

332
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,061
Then that Kaster kid comes in
and he starts mouthing off

333
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,803
about football players
and talking smack about the team.

334
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:07,703
You know that no matter
what anyone says to you,

335
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:11,192
that doesn't give you the right
to cause physical harm to them, don't you?

336
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,500
- You understand that?
- Yeah, Coach.

337
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,503
Then why would you be so stupid, son?

338
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:22,920
Then I...

339
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,500
Kaster kid called me a wetback.

340
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:31,703
Well, that's not right.
I mean, that's just racist is what that is.

341
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,362
He said I should go back to Mexico.

342
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:36,232
I'm not even from Mexico, Coach.

343
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:39,400
Anyway, I went outside afterwards

344
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,560
and asked him to apologize
for what he said.

345
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,431
He didn't want to apologize.

346
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:46,803
So he goes up
and he tries to hit me.

347
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,830
So we started fighting, Coach.

348
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:53,601
He's trying to fight me. I fight back.
It just set me off so bad.

349
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,502
I've been trying to control my temper.
You know I have, Coach.

350
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,003
You're telling me the truth?

351
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,301
- Yes, sir.
- You look me right in the eye.

352
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,511
You tell me you're telling me the truth.

353
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,942
Coach, I'm telling you the truth.

354
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:30,710
Six.

355
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,293
Took you long enough to get here, man.

356
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,472
My truck ain't runnin'.

357
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,423
We're putting in this
four-barrel carb.

358
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:41,722
I hitched a ride, man.

359
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,892
Sorry.

360
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,221
I'm guessing you know
what this is about.

361
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:48,003
- I do?
- Yeah, of course you do.

362
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,301
You wanna call yourself
my best friend

363
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:53,001
and you haven't shown up but once
since I've been in here.

364
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,002
Six weeks, man.
Six weeks.

365
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,060
Let me go ahead and recap my life for you
over the last couple of weeks, huh?

366
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:00,693
My day starts out with me
laying down on this bed.

367
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,203
Well, pretty much the whole day
takes place with me laying down

368
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,091
on this bed on my sorry
quadriplegic ass.

369
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,220
Every day, people come in here
and poke and prod at me

370
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,792
like I'm a piece of meat.

371
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:12,001
Go ahead and stick a catheter in me
in places you don't even want to know about.

372
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:14,552
My big adventure of the day
is going to the commode.

373
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,392
'Cause I gotta go
the same time every day

374
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,063
so I can teach my body
how to crap on cue.

375
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,422
Impressive, huh?

376
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,591
And then Lyla comes running in.

377
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:26,691
I wanna know if she's as chipper
out there as she is in here.

378
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,000
'Cause I'll tell you what--
I love that girl... I do.

379
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,501
I love her more than life itself.
But I'll tell you what.

380
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,853
If she tells me how great
everything's gonna be when...

381
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,752
I finally get out of here
one more time, I'm gonna lose it.

382
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,323
Point is this, Timmy.

383
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:42,023
While I'm in here dealing 
with all this, by myself,

384
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,562
and my best friend's out there

385
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,692
putting a four-barrel carb
in his damn truck.

386
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,552
Is that what's important
right now?

387
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,451
Answer me this, Timmy...

388
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,202
What happened to Texas forever?
Huh?

389
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,620
What happened to livin' large?

390
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:57,122
What happened to that eternal bond

391
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,350
that you used to love to throw
around when I was still health

392
00:18:58,397 --> 00:18:59,990
and headed towards the NFL, huh?

393
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:04,603
I need you here, Tim.
I need you here.

394
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:07,003
I expect...

395
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,400
I expect you here.

396
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:13,351
You are my best friend.

397
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,501
Grace period's over.

398
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,092
It's embarrassing for me to admit, but...

399
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,062
before things got physical,

400
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:28,290
Kurt Kaster called me
and my family racist names.

401
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,591
Said I was a...

402
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,321
A dirty wetback jock who should
go back over the border

403
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,731
with my dirty wetback mom.

404
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,852
I realize that--
that what I did was wrong.

405
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:43,541
And that I should have responded
in a more mature way.

406
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:46,751
I've been released on bail,
but the Kaster family

407
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,823
is still pressing charges against me.

408
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:51,721
I just wanted everyone to hear the truth.

409
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,860
You know, directly from me.

410
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,492
Thank you.

411
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,961
I'm not buying his story.
I'm not buying that.

412
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,462
What do you mean
you're not buying it?

413
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:02,591
Kurt Kaster is a straight-A student.

414
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,160
He's on the student mentoring program.

415
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,790
And I talked to his mother.

416
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,091
I just--
I just--

417
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:11,621
I don't feel that he
would've said those things.

418
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,690
Look, people--
they say stupid things.

419
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,493
They're--they're teenagers.

420
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:18,701
She just knew in her heart that
he didn't do it. I believed her.

421
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:21,903
Look, I've known Reyes for a long time.
I've coached him for a long time.

422
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:22,861
- Did you know that--
- He's not the kind of kid

423
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,190
- he's got a record?
- That's gonna go and do something like that.

424
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:26,062
Did you know that he's been arrested twice?

425
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:29,792
Two burglaries, and one of them,
he resisted arrest.

426
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,601
Well, he is a little bit--
He's had a tough upbringing.

427
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,961
That's not what we're talking about.

428
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm not saying it was the right thing
for him to do-- beat the hell out of this kid.

429
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:39,392
But he was obviously provoked.

430
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:43,702
I would like for you to really look
at all sides of this thing.

431
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,401
Of course I've looked at all sides of it, honey.
I'm just telling ya...

432
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,301
I looked that kid right in the eye.
He's telling the truth.

433
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:49,752
All right?

434
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,120
I can tell.

435
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,511
Hey, who you taking to homecoming?

436
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,101
Man, you should take
that, uh, rally girl, Drew.

437
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,892
Uh, no, I got--I got someone
else in mind, so--.

438
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,003
Aw, man, quit stalling!
Come on.

439
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,452
Hey, I bet your granny
still cut an ill two-step.

440
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:08,021
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

441
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:09,620
Can I talk to you for a second?

442
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,703
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up? What's going on?

443
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,021
Reyes lied.

444
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,763
Look, man, you weren't outside, okay?

445
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,801
Neither of us were.
We don't know that for sure.

446
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,893
Well I mean, we've known Kaster
since the seventh grade.

447
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,263
I mean, he's not a racist.

448
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,233
He's never said one racist thing.

449
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,562
Voodoo's the one who said
all that stuff.

450
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,902
Yeah, but it's over now, okay?
It's done.

451
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,101
It's--It's not over.
I mean, you-- you can do something.

452
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,103
- What am I supposed to do?
- You wanna make a statement?

453
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,203
Call a press conference?

454
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:33,963
I mean, you're the starting
quarterback, aren't you?

455
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:35,232
Wait, I'm not--
I'm not Peyton Manning.

456
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,761
I can't call a press conference.

457
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,803
I've played three high school football games.
I haven't even started all of them.

458
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,261
If we need to stop at 12 we can.

459
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,303
- I can do 15.
- Okay.

460
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,590
J. Street.

461
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,031
- Hey, uh, Kristen?
- Yeah?

462
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,761
Could we, uh...
Could we get just a couple minutes?

463
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:03,962
Sure.

464
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,732
Can you spot him so he
can't--doesn't fall forward?

465
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:07,301
- Yes, ma'am.
- He just got his brace off.

466
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:10,401
Put one hand right there.
There you go.

467
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,100
And you do it slow.
There you go.

468
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,633
Thank you.

469
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,501
Brace off today.
How nice. Congrats.

470
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:26,203
What say you and me
get out of here later?

471
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,362
Yeah, great idea.

472
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:32,001
- Where do you think we're gonna go?
- I got some ideas.

473
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:34,633
Tell you what,
anywhere but here, man.

474
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,120
It smells.

475
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:40,303
It smells like a hospital, man.
I hate hospitals.

476
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:42,591
All right, genius, when--
when are we doing this?

477
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:45,333
I'm thinking tonight.

478
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,063
Let's do it.

479
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,302
I'm not lying.

480
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:56,612
Hey--

481
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,510
You wanna coach big time
high school football?

482
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:02,011
'Cause that's what every single
one of these coaches does.

483
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,400
This is part of the deal.

484
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,612
You wanna coach,
you better get ready for this.

485
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:08,403
This is just the way it is,
and I don't like it any more than you do.

486
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:09,712
So get it together.

487
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,332
Let's go in there and get this done.

488
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,882
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

489
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:20,152
My God, Taylor.
Forrest frickin' Aiken.

490
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,181
- How are you, man?
- Good to see ya.

491
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,453
Good to see you, Buddy.
How's Pam?

492
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,000
She's fine, she's fine.
How about yours?

493
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,352
Doin' well. Keeping me in line.

494
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,380
Yes, sir.

495
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:30,601
Listen, have a seat, have a seat.
Yeah. I can't believe it's you.

496
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,180
Hey, Coach, this is my old buddy--

497
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,402
- Forrest Aiken.
- Hi, how are you doing?

498
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:36,612
We played football together at UT.

499
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,411
Played defense.

500
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:41,701
- Coach, how you doin'?
- Uh, just fine. Everything's going just fine.

501
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:44,702
You know, Coach, I hate that
you're having to go through all this.

502
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,003
And I'm sure you'd rather be spending
time with your boys right now.

503
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:48,481
I know you got a big game
this Friday night.

504
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:50,483
Yes, a big one coming up.
That's for sure.

505
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:54,100
Well, I've looked through this and, uh,
let's cut through all the hoopla.

506
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,512
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's--

507
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:58,501
- Let's settle this matter.
- That sounds good to me.

508
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,112
I feel real comfortable with it.

509
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,580
I've looked over it
and I feel real good about it.

510
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:05,201
- I think everything's gonna be just fine.
- That's good.

511
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:08,252
Attention please.

512
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:11,583
Assistant Principal Trucks here
with a little news update.

513
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,911
The ruling just came down from
the Athletic Administration.

514
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:18,983
Ray Tatom was deemed eligible
to play in last week's game.

515
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:22,900
This means the Panther victory
over Arnett Mead still stands.

516
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:23,932
Oh, yeah!

517
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,103
State! State! State!

518
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:45,851
Just reach behind me and lift.

519
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:46,800
- Ready?
- Yep.

520
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,372
Why don't you save some of that Jell-O

521
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,070
for the other patients, Street?

522
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,943
You kidding me?

523
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:55,503
- You good?
- I'm in.

524
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:56,540
I'm in, I'm in.

525
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,871
Just swing my legs around.

526
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,543
Okay, I got you.

527
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:01,870
What is going on?

528
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:06,552
- Field trip.
- Field trip?

529
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,572
Yeah.

530
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,001
Who did you clear this with?

531
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:11,001
Street.

532
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,003
Can I talk to you for a second?

533
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,041
Yes.

534
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,272
Go easy on him, boss.

535
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,702
- Tim, what are you doing?
- We're going on a little ride.

536
00:25:22,797 --> 00:25:24,603
Going on a little ride?

537
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,041
Yes.

538
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,441
You ready to rock and roll?

539
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:36,772
Hold on just a second.

540
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,671
Lyla...

541
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:39,670
Come with us.

542
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,203
No, no. You guys go.

543
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,270
I'll be behind you
with the police brigade.

544
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:47,403
Come here. Come here.

545
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:52,900
Let's just for once let
the rules go, all right?

546
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:55,141
I need this.
You know I need this.

547
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,270
Come on.

548
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,172
You guys are crazy.

549
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,002
Timmy, let her in.
She's coming along.

550
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:15,272
<i>A man named Gene's
got a beautiful voice</i>

551
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,802
You know how great this is?

552
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:21,001
Me, you, Riggs, open road, fresh air.

553
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:23,273
No hospitals.

554
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:24,801
Man, did I need this.

555
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:27,371
<i>Just sing me a song</i>

556
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:28,973
<i>And if it's sad</i>

557
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,401
<i>I'll sing along,
long, long</i>

558
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:35,140
<i>I told you
I knew every word</i>

559
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,600
- And a straw.
- Don't forget the straw!

560
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:40,003
Don't forget the straw!

561
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:44,272
I'm really glad you came, babe.

562
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,372
Me too.

563
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,641
I, uh...

564
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,000
Running a little low on the cash.

565
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:01,200
What a surprise.

566
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,271
- Be right back.
- Ok.

567
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,201
I don't want this to be awkward.

568
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,103
Well maybe we can start
by you not shoving

569
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,952
your tongue down his throat, Lyla.

570
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:16,700
I can't take all the blame for this.

571
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:18,300
Oh, and here I thought you
were taking responsibility.

572
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:19,301
Oh, shut up, Tim.

573
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:22,001
Lyla, look--

574
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,603
It's J's night, all right?
Let's just get through this for him.

575
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:33,272
You ready?

576
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:37,070
Uh!

577
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:39,702
You ain't in game shape,
are you, Streeter?

578
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:42,403
How are you supposed to carry your team?
You can't even carry me.

579
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:43,743
Maybe I should just
get rid of the chair

580
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:45,803
and have you carry me around everywhere.

581
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,742
Street!

582
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:51,241
Here you go.
Two burgers, straight up.

583
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:55,802
- Hey, picking up for Taylor.
- Sure, one minute.

584
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,071
Thank you.

585
00:27:57,858 --> 00:27:58,542
Hey.

586
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,002
Hey.

587
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:02,500
So where's the other one?

588
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,803
Ah.
Trouble in paradise.

589
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,073
It's this whole Reyes thing.

590
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,901
You mean the guy who nearly
killed the other kid

591
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:14,903
but nobody's gonna do anything about it
because he plays football?

592
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,773
So I guess that puts you
on his side?

593
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,570
No, it...

594
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,243
I just think you should man up
and talk to him.

595
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:24,142
I mean, you two look pretty
pathetic without each other.

596
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,503
There you go, hon.
Do you need any utensils?

597
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,742
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

598
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,473
All right, look, I thought about
what you said, all right?

599
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:42,071
And?

600
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:45,970
And I think, well, you're not really
recognizing my position in all this.

601
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:47,800
Look--I'm under a lot of pressure.

602
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:51,202
I'm supposed to lead this team.
They're depending on me.

603
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:54,700
I just can't make accusations
about my teammates.

604
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,042
You're Matt Saracen.
QB1, right?

605
00:28:57,145 --> 00:29:00,670
Look, can you just cut me some slack?
You're supposed to be my best friend, okay?

606
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,600
Fine, all right?

607
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,303
Reyes--Reyes is a crazy son of a bitch,
but he's key to our defense.

608
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,603
We're relying on him.

609
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:11,071
He also assaulted
one of our friends.

610
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:15,003
Or do you not have time to think about that
with all the pressures and everything?

611
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:17,300
Lovers spat?

612
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:19,200
Look, not now, Reyes, all right?

613
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,443
What's wrong?

614
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:24,372
Where are you going?

615
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,471
Home.

616
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:26,970
Did I upset you?

617
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:29,300
- Just leave him alone.
- What's wrong with him?

618
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:30,841
Just leave him alone, okay?

619
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:35,270
I mean, do you realize that if you weren't
a Panther you'd be in jail right now?

620
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,901
- Excuse me?
- He didn't say nothing.

621
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:39,900
You assaulted Kaster.

622
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,402
And you just think that you're gonna
get away with it, don't you?

623
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,002
You better watch what you're saying, man.
Seriously.

624
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm not afraid of you.
If that's what you think.

625
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,840
What are you talking about?

626
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:56,000
Reyes..

627
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,102
You're not worth it, man.

628
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,102
Hey--

629
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:09,502
Landry!

630
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,543
Get him off me!

631
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,300
Lay off me!

632
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:18,743
Come on, man!

633
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:21,400
Go home! You don't need this!
Okay?

634
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:23,742
Just stop!

635
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,271
Just go home!

636
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:31,140
You know what?
Kaster was right about you.

637
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,503
You did cross over.
You're one of them. Congratulations.

638
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:56,230
I could be out here
all night listening to this.

639
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:58,063
Just nothin'...

640
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,753
Congratulations on the Voodoo decision.

641
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,090
You know it could've gone
the other way, don't you?

642
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:15,191
Why, exactly?

643
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:19,803
You go with Buddy Garrity
out to a seedy little motel

644
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:24,802
to meet a kid named Voodoo.
Along with a manager.

645
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,801
And then ol' Buddy,
he starts promising things.

646
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:31,502
- What kind of things?
- He starts promising things.

647
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,922
But you didn't do that, sugar?

648
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:41,202
I think sometimes that for anyone to do
what I do it is damn near impossible

649
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:44,823
to not to sell your soul just
a little bit down the river.

650
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,450
Think you just keep doing
what you're doing, Coach.

651
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:51,895
- Taking it one day at a time.
- You know what I really love?

652
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:53,492
Mm-hmm.

653
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:54,593
I love football.

654
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:58,652
- I love football.
- I know.

655
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:00,353
I love those kids.

656
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,193
Hey, Matt.

657
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:13,301
- Hi, Julie. H--how's it going?
- Um, not bad.

658
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,903
How was dance rehearsals?

659
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:18,000
Dance--It's--
It's going really good, you know.

660
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:21,203
We have, uh, like,
three practices a week now.

661
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:23,820
Um, the girls are doing
really good, so...

662
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:25,393
- That's good.
- Yeah.

663
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:28,190
Uh, is--Is your dad around?

664
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:30,352
Uh, yeah, yeah.

665
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,320
Um... Dad, Saracen's here.

666
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:38,720
What's going on?

667
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,320
You all right?

668
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,003
Yeah.

669
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:46,792
What's up?

670
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,651
Kaster didn't say anything racist.

671
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,021
Thought you said you weren't outside.

672
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,053
I wasn't.

673
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,951
I--I was inside, but...

674
00:32:56,098 --> 00:32:57,651
But I know Kaster.

675
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:01,502
I've known him a long time, and I don't think
he would say anything like that.

676
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,820
And besides, that wasn't really
the way it was going anyway.

677
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:08,000
Voodoo's the one who called
Reyes a wetback.

678
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:09,850
Not Kaster.

679
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:14,653
And I think Reyes was probably just ...
all riled up...after that.

680
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:19,000
And then Kaster was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

681
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,350
I know I should've said something sooner.

682
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:27,720
I think I might've been confused
between what was right for the team and what...

683
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,650
And what was right.

684
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:33,593
Anyway...
sorry I bothered you.

685
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,253
Good night, Coach.

686
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,450
Hey, Matt.

687
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,171
Tell your grandmother
I say hello.

688
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,761
I will.

689
00:33:45,428 --> 00:33:46,850
Good night.

690
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,952
Hey, I'm Coach Taylor.

691
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:56,023
Yeah, I know who you are.

692
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,523
I was wondering if, uh,
if I could talk to Kurt.

693
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,602
Please.

694
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,761
Hey there, son.

695
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,290
I want to apologize for what happened.

696
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:17,903
When I get back to school,

697
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:22,003
every football player's gonna have a
piece of me on a daily basis.

698
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,250
Thanks for the apology, Coach.

699
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:27,533
I can guarantee you no football
player's gonna come near you.

700
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:32,102
There is no excuse
what Bobby Reyes did to you.

701
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:44,000
Remember when we were just junior high
schoolers, Street, sneaking down here?

702
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:46,500
Dreaming about playing varsity?

703
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,323
You know, things have changed, Tim.

704
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,091
We're still getting
that hunting ranch, Street.

705
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:55,603
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that
without my NFL money and your whopping 1%?

706
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:59,500
That's just it.
I think I'm gonna go pro.

707
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:02,891
You think you can do that?

708
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:03,892
No.

709
00:35:06,558 --> 00:35:08,003
Nope.

710
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,653
But, I mean, that's just
the money part anyways.

711
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:13,893
We can figure that out.

712
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:18,791
Best friends, right? Wasn't that
always more important than football?

713
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:20,393
No.

714
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,650
Not always.

715
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,120
It is now.

716
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:28,990
Three of us.

717
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:32,923
We'll rise up.
Together.

718
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:35,822
Get through anything.

719
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:38,252
Anything at all.

720
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:54,332
Have a seat.

721
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:02,951
What's up, Coach?

722
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,203
I was down there trying to help you,
and you looked me right in the eye and you lied.

723
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,893
I'm not wrong, am I?

724
00:36:16,328 --> 00:36:18,621
Can you even admit the truth?

725
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:21,260
That boy didn't call you
any names, did he?

726
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:24,290
No, sir.

727
00:36:24,328 --> 00:36:26,502
You went and you beat the hell
out of that kid

728
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:29,620
and then you made up a lie
and ditched everything onto him.

729
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,220
That's a hell of a position
you put me in, isn't it?

730
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:35,300
Come on, Coach. I had to lie, Coach.
You know I had to lie.

731
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,720
I was scared, Coach.

732
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:40,103
You need to pack up your personals and clear
out your locker. You're off the team.

733
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:41,802
You can't do that to me, Coach.

734
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,821
Football's all I got.
You screwed yourself real good.

735
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,533
I believe in you,
but I cannot help you here.

736
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,100
You are on your own at this point
and I'm gonna tell you what I suggest.

737
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:51,992
You go over to the guidance counselor office

738
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:55,391
and you start working on your anger problems.

739
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:58,193
There's nothing else
I can do for you.

740
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,822
Go clear it out.

741
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,590
Hold your water, lineman!
Hold your water! Here we go.

742
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:16,962
Hut!

743
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:25,402
- Aw, come on, Matt.
- Come on, let's go!

744
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,962
- Nice play, Voodoo.
- Take a break, Matt.

745
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:28,323
Hey, get in here.

746
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:29,292
Coach--

747
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,360
Coach, why you got me
playing D?

748
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:32,793
Get back to practice, son.

749
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:36,167
All due respect, I got a state ring sitting
in my drawer and it's not for defense.

750
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,390
With all due respect, you can go
sit on that bench if you like.

751
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,223
Hustle up, guys!

752
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,291
Guess who came in for counseling today.

753
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,620
Bobby Reyes.
