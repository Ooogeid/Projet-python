3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:06,746
Good morning, West Texas!

4
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,585
Slammin' Sammy Mead comin' at you

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,313
with Panther Football radio!

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,210
470 AM on your dial.

7
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,064
It's Monday morning, and
we all know what that means.

8
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,113
Only four days till Friday night.

9
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,986
The night that our Dillon Panthers

10
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,120
bring the hammer down
on the Westerby Mustangs.

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,885
Who wants to talk Panther
football, I'm all ears.

12
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:26,449
Hey, Sammy, this is
Susan from South Bain.

13
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,998
This new coach, uh, Coach Taylor, right?

14
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:29,833
Eric Taylor, that's right.

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,710
Well, he... he's got himself
a lot of pressure right now,

16
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,880
and there's lots of expectations on him,

17
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,742
and what the heck is going on there?

18
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:37,610
You got a news crew following him around

19
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:38,940
every step of the preseason.

20
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:40,171
Who does he think he is?

21
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,020
Mack Brown?

22
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:43,141
He's no Mack Brown,
I'll tell you right now.

23
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:44,542
Well, now, Susan, I
don't think anybody is,

24
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:45,903
but let me tell you something.

25
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:49,310
He has stepped into the
number one team in Texas.

26
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,190
That's right.

27
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,783
And he does have a
news crew followin' him.

28
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,560
I agree with you, and that's
a lot of added pressure,

29
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:56,952
but it's lettin' him know
how important this football

30
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,261
is to us here in Texas.

31
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,800
Well, I want to add my voice to that...

32
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,170
to that...

33
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:05,950
Okay, Grandma, I made you

34
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,302
two tuna fish sandwiches,

35
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:08,551
and I put your medicine

36
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:09,963
in the green Gatorade, okay?

37
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:12,062
Green Gatorade, but I
only want one sandwich.

38
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,053
Well, then just eat one.

39
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:14,922
But you made two, and I just want one.

40
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:16,651
No, no, no, no, I-I'll
eat the other one

41
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:17,912
when I get home from practice, okay?

42
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:19,433
You'll be hungry.

43
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,202
After that good ol' practice.

44
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:22,680
Yeah.

45
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,001
You...

46
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:27,412
I adore.

47
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,301
Y'know, I think I'm gonna
get me one of those signs

48
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:40,443
that say Landry Clarke:

49
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:42,201
Utterly Useless.

50
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,901
All State jerk team.

51
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,541
Yeah, I'd probably be on that team too.

52
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:51,232
Jason Street has a 72%
pass completion rate.

53
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:53,501
Not only is that number
one in the state of Texas,

54
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,591
that is number one nationally.

55
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,483
- Are you even gonna play at all?
- Nope.

56
00:01:58,727 --> 00:01:59,950
Seriously, this is some kind

57
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,263
of big misdirected

58
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,632
"Daddy, love me" thing, ain't it?

59
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,391
I can't keep driving
you to this practice

60
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,021
in humiliation, it's not
good for either one of us.

61
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,321
You're an insomniac. You're up anyway.

62
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,092
I'm doing you a favor.

63
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:13,982
You should be thanking me.

64
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,333
Now that was mean, Matt.

65
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,122
That wasn't nice.

66
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,633
Gotta get up, little brother.

67
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:26,723
Probably 49 players
right now. Up and at 'em.

68
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:28,500
Right now, this minute.

69
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,551
49 players on the move.

70
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,471
Tim, they'll kick you off the team.

71
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,141
Yup.

72
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:40,151
You're a brother, don't
forget. Not a mother.

73
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,642
You ain't that good.

74
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:45,281
Twice the player you ever was, man.

75
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,483
This is life, this isn't Maxim magazine

76
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:49,971
What's that supposed to mean?

77
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,182
Waste of time.

78
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,302
Right.

79
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:59,221
And no going out with
Jason Street this evening.

80
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,112
We're having a family dinner tonight.

81
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:04,201
That means the entire
family, dinner together.

82
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:06,092
Rally rehearsal tonight.

83
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,820
She's gonna be rehearsing
how far she can get

84
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,733
how far she can get her tongue
into Jason Street's mouth.

85
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:11,731
- Nip it.
- I love you, Daddy.

86
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,293
Uh, love you too, baby.

87
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:16,421
How you doin', Coach?
Tommy Hayskins, NBC Sports.

88
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:17,331
Tommy, welcome.

89
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,523
How's it feel to be head coach
after, what, how many years?

90
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:20,613
Six years, it is.

91
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,252
Got yourself a heck of a quarterback.

92
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,991
He's a good boy. Very proud of him.

93
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,730
Now, you two have been at this
together for some time, right?

94
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:28,971
Yes, sir, he was my
coach all through Pee Wee,

95
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,891
and Coach Taylor's been QB
coaching me since, uh, freshman

96
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,392
and JV years, so it's been awhile.

97
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,200
So, Coach, is it a
coincidence you finally get

98
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:38,083
the head coaching job the final
season of Jason's high school career?

99
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,552
It is, it's a very
fortunate coincidence.

100
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:43,203
You gotta feel blessed
to spend your first year

101
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,790
with a young man who's got the talent

102
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:47,072
and the moral strength this
young man right here has.

103
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,271
Hut!

104
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:50,323
We'd like to get you all on the field

105
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,120
next  Saturday up in South Bend.

106
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,813
There are really no words to
describle the experience...

107
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,172
Sounds terrific.

108
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,170
We're ready to get this thing done.

109
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:01,350
Think we are too.

110
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:03,371
How good is he?

111
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:06,840
Mrs. Street, I've been scouting
quarterbacks for Notre Dame for 27 years.

112
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,731
Your son may be the
best I have ever seen.

113
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,242
We expect a lot of him,
and, uh, he produces.

114
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,083
And, uh, we're very proud of him.

115
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,512
We go in undefeated, shattering records.

116
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:19,851
Taking these high expectations
to unimaginable new highs.

117
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,641
State champions.

118
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,083
What's after high school, Brian?

119
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,543
Me and Mack Brown gonna
get our win on in Pasadena.

120
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:28,612
Get my national championship
on, get my Heisman on.

121
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,850
It's known that a uple years
ago, your father passed away.

122
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:33,362
And he's not
gonna be able-

123
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:35,122
No, look, I don't talk
about that, all right?

124
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:37,312
You wanna ask me football questions,
I'll answer your football questions.

125
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,693
Let's shift gears a minute.

126
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,952
There's been talk of
racism around this squad.

127
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:44,081
Have you experienced anything like that?

128
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:45,341
I don't let that fade me.

129
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,993
I just keep my blinders on, and
keep moving. I got things to do.

130
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:50,153
That's not racism, man.
I just don't like him.

131
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:54,201
He can be from Saudi
Arabia, or Sweden, or Czech.

132
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:57,053
That dude could be Santa Claus,
and I still won't like him.

133
00:04:57,286 --> 00:05:00,373
Name's Tim Riggins,
I play, uh, fullback.

134
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,992
It's known that you're one of
the more aggressive players.

135
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,493
What do you find appealing about that?

136
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,422
I just like to hurt people.
Just pull'em down.

137
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,973
This is a very good football
team, and we all know each other

138
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,560
extremely well, so that's how we play.

139
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,342
Saracen, go take a
look at that trash can

140
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,393
for a yellow play sheet, I think
I accidentally threw it out.

141
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,242
H ut!

142
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,313
Move, move, move, move, move!

143
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,130
That's the ball, right
there, that we want, Steve.

144
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,575
Tim, I don't mean to be inappropriate,

145
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:23,379
but I do smell alcohol on your breath.

146
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:24,898
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

147
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,510
- Not at all?
- No.

148
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:29,772
Okay.

149
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,612
Pick it up, pick it up!

150
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:33,933
You wanna play football today?

151
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:36,242
What the hell is going
on with you right now?

152
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,443
Are we not clear that in five days

153
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,771
a group of men are gonna be coming
down here to try and destroy you?

154
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,950
Is that not- is
that not clear?

155
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:49,650
32.

156
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:52,041
Get up, Riggins.

157
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,272
These same men are gonna
be coming down here.

158
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:57,052
They're gonna use everything
they have to hurt you.

159
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,530
84.

160
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,571
I'm tired of seein' that
out here on this field!

161
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:01,863
82...

162
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,180
get up, Riggins.

163
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:05,140
Get up!

164
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:06,981
You feel a ttle extra responsibilit.

165
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,162
Yeah, there's a little bit
of extra responsibility.

166
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,200
Of course, that comes with the
territory. It's to be expected.

167
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,461
You wanna do that, you
take it somewhere else!

168
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,473
- How good is this team?
- We're a very good team.

169
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:17,512
Man, this team's the best team.

170
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:20,623
They got me.

171
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:22,432
Get up, Riggins.

172
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,570
They're gonna attempt to do
this in front of your mother,

173
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:27,142
in front of your fathers,
in front of your brothers,

174
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:28,402
in front of your sisters.

175
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:29,843
8.

176
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:31,703
Come on, son, get up.

177
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,461
You're making us look weak!

178
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,433
I hate that guy.

179
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,593
One person fumbles the
ball, we all fumble the ball!

180
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:38,452
Hate him.

181
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,790
One person shows up half drunk,
we all show up half drunk!

182
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:43,132
20.

183
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,900
This is business, I keep it football.

184
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:46,323
We ain't got time for your games, Rig.

185
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,552
Leave all other stuff at home.

186
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:50,423
We got a game to win.

187
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,060
Get up, son. Get up!

188
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,653
This is where pretty
much everybody eats.

189
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,260
Uh, I come here and
get the Aztec burger,

190
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,291
every day, leading up to a game.

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:09,861
Oh, yeah, is that an endorsement?

192
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,152
Endorsement, sir?

193
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,973
Well, that could be your first
professional endorsement, the Aztec burger.

194
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:15,941
No, he doesn't have any endorsements.

195
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:16,970
- No, no endorsements.
- No way.

196
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,570
- I got some endorsements!
- What you got?

197
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,543
Nike, Adidas.

198
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,033
- Nike and Adidas?
- Yeah.

199
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:24,483
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

200
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,511
Not the way the Smash does it, baby.

201
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,952
I got so much skills,
there's room for everybody.

202
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:32,532
Reebok too-I'ma do
Big Macs and Whoppers.

203
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,072
Coke and Pepsi.

204
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,693
Look, I'ma bring the
whole world together, baby.

205
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,241
Then I'ma bust up
Paris Hilton's marriage.

206
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:40,263
Is that right?

207
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,450
The Smash gonna be running hotel chains.

208
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,712
So, you-you
wanna go for it?

209
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,360
No, that's the coach's daughter.

210
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:49,443
Yeah, I know-I know
it's the coach's daughter,

211
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,582
but... is that some kind of rule?

212
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:55,143
I  mean, we can't talk to the coach's
daughter? I wasn't aware of that rule.

213
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,271
Come on, let's go.

214
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:06,321
Yes?

215
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,641
I'm in your English class.

216
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,001
Okay.

217
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,560
- So is he.
- Yeah.

218
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,782
We were just, ah, wonderin' if you wanna

219
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:15,922
maybe have some lunch.

220
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,113
You know, talk some Moby Dick.

221
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,740
You're on the football team, right?

222
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:21,592
I, actually, no, I don't play.

223
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,473
He's technically, barely, on the team.
He never plays.

224
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:26,700
I hold extra points sometimes.

225
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,350
Yeah, he held two last year, not-not
well,

226
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:31,613
but he's... he's kinda the backup extra.

227
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:33,383
I'm the backup quarterback.

228
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,643
But Street plays, I-I don't play much.

229
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:36,991
But you're still on the team.

230
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,640
And I don't eat with football players.

231
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:41,803
You know,
I'm not- I'm not a football player.

232
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,552
And I don't eat with you either.

233
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:45,890
No problem.

234
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,031
How do you see him handling
all these enormous expectations?

235
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,752
You know, Sports Illustrated
has this as the number one

236
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,163
high school football team in Texas.

237
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:54,970
Oh, I know, that's what I've been saying.

238
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,163
Oh, really?

239
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,072
I don't know,
he-he just handles it really well.

240
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,480
How interesting.

241
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,083
On the field he's so competitive,

242
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,030
but after, when we're
alone, he's not like that.

243
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,593
That is so interesting, really.

244
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,442
I'd be hard-pressed to remember
anything in my entire life

245
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,792
that's ever been so damn interesting.

246
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,103
Whore.

247
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,350
- Smash?
- Hey.

248
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:20,483
What's up?

249
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,710
Can I get a bite of your burger?

250
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,110
Hey, baby, you can get a
bite of anything you want to.

251
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,342
- Hey.
- Hey babe.

252
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,132
How they lookin'?

253
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,341
They're fast, and they
run a lot of counters.

254
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,010
So I heard a ugly rumor.

255
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,521
- Really?
- Had to do with you and me.

256
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,360
And a certain car dealership
opening tomorrow night.

257
00:09:57,706 --> 00:10:01,012
Oh, shoot.

258
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,403
Did you forget to tell me?

259
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,363
I  think that I did forget to tell you.

260
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,290
- Alaska, I'm just saying.
- I know.

261
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:09,170
A much more relaxed lifestyle.

262
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,880
It's under advisement.

263
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,633
I'm startin' to look at this whole damn town

264
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,880
like a big ol' out-of-tune
guitar.

265
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,093
You know what I mean?

266
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,622
I mean, smashed up like-
like some-like some

267
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,712
demonic crossword puzzle.

268
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,633
Y'know, 42 across, 11 letters.

269
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,710
Could that be? Yes, it is!

270
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:32,130
It's Satan's horns.

271
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:33,793
Is that a word?

272
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:36,141
'Cause-'cause
I'm seein' it owin' out of Street's mom

273
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:38,542
whenever she gets within 20
feet of a Notre Dame recruiter.

274
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:39,743
Stop.

275
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,661
33 down, eight letters, state of bliss.

276
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:46,211
- Starts with a S.
- Dude, you're just being random.

277
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,893
Try SERENITY, a quality

278
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,022
that's in dire shortness
of supply out here.

279
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,370
But you know what?
It doesn't even matter.

280
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:53,653
I'm thinking about starting

281
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:54,973
a Christian speed metal band.

282
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,090
- You in?
- Matthew!

283
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,531
You need to get a new friend.

284
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,620
Ain't funny.

285
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,070
Mr. Street, is it true that you can throw

286
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:17,903
a 400-yard touchdown pass
to three different receivers

287
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,440
at the same time?

288
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,452
This is true.

289
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,941
Then you must kiss me.

290
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,921
Is it true that you
have superhuman powers

291
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:38,751
and can demolish buildings
and hurl fireballs?

292
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:42,050
- This is true.
- Then you must kiss me.

293
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:48,643
Is it true,
Mr. Street-

294
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,122
That I love Lyla Garrity?

295
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:52,371
Yes, is that true, Mr. Street?

296
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:56,783
- That you love Lyla Garrity?
- More than anything in the world.

297
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,680
More than football?

298
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,231
More than almost
anything in the world.

299
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,453
Alright, listen to this, y'all.

300
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:21,052
Large, bright, family home
nestled on a quiet cul-de-sac,

301
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:26,720
three large bedrooms, a
pool, and his and her closets.

302
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,940
His and her closets.

303
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,220
Relent.

304
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:38,311
I'm just sayin'.

305
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,940
I know, I know what you're saying.

306
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:42,481
Darling, his and her closets.

307
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,350
Moby Dick is actually the
perfect metaphor for this town.

308
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:54,061
The cold black sea representing
the season in all its uncertainties.

309
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:57,921
- Dad.
- What?

310
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,961
The magical white whale is the Holy Grail.

311
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,332
- State championship.
- Yeah.

312
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,821
The boat, I mean, the
whalers are the team, right?

313
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,750
The players and the coaches.

314
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:11,560
Smash Williams is Queequeg,
the hulking, African Zulu,

315
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,172
harpoon-hurling whale killer?

316
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:15,181
Who's that make me?
Coach Ahab?

317
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:19,700
Absolutely... coach,
captain, hunter, hunted.

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,123
Mm-hmm, his and her closets.

319
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,893
Driven to catch what
may be uncatchable.

320
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:26,541
I'm not so sure you're mine.

321
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,381
I'm gonna have to order
up a DNA test on you.

322
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,691
Did you hear me?

323
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,742
If we can see over this front line,

324
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,230
and not bite at those counters,
we may just capture that fish.

325
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:36,982
His and hers closets, baby.

326
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,231
Whoo-ooh!

327
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,263
Leonard, welcome, what's on your mind?

328
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:44,122
I'm getting tired of
listening to people up here

329
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,082
worrying about the coach.

330
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,422
These people got nothing better
to do but worry about that?

331
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,223
We got boys who can play football.

332
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,231
Well, how's Westerby looking?

333
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,463
- You get down there, Coach?
- Yeah, I just got back.

334
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:58,610
Yeah, what do you know?

335
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,652
I know they run some of the fastest

336
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,181
son of a bitch counters that
I've seen in a long time.

337
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,763
Now, the front line is big.

338
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,042
Not particularly heavy, but tall.

339
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,810
It's gonna make it hard to follow that ball.

340
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,540
Now, you're gonna need to add
some height on your defense.

341
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:17,071
Maybe play Dillard and Oliver
on those defensive ends.

342
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,172
That way, it'll give you some height.

343
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:20,943
You can see down on them counts.

344
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:21,860
Yeah, I like that.

345
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,691
Hell with what you like.

346
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,970
You have got to win this footbalgame.

347
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:27,983
Now, Coach, I'm dead serious.

348
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:31,103
Now, you got no excuses, and that's
a lonely place to be startin'.

349
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:34,363
With expectations like this, the
only place you can go is down.

350
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,043
That's the problem with being his good.

351
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,210
Yeah, I know.

352
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,030
- Now, you got to drill 'em on counters.
- I will.

353
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,083
- Thanks, Coach.
- How's the family?

354
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:49,201
- Everybody's feelin' fine.
- Well, enjoy.

355
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,802
'Cause it ain't gonna last.

356
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,570
Coach, it ain't that
serious, it's only football.

357
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,210
It's only football.

358
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,720
- It's only football.
- It's only football.

359
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:04,572
All right, now.

360
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,551
Uh, we have a few
introductions that we need

361
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:14,032
to make at this time, starting
with our mayor, Lucy Rodell.

362
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,151
Thank you.

363
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,570
Thank you,

364
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:22,420
and welcome, everybody, to
the openin' of this beautiful

365
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:27,110
automobile dealership owned
and operated by Buddy Garrity.

366
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:28,911
Congratulations, Buddy.

367
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:36,190
And of course, we wanna
extend a special welcome

368
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,061
to Coach Taylor and his coaching staff.

369
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,993
Gentlemen, can you join me up here?

370
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:44,270
Come on up here, fellows.

371
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,022
Come on up, we want you up
here on the stage with us.

372
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:50,972
This is your team, ladies and gentlemen.

373
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,732
I'm gonna make this quick.

374
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:58,391
As a lot of you know, my
wife does most of the talking

375
00:15:58,638 --> 00:15:59,932
around the house.

376
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:03,020
I'm gonna get in a lot
of trouble for that too.

377
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,032
Uh, thank you, Mayor.

378
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,100
Uh, I wanna second what Buddy said.

379
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:10,220
I wanna thank you, everyone,
for coming out tonight.

380
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:13,033
And I just want to say
what a privilege it is

381
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,310
for each and every one
of us standing up here

382
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,691
to be part of the mighty
Dillon football tradition.

383
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:29,522
We all-and I speak
for each and every coach,

384
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,760
player, and, uh, trainer up here.

385
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:33,511
We all feel honored.

386
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:36,481
And we feel fully prepared to represent

387
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,340
this beloved community
this Friday night,

388
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,451
and  every Friday night.

389
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,541
Until we bring home
that state championship.

390
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,493
Let's see where that love
is if he loses a game.

391
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,200
I know.

392
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:54,181
Panthers gonna play
extreme, Westerby gonna cry

393
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:58,193
and scream, Panthers
gonna get diabolical.

394
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:00,612
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

395
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,820
Like Tom Cruise gets scientological.

396
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:09,210
Panthers gonna whoop that ass.

397
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:13,731
As long as Street gets Smash the pass.

398
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,962
C'mon, give it up, give it up!

399
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,270
Put the rings in the air!

400
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:23,093
Put those rings in the air!

401
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,760
Make some noise.
Get up on your feet!

402
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,501
- Hey, hi!
- Hey!

403
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,440
- How are you?
- Oh, how you?

404
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,053
- I'm great, how are y'all doing?
- Oh, fantastic.

405
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:33,601
Good.

406
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,321
Now, Tami, how come you
never join us for book club?

407
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,891
Oh, well, you know, with
the beginning of the season-

408
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:40,383
Oh, come on, Tami.

409
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,341
Wednesday night's our next meeting.

410
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:44,743
A little wine, a little
gossip, it'll be good for you.

411
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,130
That would be great.

412
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,001
- Fun.
- That would be fun.

413
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,042
We would love to have you.

414
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,150
Oh, thank y'all-
Wednesday night!

415
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:52,700
- Okay. Wednesday.
- We can't wait.

416
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,611
All right.

417
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,470
Oh, aren't you the cutest
thing I've ever seen?

418
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:56,841
She is, oh, she is.

419
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:58,473
- All right, y'all.
- Okay, we'll see ya!

420
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,981
Bye. Thank you so much, bye.

421
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,221
- That's gonna be so awful.
- Stop it.

422
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:13,871
Excuse me.

423
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,042
How about a little space, huh?

424
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:20,741
Coach.

425
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,622
Coach, let me see ya.

426
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,231
- How you doing?
- Hey, Pete, how you doing?

427
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:26,172
- Well, great to see you.
- Hey, Tom, how are you?

428
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,401
Hey, good luck tomorrow night.

429
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:30,362
Uh, you know, we've been watching
your offense for five years.

430
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,561
So it's your time now
for the big money, right?

431
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:33,822
You're the boss.

432
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:36,901
Y'know, your name goes next
to that WRL after this one.

433
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,701
It's not like the last five years, is it?

434
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:42,201
If he lets you call
anything, throw the ball, son.

435
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:43,841
- Yes, ma'am.
- Air it out.

436
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:44,551
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,651
You know you got the skills,
you know it right there.

438
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:48,063
- Thank you, I...
- You got what it takes.

439
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,303
- Thank you.
- Let her fly.

440
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,802
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're a nice boy.

441
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,633
- Why, thank you.
- And you got great manners.

442
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,522
- Yes, ma'am.
- Knock it off.

443
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,691
You can't go into the game
tomorrow night like that.

444
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,841
The second most important thing
after defense is the kicking game,

445
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,130
and then they can get
their offense in there.

446
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:03,511
We're hoping we're gonna throw the
ball a little bit more this year.

447
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,351
- Carpet bomb 'em, you understand?
- Yes.

448
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,901
- Chew 'em up, spit 'em out.
- Yes, ma'am.

449
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,243
- So we understand each other.
- Yes, ma'am.

450
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:10,692
Excellent, good, good.
You like early Black Sabbath?

451
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,853
- Black... Black Sabbath?
- It'll make you mean.

452
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,791
You know, the other thing some
people think is you gotta have

453
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,721
a great quarterback
to win a championship.

454
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:19,382
That's obviously not true.

455
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:21,683
I am so confused about what a blitz is.

456
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,462
It sounds a little sexual.

457
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:24,861
We've been by there a couple times,

458
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:27,311
and didn't see any cars, and lights
were off, and it concerned us some.

459
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,633
But you have been working,
you've been working.

460
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,192
Have you ever blitzed an older woman?

461
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:35,130
You could, you know.

462
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:36,631
Hi, Jason.

463
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,092
Tyra.

464
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,981
So where's Lyla?

465
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,810
She's meetin' me here tonight.

466
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:43,523
Oh, that's too bad.

467
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,733
- Why's that?
- Y'know, it's gotta get a litt old, Jason.

468
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,491
Like, drinking milk all day, every day.

469
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,042
You oughta try a milkshake
every once in awhile.

470
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:53,123
What are you gonna do tonight?

471
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,173
What do you do the night before the game?

472
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,032
You've never been a head coach
the night before the game.

473
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:57,972
You don't even know what
you're gonna do, do you?

474
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,101
Jason, do you mind?
Smile for us.

475
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:03,993
- Oh, is that your new girlfriend?
- No, no, sir.

476
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,473
No.

477
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,082
Excuse me.

478
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:10,191
Lyla!

479
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,123
Ly, come here, come here.

480
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,061
Look,
I'm-I'm sorry.

481
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,252
Shouldn't have-I don't
even know how it happened.

482
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,653
She snuck up on me,
cameras started flashing,

483
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:19,112
I started smiling, I'm sorry.
It shouldn't have happened.

484
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,803
What's your favorite football team?

485
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,322
- Oh, you know, USC.
- Oh, yeah?

486
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,520
- Hey, Smash.
- Hey.

487
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:25,973
- I gotta roll.
- Yeah.

488
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:29,043
- How you doin' there, angel eyes?
- Bored as hell.

489
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,810
- I hate these things.
- Yeah?

490
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,821
I mean, you got that, kinda
that deer in the headlights look

491
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:35,812
that I'm a little worried
about you steppin' up

492
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:36,913
to the plate here.

493
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,773
Hillary, I did not have sexual
relations with that girl.

494
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:42,673
So what are you doing?

495
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,020
Y'know, just chillin' on top of the world.

496
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:46,630
Picking diamonds off the clouds, baby.

497
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,690
- I'd love to pick you one.
- Oh, is that right?

498
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:51,132
Yeah.

499
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,291
Funny.

500
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:53,931
It's time to go home.

501
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:55,473
No, I'm having a conversation.

502
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:56,473
It's cool, man.

503
00:20:56,698 --> 00:21:00,533
Do yourself a favor, Williams.
Shut your face while I talk to my girl here.

504
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,490
Say that again.

505
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:02,562
Guys, stop.

506
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:03,412
- C'mon, Rig.
- No.

507
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,492
No, Rig, bring that.

508
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:05,941
- Say that again.
- Been meaning to ask you something.

509
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,793
You're all about God,
but at the same time,

510
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,060
you got the bling right there.

511
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,141
Guys, seriously!

512
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,631
You're some mouth, aren't you?

513
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,881
We don't want you to go out
there and be soft and be scared.

514
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:18,251
Oh, we're not gonna be soft.

515
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:19,450
We want you to be aggressive now.

516
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,243
Are you going to be
able to answer the bell

517
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,160
and bring championships back to this town?

518
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:24,340
We wanna win championships.

519
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:41,792
Now, you guys really want to
focus on learning these plays

520
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:45,073
'cause these are the exact same
plays that we run, and if you

521
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:47,311
learn it right here like
we all did, you'll have

522
00:22:47,478 --> 00:22:48,970
a pretty solid understanding
of what's gonna be expected

523
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,000
of you once you get to varsity.

524
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,103
- All right?
- Yes, sir!

525
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,280
- Mr. Street?
- Yes, son?

526
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:56,520
Are you gonna play professional football?

527
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,733
- I'm thinkin' about it.
- I think you should.

528
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,820
I think you should play for the Cowboys.

529
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:02,521
And that you should be
better than Roger

530
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,743
Staubach, and better than Troy Aikman.

531
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,463
I'm gonna think about it,

532
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,860
but I'm gonna go through school
first, and we'll see what happens, son.

533
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,780
I think you can be better
than Peyton Manning.

534
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,730
Oh, I appreciate that.

535
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,510
Let's pray.

536
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:21,822
Sr. Street, do you think God loves football?

537
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,072
I think that everybody loves football.

538
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:26,662
Me too.

539
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:35,001
Our Father, who art in
Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

540
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,372
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

541
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,373
on earth as it is in Heaven.

542
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:43,922
It sure is nice.

543
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,561
Mm-hmm, and you saw the
room in the bathroom.

544
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:47,813
I am tellin' you, room in
the bathroom is what has

545
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,910
saved more marriages than
Oprah and Dr. Phil combined.

546
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,920
- It is so peaceful, isn't it?
- It is peaceful.

547
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,301
So why don't you have your
wife come down and take a look?

548
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,823
Well, I'll tell you, I don't
think I have to do that.

549
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,223
I think she's gonna like this just fine.

550
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,392
Oh, I'm sure she will.

551
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:06,161
So you gonna make an offer?

552
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,082
Hmm?

553
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:09,810
I'll tell you what...

554
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,663
Let's see how we play Friday night,
and then we'll be getting back to you.

555
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,380
You're gonna kill 'em, Coach.

556
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,770
- I hope so.
- Bring 'em hell.

557
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,101
<i>I'm just a little concerned
about Coach Taylor.</i>

558
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:26,632
<i>He's not been a head coach before.
He's not experienced.</i>

559
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,623
<i>Uh, you know, he's gonna
rely on Street too much.</i>

560
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,140
<i>The thing is, is that, he just
can't keep on throwing all the time.</i>

561
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:34,922
<i>I mean, this ain't the
West Coast, you know?</i>

562
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,632
<i>- This is Texas football.
- I understand.</i>

563
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,260
<i>He's got a running back
like Smash Williams.</i>

564
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:39,590
<i>I don't think
he's plannin'-</i>

565
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,482
Here's how I figure it's gonna work.

566
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:51,093
Correct me if I miss something here, but...

567
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:55,372
I'm cool just hanging out right here, man.

568
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:56,850
You go do your, what?

569
00:24:57,347 --> 00:25:00,340
Maybe ten years in the NFL.

570
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:02,852
Say at five mil a year.

571
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,623
You give me 1% of every paycheck.

572
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,662
Mmm.

573
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,901
When it's all said and
done, you and me are

574
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:17,350
gonna own ourselves a
big old hunting ranch.

575
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,741
I'll keep it stocked with some ladies.

576
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:21,890
- What?
- Hello?

577
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:24,261
There's only one little problem, Rigs.

578
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,112
I don't want you living on my land.

579
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:27,643
Yeah, you do.

580
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,691
I'm the caretaker, Streeter.
Whether you like it or not.

581
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:40,233
Here's to God... And football...

582
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,403
And ten years from now, Street.

583
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:46,582
Good friends living large in Texas.

584
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:50,390
- Texas forever, Street.
- Texas forever.

585
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,100
Yo, everybody, listen up!

586
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:54,993
Let's do it.

587
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:57,861
Let's touch God this time, boys.

588
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,483
Let's touch God.

589
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:06,721
<i>The radio 470 AM, and it is on.</i>

590
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:08,593
<i>It is game day, people!</i>

591
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:12,823
<i>And I have never felt this kind
of electricity. Not in years.</i>

592
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,763
<i>This town of Dillon, Texas is on fire,</i>

593
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,433
<i>and I mean really on fire.</i>

594
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,232
<i>The Panthers should win this
game, there's no question about it.</i>

595
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,000
<i>With all the buildup and
the hype of this season,</i>

596
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,690
<i>and the talent they have on this team...</i>

597
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:42,261
<i>It's that great offensive backfield
for Dillon that has everybody's eye.</i>

598
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:44,982
<i>Jason Street, the quarterback,
and Smash Williams,</i>

599
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:46,923
<i>the tailback, there's
nobody better, probably.</i>

600
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:50,182
<i>Finally got here after a
long summer of practice.</i>

601
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:52,252
<i>Lot of expectations on this
Dillon Panther ball club.</i>

602
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:53,850
<i>Panthers are the team to beat.</i>

603
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:57,001
<i>Feed the dogs, spit the
fire, lock up your daughters.</i>

604
00:26:57,155 --> 00:27:01,223
<i>Turn on the radio, sit down, and shut
up 'cause it is game time, people!</i>

605
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:06,041
Gentlemen...

606
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:11,310
There's been a lot of talk
about expectation lately.

607
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:16,272
Expectation of what we
should be able to do to win.

608
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,093
People are expecting.

609
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:23,572
People are expecting quite a bit.

610
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:30,542
I see us winning out there tonight.
I have no trouble seeing that.

611
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:34,123
That is not what I'm expecting.

612
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,492
I expect you boys to go out there

613
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:40,130
and not take this team
lightly because I promise you,

614
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,381
they're gonna come at you
with everything they've got.

615
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:47,241
- I expect you boys to execute.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:51,822
- I expect you boys to play football.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,341
- Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
- Can't lose!

618
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,252
- You deserve this, do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

619
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:05,372
You've earned this, the right to win.

620
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,182
- You put that in your head.
- You too, Coach.

621
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,620
Expect to win.
You've earned that.

622
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:14,241
<i>We are underway.</i>

623
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,471
<i>Out on the left side,
gets away from one man,</i>

624
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:18,162
<i>breaks another tackle, and gets about</i>

625
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:21,231
<i>a 25-yard gain out
to the 40-yard line.</i>

626
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:24,812
<i>It's a great way to start the season.</i>

627
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:28,212
We got strong left eye,
wide flip, 24 counter on one.

628
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,632
- On one, ready?
- Huh!

629
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:31,652
<i>Let's see what this young
superstar's got for us.</i>

630
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,380
<i>First chance to see the 6'2",</i>

631
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,953
<i>190-pound quarterback
Street,along with Smash Williams,</i>

632
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,010
<i>Tim Riggins in the backfield.</i>

633
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:39,072
<i>The hand-off to Williams,
he tries that right side.</i>

634
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:39,950
<i>Gets away!</i>

635
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,192
<i>Oh, this kid can move!</i>

636
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:43,610
<i>First down, Panthers!</i>

637
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:44,972
<i>...by Smash Williams.</i>

638
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,841
<i>He bounces it outside,and breaks a tackle.</i>

639
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,192
<i>We got the cornerback.</i>

640
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,352
I want Barracuda 550.
Barracuda 550.

641
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:53,191
<i>And the hand-off this time to
big Tim Riggins, the fullback.</i>

642
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,560
<i>Oh, Tim gets ten yards
before getting pulled down.</i>

643
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:58,223
<i>You gotta love Tim Riggins when he runs.</i>

644
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,933
It's going back to
Manny, 27 stretch, on one.

645
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:01,060
On one, ready?

646
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:03,951
<i>Panthers on a roll, just
like we thought they'd be.</i>

647
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:05,590
<i>First and ten at the 35.</i>

648
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,092
<i>Street, drops straight back to pass,</i>

649
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:09,803
<i>has Eugene Williams open over the middle.</i>

650
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:11,223
<i>He's there with a touchdown!</i>

651
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:13,753
<i>Touchdown, the first
touchdown of the season!</i>

652
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:17,332
<i>So it's Westerby's turn to respond now,</i>

653
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,080
<i>after the easy touchdown
drive for Dillon.</i>

654
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:22,143
<i>Coy Awnee brings back the kickoff
for Westerby, and up the left side,</i>

655
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,772
<i>the near side, he gets away,
and gets a beautiful run</i>

656
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,693
<i>back to the Dillon 40-yard line.</i>

657
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,500
<i>And the first down's called,
a little bit of misdirection,</i>

658
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,573
<i>as they always do, and
Campbell bounces it out.</i>

659
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:32,643
<i>And gets away!</i>

660
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,392
<i>He's gonna go all the
way into the end zone!</i>

661
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:37,722
<i>Westerby scores on its
first play from scrimmaging.</i>

662
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:41,641
<i>Wow, we heard about these
counters, and man are they fast.</i>

663
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,673
<i>What a great misdirection.</i>

664
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,943
<i>And it fooled the Panthers.</i>

665
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,200
<i>We're already into the second quarter.</i>

666
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,123
<i>Westerby's Chaps giving us
all we can handle right now.</i>

667
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:54,950
<i>Big block.</i>

668
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,190
<i>Tim Riggins.</i>

669
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,782
<i>Jason Street brings him out.
Takes the step.</i>

670
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:04,940
<i>Drops straight back to pass.</i>

671
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:06,870
<i>Looks left. Finds Tony Golia.
He's there.</i>

672
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:09,033
<i>He's got to catch, dives
to the cone. Did he get in?</i>

673
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,841
<i>Yes, touchdown, Dillon!</i>

674
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,821
Don't you fall for that!

675
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:16,202
<i>That's the sign of a great leader
and that's who Jason Street is.</i>

676
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:19,452
<i>Westerby with the first down and
ten at the 30-yard line, though.</i>

677
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,012
That's it!

678
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:23,283
<i>And Ferguson, one-on-one
coverage, is open over the middle.</i>

679
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:24,672
<i>He's got it!</i>

680
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:26,363
<i>Touchdown, Westerby.</i>

681
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,040
<i>I'll tell you, Westerby is showing up</i>

682
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,511
<i>a lot stronger than
anyone thought they would.</i>

683
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:35,023
<i>Coach Taylor has got to do something
to get his defense into this game.</i>

684
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:39,131
You need to get your head out of
your butt and start playing up

685
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:40,712
to your own district potential.

686
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:43,471
'Cause you ain't doing it now!
He's having to help you.

687
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,313
Haven't we got one guy coming,
he's having to help you?!

688
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:49,020
- What are you seeing out there, Street?
- Seeing a lot of Texas defense, coach.

689
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:50,193
- Texas?
- Yes, sir.

690
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,123
Our corners are jamming.
They're staying out there in the flats.

691
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,020
It seems like I'm getting a lot
of pressure off the outsides.

692
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,690
Coming off the ends like crazy.
I can't even see 'em.

693
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,823
The safeties are staying pretty
deep, so we got a lot of short stuff.

694
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,640
More slants and crosses, I think.

695
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:04,792
Play it close to over the top?

696
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:06,120
We can fade if I can get some time.

697
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:07,792
But they gotta beat
that jam off of the line.

698
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,841
Plus, I'm getting blitzed
like crazy off the weak side.

699
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:10,991
I ain't even see it coming.

700
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,323
You are not that good!

701
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,061
See what's going on, now.
We need some more time.

702
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,533
Coach, they are running
the box down on us.

703
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:19,200
We have not been communicating.
We're gonna pick it up now.

704
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,011
Hey, you guys wanna communicate now?!

705
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,190
Yes, sir!

706
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,611
We're going into a fistfight!

707
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,442
<i>Smash gets the call,
tries to go outside.</i>

708
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:30,103
<i>There's nothing there, and he
gets thrown for a five-yard loss.</i>

709
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,011
That didn't work.

710
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,941
<i>They're totally out of sorts
here in the second half.</i>

711
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:38,372
Fellas, this is our field day.
Do not push us around!

712
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,370
<i>Street tries to find
Horn over the middle. He gets...</i>

713
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,630
<i>And even the passing
game's out of sync, K.C.</i>

714
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:47,121
<i>Nothing is working right now.
It is really a dangerous time.</i>

715
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,543
<i>Westerby blew out that
offensive line that time.</i>

716
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,433
54 Bandit. Jesus, they're fast!

717
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,113
Run your routes.
Have faith in your routes.

718
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,331
You will catch the ball.

719
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,800
It will be there every time, and
we will take this down the field.

720
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,793
<i>Nobody expected Westerby to be
giving us this kinda trouble.</i>

721
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:04,111
<i>The Panthers are looking
completely outta sync!</i>

722
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:13,331
<i>Westerby right now
clearly with the momentum.</i>

723
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:14,730
Ed, that was horse crud!

724
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:16,402
Watch yourself, Coach.

725
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:19,100
<i>You let a team like Westerby
stick around long enough,</i>

726
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:20,591
<i>they think they could beat ya.</i>

727
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:25,363
<i>And the give is to Campbell
on the counter yet again.</i>

728
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:28,170
<i>And he gets a long way all the
way down towards the goal line.</i>

729
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,621
<i>He is down at the one yard line.</i>

730
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:32,930
<i>They just seem to have no
answer for these counters.</i>

731
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,630
<i>Triple stack formation.
Fakes once, fakes twice.</i>

732
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,172
<i>Gives to Cameron
over the top-dives-</i>

733
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:38,702
<i>And he's in the end zone!</i>

734
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,262
<i>Touchdown Westerby!</i>

735
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,940
<i>The Westerby Chaps lead
with six minutes to go.</i>

736
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:46,830
<i>And Coach Taylor and his boys are
in deep trouble with time running out.</i>

737
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:49,502
<i>The Panthers cannot
believe what's going on.</i>

738
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,040
<i>Eric Taylor's gotta do something
to figure this thing out.</i>

739
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:55,061
<i>Dillon trying to rally from down ten.
A flip pass to Williams.</i>

740
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,582
<i>That's another first down.</i>

741
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:58,082
<i>Move the ball! Move the ball!</i>

742
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:00,693
We're gonna come back.

743
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,143
Look at me! Are you
ready to play this game?

744
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:07,133
We got strong left, 89 gun,
453 heat on one, on one.

745
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:07,772
Ready, break!

746
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:09,432
Third and five on the Panther 38.

747
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,573
Come on now, offense. Let's go!

748
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:14,260
<i>Well, they gotta get
something going. Down by ten.</i>

749
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,480
<i>They need two possessions, and score in
those two possessions to win the ballgame.</i>

750
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:18,590
<i>Third and five.</i>

751
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:22,222
<i>And Street looks like he's in command
like we've seen him look before.</i>

752
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,373
<i>This is a critical
play for the Panthers.</i>

753
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:25,931
Hut!

754
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:28,051
<i>Street takes the snap.
Drops back to pass.</i>

755
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:29,523
<i>Has protection. Throws a wobble.</i>

756
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,931
<i>Oh, it's picked off by Chandler.
Interception.</i>

757
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:34,012
<i>He's got a good wall in front of him.
Down on the left side.</i>

758
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:36,721
<i>Street the only one that
might be able to get to him.</i>

759
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,061
<i>Fumble on the play. A fumble.</i>

760
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:41,863
<i>The ball is loose!</i>

761
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:42,871
Get the ball!

762
00:33:44,837 --> 00:33:47,072
That's a gigantic hit on Street.

763
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,880
He's down on the ground. He is down.

764
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,613
- Who is that, Street?
- That's Street.

765
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:52,173
Trainer!

766
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,002
What happened?

767
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:54,881
<i>And he's not moving.
That was a heckuva hit!</i>

768
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:56,470
<i>When Street met Chandler.</i>

769
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:58,700
<i>And he was the only one that
could've stopped him from scoring</i>

770
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:01,720
<i>what would've been a game-ending
touchdown basically for Westerby.</i>

771
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,020
He's not getting up.

772
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:10,323
It's very quiet here in this stadium.

773
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,802
Doctor.

774
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:12,930
He's not getting up.

775
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,400
You know, this is obviously
the worst nightmare

776
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:20,650
for a coach and especially for a parent.

777
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:24,172
Well, you know, his entire family
of course in the crowd tonight.

778
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:27,670
Even some folks from his family
from out of state making the trip.

779
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,070
Why isn't he getting up?

780
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:32,972
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

781
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:37,230
Okay, I'm gonna check
your eyes-Hold on.

782
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:47,412
Jason!

783
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:49,682
Jason, get up!

784
00:34:50,637 --> 00:34:52,213
Please.

785
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,450
I think it's a spinal injury.
I'm not sure yet.

786
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,680
But he has
been moving-

787
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:06,610
Can you squeeze my hands for me, buddy?

788
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,093
- Squeezing!
- Good, good, good.

789
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:09,963
- Can you move your feet for me?
- Yes.

790
00:35:10,126 --> 00:35:11,423
Good, good, good.
All right.

791
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,012
Should we try to get him
on the backboard real quick?

792
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,470
Let's keep him steady, guys.
Let's keep him steady.

793
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,251
It looks likthey're gonna
have to take him off.

794
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:17,993
In fact, they've got him
strapped to the headboard

795
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:19,261
now and they're lifting him up,

796
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:20,761
and they'll put him in
the ambulance shortly.

797
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,912
- Just move him sideways slowly.
- Perfect.

798
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,960
- You're doing real good there. Real good.
- Thank you.

799
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:27,191
Okay, we're going up.
One, two, three.

800
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,343
Okay, we're going up.

801
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,600
<i>You know, the amazing thing
is we got the number one</i>

802
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,213
<i>football player in America
carted off on a stretcher.</i>

803
00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:01,361
<i>But this game has to go on.
It has to be finished.</i>

804
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:02,713
<i>And the third
string quarterback-</i>

805
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:03,970
<i>no one's seen
this guy play-</i>

806
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:05,222
<i>is Matt Saracen.</i>

807
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,311
<i>I don't know if he's
taken a snap in practice.</i>

808
00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:09,010
<i>Well, you can see the
look on his face right now.</i>

809
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,842
<i>I don't think he ever
expected to play in this one.</i>

810
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:15,710
<i>You know, here he is in
maybe the biggest game of his life.</i>

811
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,833
<i>Yeah, this young man's
gonna have to get down</i>

812
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,401
<i>to some serious business,
because his team needs it.</i>

813
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,313
<i>And he's gonna have to
communicate with this team</i>

814
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:23,671
<i>and get them back in the game.</i>

815
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:26,611
Coach, I need your captains, please.

816
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:27,882
Captains!

817
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:32,120
Saracen. Quarterback's captain.

818
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:48,903
Okay, guys.
Everybody all right?

819
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:51,141
We have just under three minutes to go.

820
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,352
I want you to play hard.
I want you to play fair.

821
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:57,040
And I want you to go back and tell
your players to keep your heads up.

822
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:59,891
Hit only what you see.
Y'all understand?

823
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:02,113
I want you to take that back
and tell your guys, all right?

824
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,872
Let's finish this thing up with style.
Best of luck, guys.

825
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,163
<i>You gotta be calm in this situation.</i>

826
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:29,161
<i>Don't turn the ball over.
Don't do something foolish.</i>

827
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:32,122
- All right, we're going pro right 90.
- No, we're going pro left 90.

828
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:32,943
Pro left 90.

829
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:35,181
- You know the play, right?
- Yeah, okay.

830
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,580
We're going
pro-pro left 90.

831
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,511
25 blast on one.

832
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:41,053
- Ready?
- Break!

833
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:48,991
<i>Matt Saracen, the sophomore,
comes out and leads his team</i>

834
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:50,532
<i>to the line of scrimmage to take</i>

835
00:37:50,698 --> 00:37:53,560
<i>his first meaningful
snap probably in his life.</i>

836
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,941
<i>And everybody's looking
at young Matt Saracen,</i>

837
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,372
<i>who calls the wrong
play and gets drilled.</i>

838
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:02,412
<i>He went the wrong way,
and he paid the price.</i>

839
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:09,922
<i>Well, you gotta try
and get a first down.</i>

840
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,221
Come on, Matt. You can do it!

841
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:13,983
<i>Okay, here's Saracen
dropping back to pass.</i>

842
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:14,681
<i>And he throws
the ball-</i>

843
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:16,603
<i>Oh, man. This kid is shook up.</i>

844
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:19,033
<i>He has hit his own man right
in the back of the helmet.</i>

845
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,193
<i>That's not the way to instill
confidence in your teammates.</i>

846
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,222
Saracen, get over here!

847
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:31,662
<i>Panther time-out.</i>

848
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:39,790
You okay?

849
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,213
Breathe. Slow down.

850
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,191
I want you to try to read the coverage.

851
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:52,352
You remember how to read the coverage?

852
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,922
- Not so well, sir.
- Look at me.

853
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:56,443
What you do is you go
out there and you look

854
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:57,642
before you throw the ball.

855
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:00,913
You look and see where the defense
is and you see where our guys are.

856
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,531
- You with me?
- Yes, sir.

857
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,160
Then you throw the ball to our guys.

858
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,260
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

859
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:11,940
Do your best.

860
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:14,330
Go on.

861
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:17,391
<i>Coach Taylor has gotta be just
thinking about getting out of this game.</i>

862
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,663
We're going pro right, 25 shovel.
Smash, this is you.

863
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:31,802
- I got this.
- All right, ready?

864
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:32,891
- On one.
- Break!

865
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,042
Big ol' third down play
now for the Panthers.

866
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:37,231
<i>Let's see if Saracen can at
least get the snap this time.</i>

867
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:38,540
<i>He's got to do something with this play.</i>

868
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:40,301
<i>Saracen back to pass.</i>

869
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,980
<i>A shovel pass to Williams.
Goes off the left side.</i>

870
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:43,843
<i>Has some room.</i>

871
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:46,971
<i>Up the field he goes.
Hey, that's a pretty good toss.</i>

872
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:48,103
<i>Awesome. Great job.</i>

873
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:50,043
<i>And they needed that play, K.C.</i>

874
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:54,092
<i>All of a sudden, some life on the
Panther sideline and in the stands too.</i>

875
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:57,241
Strong right eye, 28 tango.

876
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,001
- Ready? On one.
- Break!

877
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:00,921
<i>You can feel the energy
picking up a little bit now.</i>

878
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,332
<i>Maybe something's starting to happen.</i>

879
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm going in. It's all you.

880
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,720
<i>Saracen at the line of scrimmage.</i>

881
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:10,082
Hut!

882
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,101
<i>Takes the snap.
Pitches to Smash.</i>

883
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:14,681
<i>He's got some room.
He's gonna go all the way.</i>

884
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:15,690
<i>Touchdown!</i>

885
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:16,733
<i>Hey, okay.</i>

886
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:17,773
<i>Just like that.</i>

887
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:19,812
<i>The Panthers are right back in the game.</i>

888
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:21,042
<i>We did it!</i>

889
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,122
<i>Now it's all about the clock.</i>

890
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:24,671
<i>They've got less than a minute to go.</i>

891
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,651
<i>Coach Taylor's gotta be
thinking about an onside kick.</i>

892
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:29,413
<i>Gotta get the good hands,people out
there who line up and get that ball.</i>

893
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:32,652
<i>And here's the kick.
It is onside.</i>

894
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,142
<i>A mad scramble!
Westerby misses it!</i>

895
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:38,363
<i>The ball is still loose.
A scramble for the ball.</i>

896
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:41,322
<i>Who's got it?
It looks like could the Panther ball.</i>

897
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:44,641
<i>Panthers have it!
Here we go!</i>

898
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:45,460
<i>All right!</i>

899
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,561
<i>Timmy Riggins comes
up with the football.</i>

900
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,752
Go right 90, 7-5 high.

901
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:55,562
We got a chance to win this game.

902
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:58,440
<i>What a story.</i>

903
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:01,073
<i>Young Matt Saracen bringing
his team back into the ballgame.</i>

904
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:04,241
<i>He drops back to pass.</i>

905
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,071
<i>No, fakes!</i>

906
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,972
<i>He hands off.
Statue of Liberty-</i>

907
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,521
<i>He'll school you if he's got room.</i>

908
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:10,453
<i>He's gonna have to get
out of bounds, and he does!</i>

909
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,252
<i>They're gonna have to hurry.</i>

910
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,543
<i>It's gonna start as soon
as they move those chains.</i>

911
00:41:18,455 --> 00:41:20,080
<i>Trying to get the team back on sides.</i>

912
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:22,013
<i>Coach Taylor screaming in plays.</i>

913
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:23,870
<i>It's chaos out there right now.</i>

914
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:26,590
Towards right! Towards right!

915
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,260
Go, go!

916
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,503
<i>Snap the ball!</i>

917
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:31,802
<i>Rushing to get the play off.</i>

918
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:34,021
<i>Saracen calling for the shotgun.</i>

919
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:37,583
<i>He's back. He's left.
He falls.</i>

920
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,231
<i>No, he gets up on his feet.</i>

921
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,382
<i>Being pursued by two Westerby defenders.</i>

922
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:42,543
Go, baby!

923
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:45,280
Come on, Matthew!

924
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:47,113
<i>He eludes a tackle.</i>

925
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:50,813
<i>The clock runs out.
He pumps.</i>

926
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:58,041
<i>He steps up.
He hurls that football.</i>

927
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,861
<i>Oh, man, can this kid throw the ball!</i>

928
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:06,232
<i>He's definitely wide open.</i>

929
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:07,450
<i>He's got it!</i>

930
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:08,882
<i>At the 20... the 10...</i>

931
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,392
<i>He's going all the way!</i>

932
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:12,351
<i>Touchdown!</i>

933
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,593
<i>Panthers win! Panthers win!</i>

934
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:19,481
<i>Matt Saracen somehow brings this
team back to win the football game.</i>

935
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:21,191
<i>How do you do?</i>

936
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:48,710
Congratulations, Coach.

937
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:55,752
Right now,

938
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:58,133
it's not really about
who wins or loses, Father.

939
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,283
We just all wanna be with
Street right now, God.

940
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:02,822
We know that you work in mysterious ways

941
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:05,862
and we just wanna send
our spirit, our presence,

942
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,122
our love, just to heal
him in whatever way, Lord-

943
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,643
whatever might be broken, Lord.

944
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:12,251
Just fix it right now, Father.

945
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,340
Jesus, in your name we pray.

946
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:15,561
Amen.

947
00:43:17,476 --> 00:43:19,601
<i>Give all of us gathered here tonight the</i>

948
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:22,502
strength to remember that
life is so very fragile.

949
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,942
<i>We are all vulnerable.</i>

950
00:43:25,828 --> 00:43:30,302
<i>And we will all, at some
point in our lives... fall.</i>

951
00:43:30,947 --> 00:43:32,643
<i>We will all fall.</i>

952
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:37,611
<i>We must carry this in our hearts...</i>

953
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,842
<i>that what we have is special.</i>

954
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,612
<i>That it can be taken from us...</i>

955
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:47,373
<i>and that when it is taken from us,</i>

956
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:49,783
<i>we will be tested.</i>

957
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:54,380
<i>We will be tested to our very souls.</i>

958
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:03,813
<i>We will now all be tested.</i>

959
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:10,811
<i>It is these times-</i>

960
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:12,500
<i>it is
this pain-</i>

961
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:15,380
<i>that allows us to look inside ourselves.</i>
