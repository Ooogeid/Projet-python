1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,537
Where the hell is your father?

2
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,095
Take a deep breath.

3
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:13,511
- You look good.
- Thanks.

4
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,451
Probably because
yesterday I was baptized

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,282
and accepted Jesus
as my Lord and Savior.

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,436
Enjoy Jesus.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,911
Enjoy your depraved hedonism.

8
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,372
Say hi to the Swede!

9
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:22,529
Who's the Swede?

10
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,371
Some boy she's flirting with
at the pool.

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,653
If you leave Matt,

12
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,543
no one is gonna love you any less.

13
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:28,883
You realize that.

14
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:30,643
I really miss having you around.

15
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:41,327
Maybe it's colic.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>Honey, it's not colic.</i>

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,914
Well, Julie, she was colic.

18
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,682
I love you so much, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,164
Julie was not colicky.

20
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,636
The only time Julie ever cried
was the time you slammed her hand.

21
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,626
That was 15 years ago,
and you're the one who let her...

22
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,581
You know what,
were you asleep when I called?

23
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,713
- No.
- <i>Yes, you were. Go back to sleep.</i>

24
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:03,332
No sense in me going back to sleep
now that I'm awake.

25
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:06,487
- <i>Go ahead and talk to me.</i>
- All right, darling, how's work going?

26
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:07,607
It's good.

27
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:09,399
That doesn't sound very convincing.

28
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:12,154
It's good, it's good.
It's like being... you know...

29
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,983
This bed's uncomfortable, for one thing.

30
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:16,685
And the other thing is, that,

31
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,790
it's like being the new kid in school.

32
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,619
There's this inner circle,
you're never part of it.

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
All you have to do is be indispensable.

34
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,230
And you and I both know
that's just what you do so perfect.

35
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:29,603
That's a very wifely thing
for you to say.

36
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,191
Oh, now you got her crying.

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,038
I miss you and I love you.

38
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,528
I love you, baby. I love you.

39
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:36,666
Bye-bye.

40
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,035
Landry, what-- what time is it?

41
00:01:58,295 --> 00:01:59,945
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

42
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,201
Look, I can't find my watch.

43
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:04,055
- What?
- <i>I can't--</i>

44
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:06,163
I can't find my watch.

45
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:07,963
The last time I had it was...

46
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,246
Even if somebody found that watch,

47
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,954
they're not gonna know is yours, okay?

48
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,473
That's fine, Tyra, except for the fact
that it's engraved

49
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,441
"to Landry from grandpa."

50
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,046
It's probably with the body.

51
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,142
Can you take a deep breath
and calm down?

52
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:23,451
I could but that's not gonna matter
when I'm in the electric chair.

53
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:26,303
Okay, Landry, this is not normal,
what we're doing right here.

54
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,899
I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing
you right now.

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,499
No, you're not embarrassing me.

56
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,571
We're not supposed to return
to the crime scene.

57
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,994
I didn't realize you were
so knowledgeable about this.

58
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,099
Maybe you should just write
a how-to book...

59
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,609
That's helping right now.
Those nasty comments, that's great.

60
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,253
I'm trying to hold it together.

61
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:47,698
Think anyone's looking for him?

62
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,108
Friends or family or someone?

63
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:09,892
Let's go home.

64
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:16,703
Come on.

65
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,468
Let's go.

66
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:07,497
Presync: Sixe for top-series.net
Synchro: Gilles

67
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,262
Let's go. Watch your footwork!

68
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:14,382
Eyes up!

69
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:18,737
Hey Aaron!

70
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:20,921
- Yeah?
- Coach wants to see ya.

71
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,087
All right, keep it up.

72
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,532
I do wind sprints and gasses...

73
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,428
Coaches... Antoine.

74
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:36,832
Antoine here is in trouble

75
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,337
with the infractions committee

76
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,497
for accepting gifts from a booster.
Isn't that right, Antoine?

77
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,876
Taylor, I need for you
to escort this knucklehead

78
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,841
to his hearing tomorrow
because I don't trust

79
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,596
that he can make it there on his own.

80
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,009
We fully expect him
to be suspended for the season

81
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:53,279
because he was stupid enough
to get caught

82
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,962
at the Justin Timberlake show
with an agent.

83
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,449
Justin Timberlake.

84
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,318
Hope it was worth it, Antoine.

85
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,546
Step off.
Little white boy's got soul.

86
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,899
I don't wanna hear
another word out of you.

87
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,755
What about, uh...

88
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,438
I mean, how about practice?

89
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,608
Don't worry about it. We'll cover it.

90
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,866
All right, since we got that covered,

91
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,523
we taking my car.

92
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,653
- Hello.
- Hey, Glen, come on in.

93
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,380
Gosh, thank you so much for seeing me
at home like this.

94
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,279
You're welcome. Let's just go on
on the kitchen there, okay?

95
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,223
Okay.

96
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,290
You can probably
find a spot on the table.

97
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:32,583
Really, again, thank you
for seeing me at your home.

98
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:34,440
That's probably an inconvenience to you.

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,168
- It's fine.
- I mean these kids,

100
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,292
there's so many of them. You know,
they're coming at me like ninjas.

101
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,948
I know. They do that.

102
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,373
Wow, I hope you didn't
go to all is trouble

103
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,502
just for me.

104
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,684
I just had a baby, Glen.

105
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,559
I'm-- I was kidding. I'm sorry.

106
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,993
What's the problem?
Let's just go over it.

107
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,938
Okay, um, Barry Harby...

108
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,652
- Barry Harby Jr. Linebacker.
- Right.

109
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,960
- He's telling you he can't read?
- He said he can't.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,929
The football players
are gonna mess with you.

111
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,458
He's just trying to get into
an easier english class.

112
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,946
You can't let these kids ride roughshod
all over you.

113
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,127
Who's next?

114
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,661
Right, Tiffany Barnes.

115
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:10,782
Tiffany Barnes.

116
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,763
She wants you to write her
a recommendation?

117
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,587
- Yeah, she does. To Vassar.
- To Vassar.

118
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,596
She can't get into Vassar any more
than I can get into my old jeans.

119
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,474
- You see what I'm saying?
- Absolutely.

120
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,613
How's she doing
with the divorce of her parents?

121
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,037
I have no idea.

122
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,756
Look, I'm a science teacher.

123
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:26,964
I teach science.

124
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:29,512
And I'm a little
out of element, you know?

125
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:31,386
And I don't know if there's any

126
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,146
general words of wisdom
that you can give me.

127
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:37,606
or if you have a book or anything
I could read. Or you could refer me...

128
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,434
It's just-- you need to just connect

129
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,954
with these children,
that's all there is to it.

130
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,549
Hey hon!

131
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,524
You know what, listen,
I was thinking tonight,

132
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:46,752
if you wanted to,

133
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:49,125
you and Matt could rent a movie
and order in some food,

134
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,654
and you could bring it over here,
have a little date night.

135
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,923
What is it with you?
Matt this, Matt that.

136
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,296
You know Matt has his own life, right?

137
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:03,494
Who's next?

138
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,275
Please hurry up! We're already late.
Can we please just go?

139
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:08,693
I don't know if we're supposed
to pick Julie up or not.

140
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,239
I left her, like, four messages

141
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,842
and she never called me back.

142
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:14,384
So I don't know...
Maybe if we just go by her house

143
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,134
see if she's there, and if she's there,

144
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,449
then we're supposed to get her.
And if she's not...

145
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:19,862
We could do that. Or maybe

146
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,019
your testicles are just
in her panty drawer, Matt.

147
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,497
Have you ever thought about that?
Even I know that she's--

148
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,102
What is that...

149
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,563
- How you doing?
- Good.

150
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,630
- Should I sign for it?
- Hey, thanks.

151
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:32,487
Grandma, what'd you order?

152
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:33,737
Is that my tiara?

153
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,041
- Tiara?
- Is it?

154
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,411
Look how pretty!

155
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:46,260
That'll be beautiful for whenever
you just zip over to the rite aid.

156
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,662
Grandma, no. It was $2,400.

157
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,097
We gotta send this back.

158
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,990
- Look how pretty.
- Beautiful.

159
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,690
It's really pretty,
but it's really gotta go back.

160
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:57,653
- Oh, boys.
- Look at... Look at her.

161
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,356
You can't put a price tag

162
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,250
on happiness.

163
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,766
And again, we're glad
to have coach Mcgregor here.

164
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,519
Came out of those hills of Tennessee

165
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,921
- to the great state of Texas.
- Thank you, Buddy.

166
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,518
Oh, again, season opener
pep rally is coming up.

167
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,503
And I'm proud to say that Garrity motors

168
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,257
will sponsor and host
as we have so many years in the past.

169
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,377
Buddy...

170
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:23,772
We've all been talking.

171
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,133
We thought it'd be nice
if we had a new venue this year.

172
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,391
Well, what do you mean
we've all been talking?

173
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:30,881
Well, Lester's got his ranch.

174
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,001
There's a lot of space indoors and out.

175
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,165
We can barbeque,
make it a family affair.

176
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,735
You know, make it,
I don't know, more wholesome.

177
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,782
Garrity motors is wholesome.

178
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,489
Buddy, you got a lot going on right now.

179
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,070
What does that mean, Lester?

180
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,123
Buddy, it's just a party. It'll be fun.

181
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,738
I sure hope you can make it.

182
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:07,666
Look, I need that in-home care
that you promised me, all right?

183
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:10,408
- I call y'all people once...
- You gonna get the door?

184
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,178
I call y'all people once a week.

185
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:15,373
Checking in on it. I'm taking care of
my grandmother who-- yeah, I'll hold.

186
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,828
You want me to talk to 'em?
You're obviously not getting--

187
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,697
I'm on hold,
you can't really talk to 'em.

188
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:20,941
Like 30 minutes...

189
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:22,976
Hey, Julie.

190
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,481
Um, I didn't know if you needed a ride.

191
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,393
So I called you a couple times.

192
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,007
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was dead.

193
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,143
- Oh, all right.
- I got a ride with Lois.

194
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,863
Okay, well, do you wanna maybe...

195
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,358
You wanna do something?

196
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:37,378
Yeah, um, give me a call later, okay?

197
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,322
- Okay.
- See you later.

198
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,478
Hello?

199
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,844
Christ, shield me today from wounding.

200
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,844
Christ with me, Christ before me.

201
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,801
Christ behind me, Christ in me.

202
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,861
Christ on my right, Christ on my left.

203
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,967
Christ above me, Christ beneath me.

204
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:56,890
Christ when I lay down,

205
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,141
and in our hearts.

206
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,602
Christ in our families.

207
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,563
Christ in the hearts of everyone

208
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,830
who thinks of us.

209
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,449
And Christ in the mouths

210
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:08,975
of everyone who speaks of us.

211
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:10,189
Blue 20!

212
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
All right!

213
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,778
Good catch, Smash!

214
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,448
See that boy? Thing of beauty!

215
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:22,914
Way to go, Smash!

216
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,584
Saracen. Saracen.

217
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:27,007
It was a good toss, all right?
Good read, Saracen.

218
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,127
Coach!

219
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,090
Am I a thing of beauty, too?

220
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:35,244
Let me ask you something, Riggins.

221
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,846
Can you count to 50?

222
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:38,056
- Yeah.
- Good.

223
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,291
Then I got 50 for you, right over there.

224
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,499
Hit it! Let's go!

225
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,145
50 good ones. Let's go!

226
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,265
Come on! Come on!

227
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,688
Let's get it on! Let's go!

228
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,568
Blue 20! Blue 20!

229
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,871
Come on, Clark!
Let's run this thing again!

230
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,723
Blue 20, blue 20!

231
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,445
Feet on the ground, son!
Get your feet on the ground!

232
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,758
You gonna slap his ass upside down!

233
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:18,367
Come on, son!

234
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,458
Dig a little deeper, all right, boy?

235
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,314
- You're on offense.
- All right, shake it off now.

236
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,248
Dad.

237
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,314
Looking good out there.

238
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,290
You sure you talking about my--

239
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,088
I was just getting my ass handed to me

240
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,008
by Riggins, like, five times in a row.

241
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,552
I can't really feel my right ear
for some reason.

242
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:40,482
Give it time. You're on the team.
That's all that matters.

243
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,973
I'm real proud of you. I mean it.

244
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,397
Alright.

245
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,540
- Pretty good.
- I know, right?

246
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,950
What do you think it means?

247
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,768
You're still recovering
from your injury.

248
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,760
You've been great
about your physical therapy.

249
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,327
And that's some of the reasons
your muscles are coming back.

250
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,847
This improvement in your hands,
it's wonderful.

251
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,965
But it's no necessarily
indicative of anything else,

252
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,703
if that's what you're thinking.

253
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,765
Yeah, but who's the say that--

254
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:10,931
Jason, I am.

255
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,470
You're not gonna walk again, Jason.

256
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,625
At least not without
a major medical breakthrough.

257
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,091
And it is something
we are still years away from.

258
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:30,335
Hey dude, what's up?

259
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,870
Same old crap.

260
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,002
He just told me I'll never walk again.

261
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,122
Again.

262
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,428
Depressing as usual, eh?

263
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:38,878
I just thought...

264
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:42,684
I know this guy.

265
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:46,125
He does some
experimental stem cell surgeries

266
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,245
down in Mexico.

267
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,809
Heard they're doing really good with it.

268
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:56,486
And kick. And kick.

269
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,585
All right, bring that knee...
This is my house!

270
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,155
I need you out of here!
This is my exercise time!

271
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,358
Did you hear me? I said get out!

272
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,007
Help!

273
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,830
Get out of my house!

274
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:08,678
- Get out!
- Gramma--

275
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:10,414
Thank goodness, Matthew.

276
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,024
She tried to turn off my tv!

277
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,469
Who tried to turn off--

278
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,958
- She did.
- See, grandma, there's nobody here--

279
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:17,878
No, there.

280
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,308
Okay, who are you?

281
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,778
Carlotta, Carlotta Alonso.

282
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,021
Don't let her throw away my tapioca.

283
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,561
The in-home nurse you demanded.

284
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,238
This is junk.

285
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,505
That's what I have every night.

286
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,355
I need to get rid of this tv.

287
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,771
Oh no no no, see--

288
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,562
Oh, get out of my house!

289
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,405
- I can't. It's my job.
- We tend to keep the tv on.

290
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,743
'cause it seems to be the only thing
that calms her down.

291
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,157
It's destroying her mind.

292
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,825
I'm sorry, but a lot of things
are going to have to change.

293
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:45,214
Like?

294
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,733
Where am I supposed to sleep?

295
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,119
What do you mean, sleep?

296
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,139
I mean sleep. I'm going to live here.

297
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,907
What you doing, coach?

298
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,034
Tell me what you're gonna say
to the committee.

299
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,323
- I got it down, no worries.
- Good, let's hear it.

300
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,753
Nah, coach, I want it
to sound spontaneous.

301
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,364
You know, from the heart.

302
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:29,858
That's great, so let's hear it then.
Be spontaneous.

303
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,437
All right.

304
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:33,476
I'm sorry that I took those tickets

305
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,146
to Justin Timberlake.

306
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,630
Especially when they didn't
have no cristal in the box!

307
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:39,899
Can you believe that?

308
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,336
- I don't drink no cheap stuff.
- That's real funny.

309
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,484
You know what's not in your
little speech, though?

310
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,892
- What's that, coach?
- Put a little contrition into it.

311
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,475
You know what that is?

312
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,524
I got an idea. But that's probably
because I'm not sorry.

313
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,458
- You're not sorry.
- No, sir, I'm not.

314
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:55,751
You hear that, America?

315
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:59,882
I'm not sorry! How about that?

316
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,348
Tell me, hot shot,
you payed for this car all yourself?

317
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,759
- Oh yeah. All by myself.

318
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,814
You pay for all that nice jewelry
by yourself?

319
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,330
Yes, sir, I got a paper route.

320
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,796
Oh, come on, coach!

321
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,678
Everybody know we take stuff!

322
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,852
Look, I play football!

323
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:14,390
Hell, they should be paying me.

324
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,888
I bring a million dollars
to this school every year.

325
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,389
Shoot, this stuff started for me
when I was in pee wee.

326
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,759
- I got a ice cream.
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

327
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:23,188
Everything's fine.

328
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:25,419
Me and Gracie are out for a walk,
walking to school.

329
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:28,227
And in fact, Gracie has a couple
of words for you. Hold on.

330
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,061
Don't do that. Now's not the time.

331
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,523
Talk to your daddy.

332
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:35,118
Hello, it's dad.

333
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,096
<i>It's daddy. I love you, Grace.</i>

334
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,496
I love you. Dad loves you.
Hey, I love you.

335
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,661
Now, let me talk to mom. Tammy, hello?

336
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,779
I gotta go.
I'll call you back-- bye.

337
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,153
- I-- what?
- I just wanna ask you one thing.

338
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:49,105
What you doing in the car with me

339
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,785
when you have a new baby?

340
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,870
You don't just open the door, Buddy.
This is not your house anymore.

341
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,440
What are all my trophies
doing out in the front?

342
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,931
I don't want 'em anymore.

343
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,751
You get 'em out of here by Sunday
or they're going in the garbage.

344
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:08,817
- And you're early.
- Yeah, five minutes.

345
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,653
- Can I come in my house?
- No. You know what, frankly, Buddy?

346
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,486
I don't think feel safe.

347
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,556
I'm sorry, Pam, about the other night.

348
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,726
You know... I admit, I lost it.

349
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,812
I just, uh...

350
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,357
You know, a man can only
be pushed so far.

351
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,995
Don't you even dare talk
to me about being pushed, Buddy.

352
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,086
- I am the victim here.
- I think it's about time

353
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,754
for us to lose the victim stuff.

354
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:30,973
You're too much--

355
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,424
I can't believe you!

356
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:33,944
Mom.

357
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,950
Come on, dad, let's get this over with.

358
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:37,783
Okay. Hey, Bud.

359
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,551
Hey, Thabs, let's go.

360
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,401
Hey, what's that, a soccer ball?

361
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,638
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do it.

362
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,208
Gonna have some fun!

363
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,958
There's always,
like, a middle man of bands.

364
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:51,051
You gotta get songs written.

365
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,036
I always have problems
with lights.

366
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,320
And I always want a smoke machine
or something like that.

367
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,464
How often do you get a smoke machine
in a place with a band, right?

368
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,584
Thank you.

369
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:10,753
Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,107
Just picking up my paycheck.

371
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,461
Okay.

372
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,065
So where did you go the other night?

373
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:21,626
Oh, um, I actually--
I had another party to go to.

374
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,060
Oh, cool. Ah, no.

375
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,512
I mean, someone had said
they saw you get picked up

376
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:27,887
by your dad or something.

377
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,593
That was my older friend.

378
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:30,764
Yeah.

379
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,431
But I got a lot of studying to do,

380
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:35,356
so I'll, uh... I'll see you around.

381
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:38,753
Oh, that's right. School started, huh?

382
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,444
- Yeah.
- Okay.

383
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:44,269
So... So I guess this is good-bye?

384
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:46,614
I guess it is.

385
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:49,496
All right, well, hey,
don't go growing up too fast,

386
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,471
'cause you're gonna be a heartbreaker.

387
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,981
Guys are just gonna
be busting down your doors,

388
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,137
so watch out.

389
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,235
So I'll see you around, kid.

390
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,405
Hey, Glen.

391
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:12,314
Hope you don't mind. We just dropped by.

392
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,516
I'm gonna plop down
on your couch right now.

393
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,532
I'm exhausted.
I just walked all the way from my house.

394
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,327
You walked all the way from your house?

395
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,714
Yeah, we did. It is boiling hot.

396
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,549
Yeah, it's 105 degrees out there.

397
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,020
That's completely insane.

398
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,290
Well, it's not insane
when you have a baby

399
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,936
who won't stay quiet unless
you're movin' her all the time.

400
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,139
And I figured I'd kill
two birds with one stone.

401
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:33,259
Right.

402
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,992
What's your problem with that, Glen?

403
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,324
It's no problem,

404
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:40,717
it's just that you're profusely
sweating, you got a newborn baby.

405
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,812
You're walking
in 105-degree temperature.

406
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,036
You're perspiring. It's your glands.

407
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,544
I'm sorry, I don't need you
talking about my perspiration.

408
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,540
I don't need you talking
about my glands.

409
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,948
I came to talk about the job.

410
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,011
Which you might need
a little bit of help with.

411
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,884
I might need
a little bit of help with it.

412
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,659
I'm really not qualified to be doing it.

413
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,232
But I think what's more important

414
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,231
is your behavior,
you bringing this baby here.

415
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,001
I'm concerned about the baby's health.

416
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,815
- It could get sick here.
- Excuse me,

417
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:06,535
Let me tell you something right now.
Right here and right now.

418
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,882
This isn't my first barbeque,
Glen, all right?

419
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,163
So I don't appreciate

420
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,690
you going on and on and on
about what a bad mother I am.

421
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,840
I'm not trying to say
that you're a bad mother.

422
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,828
Oh, really?
That's what it sounds like to me.

423
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,910
I'm not trying to say
that you're a bad mother.

424
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,703
- What I am saying, although...
- Now look...

425
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,496
I'm afraid to say it to you right now,

426
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,953
because, frankly,
you frighten me a little bit.

427
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,460
You got a lot of nerve.

428
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:30,276
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, no, I was trying to help.

429
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,563
I was trying to help by coming over here

430
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:34,490
which I think you need
a little bit of help.

431
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:36,235
So don't you go and you judge me

432
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,091
on what kind of mother I'm being.

433
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,294
How dare you?

434
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:40,958
That's not what I was trying to do.

435
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,709
Well, how dare you?
'Cause that's what it sounded like.

436
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,626
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to upset you or...

437
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:46,766
Well, too late.

438
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,297
This is just a bad idea.

439
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,767
You know what,
you just go on and do your job.

440
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,779
You want something to drink?
You want some water or something?

441
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:58,776
You know what, I'm gonna
get you a glass of water, okay?

442
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:03,492
Hey, uh. Julie, it's Matt.

443
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,802
Um, you told me to call later.

444
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,506
And it's later, so I'm calling.

445
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:13,273
Anyways, call me back.

446
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,043
And then I'll talk to you later.

447
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,401
Bye.

448
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,975
Sorry, Gracie.

449
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,119
There's a bump.

450
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,733
Hey, Mrs. Taylor!

451
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,627
Hey hey! Jason Street. How you doing?

452
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,939
- I'm good. How are you?
- Great, never better.

453
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,323
Awesome.
I was wondering if I could have--

454
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,935
- See baby Gracie?
- Hi, Gracie.

455
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:47,428
I was wondering if I could
have a second of your time?

456
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,785
Sure. No problem.

457
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,694
We're just walking home.

458
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,958
I've been having this dream lately.

459
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,217
A lot. And you're in it.

460
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:01,881
So in the dream

461
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,875
you tell me to get up and walk.

462
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:07,725
And I do.

463
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,256
I walk

464
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,329
'cause you told me to.
You make me walk.

465
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,788
- Really?
- Yeah.

466
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:18,984
And one day after having the dream,

467
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,346
I found out I could do this again.

468
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,758
I can make a fist with my right hand.
Which I couldn't do before.

469
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,747
And I still can't do it
with my left, but...

470
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:31,478
That's great, that's great, Jason.

471
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:34,208
I just wanna talk to you,
'cause I feel like...

472
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,009
Like it really means something.

473
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,019
I think it means I'm gonna walk again.

474
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,015
Soon.

475
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,175
How about that?

476
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:47,839
So, uh, anyway, I guess I just
want to say thank you.

477
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,755
You have a great day. Bye, Gracie.

478
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:54,200
You're welcome. I'm so glad
I got to see you today.

479
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,163
Me too.

480
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,548
You have a great day,
Mrs. Taylor! Thank you.

481
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,308
Hurry up, let's go.

482
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,144
Let me ask you something, coach.

483
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
You got that baby on a schedule?

484
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,541
Oh, wait, you wouldn't
know that, would you?

485
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:14,877
No, but seriously,

486
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,697
how's your wife feel
about being alone with the baby?

487
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,514
That was a question, coach.

488
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:20,800
Hurry up, let's go.

489
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:22,063
Look at that scowl.

490
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:23,719
I gotta get a picture of this.

491
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,738
Hold on.
I'm gonna send this to your baby.

492
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:28,266
Think everything's a damn joke,
don't you?

493
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,309
It's all a big damn joke to you.

494
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:32,728
All the talent you got,
what do you use it for, huh?

495
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,099
Getting free stuff
and letting your team down.

496
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,530
You know what my opinion is?

497
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:39,320
You don't deserve to play the game.
What do you think about that?

498
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,071
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- You let your team down,

499
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,931
you let yourself down.
And you don't care

500
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,148
You don't care if you
finish out the season.

501
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,826
'cause I'm sure big ol' Antoine,
he's got it all figured out.

502
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,625
He's got a backup plan, doesn't he?

503
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,290
Who am I talking to?

504
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,609
Who am I?

505
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:58,013
Who the hell are you?

506
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,742
Oh, hey, Landry.

507
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:21,235
I just wanted to say congratulations
on making the football team.

508
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:24,212
I'm actually
sort of your rally girl.

509
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:26,678
- Sort of my rally...
- Yeah.

510
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,084
So you're my rally girl?

511
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,204
Wow, Landry.

512
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,478
Your own personal rally girl.

513
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:33,218
I guess you've arrived.

514
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:35,674
Anyway, we can work out
the details later.

515
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,085
I just wanted to say hi.

516
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,184
You think that all human beings

517
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,654
are capable of evil?

518
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,104
I'm gonna borrow him for a second.

519
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:45,551
I mean, obviously some are.

520
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,114
I was asking her a question.
You don't have to rip me away.

521
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:51,719
I'm not a little kid.
You don't have to hold my arm.

522
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,236
- Bye, thank you.
- Bye. What the hell are you doing?

523
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:57,397
- What am I doing?
- Yeah. Are you insane?

524
00:23:58,191 --> 00:23:59,689
You have got to hold it together.

525
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,089
Do you have no empathy
about anything, Tyra?

526
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,628
So you have ice water
running through your veins?

527
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:06,283
A human being is dead because of me.

528
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,924
And what are you doing?

529
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:09,535
You're out having a great time.

530
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:11,611
And you know what,
he was a rapist, okay?

531
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,785
Stop acting like he was
some kind of a saint.

532
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,255
- I'm not acting like--
- Act like a man then!

533
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,172
Want me to act like a man.

534
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,089
Yeah.

535
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,274
See, that's real easy for you to say,

536
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,698
because you're not the one
who killed him, are you?

537
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,506
You don't have to think about that.

538
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,874
You don't have to close your eyes
and hear the sound of his skull cracking

539
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,613
every time you go to sleep, do you?

540
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:42,767
Don't tell me to act like a man.

541
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,464
Because the thing about this is,

542
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:46,300
I would do that again
for you in a second

543
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,934
because he hurt you
and because I'm in love with you.

544
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,069
And don't-- Don't look at me like that.

545
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,217
All right, don't. Because you know.

546
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:54,444
You've known forever.

547
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:56,414
It's not some big secret, all right?

548
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,216
Let's not pretend that this was
some great thing that we did.

549
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,945
And let's-- just don't tell me
to become a man, all right?

550
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:06,798
Because if that's
your definition of a man,

551
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,349
that's extremely sad.

552
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:12,756
All right?

553
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,379
Look, gentlemen, I'm not here
to make excuses.

554
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,339
I mean, everybody makes mistakes.

555
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,192
I made one. A big one.

556
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,088
And I'm sorry for that.

557
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:40,207
I should know better, my mom
raised me better than that.

558
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,001
And I swear to you, on the Bible,

559
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,018
I promise you it won't happen again.

560
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,421
I wasn't raised that way. I know better.

561
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,387
But it was a mistake.

562
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,835
All I wanna do is play ball.

563
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,979
It's been my dream...

564
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,189
to make it to the NFL.

565
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,711
Gentlemen, whether he plays
at TMU or not,

566
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,773
Antoine Beltrane's gonna go the NFL.

567
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:06,319
That's my opinion.

568
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,555
He's either gonna go as a selfish,

569
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:09,945
undisciplined punk,

570
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,865
or you can allow us to shape him

571
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:14,635
into what I believe he could be.

572
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:16,589
The problem's systemic.

573
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:20,036
It's a culture in football that's been
allowed to have a life of its own.

574
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,673
It's no great secret.

575
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,831
I mean, he's not the only prima donna.

576
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,084
The fact of the matter is,
we're asking for one year

577
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,785
to drill some sense into the kid.

578
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,097
Take away his iPhone.
Take away his cars,.

579
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:32,218
his ridiculous jewelry,
and all the other crap.

580
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,929
And we make his life miserable
for a season.

581
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:37,696
He's gonna be representing us,

582
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:39,794
and I propose that our responsibility

583
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:42,023
lies in doing better
by Antoine Beltrane.

584
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,723
Okay, see, with this

585
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,961
my grandma likes to have
newspapers, magazines,

586
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,428
'cause then she can read it.

587
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:00,005
One time I had a client
who never threw anything away.

588
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,352
She was crushed to death
under a pile of newspapers.

589
00:27:02,472 --> 00:27:04,122
- It that what you want, Matt?
- No.

590
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,472
I can't live here unless it's clean.

591
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,627
Okay.

592
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,463
We, that means you,

593
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,591
should install a guard rail
on the steps.

594
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,536
The thing we have to be careful of

595
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:16,303
at her age is falling down.

596
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,944
And we're all going to have
dinner together from now on.

597
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,432
Okay, look, that's great.
But what about her mind?

598
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,300
- Like, how are we gonna help...
- Yeah, she's a little cuckoo.

599
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,393
She needs structure.
She needs the tv off.

600
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:29,242
She needs crossword puzzles
and walks and conversation.

601
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:31,250
Okay, but-- whoa, hey,
where are you going?

602
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,966
You people may have a mildew problem.

603
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:34,717
Okay, look, this is my room, so...

604
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:37,068
Did you draw this?

605
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,909
Yeah. Can I have it back, please?

606
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,925
What's the matter? It's good.

607
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,684
Thanks, but this is my room,
so I think...

608
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,908
It's kind of depressing.
You need some new curtains.

609
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,262
- Curtains?
- How old are these sheets?

610
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,105
- I don't know.
- Help me move the bed.

611
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:52,673
No, we're not moving the-- no.

612
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,679
Really, Matt?

613
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,744
Haven't you heard of the internet?

614
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,894
Yeah, that's funny.
That's funny, thanks.

615
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,152
I mean...

616
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,689
Baby, you are hot.

617
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,539
Hey, Jules, come here and feel her,

618
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:16,282
tell me if you think she's hot.

619
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,045
Um, I really don't know
anything about babies.

620
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,342
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,153
But Lois is outside waiting,
so I really gotta go.

622
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,252
Well, be home by 10:00, please.

623
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:26,749
All right, I love you.

624
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:28,855
Love you.

625
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,219
Gracie, now, don't do this to.

626
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:35,965
Yeah?

627
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:37,968
Coach, you wanted to see me?

628
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,933
Ah, come on in, Taylor.

629
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:42,388
- Three games.
- Sir?

630
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:46,126
Antoine Beltrane's
only gonna be out three games.

631
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,411
Well... that's good.

632
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,163
You're damn right it is.

633
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,383
He said you put on
quite a show up there.

634
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:56,111
He also said that you
hollered at him pretty good.

635
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,530
He kind of has that effect on people.

636
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:03,248
I bet you were one hell
of a high school coach, Taylor.

637
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,247
I appreciate that, coach.

638
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,591
Thank you.

639
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,335
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing good.

640
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,549
So have you made it
a point of stalking me

641
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:31,669
or something?

642
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,140
No.

643
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:36,538
Just a lucky coincidence.

644
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:37,962
What are you doing?

645
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:40,046
I am debugging my friend's windshield.

646
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:41,790
No, I mean tonight.

647
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,396
What are you all

648
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:44,731
dressed up for?

649
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:48,489
Oh, um, it's the big Panther pep rally.

650
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,666
Oh, yeah!

651
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,516
Oh, man, that sounds like fun.

652
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:55,913
Yeah, you have no idea.

653
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,266
I'm sure I don't.

654
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,125
Well, you know what?

655
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,763
Why don't you hop in?

656
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:06,533
I'll take you in the most
majestic vehicle on earth.

657
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,039
Come on, really.

658
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:12,987
I'll give you a ride.

659
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Okay.

660
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,983
I just gotta go tell Lois, though.

661
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,247
Yeah.

662
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,396
We're happy to have
you all come out here.

663
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,385
And we especially wanna thank you

664
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:24,555
for coming out to my ranch here tonight.

665
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,507
We really, really appreciate it.

666
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,812
And now the minute
you've all been waiting for, you guys!

667
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,331
It's time to meet

668
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:32,487
the 2006

669
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:34,946
Dillon high school State champions!

670
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,506
Hey baby, y'all ready
for some Smash ball?

671
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,736
Oh, my God.

672
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,005
Yeah, I used to have
a place like this once, too,

673
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,020
but I sold it for this van.

674
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:25,423
So this is how you guys throw a party.

675
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:28,013
Let's just say that football
isn't lost on Dillon.

676
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,843
Well, hey, it was nice seeing you again.

677
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,402
- Yeah. Thanks for the ride.
- It was good stuff.

678
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,191
Um, next time you wanna...

679
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,853
You can call me sometime.

680
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,250
I'm sorry, did I miss your thing?

681
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,710
Yeah.

682
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:08,297
Doesn't matter.
It's the Smash show, anyway.

683
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:15,656
Look, I think we really need to talk.

684
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Okay.

685
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,450
Talk.

686
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:29,687
I just think that...
That maybe we've changed

687
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:30,861
or something.

688
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:35,173
The point is, it's me. It's not you.

689
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,602
You didn't do anything.

690
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,572
I know I didn't do anything.

691
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,278
I know it's not me.

692
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:43,453
I know it's--

693
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,470
I know it's the Swede.

694
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,869
No, it's not the Swede.

695
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:49,989
But how about

696
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:54,266
just be honest with me?

697
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:58,314
Just tell me the truth.

698
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:02,673
It's just...

699
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,933
It's the Swede, it's my parents,

700
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:11,414
it's me feeling trapped.

701
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:13,384
It's me turning into my mom.

702
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,188
It's just... I don't know.

703
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,595
Nothing seems right anymore.

704
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:22,045
And I just really need some space.

705
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,273
Oh, Lester.

706
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:51,697
Yeah, no, Garrity--

707
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:53,567
Garrity Mortors is not good enough.

708
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:55,137
It's not wholesome.

709
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:56,985
This is wholesome.

710
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,588
This is Lester's wholesome trophy room.

711
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,332
didn't even shoot
one of these damn animals. Probably.

712
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:07,005
And here is Mr. Lester out there.

713
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:10,752
Working that hillbilly.

714
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:15,758
Work that old ridge runnin'
hillbilly mouth breather.

715
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,522
So, there's 14 seconds left,

716
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:24,909
rain's coming down hard.

717
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,360
Jimmy Carter's the President,

718
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:28,652
the country is depressed.
Dillon is depressed.

719
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,967
By God, it's time
to win the State championship.

720
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,148
Tt's time for Buddy Garrity
to get this thing done,

721
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:34,629
You know what I'm saying?

722
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:37,544
It's like... it's...

723
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,812
Lester, come over here.
You gotta hear this.

724
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,245
This is the State championship game.
14 seconds left.

725
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:45,933
It's gotta be a run-pass option.

726
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:47,053
Okay.

727
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,465
You got Speeze on that side.
I got Nippy on that side.

728
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:51,939
- Let me get that.
- No, I'm telling the story!

729
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,156
So I'm in the center.
I got Billy right here, and I go back.

730
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:56,650
So I remember this. Tomahawk,

731
00:34:57,905 --> 00:34:58,905
run pass over!

732
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,528
Sorry, ma'am. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

733
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,649
- That's enough, now.
- Get your hands off me!

734
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,603
You want some of me, boy?
I will dough pop you right now!

735
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:08,938
You want me? Come on!
Let's go. Let's go.

736
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:11,658
- You need to just take it easy.
- Let's go, boy!

737
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,729
Lester, do you want some of me now boy?

738
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:15,322
I got him.

739
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:16,908
It's fine. Riggo.

740
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,873
It's Riggins. Tim Riggins
right here, baby. State champion.

741
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:21,235
State champion,

742
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,501
Lester never played.

743
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:26,062
It's all right.

744
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,313
I think I lost, Riggo.

745
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:32,914
I never lost in my life.

746
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,065
I have lost my family.

747
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:38,507
Now I lost football.

748
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:39,627
What's going on?

749
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:42,046
What is he, drunk?

750
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:44,310
I don't know, Lyla.
Maybe he's had one too many.

751
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,780
What do you think?

752
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:47,285
Go. I got it.

753
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,485
I can do this. You must be loving this.

754
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,672
- I got it.
- Why would I love this?

755
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,223
I don't know. Just go, please.

756
00:35:53,393 --> 00:35:54,993
- You want me to leave?
- Just go!

757
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,900
I got it. Get up, please.

758
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:01,164
It's spinning, it's spinning,

759
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:03,622
- I love you.
- Okay, dad, I need you to get up, okay?

760
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,811
I love you.

761
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:09,781
My head is spinnin'.

762
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:12,997
Can you help me, please?

763
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:15,946
Please.

764
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:19,986
- There we go.
- This is it? This is mine?

765
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,339
This is your barn, huh?

766
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:23,945
- I love you.
- There we go.

767
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:25,065
I love you.

768
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,311
- Where's your bed, dad?
- I'm sorry.

769
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:28,602
It's in here.

770
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:31,615
Gotta roll you over, dad.

771
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,057
Been here before.

772
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:36,904
All right, I got it.

773
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:38,068
I'm sorry.

774
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:40,879
I'm sorry, guys. Thanks.

775
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,199
- Good night, champ.
- I just wanted to play

776
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:45,555
in a game...

777
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:47,855
I love you both.

778
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:05,678
Why is everything always falling apart?

779
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,143
Listen, I think you'll be just fine.

780
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:17,158
Believe me, I've seen
a few drunks in my day

781
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,512
and he's not one of 'em.

782
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,013
He's not.

783
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,369
He's just sad, that's all.

784
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:27,298
He made his bed.

785
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:33,957
How you doing?

786
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:37,814
I'm okay.

787
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:41,932
You?

788
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:44,488
I'm great.

789
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:48,741
You better go.

790
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:51,097
You probably have a three-way to get to

791
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,285
or something.

792
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,364
Good night, Lyla.

793
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:18,134
All right, Tammy, make sure
she's getting enough fluids.

794
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,254
Offer her formula after you breastfeed.

795
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,662
And she needs to eat
once every hour, okay?

796
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,749
Maybe you and your husband
can take shifts.

797
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,819
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

798
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,059
- She's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

799
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,749
Do you have anybody you can call?

800
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:32,919
Maybe you shouldn't drive yourself home.

801
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:36,525
Babe, she's fine. I swear.

802
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,534
The doctor brought her fever right down.

803
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,645
And she's starting to sleep now.

804
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:45,852
She's nice and quiet.

805
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,604
No, I don't want you running home.

806
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:50,789
You just stay. Sit tight where you are.

807
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:53,009
I don't want you
coming back here, honey.

808
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:55,673
Honey, I'm fine, I swear.

809
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:57,887
And she's good.

810
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,685
It's trip to the emergency room.

811
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:02,458
You know how many times
Julie got dragged over here?

812
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,493
All right, I love you, baby.

813
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:05,613
I promise.

814
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,868
Okay, all right. I love you so much.

815
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:11,072
Bye.

816
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:13,923
Hey.

817
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:15,328
Hey, Glen.

818
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,281
Thank you for coming.

819
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,913
You-- are you okay?

820
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,033
yeah, I'm good.

821
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:25,797
So she's waking up on you.

822
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:29,251
I'm sorry.

823
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:30,662
You're so sweet.

824
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:32,672
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

825
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:35,313
No, you know, it's fine.
I wasn't doing anything.

826
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:37,928
You're so sweet,
and I didn't have anybody else to call.

827
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,305
Thank you very much.

828
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,164
I really appreciate it.
You're real nice.

829
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm sorry I was kind of a bitch to you.

830
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,870
I'm just a little emotional
at the moment.

831
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,824
You weren't a bitch to me at all.

832
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,744
It's fine. It's really no big deal.

833
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:50,530
You're so sweet. Thank you.

834
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,598
- You have everything?
- I think so, yeah.

835
00:39:52,846 --> 00:39:53,846
Okay, let's go.

836
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:55,149
Okay, sweetheart.

837
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,851
- That's a beautiful baby.
- Thank you.

838
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:00,405
Hey, you know, this might not

839
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:02,205
be any of my business.

840
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm not trying to step over the line,
but this whole ordeal,

841
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,867
this living apart
from your husband thing?

842
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:11,129
What was the point of that exactly?

843
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:13,158
I don't know.

844
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:16,011
That was just my idea.

845
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,813
It was just a stupid idea.

846
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,956
How did you get in here?

847
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:52,964
I'm glad he's dead.

848
00:40:56,172 --> 00:40:57,172
God, I...

849
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,870
You know,

850
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,583
he wasn't gonna stop.

851
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:10,141
He was just gonna
keep on doing that to me.

852
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:13,893
You know, maybe something's
wrong with me,

853
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:15,059
but I am...

854
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:20,468
I am so glad he's dead.

855
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:24,126
I just, um...

856
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,680
I wish I was the one who killed him.

857
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,131
Don't-- Don't say that.

858
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:33,292
- No.
- Don't.

859
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,370
You are the best guy

860
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,186
- I have ever known--
- Stop

861
00:41:37,306 --> 00:41:39,796
No, and if anything
happens to you because of me,

862
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:44,555
I would never forgive myself.

863
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:47,902
I am so sorry.

864
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,631
Oh, nah. Don't be sorry.

865
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,554
There's nothing to be sorry about.

866
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:03,019
It's all right. We're gonna be fine.

867
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:04,823
Stop.
