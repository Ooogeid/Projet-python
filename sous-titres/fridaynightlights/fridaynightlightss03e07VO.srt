1
00:00:00,-002 --> 00:00:02,671
I would like
to propose a toast to QB1

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,757
of the Dillon Panthers.
Cheers, pal!

3
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,968
That is what I'm talking about,
young man. Way to go!

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,973
I think our band can be really great.
You really need to get over this girl.

5
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:15,017
Let's get to work. And let's start
with this... Here, work list.

6
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,229
- I miss you like crazy. You know that?
- We love you too.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,857
- Put the little man on.
- Am I really that boring to talk to?

8
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,484
No, I just don't want my son
to forget my voice.

9
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:26,654
I'm proud of you.
You're here with me and not with mom

10
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:30,072
in Northern California
with some vegetarian, raising figs.

11
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,201
I'm just... It's a great day, baby!
Let's go.

12
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:36,456
- So, where the hell is gate 4?
- Actually, I'm pretty sure it's gate 2.

13
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:38,750
Thank you very much
for your unsolicited

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,557
wrong opinion, Mr. Tim Riggins.

15
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:42,670
Dad, we should talk
about this camping thing.

16
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:46,087
Honey, this is gonna be
quality family time,

17
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:47,577
out, in nature.

18
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:51,574
Here they are.

19
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,055
Hi, guys!

20
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,308
- Look at 'em. They're big!
- Hi, Taby!

21
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,227
Little Bud, little Bud.

22
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:00,997
Hey, Bud.
How you're doing, Buddy?

23
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,967
Good to see you. Look at you!
How big you are.

24
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,361
We better call Mack Brown and tell him
we got a linebacker, right here.

25
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,946
No, I'm in the soccer now, dad.

26
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:13,207
Son, football is in the Garrity DNA.
You're gonna be a football player.

27
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,494
Look at my little sweetheart.
Hey, baby!

28
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:17,432
You look like a hippie.

29
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,251
- Give me a big ol' hug.
- Dad, dad, you're all sweating.

30
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:23,586
- I'm not sweating, jeez.
- Not sweating.

31
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:26,087
Can Gretchen come over later
and watch <i>Sex and the City</i> movie?

32
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:28,792
- We're going to miniature golf tonight.
- Miniature golfing?

33
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,462
Heck yeah, it's fun.
All right, let's go!

34
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,717
Just how long
do you think this is gonna last?

35
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:37,520
- I don't know, as long as they want.
- Let's not make it last too long.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,477
But it'll be fine, come on.

37
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:42,907
I feel sorry for this kid the way his
dad breathes down his neck all the time.

38
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:46,109
Well, everyone has their own way.
And I like Katie.

39
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:49,264
- Do you? I'm glad we're here then.
- She's nice.

40
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,029
- Come on.
- Hi.

41
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:55,701
Guess what I have upstairs.

42
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,015
The California Closets guy has been here
and I have a brand new bedroom.

43
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,041
You've gotta see it.
It totally changed my life.

44
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,792
Real quick then we should go,
he's gonna drive me home.

45
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,171
- Cause you're gonna want one.
- Sweety, 5 minutes.

46
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,548
Please, okay? Don't...
I'm sorry, Coach.

47
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,716
- Hi J.D, how are you?
- Good.

48
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,885
- J.D, how are you?
- Coach, how are you?

49
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,721
- We've got a tee-time Sunday at 9 a.m.
- All right.

50
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,682
Better bring your A-game, old man.

51
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,736
He's hurting me, Coach!

52
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,846
My A-game? Excuse me.

53
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,147
Coach is here. Tell the truth,
who won last time?

54
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,358
- He did.
- That's correct.

55
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,339
I'm going to bed.
I'm tired.

56
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,133
- Night dad, night coach.
- Good night.

57
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:32,988
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

58
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,838
- That's a good boy.
- He is a very good boy.

59
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:41,415
Due mostly to my wife,
but he is a really good boy.

60
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,835
Listen, just real quick:

61
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:48,170
yesterday at church,
when we were speaking about J.D,

62
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,491
as his coach, that made me
a little uncomfortable.

63
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,299
I didn't mean to cross any lines.
Sorry.

64
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,801
No, I understand that.

65
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,197
He's a very special boy
and I just hate it

66
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,519
when I see him screwing things up
like that, that's all.

67
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,658
- Understood.
- Thank you for bringing it up.

68
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,689
It's appreciated.
And it will not happen again.

69
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:07,272
- Well, it's not matter of that...
- We're good.

70
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:11,360
- That was a hell of a dinner.
- Well, dinner is not over, sir.

71
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,322
Dinner is far from over.
Here we go.

72
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:17,826
- Say when.
- When.

73
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:18,986
When...

74
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:21,097
Coach...

75
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,417
To you and me.
We make a hell of a team.

76
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,685
There's something
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

77
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,463
- About Tim.
- Shoot.

78
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:53,212
Well, I mean,
it's a recruitment letter.

79
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,030
From O.U, that's nice, but it's...

80
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,188
Yeah, we've gotten
a couple of these and...

81
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,752
You know, I replied but I haven't
heard anything back, so...

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,222
- Well...
- Here.

83
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,838
It's pretty basic
recruitment letter.

84
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,014
Thank you.

85
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,973
You know, they probably send out...

86
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:12,102
a lot of them. You know,
I got a few hundred when I was...

87
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:15,549
in high school, so...
Tim's not exactly college material...

88
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,504
I wouldn't get my hopes too high.

89
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,284
Look, Street...

90
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:24,103
I know the kid is an idiot.
You don't have to tell me about it.

91
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:28,408
But if there's anything I can do
to get him into college, I need to know.

92
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:30,865
Forget it.

93
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,606
That's just stupid. What the hell
would I know about this anyway?

94
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:35,276
No, it's not stupid...

95
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,302
Billy. It's just...

96
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,491
He just gotta work harder than the other
5-star recruits out there.

97
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,922
Look man... You just know way more
about this stuff than I do.

98
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,092
Just tell me what I need to do.

99
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,918
I'd say the first you do is start
to gather a highlight reel for him.

100
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:54,122
Go through his games, and pick out some
of his best places, throw 'em on a tape.

101
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,572
Maybe get an interview of Coach
or something like that.

102
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,652
You throw it all together,
send it out to schools,

103
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,133
- maybe it'll raise a little interest.
- I like that.

104
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,303
That's good.

105
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,265
- We're making a movie.
- A movie?

106
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,768
- What are you talking about?
- You're ambitious.

107
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,021
- What are you guys doing?
- Yeah, seriously.

108
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,501
What do you mean?
We're not doing anything.

109
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,944
- Because we're finished.
- Sweet.

110
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,327
With everything?

111
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,891
Yeah, man, the paint is dry,
the curtains are up, and...

112
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:24,186
extremely unique. And they ain't got
that despicable Billy's mouth.

113
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,036
- I think we're good.
- That's funny.

114
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,218
2 idiots
and a couple of cripples can do it.

115
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,417
- It's a job well done!
- Like the Special Olympics.

116
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:34,044
All right, so what's next?
Do we call that Missy lady?

117
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,255
- That Realtor lady?
- No, we don't call her.

118
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,383
All she's gonna wanna do is stick a sign
in the ground and charge us 6% so...

119
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,094
- no, we don't call her.
- Okay, so what do we do, then?

120
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,501
We sell the house.
Ourselves.

121
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:48,786
- What?
- I mean, how hard can it be?

122
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,727
Yeah, how hard can it be?

123
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:57,442
3x07: KEEPING UP APPEARANCES

124
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,490
Subtitles: Team Panthers
With the participation of:

125
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,746
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac

126
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:48,251
Tami, it was an accident, okay?

127
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:51,338
Jamarcus is a good kid, he just got
a little carried away, it's no big deal.

128
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,249
You tell that
to Bree Hudson's mother.

129
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,535
Hey, we're talking about
our starting fullback here.

130
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,129
I know who we're talking about. This is
his 3rd time in my office this semester.

131
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,306
Jamarcus Hall.

132
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:03,634
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, Principal Taylor.

133
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,642
First of all,
I wanna say it was an accident.

134
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,041
I didn't mean to catch Bree's hair
on fire, I promise.

135
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,058
What in the hell did you think was gonna
happen when you spray deodorant

136
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,598
into a Bunsen burner?

137
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,062
- I didn't think it all the way through.
- Sit down.

138
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:17,905
Come on, now.
Good lord...

139
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,528
- We've been down this road before.
- Yes, ma'am.

140
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:27,117
And what did we talk about last time
when we had this conversation?

141
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:30,118
- You gotta let me play Friday, I've to.
- That is a conversation

142
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,407
that we're gonna have to have with your
parents, this afternoon after school.

143
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,124
- You can't call my parent.
- That's what we talked about.

144
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,385
Maybe you ought to bring Coach Taylor
into the loop on this thing here.

145
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:42,756
Now, Coach McGill, why do I need to talk
to coach Taylor about a conversation

146
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,384
I'll be having with Jamarcus
and his parents this afternoon?

147
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,887
Now you get on outta here
cause I need to call your parents.

148
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,221
You need to think, sir.

149
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:52,524
I'll see you later on.

150
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,311
Thank you for your help,
Coach McGill.

151
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,230
Come on...

152
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,888
Honestly...

153
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,158
Hey, Landry!

154
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,078
What are you doing?

155
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:10,195
Nothing, I'm just sitting here playing
guitar and not thinking about Tyra.

156
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,961
<i>Hey, y'all, this is Tyra Collette,</i>

157
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:17,621
<i>reminding everyone that Dillon
has annual blood drives today.</i>

158
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:21,503
<i>So come on and donate your blood on 6th
period and we're gonna bring cookie.</i>

159
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,171
That's unbelievable.

160
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,361
She's everywhere...

161
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,512
<i>I know a girl who</i>

162
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,929
<i>Thinks of toast</i>

163
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,912
<i>She'll make you breakfast</i>

164
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,457
<i>She'll make you toast</i>

165
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,307
<i>She don't use butter</i>

166
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,196
<i>She don't use cheese</i>

167
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:51,272
<i>She don't use jelly or</i>

168
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:54,667
<i>Any of these</i>

169
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:56,497
Cheer up.

170
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,459
<i>She uses</i>

171
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,702
<i>vaseline</i>

172
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:09,820
<i>She uses vaseline</i>

173
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,805
I really thought for sure
that would cheer you up.

174
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,279
This whole emo thing
you've got going on...

175
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,768
It's okay. But...

176
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:20,354
Would you give me a ride home
tomorrow after practice?

177
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,985
I will give you a ride
after practice tomorrow.

178
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,672
Thank you.
And, just cheer up, you know.

179
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,842
Tomorrow is a brand new day.

180
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,760
Nothing to worry about.

181
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,245
New things.
I'll see you soon.

182
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:42,293
Tim Riggins,
number 33 for the Dillon Panthers,

183
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,819
- what are your interests?
- My interests...

184
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:47,173
I like football and...

185
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,889
I love, you know,
playing on Friday nights.

186
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,387
And hopefully, I can play
Saturday nights. That's college night.

187
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:56,181
- I'm not a big fan of practice, though.
- You love Gwen Stefani?

188
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,517
- Bananas...
- What the hell was that, man?

189
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,250
What are you doing, man?
What are you talking about?

190
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,481
- We try to shoot a video!
- That was my best take yet.

191
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,440
Oh, yeah,
that's your best take, yet?

192
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:07,446
- Guys!
- What?

193
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,956
We gotta keep our eyes
on the ball. That's this house.

194
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,480
- Can we focus?
- I'm focused.

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,053
I went out, I got the set-up sheets,
I think they look pretty good.

196
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,785
Does anybody else wanna
take a look at 'em?

197
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:19,705
That's damn good, man.
Color and everything.

198
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,333
Wait... 295?

199
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:24,413
I thought you said 265.

200
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:28,415
I looked it up on how much it costs
in the neighborhood, I'll tell you...

201
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:31,035
with all the upgrades we did
on the house, 295 is the least.

202
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:32,634
Street, my is my nest egg.

203
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,242
- I worked really hard for this.
- It's his nest egg.

204
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,635
QB, if we've to reduce the price,
we're dead in the water.

205
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,238
The longer we hold on to this place,
the longer we're paying for it.

206
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,548
Now we're stepping up to the plate,
you wanna wimp out?

207
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,824
Turn on your bet and go home?
Take the bare minimum?

208
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,524
No, that's not what we're here for.
We did this to make money.

209
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,526
295. We set the price there,

210
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:52,112
- and we'll get that price, all right?
- All right.

211
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,868
- Trust me.
- I'm in.

212
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,445
All right.

213
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,582
Thank y'all for coming in.
I know it's at last minute

214
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,583
but I just felt like we needed
to take this opportunity to sit down

215
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,959
and talk about
what's been going on with Jamarcus.

216
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,502
The boy can't sit still
to save his life.

217
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,358
What is wrong with you?

218
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,923
- I don't know, sir.
- Well, I just think that we need

219
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:15,427
to sit down and kinda make a plan
so that we can make sure this kind

220
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,838
- of accident don't happen again.
- Principal Taylor, I have got six kids.

221
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,195
I know how to handle Jamarcus.
He'll be punished.

222
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,338
Okay, well, I'm afraid the next time
something like this happens,

223
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,808
the next step
is gonna be suspension.

224
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:29,363
And you know, that's gonna
take away from the academics,

225
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,985
certainly, he's gonna missing
some football games, which I know...

226
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:34,041
- Games?
- What are you talking about?

227
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,611
Y'all don't know
Jamarcus is a Panther?

228
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:47,189
Hey, tomorrow, I was thinking,
maybe, we could...

229
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,986
just rent some canoes
or some kayaks

230
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:53,061
and just paddle on down to the falls.
How does that sound?

231
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:54,549
- Sounds good?
- Yeah.

232
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,177
- Hello, back there...
- What?

233
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:59,387
Buddy, would you
turn that off, please?

234
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,600
Tabby,
could you please stop texting

235
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,060
for just a minute, honey,
so we could talk or something...

236
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:08,331
I mean, why don't we...
have a little sing-along,

237
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,982
- like we used to?
- You wanna have a family sing along?

238
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,362
- Count me out.
- Tabitha, you used to love to sing.

239
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,655
I used to not have pubic hair either,
but things change.

240
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,947
- Pubic hair is not a swear.
- But it's gross.

241
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,452
It's TMI for the old dad, okay?

242
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,578
- Dad, I gotta go pee.
- Kevin says we...

243
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,180
Shut up! No one wants to hear
about your pubic hair.

244
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,899
Amen to that. Dad, seriously,
gas station, something...

245
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,025
If you really want me to,
I'll censure myself.

246
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:34,189
For a second there, I forgot
I was back in fascist Texas.

247
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,916
Oopsie daisy.

248
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,718
Dad, can I have some money?

249
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,089
Imagine that. Imagine that.

250
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,956
Here we go.
You're welcome...

251
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,297
Dad, are you okay?

252
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,422
Just great having them back, huh?

253
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,208
They'll come around.

254
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:02,098
You want anything from inside?

255
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,998
- Tums.
- Tums?

256
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,227
- Thanks, baby.
- You got it.

257
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,388
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

258
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:27,158
Jamarcus Hall
set Bree Hudson's hair on fire, today.

259
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,453
Mac told me, I know.

260
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,897
The thing is that when his parents
came in for the conference...

261
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,065
- Lighting hair on fire...
- it was discovered

262
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,568
that he never told them
that he's playing football.

263
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,428
He forged their signature
on the permission slip

264
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,872
and they're pulling
him off the team.

265
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,725
- Tami, what did you do?
- What do you mean, what did I do?

266
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:49,748
What did you do? What do you mean,
they're pulling off the team?

267
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:54,253
Hon, they didn't know he was playing
football. He forged their signature...

268
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,964
Honey, before you discipline one of
my players, I need to know about this.

269
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:01,841
Honey, why in the world am I gonna
let you know about the fact

270
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:05,237
that I've gotta deal with a disciplinary
situation with Jamarcus Hall?

271
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,432
Cause I'd like to be part
of that process, that's why.

272
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:10,673
- Why?
- Because you've got one my player,

273
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:13,406
he's got some problems.
I need to be involved in that,

274
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,316
because if I don't have my fullback
on Friday night, I'm screwed.

275
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,963
Therefore, I'm telling you,
I should have been part of that process.

276
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:24,048
Honey, I'm telling you, there's not
a thing you could've done about it,

277
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,742
whether you're a part of it or not.

278
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:29,181
Well, that's just great. That and a dime
will get me a cup of coffee, won't it?

279
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,331
Hey, Mac!

280
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,695
Is this... Is this the green house
on the right?

281
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,366
You wanna come in or something?

282
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:45,053
I just figured that we can hang out here
and talk for a little while.

283
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:50,391
We could talk about our band,
cause it's really cool.

284
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:54,062
- I think our band is pretty cool.
- Me too.

285
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:57,065
I'm liking the way everything sounds,
I think you're doing great.

286
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,841
I know it's hard to come into a...
you know, a new...

287
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:04,111
a new band and try to fit in,
but I think you're doing...

288
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,241
you know, a good job...

289
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,577
Thank you.

290
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,514
It's fun, I think
that's probably why.

291
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,746
Definitely.

292
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:32,854
Well...

293
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,229
Thank you for the ride.

294
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,291
Alright.

295
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,509
I'll see you later.

296
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,751
Explode Riggins, explode!

297
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:01,610
Hey Rigs, let's bring it a little more
towards me next time.

298
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:05,300
- All right, son.
- Let's go, there it is, right there!

299
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:11,390
Listen I gotta get
right back to you on this, okay?

300
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,516
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Coach!

301
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,991
- May I catch you on your film?
- No sir, I'm out here for Riggins.

302
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:20,648
I'm trying to put a little
highlight reel together for college.

303
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,568
- Get over here.
- J.D. throw the ball, let's go!

304
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,404
Get over! Coach, just one second sir.
Get over here!

305
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,741
J.D. come on! How many times
have we been over this?

306
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:32,545
I'll catch you in a few, here.

307
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,964
Coach! You think
I could have 10 minutes later...

308
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,689
- Anything you need, absolutely.
- Thank you.

309
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:42,421
It's a five step drop, you gotta
release the ball quicker, okay?

310
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,319
Hit the first window, OK?

311
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,552
- You know we worked on this.
- Set up the offense. Thank you.

312
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,596
- Sorry, I just... He was messing up...
- Get over the stake, I got work to do.

313
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,984
Make sure he's flawless
on Friday night, okay?

314
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,978
I don't care, just talk to him.
Get Crowley on the spot

315
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,882
if that's what we gotta do.

316
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:02,577
What's up coach?

317
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,988
It's all there.
Washed and everything.

318
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:12,367
- All right.
- My dad wasn't gonna let me play...

319
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:14,491
so I did what I had to do.

320
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:17,413
I understand, listen to me, but a lie
is a lie, there's nothing I can do.

321
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,095
My hands are tied.

322
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,273
Tell the guys I say "I'm sorry".

323
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,830
Great, I'm gonna die
if Danny Herlica sees me like this.

324
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,200
Tabby relax, this is just a scrape.

325
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,661
This is boring!

326
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,597
Come on Bud, here.
Let me see that, babe.

327
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,020
- Let's toss the football around a bit.
- It's stupid.

328
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,755
No football is not... I don't wanna hear
you talk like that, it's not stupid.

329
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,494
Kevin says it's the only sport
that's played here...

330
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:54,367
I don't care what Kevin says, OK?
Let's just not talk about Kevin.

331
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:58,379
Alright, we don't have to toss
a football if you don't want to.

332
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,425
But we do have to eat,
and I'm very hungry.

333
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,811
- You're hungry baby?
- I'm hungry.

334
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:08,506
I got a very special treat
for us tonight.

335
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:12,032
These are prime
Nebraska Angus steaks.

336
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:15,013
We gonna cook these babies up and
have a great dinner, how's that sound?

337
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,349
How many times do I have
to tell you I'm a vegan now?

338
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,516
Knock it off!

339
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,063
This is organic,
grass fed, Nebraska prime.

340
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:25,982
- That was slaughtered.
- Yeah, that was slaughtered and then...

341
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:29,753
What we gonna do is say a little prayer
for the cow right before we eat it.

342
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:33,023
- How does that sound?
- Kevin says "meat is murder".

343
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,667
Tabitha, I don't care
what Kevin says to tell you the truth.

344
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,790
Kevin can tell you
all his left wing propaganda...

345
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,272
It's not propaganda, it's a fact.

346
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,860
It's a fact, huh?

347
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,525
Listen to me, young lady.

348
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,686
Kevin... is not your father.
I'm your father...

349
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,353
A real father wouldn't have
cheated on mom!

350
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:08,067
- I wish you weren't my father.
- Tabby!

351
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,187
Dad...

352
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:12,152
How about the coyote
chained up right there!

353
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:15,185
You know what, young lady?
I think I feel the same way right know.

354
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,533
I've been doing nothing
but trying to...

355
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:19,827
All I've got from hate,
since y'all got here.

356
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:22,038
Hate from both of you.
And I'm tired of it!

357
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:26,167
- What's wrong with you guys?
- What?

358
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:29,462
What? You guys have been acting like
little brats ever since you got here.

359
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,126
There you guys go...

360
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,234
And your appetizers
are gonna be out very shortly.

361
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,482
- Can I talk to you for just a second?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:49,692
I just...

363
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,723
I just wanted to come here
and say thanks,

364
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,364
and to let you know that you were
absolutely right about everything.

365
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,242
I now see that we were never
supposed to be together.

366
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:03,247
And... I wanna let you know
that I met someone else

367
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,581
And she is perfect for me.

368
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:08,501
- We're completely right for each other.
- You have a girlfriend?

369
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,157
Landry, I'm...

370
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:15,884
I'm really happy for you.

371
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,638
I am too, and I am happy for you.

372
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,255
And...

373
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,100
maybe now we could try
and be friends and...

374
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,007
if you...

375
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:29,665
I would love that.

376
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:35,367
Well... I guess I'll just
see you around then.

377
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:02,345
- Dad, get in the car.
- Just leave me alone, Lyla.

378
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,265
Get in the car!
Let's talk about it.

379
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
Please...

380
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,910
That kinda sucked, huh?

381
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,415
That was terrible.

382
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:28,548
I acted terribly.

383
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,383
They deserved it.

384
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:36,756
They hate me.

385
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:38,724
They don't hate you.

386
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,968
All a man has is his children,

387
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:42,773
and they hate me.

388
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,661
Dad, they don't hate you,
they're being brats.

389
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:49,172
They don't know what they're saying,
they don't mean it.

390
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:50,756
Yes, they do.

391
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:53,981
And I deserve it.

392
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,493
I've lost 'em.

393
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:08,655
You still got me.

394
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,297
That means a lot, Lyla.

395
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:40,324
Just let me do the talking.
I know what I'm doing here.

396
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,176
Honey, I've talked to these people,
I have a relationship with them.

397
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,340
I understand,
would you let me do the talking?

398
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,743
Yes I can, indeed.

399
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,589
No running in the house!

400
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,456
Look, it's not that we don't
appreciate you coming by,

401
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,902
but you gonna have to understand.
We're just not football people.

402
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:58,356
What is it? Baseball, basketball?
Don't tell me your a...

403
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,787
Don't tell me
you're a soccer family...

404
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,468
Mr Taylor, I'm an engineer
at the power plant.

405
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,014
My company has moved us
5 times in the last 10 years.

406
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:10,349
My point being
that we're just passing through.

407
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,573
I mean I'm not one
of your Dillon football fanatics.

408
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,035
Gimme a chance to explain
what we do with these young men...

409
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:20,234
You can explain all you want, football
doesn't mean anything to our family.

410
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,545
I don't want Jamarcus
wasting his time and energy

411
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,822
on something that's not going
to get him anywhere.

412
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,909
He needs to be focused
on his future.

413
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,674
Jamarcus is a self centered kid,

414
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,623
who thinks that the whole world
revolves around him.

415
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:37,626
And, he's being some old high school
football star does nothing

416
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:39,377
but confirm that misconception.

417
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:42,339
Well, Mr. Hall, I hope you understand,
I couldn't agree with you more.

418
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:47,304
But I'll tell you what, I don't allow
<i>prima donnas</i> on my football team.

419
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:50,960
Because I believe that football
is about community spirit, sir

420
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,704
and I believe that it gives young men
a chance to be part of something...

421
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:56,229
All this time I thought
it was just a dumb game

422
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:59,085
that this whole whacked-out town
is obsessed with.

423
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,742
No, sir. I don't think I'd be devoting
my life to just some dumb game.

424
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,821
Well, if I can interrupt you
just for one second.

425
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:06,907
- Sorry.
- Go ahead!

426
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:10,118
I really do understand,
I have to say it took me long time

427
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,996
to understand this fuss about football.
He's very convincing about it,

428
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:16,500
but I didn't get it either.
But what I do wanna express to you all,

429
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:20,310
is I have seen football
do wonderful things for kids.

430
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,921
And that is because of my husband.

431
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,883
He has a great ability
to take a kid,

432
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:29,805
get him out on the football field
and inspire them and empower them.

433
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:33,106
And then, that transfers over
into their lives, at school,

434
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,433
and in every way.

435
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,435
I think he could do that
for Jamarcus.

436
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:40,232
But Mrs Taylor, Jamarcus lied to us
and he's been lying to us all year.

437
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:43,735
I understand and I was really
concerned about that, believe me.

438
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:48,012
Coach Taylor will make him
regret the day that he ever did that.

439
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:50,090
Come to a game Friday night,

440
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:53,953
just one time, just to see him
out there in his element,

441
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:56,427
shining and for him to know,

442
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,934
that you're there
supporting him in that.

443
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:01,357
I feel like it might
make a difference.

444
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,640
We'll think it over.

445
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:06,156
I think that went well.

446
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:08,901
You're opening the door for me!

447
00:25:09,523 --> 00:25:10,594
Thank you!

448
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,199
So sweet...
Thank you.

449
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:16,567
I think it's cute.

450
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,636
Funny. I don't really know
who the guy is but...

451
00:25:19,756 --> 00:25:22,306
- Hey, Devin! How are you doing?
- Hello.

452
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:25,593
Do you think maybe that you
wanna hang out after band practice

453
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,032
I just... I'll talk to you later.

454
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,827
- She don't have to... It's OK.
- I know, It's OK.

455
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,077
I was thinking that maybe
after band practice,

456
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,912
we could go grab
a bite to eat at the Knockhole,

457
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,123
maybe have some cobbler,

458
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,109
- maybe some barbecue, maybe...
- Landry?

459
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:44,856
- What?
- I'm a lesbian.

460
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:48,258
- No you're not!
- I'm serious,

461
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,605
I'm gay.

462
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,636
I like girls,

463
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:53,245
not boys.

464
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:56,615
I feel like I need to tell you,

465
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,875
because you have
the wrong idea about us.

466
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:01,254
That's an important information...

467
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:05,080
that I'm really
glad to know because...

468
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:08,695
I'd have sworn the other day that you
kissed me back whenever I kissed you.

469
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:12,741
I didn't want to be rude, Landry,
and I thought I had to make sure...

470
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,586
I'd go and give it a try and...

471
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:17,537
I know now that I really am.

472
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:21,040
So... I really should
thank you, I guess.

473
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,119
Well... I'm gonna have to...

474
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,774
to go and let's this
soak in or something.

475
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,138
Cause I...

476
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:32,551
I don't know how to react to this,
right now.

477
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:36,222
This place would be great
for a young couple, you know?

478
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:38,015
It's fully loaded out here,

479
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,017
- have you been upstairs yet?
- Not yet.

480
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,105
You haven't seen
the master bedroom?

481
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,814
- No, what's in there?
- You gotta check out the master bath.

482
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:48,777
I mean, that thing is huge. Seriously,
you could fit 2 in that bathtub,

483
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,690
with room for a third.

484
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:52,649
You know what I mean.

485
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:53,819
Maybe later.

486
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:56,631
Hi, folks.
Good afternoon.

487
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,527
My name's Jason Street.
Take a look at this, a look around.

488
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,664
If you've any questions,
come back and find me

489
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:04,090
or Timothy here will be happy
to answer it for you.

490
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,546
I get what you're saying, but there is a
little bit of wiggle room on the price.

491
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,661
Folks, how you doing? Jason Street.
What are we talking about over here?

492
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,034
Jason, glad you came over.

493
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:15,835
We're just talking about a little bit
of wiggle room on the price.

494
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,931
That's a little bit premature.
I think 295 is pretty much...

495
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:23,228
With the way the market is, it's best
to live in reality, don't you think?

496
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,913
- We'll just take a look around.
- Okay, you do that.

497
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:28,399
Take your time, I'll be right here.
Alright.

498
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:33,029
- What the hell is your problem?
- We gotta lower this price right now.

499
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,499
House hasn't been
on market for 6 hours yet.

500
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:38,368
We haven't even had a nibble yet.
I'm talking to everybody in there

501
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,467
- nobody's even interested.
- Quit being a baby, grow some balls.

502
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,873
Since I lost my legs,
I'm more careful about my balls.

503
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:45,959
Let's take a vote
on reducing the price.

504
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,210
I'm right with you.

505
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:49,796
No, 295!
That's it!

506
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,840
2-9-5! Can we be professional
at our own damn open house?

507
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:56,467
What the hell? We never agreed on 295,
and who made you the boss anyway?

508
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,471
I'm the boss because nobody else
wanna step up. That's why I'm the boss.

509
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:02,140
Listen, Maverick. We can't afford
to be on hook for this mortgage.

510
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,153
It ain't just about you
and your kid.

511
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:06,980
- Don't bring Noah into this.
- No, don't you bring Noah into this!

512
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,274
Every time a decision's to be made,
you wave that baby around like a gun!

513
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:13,144
- Well, screw you, Herc!
- Guys...

514
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:15,685
- Screw you back, QB!
- No, screw you Herc.

515
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,198
Screw you back QB!

516
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,659
You wanna bring my family into this?

517
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:23,713
Stop it!

518
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,416
... a great time actually
to move this upstairs.

519
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,287
- Alright! Alright!
- Stop it!

520
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,596
Fine!

521
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,321
Fine! Yes I need the money for my family
but everybody here needs the money!

522
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:39,790
Billy's trying to get married!
Tim is trying to go to school!

523
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:42,014
Fine, I need the money
for my family!

524
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:45,301
Erin's up in New England
right now, with my kid.

525
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,927
Her parents are putting him
in daycare which I can't afford!

526
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:51,107
How am I suppose to compete
with that, Herc? I can't!

527
00:28:51,623 --> 00:28:53,651
We keep the price
where it is man, OK?

528
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,863
We're lucky if we get $60,000
to split between the 4 of us.

529
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,821
I need that money, alright?

530
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,438
Please just...

531
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,445
Please just trust me!

532
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,889
Alright, QB.

533
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Alright.

534
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,427
We'll do it your way.

535
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:24,782
Thank you.

536
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,232
I just wanted to make sure,
you know...

537
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,526
in case you need to do meetings
for physics club,

538
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,613
that the lab is not available right now,
because of the fire.

539
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:42,157
I'm not in physics club anymore.

540
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,491
- Really?
- It was only me and Charles,

541
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:48,467
so we decided that
we had a lot on our plates anyways...

542
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,750
So, you don't have
to worry about us.

543
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,045
- Good to know, alright.
- Mrs. Taylor,

544
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:55,883
can I ask you...

545
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,548
Like, can I talk to you
for a second?

546
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:05,912
I just start to feel like
I have some sort of...

547
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:08,688
talent that repels...

548
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:11,646
females... away,

549
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,985
and sends them running.

550
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:17,361
I was in love with Tyra
for a long time,

551
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,820
I chased her away,
and then, there was another girl,

552
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:22,574
and I really chased her away.

553
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,825
That was a lot quicker.

554
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:26,814
Here's the thing,

555
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:30,830
and I know it's probably not very easy
to see this here, in Dillon,

556
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:34,710
but you are
at the beginning of your life.

557
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:38,132
A lot of these football heroes
around here,

558
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,446
they're not gonna get
much further than this.

559
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,677
But you are gonna go
to some great college,

560
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:47,160
you're gonna have a career
that you'll love.

561
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,445
And, I'm telling you right now,
women are gonna flock to you.

562
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:57,723
I know it's hard to believe,
but that's the way it's gonna work.

563
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:01,319
You are a good person,
and this is just the beginning.

564
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,573
I'm right 100% of the time,
you can ask my husband.

565
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:15,876
You got a little crowd out there!

566
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,186
What's up, baby?

567
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:39,283
I thought you might be too big time now
that you're pro to say hello to your QB.

568
00:31:39,403 --> 00:31:43,278
It's been a long time. You know, when
I heard, I wanted to come to see you,

569
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:45,780
- but we had Florida swamp...
- Don't worry about it.

570
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,201
Watching you hand the Gators their asses
is the best thing that happened to me.

571
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:50,785
Really?
What's been up to, man?

572
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:53,965
Not much, I coached for a little bit.
Coached the team, we won a ring.

573
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:57,604
You know? And I'm selling cars,
and I'm flipping a house right now.

574
00:31:57,724 --> 00:31:59,795
You know, and I have a son, now.

575
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,714
Excuse me, Jason Street.
This is my man,

576
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:04,092
right here, my soon-to-be agent,
Grant Harbert.

577
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,051
All we gotta do is sign.
Drop the soon-to-be.

578
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,791
Jason was the QB
at my last two years in Dillon.

579
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:11,348
To this day,
the best quarterback I've ever seen.

580
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:14,361
He had the canon and the best
sport mind than anybody I know.

581
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,478
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- How you doing, man.

582
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,980
I've been QB myself,
down there at Westerby.

583
00:32:19,143 --> 00:32:20,566
Oh, Westerby!

584
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,776
I left Division II bowl
an hour after that.

585
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:26,571
- You graduated and became an agent?
- I didn't have the arm to go pro...

586
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:28,823
- Really?
- Absolutely, man.

587
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:31,785
You talk football all day, friend of
some the greatest players in the world.

588
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:35,585
- And the money is pretty great.
- I'll see you, Jason, I got to go, man.

589
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:39,000
- Good to see you. Keep in touch, okay?
- Alright. Take it easy, alright?

590
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,711
Price of glory...
Hey Jason, nice to meet you.

591
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:44,464
If you're in the Big Apple,
ring me up.

592
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,555
Okay, nice to meet you, Mr. Harbert.

593
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:57,228
Blue 80, set, hut!

594
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:01,566
<i>J.D. McCoy driving back.</i>

595
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,386
<i>He's got a man open deep,
he lets it fly!</i>

596
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:08,072
<i>It is too long!</i>

597
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:11,325
What are you doing, J.D.?
Keep the elbow in, boy!

598
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:17,914
I see him over there.

599
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,628
<i>It's a hand off to Jamarcus Hall.</i>

600
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:25,715
<i>He finds an opening...
Oh, nice stiff here!</i>

601
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:28,685
<i>And the Panthers get
a much needed first down.</i>

602
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,471
There he is!
Here's the boy!

603
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,767
<i>And that's another incompletion</i>

604
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,013
- <i>for J.D. McCoy.</i>
- Keep the elbow down, boy!

605
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:44,274
- He only missed it by that much.
- I know, but he's got to keep it down!

606
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,208
We've been working on it
all week long.

607
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:47,478
Now, it's OK.

608
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,529
Either receivers
ran the wrong route.

609
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,400
<i>Panthers passing attack
finding it a tough go</i>

610
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,284
<i>against this Fordwood
secondary tonight.</i>

611
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:03,252
<i>Oh, up the middle for a nice gain!</i>

612
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:07,193
<i>Jamarcus Hall has been the lone
bright spot in this Panther offense.</i>

613
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:30,236
Where are you going?
Get over here!

614
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,490
Get over here, right now!

615
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,327
What the hell are you doing out there?
Where is your timing?

616
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,467
- We worked on this all week.
- I'm sorry.

617
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,865
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
You get your head in this game...

618
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:43,590
Joe, I need my quarterback.

619
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,502
- I'm almost done.
- J.D., let's come on in.

620
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,886
- Let's go in the locker room.
- What you doing?

621
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,841
What am I doing? I'm talking to my son,
is that a problem?

622
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:54,010
You yelling at him
is not gonna help in any way.

623
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:57,430
- That's a family matter, Coach.
- I'm not getting in your family matters

624
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:00,600
but I'll ask you to give the kid some
breathing room, so I can work with him.

625
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,853
Let's go, gentlemen, let's go!

626
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:08,136
Listen to me. My old man used
to love to come watch the games.

627
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:09,881
He had great expectations for me,

628
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:13,496
expectations that I did not live up to,
and that was not easy on him.

629
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:16,166
My dad... He just wants me
to do my best.

630
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,453
- He wants me to succeed, that's all.
- Coach, time to get back out there.

631
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,389
Let's go.

632
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:34,586
Listen up, gentlemen.

633
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,774
We're gonna go no huddle.

634
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,037
We've been working on this
all damn year.

635
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:41,272
Let's go out there
play some smart football,

636
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:43,935
and let's not make any stupid mistakes,
what do you say?

637
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,271
- Let's go, come on!
- Let's go to work!

638
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:47,981
You're gonna call the place.

639
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:51,192
Don't look at the stands to your daddy,
I want you looking at sidelines to me.

640
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:54,363
You understand that? I'll pull
your ass off the field if you do so.

641
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:56,698
I've got all the confidence
in the world in you.

642
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,880
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

643
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:04,165
Let's go!

644
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,965
<i>McCoy fires a laser to Law.
First down, Panthers.</i>

645
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,140
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

646
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,685
<i>Fear not, Dillon faithful.</i>

647
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:28,541
<i>This second half
has seen the resurrection</i>

648
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,942
<i>of that gunning arm of J.D. McCoy.</i>

649
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:35,278
<i>McCoy reaches to Riggins,</i>

650
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,740
<i>Riggins rumbles up the middle,</i>

651
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,844
<i>We're inside the Fordwood 25!</i>

652
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:45,122
<i>This Panther offense is firing
on all cylinders now.</i>

653
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,110
There we go, baby.

654
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,105
<i>A huge 50 yard T.D. pass,</i>

655
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,234
<i>and just like that,
Dillon's prodigal son has put</i>

656
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:15,987
<i>the final nail
in the Fordwood coffin.</i>

657
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:17,924
<i>Hello, playoffs!</i>

658
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:19,597
Well done.

659
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:26,913
You did do your thing out there!

660
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:28,169
There he is.

661
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:31,334
All the way to State, baby.
You all know how we do!

662
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,510
Hey, man, I'm...
I'm gonna catch y'all later, alright?

663
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:50,457
You looked good out there.

664
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:00,874
So, we got to get home now
and get you all to bed,

665
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:04,546
so you can get some good shut-eye cause
you get to fly early in the morning.

666
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,396
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah.

667
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:09,287
Do you think we could stop
and get some sundaes on the way home?

668
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:11,416
I don't know about that,
that's a dairy.

669
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:14,920
Come on, please.

670
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:18,466
Okay, baby. Sundaes,
we'll have some sundaes, okay...

671
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,931
Let me talk to Charlie
and we go.

672
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,054
Guys, thank you.

673
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,702
I had a lot of fun.

674
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,706
Great game!

675
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:31,562
- Great job.
- Where's dad?

676
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,004
You know, he had
some booster club meeting, I think.

677
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:38,444
No. Why isn't he here? He's always
riding home from the game with us.

678
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:40,987
He's not mad at me, is he?

679
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:44,555
Look. Look at me,
will you look at me?

680
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,785
He should be mad at himself.

681
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,080
I've known him for ever.
He just needs a little time on his own.

682
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,103
He'll be fine.

683
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,772
You wanna go eat some junk food?

684
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,547
Why not? Let's do it.

685
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,676
- Where?
- Where you wanna go.

686
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:04,775
5,000 under.
20% down.

687
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:08,890
- Good night.
- See you later.

688
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:10,266
Sure, it sounds great.

689
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,513
Alright. Yes, sir.
Goodbye.

690
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:13,853
Who was that?

691
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,856
- Mark Clant, first properties.
- Don't know Mark Clant, who's he?

692
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:19,943
Yeah, you do. He's the guy that
just got us a first offer on the house.

693
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,375
- You're kidding me, you serious?
- I'm dead serious!

694
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,364
No way!

695
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,579
- Were you messing with it?
- No, I messed up with your guitar.

696
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,680
You asked me
that 2 minutes ago.

697
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,180
- How are you?
- Good.

698
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:43,342
I'm gonna go get water,
I'll be right back.

699
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:48,151
Good game, last night.

700
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,134
That's funny.

701
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:58,408
I don't want things
to be weird between us

702
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:01,318
- because of this...
- Totally not gonna be weird.

703
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:03,748
I'm sorry about everything.

704
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,573
It was my fault,

705
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:08,329
you didn't do anything wrong,
you've just been honest with me.

706
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,285
And, trust me, I appreciate that.

707
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,524
And I've just kind of been...

708
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,380
There's been a lot of stuff
on my plate.

709
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,878
Oh, the stuff
that you write songs about?

710
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,008
Some of that, yeah.

711
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:26,101
But I just want to make sure
that you're okay with...

712
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:28,929
the secret, I guess.

713
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:33,683
I'm absolutely fine with it,
I think that it's great,

714
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,843
and I think that
we should play some music.

715
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,404
But you don't have anything
to worry about.

716
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,491
I don't want to play the song
that we planned earlier.

717
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,405
Cause I'm gonna slit my wrists
if we play that anymore.

718
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:12,399
<i>I know a girl who</i>

719
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,892
<i>Who thinks of toast</i>

720
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,149
<i>She'll make you breakfast</i>

721
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,979
<i>She'll make you toast</i>

722
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,969
<i>But she don't use butter</i>

723
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:25,813
<i>She don't use cheese</i>

724
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:28,248
<i>She don't use jelly</i>

725
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,824
<i>Or any of these
She uses</i>

726
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:33,619
<i>Vaseline</i>

727
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:52,761
I mean, it burns like fire, Billy.

728
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,144
Sorry, I'm late.

729
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,696
Finally!

730
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,185
We got something
we wanna show you guys.

731
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,728
- Can we watch it now?
- Hit the lights and just turn it on.

732
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:05,061
- Let's go, let's go, Billy.
- Shut up!

733
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:06,769
- How are you?
- I'm great.

734
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:09,488
- What are we watching, sorry?
- Tim Riggins goes to college.

735
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:13,928
- Here we go.
- Alright, what...

736
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:17,246
- That's good.
- Good job.

737
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:19,539
Alright.
So, you see we spotlight you.

738
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,621
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
six guys to bring him down.

739
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:28,798
Typical Tim Riggins style.

740
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,520
- He gets the corner, then power!
- Speed, speed, speed!

741
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,902
This guy look like LaRon Landry
getting run over by Brandon Jacobs.

742
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:38,274
I remember that.

743
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:41,512
It's my favorite one. Talking
about delivering hits, watch this one.

744
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,773
Look how quick he gets up!

745
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,644
We got 20 years
of footage to go through.

746
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,277
<i>What single characteristic
do you think defines Tim Riggins</i>

747
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:51,958
- <i>as a football player?</i>
- Coach...

748
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,671
<i>Toughness.</i>

749
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:58,021
<i>I've never seen a kid</i>

750
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:01,895
<i>with more fortitude
than Tim Riggins.</i>

751
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,499
<i>No fear.</i>

752
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:07,336
<i>What's your...
What's your favorite memory</i>

753
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,790
<i>of your brother playing football?</i>

754
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:16,205
<i>Watching him
get that ring back in '06.</i>

755
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,836
<i>After all we been through together,</i>

756
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:21,688
<i>see him win State, that was...</i>

757
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,597
<i>that was probably
the happiest day in my life.</i>

758
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,355
<i>I'm just really proud of him.</i>

759
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:31,777
- Nice.
- Jason, that was really nice.

760
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:35,949
Tim, I think you might
actually go to college.

761
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,198
Street, thank you.

762
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,495
For everything, for the house...

763
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,373
- For everything.
- Thank you, Six.

764
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:45,917
Welcome.

765
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:48,504
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

766
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:50,838
For Tim going to school.

767
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:04,119
What are you doing out here?

768
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:06,854
I was just thinking.

769
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,574
Looking at the Dillon sky.

770
00:44:21,052 --> 00:44:23,466
You think I could make it
somewhere else?

771
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,210
Do you think I could...

772
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,674
I don't know,
be a good sports agent, or...

773
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:32,707
something?

774
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:36,926
What?

775
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,402
Lyla, you're okay?

776
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,433
You're leaving.

777
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:46,395
No, I don't say that.

778
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:49,404
You don't have to.

779
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:59,533
I think you'd make
a great sports agent.

780
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,076
Really?

781
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,856
Yeah, you know...

782
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:07,164
You know sports,
you know athletes.

783
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:08,996
You're smart,

784
00:45:09,554 --> 00:45:12,028
you're a great negotiator...

785
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:18,189
I think you'd be
a great sports agent.

786
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:20,429
I really do.

787
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:28,020
Thank you.

788
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:29,907
You're going.

789
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:33,024
I think I have to.

790
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:36,485
I think, once the money clears,
I'm gonna go to New York

791
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:39,419
- and get a new job and...
- That's a big deal.

792
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:41,524
start a new life.

793
00:45:45,698 --> 00:45:47,248
I think that's great.
