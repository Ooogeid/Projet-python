1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,664
We have lost four teachers
to budget cuts this year.

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,188
We need a Jumbo Tron?

3
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:06,668
No, Tami, we don't need one,
but we want one.

4
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:08,086
I told Buddy Garrity

5
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:11,339
I'm gonna reallocate
the Jumbo Tron funds to academics.

6
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:14,676
Miss Colette,
states schools are a pipe-dream.

7
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:16,943
I mean,
do you really want it like...

8
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,014
- the whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing?
- Yes.

9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,143
I lost my scholarship,
and no school wants me.

10
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:26,104
I will help you getting into college
and playing football again.

11
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,565
I won't stop until you get there.

12
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,178
Oh, my God.

13
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,904
- Just take it off.
- I'm trying.

14
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:36,522
Seriously, it's a new butt warmer,

15
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,158
- it's already...
- Get it off!

16
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:43,538
What the hell is this? I'm digging through
the couch looking for change and find this.

17
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:45,254
Were you gonna tell me about it?

18
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:48,136
- Letter of interest from Oklahoma, man.
- What?

19
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,336
Wait a minute, let me see that.

20
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,840
Tim, this is great. You didn't tell me
you were getting interest from colleges.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,134
But you're gonna
respond to this, right?

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,971
- This is about the rest of you life.
- Exactly, the rest of your life.

23
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:03,088
I'm gonna go get my laptop
and write a response.

24
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,728
You and me, man,
we're going places.

25
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,776
Listen, I want the scoreboard too
and I don't believe we'll get it.

26
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:15,454
I just think that this reallocation
of these funds

27
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:18,239
is actually gonna be a win
for everybody involved.

28
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:21,034
But still, the people of Dillon,
they love their football.

29
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,399
Well, you know,
I know that, I mean...

30
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,495
That's been my life here
for so many years.

31
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,585
And I see how great that program is...
Let's spread that around.

32
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,587
Get the academics
on the same par.

33
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:34,058
Tell the truth, though,

34
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,345
there must have been a little tension
between you and your husband over this?

35
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,010
You know, I feel like we both

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,476
approached our marriage
and our career with a real...

37
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,100
Real foundation of respects, so...

38
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,304
160/100.

39
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:52,422
Lorraine...

40
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,114
We're in the danger zone.

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,138
Are you taking your medication?

42
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,738
I don't like those pills.

43
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,583
- But I like that tie.
- Well, thank you very much.

44
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:04,403
Matthew, did we turn off
the stove, honey?

45
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,003
Yeah, the stove is off.
Wait Grandma, you need...

46
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,408
- Why aren't you taking your pills?
- They dry out my skin.

47
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:13,477
And you know as well as anyobdy,
I have always looked young for my age.

48
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:16,214
Lorraine, can I just speak the man
outside just for a sec?

49
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,717
Matthew,
I'm not even gonna refill these.

50
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,429
This is a big problem, Matt.

51
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,556
Look, how about
you just give me the pills...

52
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:33,273
and then I'll make sure she takes it.
I can put it in her food or something.

53
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,316
I can't legally do that.

54
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,240
Okay, so we're supposed to just...

55
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,029
wait for her to have a stroke?

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,559
Listen, we knew this day would come.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,076
It comes for every patient
with dementia.

58
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,037
She's no longer able to handle
her own affairs.

59
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,397
I'm sorry, Matt.

60
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,013
What are you doing?

61
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:08,039
Waiting for the new edition of
the paper. It's got  my article on it.

62
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,973
You're not supposed
to read your own press.

63
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:13,646
I know. I'll make seconds to have it.
You get articles all the times.

64
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:16,152
Here it is, I think.

65
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,634
I'll get more wine.

66
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,759
3x02: TAMI KNOWS BEST

67
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,806
Subtitles: Team Panthers

68
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,974
With the participation of:

69
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:55,063
benj!, charliea, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop

70
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:31,724
Come on, make the cut.

71
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:35,086
Hey, come here.

72
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,663
Every time you go left, you loose
half the speed. What's that all about?

73
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,443
- It's nothing.
- Is it your leg? You're in pain?

74
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,310
- You tell me if you're in pain.
- I'm not in pain, Coach.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,892
The knee is fine,
I'm just getting used to it.

76
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,064
Anyway...

77
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,773
I gotta get to work.
So do you, by the way.

78
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,714
Hey, Coach.

79
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:57,667
You don't mind me asking.
What's the big plan, anyway?

80
00:04:57,837 --> 00:05:00,086
Don't worry about it.
You keep working on your speed,

81
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:02,436
I'll work on the try-outs.
I got a lot of calls out there...

82
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,059
Gonna be a lot of calls coming in soon,
we're gonna have to choose.

83
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:06,621
So just get yourself ready.

84
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,380
I'll take care of that.
You take care of the rest.

85
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:14,467
Smash, he was on the hot list last year.
Your call, buddy, time's on.

86
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,763
Yeah, no, his knee is fine, that's what
I'm saying, you gotta see this kid,

87
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,440
he's got Texas Tech
written all over him.

88
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,658
Well, no, I understand that the timing
is not exactly perfect right now.

89
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,381
All right.

90
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,835
All right, well,
thanks for returning the call.

91
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:33,629
No luck with Smash?

92
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:37,546
Well, it's not exactly the...

93
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,834
right time for setting up
a walk on that, is it?

94
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,356
- Morning, everybody.
- Principal Taylor?

95
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,359
- Yes, Clant.
- Here you go.

96
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,098
- Phones are ringing off the hook.
- Really, what about?

97
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:58,269
Jumbo Tron?

98
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:02,002
Well, tell 'em I said you're welcome.
Thank you.

99
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,944
- Mayor Rodell.
- Good morning, Tami.

100
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,820
- Hi. How are you?
- Morning.

101
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,820
- This is a great picture.
- Thank you so much.

102
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:14,944
So, to what do I owe this great...

103
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,011
unexpected surprise?

104
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,106
Honey, you know why we're here for.

105
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,626
It's about
that scoreboard situation.

106
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,767
You're new.

107
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,481
You're excited.

108
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,382
I appreciate that. I really do.

109
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,649
But what has happened to you,
is that you've made a mistake.

110
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:32,595
And that's okay. That's okay.

111
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,315
Lord knows I've been there myself
in front of the whole town.

112
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:37,420
But the thing to do now

113
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,395
is to admit you made that mistake
and fix it.

114
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, the thing is...

115
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,608
I haven't made a mistake,
Mayor Rodell.

116
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,943
Really?

117
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,734
Is that what you think?

118
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:52,115
Then you're not looking
at the big picture.

119
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,826
Because those boosters raised
that money in good faith

120
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:57,120
that it was gonna be used
for a scoreboard.

121
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,747
And it is not up to you
to make some unilateral decision

122
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,583
to spend it any other way.
I don't give a damn what it's for!

123
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,420
Well, actually, technically,
it is up to me

124
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,798
according to the bylaws,
but what I find interesting is given

125
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:12,596
the funding problems in this school,
given the test scores of this school,

126
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,746
I am surprised that you
and all those boosters

127
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,598
have not jumped right on this bandwagon,
that's what surprises me.

128
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:21,878
I am really sorry to hear
that you feel that way, Tami.

129
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,197
I really am.

130
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,439
I just...

131
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,400
I hope it doesn't turn ugly.

132
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,683
For your sake, I mean.

133
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:34,490
Damn, we are splurging tonight, baby.

134
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,677
I got New York strips.

135
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,663
Pan fried and buttered,
the way that got it tender.

136
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:44,621
It's about $40 worth
of prime beef here, baby.

137
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,796
And I wanted to talk to you
about Saturday.

138
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:50,673
Joe McCoy wants us to...

139
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:52,967
go out to eat.
Is that okay?

140
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,332
Yeah, sure.

141
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:56,304
I'll see if Tim can come.

142
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,463
You know, Lyla, I don't know if...

143
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,144
Tim Riggins is really
the right one for you.

144
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:06,606
Well, he's a good guy.
He's going to college.

145
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,570
Tim Riggins going to college

146
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,612
is like me teaching yoga classes.
That's not gonna happen.

147
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:16,115
Maybe he just needs someone to believe
in him. You ever think about that?

148
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,660
There's been plenty of young girls
in Dillon who have believed in him.

149
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:23,373
Do you understand that a dad
would not want his daugther

150
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,391
to be with a guy
who drinks all the time

151
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,377
and has been with half the girls
in the state of Texas?

152
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,880
He comes with wild trash.
He's gonna bring you down.

153
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,980
Are you using protection?

154
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,469
Excuse me?

155
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,181
The last thing we need
is for you to get pregnant and for us

156
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,808
to have to raise
Tim Riggins' kid. Lyla!

157
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:54,134
That craziness in my office today
with Buddy and the mayor.

158
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:58,836
It was unbelievable. They were
threatening me. It was like the mafia.

159
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,536
And I thought the mayor
would be on my side, I mean...

160
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,664
And there's Buddy
just sitting there, like...

161
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,875
none of this is his fault,
he doesn't know what's going on.

162
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,528
These people are acting like
I've done the worst thing in the world.

163
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,758
Like it's terrible for everybody.
What is everybody thinking?

164
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,885
What do you think I should do?

165
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,375
I'll get her.

166
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,116
- Honey.
- I got it, go to bed.

167
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,231
Hey, I'm Tyra Colette,
vote for me.

168
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:32,107
Vote for Tyra.

169
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,985
Okay, so hand me
about half these flyers

170
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:38,215
and I'm gonna hang some out in the quad.
You're gonna be wonderful.

171
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,905
That's not that funny.

172
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,325
- Vote for Tyra!
- It's not that funny...

173
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,788
There are not one person
who saw who did this?

174
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,040
- Nobody saw who did this?
- What's going on?

175
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,335
Oh, nothing,
it's just a little situation here.

176
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,629
I'm gonna handle it.
Don't worry about it.

177
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:56,132
- It's fine, I'll handle it.
- Landry!

178
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,521
Okay, all right.
Just go to class.

179
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,400
Tyra, I'm sorry this happened,
but I'm not sure what you want me to do.

180
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,987
I got into this race late. I need to get
my face out there. I can't do it like that.

181
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,656
I do know this.

182
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,771
Jenny Warwick started working
on her campaign 3 weeks ago,

183
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,937
not the night before deadline.

184
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,130
You can't get into the race late,
and half fast,

185
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,749
and expect people to respect you.

186
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,589
Either she's completely in charge
of herself or she's non-<i>compos mentis</i>.

187
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,344
- I don't know what that means.
- A legal term for when you lose it.

188
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,490
That's why I'm suggesting
you become her guardian.

189
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,035
No, I don't want
to become her guardian.

190
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:47,767
She's my guardian, okay?
I'm 17.

191
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,830
You could become
an emancipated minor,

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,016
then you could assume legal guardianship
over your grandmother's affairs.

193
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,444
That way, you'd have complete control
over her financial matters...

194
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:01,864
I don't wanna be
in control of all that, okay?

195
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:04,075
I'm trying
to go to college next year.

196
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,453
What about your dad?

197
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,033
He's in Iraq, right?

198
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:10,372
Is he coming home anytime soon?

199
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:14,048
I don't know...
I don't think so.

200
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,052
Well, I suppose
we could put her in a home.

201
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:18,918
Let State take care of her.

202
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:20,967
I'm not doing that.

203
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,512
Listen, hey...
I'm just giving you your options.

204
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:27,556
You know, you came in here and...
it seemed pretty urgent.

205
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,103
Here is the paperwork to become...

206
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:34,287
an emancipated minor.

207
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,211
If you decide to do it,

208
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,568
you can track down your dad
and have him sign.

209
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,974
Come on, let's go!

210
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh, come on, man!
You got a big game tomorrow!

211
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,668
Just whacked you up.

212
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,796
Hey, guys! I got a little kid home
who'd like to see me today!

213
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,455
That's it!

214
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:06,429
Damn, Rig, what the hell, man?

215
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:08,264
What did you hit me for?

216
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:10,558
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

217
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,728
I pushed you Williams,
you gotta relax, man!

218
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,340
You know what?
Just forget it!

219
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,034
I don't even know
what we're doing out here, anyway!

220
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,654
What do you do?
Where are you going?

221
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,476
All right, grandma. I really...
Look, we're gonna just...

222
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:35,541
We gonna try taking these pills, okay?
I know you don't want to, but...

223
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,210
I can't take that. It makes my face
look like mummies or so.

224
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,075
Well, you know what a stroke
will make your face look like?

225
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:44,633
I'm not gonna have a stroke. I don't
even know anybody who's had a stroke.

226
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,553
Grandma,
if you don't take these pills...

227
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,014
You leave me alone about the pills.

228
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,942
I'll be right back.

229
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:10,701
Sorry...

230
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,204
You...

231
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:20,693
You work here now?

232
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:24,548
Yeah, I work at Applebee's...

233
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,301
God, you got a name tag
and everything, uh?

234
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,680
Yeah, I'm very official.
I'm just saving it for a car.

235
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,019
So... why are you kicking
the crap out of the boxes?

236
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:41,232
It's my grandma. She refuses
to take her blood pressure medication.

237
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,431
Why isn't she taking it?

238
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,278
Because she thinks
that if she takes it, it's going to

239
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,521
dry her skin out
and make her look like a mummy.

240
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,944
And the doctor can't legally
give me her medication to...

241
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,370
you know, to give to her
because I'm not her legal guardian.

242
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,793
And I can't be her legal guardian
unless I become an emancipated minor,

243
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,013
and in order to become an emancipated
minor, I'd have to have my dad sign...

244
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:05,022
some piece of paper but unfortunately,
my dad's in Iraq right now,

245
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,676
he's not sitting around by a fax,
so I can't get him to sign anything.

246
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:11,840
So...

247
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:15,182
Would now be a bad time to tell you
your grandma is yelling at the cooks

248
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,393
- to make her chocolate pudding.
- Are you serious?

249
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,194
No, no!

250
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,439
No, I'm just...
I'm joking.

251
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,349
I'm sorry,
I was trying to be funny.

252
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,027
That was rude.

253
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,262
Yes, it was.

254
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,418
But it was kind of funny.

255
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,167
Yeah, well...
I gotta get back to work.

256
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,461
- It was good seeing you.
- You too.

257
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:48,630
Would you mind, like, kind of piling
the boxes back where you found them?

258
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,761
Thank you.

259
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,634
Oh, yeah...

260
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:03,314
Take it off...
Take it off, come on.

261
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:05,483
Lyla, I know how to dress myself.

262
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,319
No, you only know how to put on
a pledge shirt one button per button.

263
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,865
You know what'd be great?

264
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,419
We just leave, cause I don't even wanna
go to this dinner in the first place.

265
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:16,618
Yeah, well, if you only did
what you wanted to do,

266
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:19,522
your life would be all about football,
beer and sex, wouldn't it?

267
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,659
And what's the problem with that?

268
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:25,905
It's just a good opportunity for you
to spend some time with my dad.

269
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:28,766
And Mr. McCoy went
to Oklahoma, so he...

270
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:33,052
- might be able to help you out.
- Basically, you want me to smooth him.

271
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,825
No, I don't want you
to smooth anybody. I just...

272
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:39,287
You guys just gonna,
you know, talk about football.

273
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:43,297
- Not a big deal.
- I hate this, and I don't wanna go.

274
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,444
You don't even know
what you're saying you hate.

275
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:49,397
You just gonna go to dinner
with a guy who loves football, who...

276
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,239
might actually be able to help you out
and there's nothing more to it.

277
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:56,575
Come on...

278
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:00,384
You...

279
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:03,416
wanna tell me the real reason

280
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,376
why we're doing this?

281
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:07,026
Because...

282
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:09,773
I care about you.

283
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:14,479
And you wanna know
why <i>I'm</i> doing this?

284
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:17,611
Because you care about me?

285
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,374
Maybe just a bit.

286
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,418
Thank you.

287
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,272
How about...

288
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:28,691
"A vote for Tyra
is a vote for hotness?"

289
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:32,393
Landry, I'm serious here.
I'm trying to be a serious person.

290
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:35,030
How is that not serious?
I'm trying to help you out.

291
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,715
How about "Vote Tyra...

292
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,227
- "and get action?"
- Hell, yeah!

293
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,778
- I didn't realize it was gonna sound...
- How about nothing about action or hotness?

294
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:50,217
Well, why not, honey?
You're such a gorgeous girl.

295
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,632
I mean, I always say
"smoke him if you got him", that's all!

296
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,911
Seriously, all right, back off!
Knock it off!

297
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:26,999
I want you all off the campus
in one minute or I'm calling the police.

298
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,502
- That's a little extreme, Mr. Trucks...
- The party's over, ladies.

299
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:31,861
What's going on?

300
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,548
Jenny's mom was here yesterday
helping her to hand out cupcakes,

301
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,092
I don't understand why I can't have
some friends helping me.

302
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,845
- Mrs. Colette, are you really that dumb?
- Hey, watch it.

303
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,890
Just give me a moment here, Mrs. Taylor.
Do I have to explain to you

304
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,381
the difference between Jenny's mom
and 4 dancers from the <i>Landing Strip</i>?

305
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,979
Back to class right now.
Right now, you all!

306
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:52,089
Did you hear what Mrs. Taylor said?
Clear out!

307
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,171
What are you doing?

308
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:58,405
- I'm helping my campaign.
- You are suspended

309
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,950
- 3 days, starting now.
- Wait a minute...

310
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,982
- Wait, no!
- Hold on, hold on.

311
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,786
Listen, I'm...
Let me deal with this, all right?

312
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:08,290
- You gonna deal with it?
- Yes, I'm taking care of it. Tyra...

313
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:12,723
Go get ready for that meeting and
I'm gonna discuss this with you later.

314
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,353
Thanks, Mrs. T.

315
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,342
You're letting her get away with this?
You have got to be kidding me.

316
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,861
I need two more burgers well done
with Alamo sauce.

317
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:28,727
After that, I need you to mob the floor
in the back, I ain't staying late tonight.

318
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,081
Yeah, fine.

319
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,399
Hey, Coach, what's the matter?

320
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,026
Give you a crispy chicken sandwich
for the game?

321
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,497
I've been calling
every school I can think of

322
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,515
telling them that Smash Williams
is on a full recovery,

323
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:45,839
that he's ready to play college ball.
You tell me, should I not be doing that?

324
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,502
I don't know what it is.

325
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,502
I've never been scared once
playing football.

326
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,548
Even after Jason Street, I just...
I played like nothing could touch me.

327
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,220
Look, it's not just the knee...

328
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,394
I mean, it is, but...

329
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:05,222
I know you think
I can be who I was.

330
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,831
But I think I was only great
cause I was a Dillon Panther.

331
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:11,311
I was part of something
bigger than myself.

332
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,006
The team needed me to be great, so...
I was great.

333
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,777
Now, I'm just a guy playing by myself
on my old high school field.

334
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:20,897
And let's be honest...

335
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,157
you're having a hard time
finding a try-out for me.

336
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:25,909
I'll get you a try-out.

337
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:33,375
Suck it up.
That's what being a man is.

338
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:37,171
I wanna see you over Hermann Field
at 8 o'clock, Saturday night, full pants.

339
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,132
Don't you be late on me.

340
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,585
And I'd also like to remind everyone

341
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,187
that with two years student government
experience under my belt,

342
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:57,361
I understand what is required
and I'm ready to lead.

343
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,873
This is a question for Tyra.

344
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:11,955
Can you explain for those of us who are
concerned about your lack of experience,

345
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,376
how you could turn this
into a positive

346
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,419
when acting as a liaison
between the students and the faculty?

347
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,882
Wow, that was a long question.
I don't think I remember half of it.

348
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,762
No, seriously, y'all. What this entire
election really boils down to

349
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,724
is who you want planning your prom,
and one thing I can tell you

350
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,208
is that nobody here is getting laid
if you let Jenny here

351
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,083
have our prom in the gym, okay?

352
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:48,367
<i>Wow, oh my...
Is this a Panther's cakewalk or what?</i>

353
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,828
<i>The Panthers hold
the commanding lead,</i>

354
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,080
<i>42 to 0 over the Laribee Lions.</i>

355
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,811
<i>And how about a little
icing for that cake?</i>

356
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,750
<i>Saracen's under the center.</i>

357
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,299
<i>He takes the snap.</i>

358
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:02,713
<i>He screens right to Riggins
in the midfield.</i>

359
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,602
<i>He's to the forty, he's got room!</i>

360
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,422
<i>He picks up a good block
for forty to the tenth!</i>

361
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:09,136
<i>Touchdown, Tim Riggins!</i>

362
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:12,808
<i>Oh, boy, the Panthers
have this one in hands.</i>

363
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,596
Coach, good game.
Good game.

364
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,923
Craig, how you doing?
Good to see you.

365
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,843
When are we gonna see
that J.D. McCoy kid play?

366
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,286
- Matt had a hell of a game.
- Yeah.

367
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:42,628
I hear what you're saying.

368
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,198
All right, good nap, enjoy tonight.

369
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,719
He didn't even acknowledge me.

370
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,651
And Karen O'Day is not making
eye contact with me,

371
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:58,270
it's like all these people hate my guts,
what's wrong on with them?

372
00:21:58,723 --> 00:21:59,797
It's craziness.

373
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,981
People love football,
you're not gonna change that.

374
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:03,192
I know that

375
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:07,440
and I also know they're not thrilled
about the loss of their big Jumbo Tron.

376
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,656
- Did they change this menu?
- You know what, hon?

377
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,707
I need you to weigh in,
cause at this point,

378
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:14,995
I'm feeling like this world's against me
and I'm wondering which side you're on.

379
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,867
Honey, I don't wanna weigh in
on this situation right now,

380
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,084
because I don't wanna tell my wife
who I love and who I believe in,

381
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,045
a hundred percent,

382
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:26,678
that the first major decision
that she made at that school,

383
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:28,965
could be construed by some...

384
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,155
as questionable.

385
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,806
It's risky, yeah, I mean...
And courageous.

386
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:38,248
Questionable?
Come on, Hon...

387
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:41,414
You know what? I don't care about
the damn Jumbo Tron. I really don't.

388
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:43,899
But let me tell you something,
Buddy Garrity and the boosters,

389
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:48,103
if they want that damn Jumbo Tron,
they are gonna get that damn Jumbo Tron.

390
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:49,820
And the hell with the rest of them,

391
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,366
- but you knew that from the get-go.
- Well, yes.

392
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:56,251
The only people who have the money
are the boosters and Buddy Garrity,

393
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,895
and I love they want
the football program to flourish

394
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,832
but I just think that they need to be
told if they want that to flourish,

395
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,351
they need to give a tiny,
tiny bit to academics.

396
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,338
Baby, there is a big difference
between tiny, tiny and Jumbo Tron.

397
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:09,460
This is the way change is made

398
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,678
and I felt like I needed to make
that statement right from the beginning.

399
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,096
Honey, you made it clear,
and you made your statement.

400
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,234
Well, I know...

401
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:22,104
there is a new episode
of <i>Cagney and Lacy</i> on.

402
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:25,607
There's not any new ones on,
this show is not on anymore.

403
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,985
That was a good show, I don't know

404
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:31,947
why they quit those good shows
and put these other shows on.

405
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:33,528
All right...

406
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,992
I'll watch whatever this is.

407
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:39,704
- Is that milk about ready, honey?
- Yeah, this is ready, it's on its way.

408
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,766
Oh, thanks.

409
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,501
I saw that game.

410
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,464
You played great.

411
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:48,463
You just played great.

412
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:52,435
- Thanks.
- You've always loved football, Matty.

413
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:54,552
I remember when you were 2,

414
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,097
you were trying to throw a football
bigger than you were.

415
00:23:58,256 --> 00:24:01,726
And you were such a sweet baby.
Such a sweet, sweet baby.

416
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:06,102
But here you are, all grown-up...

417
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:08,567
taking care of everything.

418
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:12,695
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

419
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:16,030
I don't know.

420
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,778
Matthew, I love you.

421
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,081
I know, I love you too, grandma.

422
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,720
Grandma...

423
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,638
You are such a good boy.

424
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,573
That's cause I was raised by you.

425
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,802
Thank you...

426
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:40,604
Thank you.

427
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:01,162
Okay, okay...

428
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,498
Can I help you with something, Matt?

429
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:06,851
I need to borrow your car.

430
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,877
Why do you need
to borrow my car, Matt?

431
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,823
Okay, look. I just borrow it,
and it'll be back in the morning,

432
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:15,508
You don't even have to know
that it was gone.

433
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:18,249
Please.

434
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:33,469
It's me, Matt.

435
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,001
Your son.

436
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,213
Matt?

437
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,023
- Look at you.
- Look. I just need you...

438
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,914
to sign these papers, please.

439
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,507
What's this?

440
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:07,513
I need to become an emancipated minor
so I can take care of grandma legally.

441
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:11,583
Lorraine?
Where's Henry?

442
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,257
He's in Iraq.

443
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:20,175
I don't wanna talk about all the things,
so if you could just sign those, please.

444
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,920
- You wanna come inside?
- No.

445
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,858
Okay.

446
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:28,349
Hang on a second.

447
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,394
- What are you doing?
- It's just... I can't...

448
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:34,146
I'm not gonna sign anything
that I haven't read, so...

449
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:42,663
What's wrong with Lorraine?

450
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:48,198
She's got dementia. She can't
really take care of herself anymore.

451
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,135
And Henry left you alone with her?

452
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:54,194
I don't think you really
are in position to judge.

453
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:00,381
You got a pen?

454
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:04,885
Yeah.

455
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:08,264
Come in.

456
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,376
Did you hear?

457
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:16,184
You are looking at the new president
of the Dillon High student body.

458
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,771
- I heard.
- And they said it couldn't be done.

459
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,828
Can I help you with something?

460
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:25,657
What's the matter?

461
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:30,077
You know you sank to the lowest comment
and nominator to win that election.

462
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,484
No, I...

463
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,710
Mr. Trucks, he made it...

464
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,712
Don't you even go
blame it on Mr. Trucks!

465
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:42,744
It is time for you to start
taking responsibility for your life.

466
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,588
Well, Mrs. T.,
I was just doing what I though I had to.

467
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,646
And when I was standing
out there in that quad

468
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:51,036
watching you make an idiot out of
yourself and everybody around you,

469
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:53,685
I did what I thought I had to do
by sticking up for you.

470
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:55,895
Because I have believed in you.

471
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,941
Now, I suggest you would better start
earning back your self-respect

472
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:02,868
and the faith
that I once had in you,

473
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:05,572
or you really will be on your own.

474
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:09,061
Go and get to class.

475
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:02,629
- You're ready ?
- Oh yeah!

476
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,636
All right. Bring it back.

477
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,223
- 26 to count.
- All right, you all heard the man.

478
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:14,474
On one. Ready?

479
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,567
- You all right?
- Lucky hit, Rig.

480
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,945
- Lucky.
- All right.

481
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,406
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

482
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,363
Same play.

483
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,371
Set. Hut!

484
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,770
Smash, you okay, man?

485
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,142
I didn't mean to hit the knee.
You okay?

486
00:30:59,113 --> 00:31:00,437
Smash, get up, baby.

487
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:09,863
Hey, 6!
I'm back, baby!

488
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,908
- The Smash is back!
- There you are, man.

489
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,622
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah, you gonna be fine.

490
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:33,153
I'll just chat him up about playing
with Bosworth at Oklahoma, and then...

491
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,588
How the hell do you know that?

492
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:36,980
Google, why?

493
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,177
I didn't know you google.

494
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,063
- I'm not retarded, I google.
- I know, but...

495
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,501
Sometimes,
you pretend you are, so...

496
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:49,319
Oh, my God!

497
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,968
Buddy Garrity, look at your dau...

498
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:54,955
You are just a vision!

499
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,275
And you, are you sure she's yours?

500
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:00,330
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

501
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,165
- This is Tim.
- How are you?

502
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,792
- Nice to meet you.
- Joe McCoy, good to see you.

503
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,879
- What up, man, how is it going?
- Good.

504
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,466
- So, Melany, we all here.
- Right this way.

505
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:21,808
Two things.

506
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,529
I don't like you with my daughter,

507
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,932
the reason should be obvious.

508
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:31,024
Two,
my relationship with Joe McCoy

509
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,904
is extremely important.

510
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,491
You do not jeopardize it
in any way,

511
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,863
or I will hurt you.

512
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,613
Joe, that is nice.

513
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,674
Thank you.
That's my anniversary present.

514
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,217
That's beautiful.

515
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,678
Yeah, that was a bargain.

516
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:02,058
Tim, I understand that
you have switched positions this year

517
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,525
to tailback?

518
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,688
How is that working out for you?

519
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,423
Thinking about college
for next year?

520
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:19,158
- Are we ready to order?
- Sure.

521
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:24,141
- The Texas Game Sampler, please.
- Texas Game Sampler.

522
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:27,161
- And you, Ma'am?
- I'll have the same, please.

523
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,320
- And for you, sir?
- You still have the porterhouse?

524
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,652
But it's not on menu.

525
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:34,424
That's what I want.
I want that big porterhouse,

526
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:36,676
just have Wayne cut me one.

527
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,316
- Medium rare.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:41,264
And for you, sir?

529
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:44,225
All look so good.

530
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:46,912
Let's go with the...

531
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,272
Let's go with the squab, tonight.

532
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:51,065
Honey, are you sure?

533
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:52,701
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,982
Okay, well then... Go.

535
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:58,823
Can I get that...
Let's get that rare, as well, please.

536
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,371
One rare squab.

537
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,425
Thank you, sir.

538
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:18,781
- What happened in there?
- What do you mean?

539
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:21,675
Mr. and Mrs. McCoy were asking you
a bunch of questions,

540
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:23,556
you didn't say anything,
you were rude.

541
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:27,644
Did I not give you heads up that I hate
those restaurants, those people,

542
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:29,145
the food was sick.

543
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:31,648
Yeah, well,
you ordered rare pigeon.

544
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:34,803
You know what?

545
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,195
Who are you trying
to turn me into, right now?

546
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,238
I'm not trying
to turn you into anything.

547
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,490
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm positive.

548
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:45,118
I'm trying to make you into someone
who doesn't order rare squab.

549
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,890
I'm a horrible person.

550
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:51,060
Maybe I'm just too simple
of a guy for you, Lyl'.

551
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,139
I'm too simple,
I'm not classy enough for you.

552
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,172
That's right.
That's what it is.

553
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,502
- Maybe we should just go separate ways.
- Maybe we should.

554
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:04,557
- Good.
- Great.

555
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:31,905
- Hi, Tami.
- How you doin'?

556
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:34,252
I'm fine.
Can we talk for just a second?

557
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:37,134
Yeah, as long as it's not
about the Jumbo Tron thing,

558
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,818
because I don't wanna talk about that
on my time off.

559
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:43,156
Well, it is
about the Jumbo Tron, because...

560
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,596
Quite frankly, Tami,
just let me say this.

561
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,430
That issue has not been
put to bed, yet.

562
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,419
We had a meeting,
with the superintendent.

563
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,019
The funds are frozen.

564
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,042
Who had a meeting?

565
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:56,774
Well, the boosters,

566
00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:59,110
and the mayor,
and the superintendent,

567
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:02,864
and all the people I've been out trying
to get money from, for the Jumbo Tron.

568
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:04,782
And so, anyway,

569
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,717
the hearing will be in 2 weeks,
it's open to the public,

570
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:10,746
you could be there of course,
everybody avows their opinion.

571
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,291
And we'll see what we do
at that time.

572
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,722
I'm sorry it happens this way.

573
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,616
It's gonna be okay.

574
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,551
Bye.

575
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:28,556
What's that all about?

576
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,389
Hey, Mitch, how you doin'?

577
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:59,044
- Coach Taylor.
- Hey, Corina.

578
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:02,215
- How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm sorry to come by so late...

579
00:37:02,475 --> 00:37:04,300
That's okay. Come on in.
Brian!

580
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,756
- Yeah, mama?
- Come here!

581
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,059
What's up, Coach?

582
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,686
You and I have some work to do.

583
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:18,064
2 weeks time.

584
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,551
You got a walk on Texas A&M.

585
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:24,049
Yes, sir.

586
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:26,072
I'll make you proud.

587
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,079
- See you tomorrow morning.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,777
Hey, kid.

589
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,043
- Good night.
- Thank you.

590
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:40,837
Thank you, Coach!

591
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:00,815
Somebody died?

592
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:07,989
- Why are you here?
- Mandy had to drop something off.

593
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,886
So, as soon as they're done humping,
I'm out of your hair.

594
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,574
Well, that shouldn't take too long.

595
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:17,194
You think?
I've been here long enough.

596
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:18,959
Why are you dressed like that?

597
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:22,078
I'm dressed like this
because I just came from dinner

598
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:23,967
with Buddy Garrity, Lyla,

599
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,216
and the new rich booster that I was
supposed to chat up about college.

600
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,550
Which, between you and me,

601
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:33,014
don't think I'm cut out for.

602
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:35,170
You and me both.

603
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,263
But it's nice to get this off and...

604
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:42,939
kinda want to have a beer,
just chill out and watch...

605
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:44,469
anything.

606
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,069
Yeah, cheers.

607
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:55,956
I ate pigeon tonight, Tyra.

608
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,344
Why?

609
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:01,792
- I don't know why.
- I don't know what pigeon looks like.

610
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:03,188
It was crap.

611
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,329
Could barely get through,
but I ate it

612
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:08,299
because I didn't want them
to think I'm making a mistake.

613
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:25,170
- Where are your pants?
- My pants are just over there...

614
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,692
It was hot.

615
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:29,236
So I just... geared down,
just chilling.

616
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,618
- I brought you a cheeseburger.
- Seriously?

617
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,331
I felt bad.

618
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:39,514
Thank you.

619
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,875
It's very sweet of you.

620
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:48,130
Great.
You done?

621
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,007
- I was waiting for him to start...
- You know what? Don't even...

622
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:57,546
- Bye, y'all. Good seeing you.
- That's a good look for you, Tim.

623
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,143
- I love you, Billy.
- I love you too, sweetie.

624
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,421
Why are you in Landry's car?

625
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,088
I just needed
to borrow it for something.

626
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:31,773
You done with work?

627
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:34,135
Yeah, long day.

628
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:35,886
You want a ride?

629
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:39,463
Sure.

630
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:50,276
I went and saw my mom.

631
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:55,743
That's a big step.

632
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:00,492
I got her to sign
those papers, so...

633
00:41:02,246 --> 00:41:04,332
I'm an emancipated minor, now.

634
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,541
Emancipated minor...

635
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,630
That's kinda hot.

636
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,685
- Yeah, you think?
- I think it's very hot.

637
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,568
Does that mean you get to, like...

638
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,787
vote, and drink, and...

639
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:19,889
smoke, and rent cars?

640
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,518
It means I get to take care
of old people.

641
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:26,740
Yeah, maybe not so hot.

642
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:28,752
Yeah, maybe not.

643
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,354
- Stop the car. Stop, stop.
- What?

644
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,186
This is the car I'm gonna buy.

645
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:46,575
What do you think? It's the car
Mrs. Sadmark's gonna sell me

646
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:48,626
when I make enough money
working at Applebee's.

647
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:51,045
She's beautiful, isn't she?

648
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,341
This is a Celica.

649
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,324
Are you implying that maybe
I should buy a Dodge Dard

650
00:41:58,494 --> 00:42:00,809
and let the engine fall out,
so I can be just like you?

651
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:02,306
Okay, it's beautiful.

652
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,790
It's a beautiful...

653
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:07,061
Celica.

654
00:42:07,684 --> 00:42:08,982
See? I told you.

655
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:13,359
And maybe, if you're really nice to me,
I might give you a ride to shool.

656
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:15,811
Maybe.
