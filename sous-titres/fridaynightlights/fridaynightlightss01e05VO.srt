1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,386
<i>Sports Illustrated
has this team...</i>

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:04,520
<i>as the number one high school
football team in Texas.</i>

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:05,964
Got yourself
a heck of a quarterback.

4
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,343
- Is it true, Mr. Street?
- That I love Lyla Garrity?

5
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,909
<i>Street the only one
to be able to get to him.</i>

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,477
<i>A gigantic hit on Street.</i>

7
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,344
Jason's paralyzed.

8
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:17,843
This is not just some game,
you realize that,

9
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:19,275
after what's happened
with Jason.

10
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:20,300
It's about this town.

11
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:22,365
It's about the spirit
and keeping this town alive.

12
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:25,609
You think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

13
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,441
You got a job to do.

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,342
This is all yours
for the taking.

15
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,322
You know, Jason's been
asking about you.

16
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:34,171
You know, you wait too long,
he might start taking it personal too.

17
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:37,213
You want to help, then stop pretending
that everything's okay.

18
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:40,343
He's never gonna walk again!

19
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,870
<i>What happened with us came from
all these feelings about Jason.</i>

20
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>They're trying to bring in
this Katrina refugee.</i>

21
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:49,613
<i>We got ourselves
a quarterback, Coach.</i>

22
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:54,601
Can you tell me who
you're thinking about starting?

23
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,841
If you want it to be you, you're
gonna have to show me a lot more

24
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,242
than what you've been showing me
on the field this week.

25
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:01,212
I can't stop thinking
about you, Lyla.

26
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:21,203
Morning.

27
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:25,103
- No hospital today?
- No, I'm going for a run.

28
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,870
I think this is--

29
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:29,363
Hey...

30
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:33,161
I think it's really great.
You're doing something for yourself.

31
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,510
Thanks, Mom.

32
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,271
Have a good day, sweetie.

33
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,412
<i>I own this place,
it's part of me</i>

34
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,873
<i>It fills me up
and swallows me</i>

35
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,312
<i>And I am oceans,
rocks, and vines</i>

36
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:51,641
<i>Reaching for
the sun that shines</i>

37
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:53,813
<i>Oh, I must say,
I adore you</i>

38
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,473
<i>But sometimes
I seem to ignore you</i>

39
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,612
<i>That's because
I don't deserve you</i>

40
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,310
<i>Or have your love
for me ever</i>

41
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:06,613
<i>All this time
I wanted you to know</i>

42
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:09,641
<i>That if you're ever...</i>

43
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,473
Yeah?

44
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:20,113
Hi.

45
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:34,743
You hungry?

46
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:35,812
Yeah.

47
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,762
It's not much, but--

48
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,670
Is your brother here?

49
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,712
No.

50
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,740
<i>Hey, Sammy, it's Wednesday.</i>

51
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,212
<i>When are we gonna get
the decision from Coach Taylor?</i>

52
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:22,372
<i>Is it gonna be Voodoo,
or is it gonna be Saracen?</i>

53
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,073
<i>Well, we're on
the same page there, Fred.</i>

54
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:25,611
<i>We're all waiting
for that answer.</i>

55
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,013
<i>Voodoo's a star, man.
We gotta see that kid play.</i>

56
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:30,842
<i>A team does not function with
a quarterback controversy.</i>

57
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,510
<i>He's just gotta go out
and pick one.</i>

58
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,841
<i>Well, my friend, as I said,</i>

59
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,371
<i>I don't think
you're alone there.</i>

60
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,173
I found this national web site

61
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,641
listing all these open
high school coaching jobs.

62
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,210
You did not.

63
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,772
There's one in Miami.

64
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:44,943
There's another school in New York.

65
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:48,240
There's even a head coaching
job in Seattle.

66
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:49,913
And it comes with a house
in "Pudget" Sound.

67
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:51,410
Puget Sound.

68
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:53,840
You know what I heard once?

69
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,602
I heard that a daughter
is supposed to be a comfort

70
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,540
and a blessing
to her father.

71
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:01,442
Texas isn't even a state.

72
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,170
Technically, it's a republic.

73
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:06,102
It'd be nice to live somewhere
that's actually a part of this planet.

74
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:09,211
Do y'all think that they actually
have football in Seattle?

75
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,470
Not the same thing.

76
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,710
Come on, on the hop, guys,
let's get out of here.

77
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,143
Mike, get Voodoo
out of the weight room.

78
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,840
- Tell him I want to see him.
- In the office?

79
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,912
- Yeah, in my office.
- All right, I'll send him in.

80
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,440
Voodoo!

81
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,100
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Sit down.

82
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,082
How you doing?

83
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,582
Listen, we haven't
had much time to talk.

84
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:50,531
And, uh, it's been
pretty busy around here.

85
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,153
I just thought that--

86
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,451
Well, you know I'm gonna
be making a decision soon about Friday.

87
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,551
This is where you might want
to chime in about

88
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:06,402
how you relish the opportunity.
Or, you know, you're not gonna let me down.

89
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,150
You might want to add something about
the insight you've gained into the game of football

90
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:12,562
in the short time you've been lucky enough
to be a Dillon Panther.

91
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,452
I'm not here
to make friends.

92
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,883
This ain't my home.
This ain't my school.

93
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,113
It never will be.

94
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,182
Yeah?

95
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:26,211
I don't like the food here,
the music, the weather.

96
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,813
I can definitely do without
everybody going on and on

97
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,551
about the great state of Texas.

98
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:35,302
I'm here to get noticed, get recruited,
and get my ass to LSU.

99
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,910
And you?

100
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,913
You're just trying to scrape by.

101
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:42,481
Trying to win some games,
keep your job.

102
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,721
You and me are
an arranged marriage.

103
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:47,580
Nothing more.

104
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:49,251
You've seen what I can do.

105
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,882
You want to start Saracen,
you go right ahead.

106
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,973
You wanna leave that door open?

107
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:12,503

Synch: Tauri41.

110
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,162
Hey, look, you're doing
pretty good out there.

111
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,103
- Blowin' it out in practice.
- Yeah? You think so?

112
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,643
- Yeah, man.
- Cool, thanks.

113
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:04,803
You and me, State and Main.

114
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:07,613
- Okay.
- For real.

115
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,413
Hey, hey, where you goin'
there, girl?

116
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,343
Hey, baby, come on back here
and bless me.

117
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:15,882
Hey, you guys seen Lyla?

118
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,441
Lyla?

119
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,143
What about the Smash, baby?

120
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,403
And don't forget about my boy here,
Matty Saracen.

121
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:24,810
Hey, Matt.
Are you starting on Friday?

122
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:27,413
I-I might be.
I might.

123
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:34,411
Oh, boy.
You're drawing up plays.

124
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:36,413
Oh, thank you.

125
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:37,881
Thank you. I'll take it.

126
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,813
Oh... We're having dinner.

127
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:41,210
You can forage for them later.

128
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,283
This looks good.

129
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:45,313
Here you go.

130
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,181
One triple-chocolate meltdown.

131
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:50,910
You're not my waitress.

132
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,110
Shift change.
Lucky me.

133
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,853
I'm not sure how
I feel about this.

134
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,472
I mean, it's kind of abrupt.

135
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,173
I had a thing going
with this other lady.

136
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,071
She was bringing me
napkins and mints.

137
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,743
See, you know, that's rough.

138
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:05,941
But at her age,

139
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:08,010
Carlene can only handle
the day shift.

140
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,312
Plus, there's a
"Murder, She Wrote" marathon

141
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,341
- on this weekend, so--
- I'm stuck with you.

142
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,480
Whoa, what's going on
out there?

144
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,125
Just a bunch of overheated jocks,

145
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:23,749
too dumb to know
they have no future,

146
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,351
fighting over a game
that has no meaning,

147
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,982
in a town from which
there is no escape.

148
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,210
That's, uh--
Wow.

149
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,941
Anyway, my name is Tyra,

150
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,840
and I'll be at your service
for the next six hours.

151
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,113
Okay.

152
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,842
All right, good. Good.

153
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,642
Let's go, let's go!

154
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,840
Get 'em over there!

155
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,311
Lookin' good, yeah.

156
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,513
Stay low and drive.

157
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:55,082
Aim for the "B."

158
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,680
There it is.
All right, good.

159
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,881
Now pass.

160
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,780
Bring it down.

161
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,983
Nice, nice.

162
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,243
- Yeah!
- What's going on, Coach?

163
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,383
The guy's looking good,
Coach.

164
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,300
How come Saracen isn't
rotating in with the first team?

165
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,711
I thought last week we said
we were starting Tatom.

166
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,103
I think you said that, and I said,
"Thanks for the opinion, Coach."

167
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,202
Saracen, put your lid on.
Strap up, son. Get your ass in there.

168
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,470
We're rotating him with the first team
until I say otherwise.

169
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,110
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:21,913
Get in there, son.

171
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,511
Hey.

172
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:48,310
You know, there is more
than one restaurant in this town.

173
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:50,643
I'm just...saying.
Oh.

174
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,282
Well, I just came by
to give you something,

175
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:56,013
but now, maybe I'm not
feeling like it anymore.

176
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,641
What is it?

177
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:00,400
You remind me of him.

178
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,601
I remind you of an old,
wrinkled black man

179
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,500
- wearing a weird hat?
- Yeah, something like that.

180
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,181
Okay.

181
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,002
- Well--
- That's it.

182
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,913
Thanks.

183
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:18,511
Hey, you want to come
for a ride...with me?

184
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:20,141
A ride?

185
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,911
Yeah, I work for
an investment bank,

186
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:25,702
and we're looking to see if the oil fields
are worth reopening around here.

187
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:28,801
I gotta go out to the fields
an do an evaluation.

188
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,902
You know, financial
feasibility, analysis.

189
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,401
- And I'm just boring you to death.
- Yeah, totally.

190
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,301
Anyway, look, I gotta go out to the fields,
meet some geologists.

191
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,003
I was wondering if you'd
want to go for a ride.

192
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,772
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

193
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,612
What?

194
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,410
I wasn't--
I'm not--

195
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,213
I just like your company.

196
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,372
- Hey.
- Hey.

197
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,610
What are you doing here?

198
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:05,303
I have two parents who work here,
and I can't get either one of them

199
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,010
to sign my stupid
driver's ed form.

200
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:12,600
Uh, are you--
Are you gonna come to the game on Friday?

201
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:15,010
Uh, yeah.
My dad's the coach.

202
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,910
He'll have a heart attack
if I don't show up.

203
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:21,003
So, do you think
you're gonna start?

204
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:23,511
Uh...I don't know.

205
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,010
That's the coach's decision.

206
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,503
You know, whatever he decides,
I'm there for.

207
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,070
But I've been working hard,
so I'm ready.

208
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:30,870
I feel good about it.

209
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,412
I just-- You know, whatever he feels
is best for the team,

210
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,011
that's--that's what
I'm ready to do, so.

211
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,803
Dude, you need to chill out.
I'm not ESPN.

212
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,140
Sorry.

213
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:44,210
No, it's cool.
All right, I'll...

214
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll see you around, then.

215
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:47,372
- Bye.
- Bye.

216
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,701
You're so stupid.

217
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:53,840
There you go.

218
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,473
Now try throwing it
back to Raines.

219
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,501
You're doing great.

220
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,340
There you go.

221
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,870
Try to throw it back.

222
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,040
Use your biceps.
You got 'em.

223
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,502
All right, here's the play.

224
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,601
Go about 15 yards, run a post pattern.
I'll hit you by the water cooler.

225
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:23,502
Phil, get QB in a van this afternoon.
Get him downtown to the center.

226
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,572
You know I can't authorize that.

227
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:29,040
Authorize this, Phil.
I want to show this boy his future.

228
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,811
What's happening
this afternoon, Phil?

229
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,041
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

230
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:46,271
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

231
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:49,870
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

232
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,372
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

233
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,141
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

234
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:56,972
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

235
00:12:57,017 --> 00:13:01,770
<i>Dream, dreamer
get in your way</i>

236
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:06,040
<i>Always do this to where?</i>

237
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,741
<i>Lose yourself to the sea</i>

238
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,843
<i>Am I only a dream?</i>

239
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,370
<i>Shoot the runner</i>

240
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,370
<i>Shoot, shoot the runner</i>

241
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:20,073
<i>I'm a king
and she's my queen</i>

242
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,703
Hey, miss Lyla Garrity.
Come in here and sit down.

243
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,201
Well, it's not true what
they say about cheerleaders.

244
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,802
That you're all just a bunch of T and A,
and nothing between the ears.

245
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,440
Excuse me, Mrs. Taylor?

246
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,840
Well, I mean, you got
straight-As, girl.

247
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:40,642
Good.

248
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,213
- Thank you.
- That's awesome.

249
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,541
Yeah, so, what are you thinking?
Are you thinking about colleges?

250
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,700
Well, I always figured I'd wait to see
what school Jason was gonna play for.

251
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,243
Probably Notre Dame.

252
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:55,672
So, I'd probably end up taking
classes at St. Mary's.

253
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:59,842
You know, and enroll full-time
once Jason was settled in.

254
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,102
Well, college football is so much
more demanding than high school.

255
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:07,543
- I'd want to be there for him.
- I understand that.

256
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,810
But, you know,
I was actually thinking,

257
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:14,140
separate from that,
what you might want to do.

258
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,813
I guess with Jason's
recovery and all,

259
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,470
I really haven't had the time
to give that much thought.

260
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:23,841
I know, I know.

261
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:29,272
But that's why I thought maybe it'd be
a good idea for you to come in here.

262
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,712
Maybe it's time to start
thinking about it.

263
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:33,773
What do you think?

264
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:50,883
What the hell are you doing?

265
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,870
Copying the playbook.
What do you think I'm doin'?

266
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,571
Tatom's been borrowing mine,

267
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:58,900
so I thought it was about time
he got one of his own.

268
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,872
You got a problem with that now?

269
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:04,071
No, I just like to know
what's going on in my office.

270
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,913
Like I like to know
what's going on with my offense.

271
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,300
You know, I don't really care for
what you're insinuating there.

272
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:11,100
Mac, I'm not insinuating anything.

273
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:15,400
But since we're broaching the subject,
I can tell you one thing that I don't like.

274
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,841
I don't like
my offensive coordinator

275
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,340
chatting up Buddy Garrity,
like he's on a date.

276
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:21,601
I don't care for that too much.

277
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:24,502
Look, who I have a drink with
is none of your damn business.

278
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,101
Easy.

279
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,602
You think I want your job, right?
Well, you're damn right I do.

280
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:31,003
'Cause the way I see it, 
you're sitting in my chair.

281
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,801
But I'll never do anything
to hurt these kids.

282
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:37,501
I want to win, just like you do.
These are my boys too.

283
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:40,702
So you pull it together.
Got me?

284
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,473
See, this is what i fear about.

285
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,960
We've got mass-producing
Borden County,

286
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,182
mass-producing Howard County.

287
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,203
We move over here into Dillon, though,
and we've got, you know, almost--

288
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,730
Yeah, again, I suggested
like you did, boss.

289
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,671
You guys know better than I do.

290
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:10,572
I don't know.

291
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,203
I guess I just have to laugh.

292
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:15,001
All these people so caught up
in their tiny little lives.

293
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,631
It's ridiculous, don't you think?

294
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,201
What?

295
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:21,032
Nothing.

296
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:23,671
You're opinionated.
I like that.

297
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,333
You know what else I hate,
just for the record?

298
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:28,832
- What?
- Oil.

299
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:30,833
Ok.

300
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,170
Why?

301
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:36,700
I know it's a widely held belief,
but any particular reason?

302
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,001
I hate what it did to my father.

303
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,002
This whole town, really.

304
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:48,130
My father, he lost his job
as a rigger in the last bust.

305
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:53,002
I mean, it's worse than crack.

306
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:56,000
These dealers come in promising
good times will last forever.

307
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:58,203
And just as fast, it's gone.

308
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,803
And all the money's gone with it.

309
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,672
You want to know a secret?

310
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:07,330
Hmm?

311
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,470
I'm not a big fan of oil either.

312
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,331
Oh.

313
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,531
Really?

314
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,402
Back home, I drive a hybrid.

315
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,002
You like it out there in Los Angeles?

316
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,001
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

317
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,302
You know, you'd do all right out there.

318
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,200
So, um...

319
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,502
how long are you gonna be here for?

320
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,332
I don't know.
As long as my boss wants me to be.

321
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,332
Another week, at least.

322
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:47,333
So what would you say
to dinner tomorrow night?

323
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:50,001
Real dinner, I mean.

324
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:55,002
Yeah. I'd like that.

325
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:58,002
<i>One scotch, one bourbon</i>

326
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,070
<i>And one beer</i>

327
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,471
Hey, QB.

328
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:16,801
Oh, hey-- Hey, Herc.

329
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:20,000
Sorry.

330
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,873
When was that?

331
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,773
Well, that was a while back.

332
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:31,003
Ooh, you're getting good at that.

333
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,003
Look at you.

334
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,130
Very nice.

335
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,130
Very put out.

336
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:38,830
What's your injury?

337
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,931
The same as you.
C7-T1.

338
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:45,702
We got our fingers.
We're the lucky ones around here.

339
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,573
Oh, yeah, real lucky.

340
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,572
It's all relative, QB.

341
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:57,700
How, uh-- How long before you, uh,

342
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,070
you started playing
quad rugby?

343
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,802
About a year.

344
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:05,602
Of course, I wasted a good six months
drowning in a sea of self-pity.

345
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,031
Six months?

346
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,600
Six months.

347
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,133
How's that calculus going?

348
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,702
What calculus?

349
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,303
You know, you were talking
about it the other day.

350
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,571
I don't know.

351
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:25,971
Advance-placement trig?

352
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:27,971
Yeah.

353
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:29,401
How's that going?

354
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,070
It's going fine.

355
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,073
I know you were worried about it
the other day.

356
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,670
You had some big test
coming up.

357
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,670
- Tim, just don't do this, okay?
- Do what?

358
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:42,101
Pretend that you're interested
in my schoolwork.

359
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:46,002
It's obvious that you're not,
that you're just trying to--

360
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,200
Have a conversation, Lyla?

361
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,230
Yeah, I thought we may want
to try and do that sometime.

362
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,102
Okay.

363
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,001
What do you want to talk about, Tim?

364
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,603
The fact that you're sleeping with

365
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,202
your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend?

366
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:04,973
Is that what you want
to talk about, Tim?

367
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:12,501
No, I don't think we're going
to be doing a lot of talking.

368
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:46,602
I just wanted to see if you might be
coming home for dinner tonight.

369
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,873
I don't think I'm gonna
be home for dinner tonight.

370
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,003
Your daughter was asking
for a picture of you,

371
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:53,532
and so I just thought you might
like to weigh in on which one--

372
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,272
That's not funny.
Don't do that.

373
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:00,332
We sure would love to see you.

374
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,703
How was your day today?

375
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:02,902
- It was all right.
- Yeah?

376
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:03,802
How was yours?

377
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:05,973
If you listen to
the TV or the radio,

378
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm the coach that can't
get the decision made.

379
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:09,833
Can't make a decision.

380
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,231
Can I help you
make the decision?

381
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,101
Sure, go ahead. Make the decision, Honey.
What's your decision? You make the call.

382
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:15,333
Start Saracen.

383
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:17,702
Start Saracen? 
I cannot start Matt Saracen.

384
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:18,500
Then start Voodoo.

385
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,102
I don't want to start Voodoo.

386
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,500
Then start me.

387
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:24,671
I would love to start you.

388
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,532
I would love to start you.

389
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,200
Well, you know, it seems to me here
that at this point, there's just not gonna be

390
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,330
a decision that's gonna feel good.

391
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,800
So the good news is
you can make the decision

392
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,733
and come on home and
have dinner with your family.

393
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:40,071
See your kid.

394
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:44,003
Problem is, I've just got
a little, slight problem,

395
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:45,103
being that...

396
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,003
Matt Saracen, one, is good for the team.
The team will play for Matt Saracen.

397
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,500
There is no doubt about that.

398
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:54,103
He's done everything I've asked him to do.
He's left it all on the field.

399
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:55,100
No problem.

400
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,602
I trust the kid.
He trusts me.

401
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,270
This kid Voodoo,
I don't like the kid, one.

402
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:03,070
Two, I don't trust the kid.

403
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,651
But three, I believe he can
get it done for us.

404
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:07,502
I believe he can
win this game for us.

405
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:10,070
That's it.
That's it right there.

406
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:13,930
That sounds to me like you've
made your decision, Coach.

407
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,472
Yeah, they said something
about bedrock.

408
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:25,502
The crude's made up of this stuff.
Could you put Angela on the phone anyway?

409
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:26,571
Thank you.

410
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,102
Angela, hey, it's Connor.

411
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm gonna need a flight back to L.A.

412
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,732
Tomorrow morning's perfect.
Thank you.

413
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,531
All right.
Bye. Hi.

414
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,403
- How you doing?
- I was waiting for you.

415
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:42,503
That was my boss.

416
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,800
My boss needs me back in L.A.,
so I've gotta cut the trip short.

417
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:49,730
But I would really like
to go out tonight still.

418
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,601
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

419
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:53,831
Okay.

420
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:56,830
- I'll see you later.
- Work.

421
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,232
Bye.

422
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:03,632
Yeah?

423
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:08,000
- You wanna talk to me, Coach?
- Yeah. Come on in.

424
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,000
Sit down.

425
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:22,900
You gave a hell of a week of practice.
I couldn't have asked for anything more.

426
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,002
Thank you, sir.

427
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:25,403
I just want to let you know that

428
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:28,842
I really appreciate all the encouragement
you've been giving me.

429
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:30,600
- And I feel ready for this.

430
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,101
I mean, I feel readier for this

431
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,541
than anything in my whole life.

432
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,002
I'm gonna start Voodoo.

433
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,400
I want you to be ready.

434
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:41,543
I want you to stay on the playbook.

435
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,242
- Be prepared.
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:52,503
Yes, thank you.
Thanks for letting me know.

437
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,371
I say if we do our best,
we will have success.

438
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,601
And that we own
the fourth quarter.

439
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,073
The fourth quarter is ours!

440
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,272
The fourth quarter is ours!

441
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,102
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

442
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,740
<i>It's going down tonight!</i>

443
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:50,402
<i>The Panthers ain't even
began to fight!</i>

444
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:54,803
<i>Look, they wanna trash
our locker room,</i>

445
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,440
<i>we're fittin' to hit 'em
with a sonic boom!</i>

446
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:02,002
<i>The Panthers gonna have
the last laugh,</i>

447
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:04,972
<i>'cause we
breakin' our foot off...</i>

448
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,243
Love you, Daddy.

449
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:36,900
How you feeling today, Mr. Street?

450
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:40,301
Well, hello, Miss Garrity.
You look pretty tonight.

451
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:43,803
What are you doing here?
You're gonna be late for the game.

452
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:45,200
I know.

453
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:47,201
You have a visitor.

454
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:48,843
I do?

455
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:50,841
Mm-hmm.

456
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:52,310
- Hey.
- Hey, Coach.

457
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:53,941
I thought I'd bring up
a little something.

458
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,810
Decorate the room a bit.

459
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:02,002
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

460
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:06,080
God bless, coach.
Good luck.

461
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,511
Clear eyes, full hearts.

462
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,413
Can't lose.

463
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,342
What's up, Street?

464
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:35,142
What's up, fellas?

465
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,681
Man, look, we just came by
to say we love you.

466
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:46,000
- We're gonna win for you.
- I know y'all are gonna win.

467
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:54,780
Get the balls, right?

468
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:55,882
Yeah, sure.

469
00:26:58,436 --> 00:26:59,911
How you doing, Matt?

470
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:02,500
Play well, all right?

471
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:03,281
Thanks.

472
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,541
You get better.

473
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:08,240
Thanks, Coach.

474
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,521
It's good to see you all.

475
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:15,390
How you doing?
Get out of there.

476
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:21,392
Thank you for coming, y'all.

477
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:39,363
I miss you, Street.

478
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:41,592
Where the hell you been?

479
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,392
You know.

480
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,620
Around.

481
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:00,562
Go.

482
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,562
- See you later, okay?
- Okay.

483
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:06,360
- Love you.
- I love you.

484
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:08,403
I love you too.

485
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:46,922
Hi.

486
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,060
Hi.

487
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:51,383
I thought I was picking you up.

488
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:53,602
- You're--
- Can I come in?

489
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,343
Um, yeah, of course.

490
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:30,603
It is Friday night, and Voodoo madness
has put its spell on the Lone Star State.

491
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:36,620
And 16,000 people have gathered together
to witness the debut of superstar phenom

492
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:38,791
Ray "Voodoo" Tatom.

493
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:42,023
And for Coach Taylor, he better hope Voodoo

494
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:43,401
can get it done tonight.

495
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:44,823
I can't remember when there was

496
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:47,921
so much riding on a game
this early in the season.

497
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,450
This is a bitter rivalry,
and no one is about to back down.

498
00:29:57,527 --> 00:30:00,421
Oh, Riggins gets leveled!
And Tatom goes down.

499
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:02,091
It's another offensive line breakdown.

500
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:04,102
You know what, Ray Tatom is not happy.

501
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:06,103
Frustration starting to mount here

502
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:09,000
as this game plan by Coach Taylor
is not going the way he'd hoped.

503
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:13,402
Halfway through the second quarter here
as the Panthers are down by a touchdown.

504
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,801
Pro right, 27 China.
Screen pass to Riggins.

505
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,702
We worked on this play
all night--we're setting 'em up.

506
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,301
We can get 'em with this.
Now let's go.

507
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:20,822
Looks like Smash is gonna shuttle in the play.

508
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:23,391
I hope Coach Taylor's found
the key to this Tiger defense.

509
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:26,251
- Pro right, 27 China.
- No, hell, no, man. Forget that.

510
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,120
Hey, you can't change the play.

511
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:30,050
We gonna win, we gonna play my way.

512
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:31,321
Let's go, Voodoo, come on!

513
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,350
Tatom's over the ball.

514
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:34,028
Set!

515
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,492
Hut!

516
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:37,853
He takes the snap.

517
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:38,903
Hit him!

518
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,800
- Riggins wide open in the flat.
- He's open! Hit him!

519
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,650
<i>All I want is what's mine</i>

520
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:46,091
<i>I don't care who I hurt</i>

521
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,151
Go, Voodoo!

522
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:51,552
He's on his way!

523
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,093
Voodoo Tatom!

524
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,693
He's gonna get it!

525
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,952
It's a touchdown, Dillon Panthers!

526
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:02,201
Whoo, I tell you what, that is the Voodoo
Tatom we've been waiting for, Sammy!

527
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:06,353
And Dillon is right back in this thing.

528
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:12,952
Come here, come here.

529
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,950
You run the plays I call.
You understand?

530
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:17,692
I give you that one, and that's it!
That one.

531
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:20,023
- Look at the scoreboard, Coach.
- That one!

532
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:29,452
And Voodoo has fired up this team
after that stunning touchdown.

533
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,352
And you can feel the momentum shift--

534
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:32,793
Oh, what a shot!

535
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:35,252
And the defense is really
bringing on the pain now.

536
00:31:35,297 --> 00:31:38,550
They are playing with purpose,
trying to get that ball back in Tatom's hands

537
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,426
to try and get a lead before the half.

538
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:43,022
Hey, listen to me.

539
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:43,992
Listen, Tatom, c'mere.

540
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,491
Tatom. Tatom!

541
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:46,822
Tatom!

542
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:49,003
Tatom, get over here!

543
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:52,202
Seems like a little confusion
over on the sidelines, Sammy.

544
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:53,353
What's he doing?

545
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,400
Pro right, gun,
triple nine ranger... On one.

546
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:58,821
Ready?

547
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:01,221
Coach Taylor seems
a bit perplexed out there.

548
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:02,320
I don't know what's going on.

549
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,193
Oh! Ohh!

550
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:06,023
Move, 35!

551
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,623
Hut!

552
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:10,390
Tatom drops back.

553
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:12,051
Quick three steps on the right side--

554
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:14,101
Oh, and it's picked off!

555
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,402
The ball is picked off by the safety,
Fowler, and he's up the left side.

556
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:22,150
And it doesn't look like
he's gonna be touched.

557
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:24,921
And that is a touchdown.

558
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:28,801
Dillon is gonna go into the locker room
down by a touchdown.

559
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:34,351
Hey!

560
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:38,103
You pull another stunt like that again,
and you are off this team, you understand me?!

561
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:39,821
- Move off.
- You understand me?!

562
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:40,952
Move off me right now!

563
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,392
- You get out of my sight!
- Who?

564
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:43,592
- You get out of my sight!
- What?

565
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,321
- You're done!
- Done with what?

566
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,552
You are done!
Get out of my sight, son!

567
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:48,522
You are done!

568
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:50,150
- I don't care!
- You are done here!

569
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,721
I don't need Texas!

570
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:53,521
That make you feel big?
Go ahead, you're done, son!

571
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,491
You don't pull that crap
on me out there!

572
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:57,692
- No one does!
- Fade to black.

573
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,591
- Saracen!
- Yes, sir?

574
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:07,153
Go warm it up, son.

575
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:10,622
It all comes down to this, folks.
One minute 18.

576
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,120
Panthers down by 7.

577
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,621
This is our time.
The fourth quarter's ours.

578
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:16,851
We have worked for this.
We have earned it.

579
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:22,521
Matt Saracen continues as the quarterback,
and still no sign of Voodoo Tatom.

580
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:24,701
Bold move by Coach Taylor.

581
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,422
Now we'll see how this
is gonna turn out.

582
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,892
Listen to me, we're gonna
run this team ragged.

583
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,522
- You can lead this team.
- Yes, Sir.

584
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,590
Lead 'em now. Bring it home.

585
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:38,820
It is a tough road to home for Saracen.

586
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:43,100
84 yards to go.

587
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,923
All right, we're gonna
wing right, 28 rocket pitch.

588
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,851
Let's do this.
All on one. Ready?

589
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,652
Go!

590
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,152
Set!

591
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,552
Dillon setting up
with three wide to the right.

592
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:58,152
And with so little time, they probably have
only three or four plays left.

593
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:07,100
Oh, he goes to the short man, Dolia,
and he's out of bounds at the 32 yard line.

594
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:08,423
Hut!

595
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:10,722
There's a pitch out to Williams on the right.

596
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:12,793
He picks up a block.
He's heading up the sideline.

597
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:15,690
He gets to the 46 yard line.
Another first down.

598
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:17,020
And that'll stop the clock.

599
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,191
Let's go, Matt.
Keep it rolling.

600
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:22,692
Here's Williams on the left side now.

601
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:23,852
He's running him left!

602
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:25,992
And Williams got a little bit of room.

603
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,362
And he is pushed out of bounds.

604
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,000
That'll stop the clock
while they move the chains.

605
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:35,303
Seven seconds. This is the last play
of the game for the Dillon offense.

606
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,832
Let's see if Matt Saracen
can pull this one off.

607
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:40,901
All right, we're doing the same play,
just with a little twist!

608
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:49,000
Blue, 8!
Blue, 8!

609
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:51,570
Hut!

610
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:54,503
Saracen with another pitch
to Smash Williams on the left side.

611
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:55,873
Reverse! Reverse!

612
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:58,403
It's a reverse!
Riggins on the right side.

613
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:00,873
Look at that block by Saracen!

614
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:05,830
Touchdown!

615
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:08,132
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers.

616
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:12,101
I cannot believe
what I have just seen.

617
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:15,802
Oh, folks, we have seen
something truly special here tonight.

618
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:18,832
And now, we got an opportunity
to tie this ballgame

619
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,503
with just one extra point.

620
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,042
Dillon's gonna be thrilled
to get out of here with a tie.

621
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,030
Saracen, get in here.

622
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,433
Turn around, son.
What do you see out there?

623
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,473
We got 'em right where we want 'em.

624
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,800
We're gonna go for two.
What do you think?

625
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:37,403
Give it to Smash.
He's been doing it all game, Coach.

626
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:42,101
- Coach, we need a play.
- 18 option, Matt. 18 option.

627
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,253
- Do you understand that play?
- Yes, sir.

628
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:45,703
- You got the play, you understand?
- Yes, sir.

629
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:46,402
Get 'er done.

630
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:47,970
Well, I don't know if I like this.

631
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,633
But Coach Taylor has Saracen
back in the game.

632
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:53,803
And it looks like they're gonna be going
for the two-point conversion and the win.

633
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,372
You are looking at a man

634
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:04,073
who is betting his entire career
on this one play.

635
00:36:07,677 --> 00:36:09,601
Green, 20!

636
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:11,831
Hut!

637
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:19,773
Williams takes the pitch.
Heads up the right side.

638
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,403
He gets airborne--
Oh, he takes a lick at the goal line.

639
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:24,031
Did he make it?

640
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:27,500
It's good! It's good!

641
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:30,203
Smash Williams has scored
on a two-point conversion

642
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,900
and the Dillon Panthers
have taken this game.

643
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:36,931
- Damn fine game, Coach.
- Just doin' my job.

644
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,103
I can't believe Coach T would've put
the whole season on the line,

645
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:42,903
but boy, that was a beautiful call!

646
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:45,450
I'll tell you what,
Coach Taylor rolled the dice

647
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:48,235
- and he came up a big winner this time.
- Coach, good luck for the season.

648
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:50,200
- That was a fine game.
- Thank you, sir.

649
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,242
Connor?

650
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,440
Connor?

651
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,903
Hi.

652
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:56,400
- Morning.
- Morning.

653
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,902
Breakfast.

654
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:02,672
Someone should enlighten
this town about room service.

655
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:09,200
It looks like it's just
for one person.

656
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,740
Yeah, well, I gotta
catch my plane.

657
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,572
- Right, right.
- You knew I was...

658
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:17,101
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

659
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:23,203
You know, Tyra...

660
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:25,503
you're a really great girl.

661
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:27,900
- And, um...
- Please, just...

662
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:30,941
Don't.

663
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:41,302
Look, I have to be honest
with you, Tyra.

664
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,471
I'm involved.

665
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:47,473
You know, in L.A.
I'm, I'm in a pretty serious--

666
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,200
- Relationship?
- Yeah.

667
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:50,342
Yeah, well...

668
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:53,743
you know, this was just
a one-time thing.

669
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:56,203
- And I have a boyfriend, so...
- Right.

670
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,072
Yeah.

671
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,672
Okay, well...

672
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:08,303
- I really have to, um...
- Right.

673
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:11,502
So I'll see you soon?

674
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,571
- Yeah.
- Ok.

675
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:15,673
Bye.

676
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:37,740
<i>Let's get out of this country</i>

677
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:41,142
I wanna get those, um, those
chocolate-covered blackberries.

678
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:42,970
- That sounds good.
- All right.

679
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:43,940
Hey!

680
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:46,042
Hey, you know what I like about me?

681
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:48,473
That you're married to somebody
as fantastic as me?

682
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:49,801
That is what I like about me.

683
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,443
- Good morning, cheerful.
- Hey, thank you for doing that.

684
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:53,770
Tonight, what do you say
we go grab some dinner?

685
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:56,041
- Uh-huh, I like that.
- Catch a movie.

686
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:59,201
- And then we'll do the...
- Oh, really?

687
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:00,540
Okay, okay!

688
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:03,300
Wait, wait, wait!
Inappropriate. Inappropriate.

689
00:40:03,377 --> 00:40:06,040
- Eating breakfast.
- We're gonna get down tonight.

690
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:09,273
I'll see you after
the meeting this afternoon.

691
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:12,800
- Good-bye. I love you.
- Tell Buddy Garrity,

692
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:15,003
uh, he can shove it.

693
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:19,941
<i>Find a cathedral city, You can
be handsome, I'll be pretty</i>

694
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:29,141
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

695
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,906
<i>Everyone else thinks
it's the bee's knees</i>

696
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:35,373
I'll tell you what. Eric Taylor coached
a hell of a game last night.

697
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:38,200
Those Arnett Mead boys had
a tremendous size advantage

698
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:42,902
over our Panthers. And he just ran
those Tigers flat into the ground.

699
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,443
- Hey, you're a hero,man.
- Well, my hat's off to Coach Taylor.

700
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:49,603
And young Matt Saracen has really emerged
as a force to be reckoned with.

701
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,171
That was a hell of a performance.

702
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:56,500
Hey, Jeff, how are you doing today?

703
00:40:56,545 --> 00:40:58,270
I appreciate that, thank you.

704
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:01,303
- Hey, good one. Good one.
- Thank you.

705
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:06,242
<i>Smell the Jasmine,
my head will turn</i>

706
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:09,372
<i>Feel like gettin'
confessional</i>

707
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,402
<i>We'll find a cathedral city</i>

708
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:15,602
<i>You can convince me
I am pretty</i>

709
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:23,412
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

710
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:27,351
<i>Everyone else thinks
it's the bee's knees</i>

711
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:30,361
<i>What does the city
have to offer me?</i>

712
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,902
<i>I just can't see</i>

713
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:38,901
<i>I just can't see</i>

714
00:41:58,537 --> 00:42:02,602
Coach Taylor, a couple of gentlemen
I'd like for you to meet here.

715
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:03,862
Buddy.
It's, um..

716
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:05,860
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

717
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:08,761
Lance Jennings. Ryan Johnson.
Nice to meet you.

718
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:11,731
We're from the district executive committee.

719
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:15,200
Some questions have arisen
about Ray Tatom's eligibility.

720
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,663
And I thought we had this
all squared away, Coach.

721
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,200
I thought we did too.

722
00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:25,500
Well, we're here to inform you that
there's gonna be a formal investigation.

723
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:27,830
And we'll notify you
of our findings.

724
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:29,762
Your "findings."

725
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:33,602
And if he is deemed ineligible...

726
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:35,730
Ray Tatom won't be playing
football here anymore.

727
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:39,833
And Dillon will be stripped
of last night's victory.

728
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,202
Well, y'all have a good day.
Buddy, I'll talk to you later.

729
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,002
Yeah, I'll talk to you later, Coach.
