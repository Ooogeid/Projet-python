1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:01,397
Julie, You skipped class?

2
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:02,836
It was only one time.

3
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,497
Look, Miss Taylor, we're really sorry--
we'll never do it again.

4
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:06,772
That color
looks good on you.

5
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:07,902
You should get it.

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,197
I don't know.

7
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:10,948
I don't really have
the money for it.

8
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,099
You have been invited
to training camp in Austin.

9
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:18,880
No way!

10
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,420
Coaches evaluate the players

11
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,799
and then choose the new members

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,305
for the national quad rugby
squad for the U. S. of A.

13
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:26,601
Yeah, he's gonna
have these rally girls

14
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,110
fawning all over him
until Spring.

15
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,631
Julie, I'm sorry.
Okay?

16
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,792
I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

17
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,862
Guys like Smash are fearless.

18
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,893
They're dangerous.
They're like junkyard dogs.

19
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:37,642
How do you mean?

20
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,562
I'm not saying
that all black guys are dumb.

21
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,691
Wait, I'm not Jesse Jackson.

22
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,883
My cause is football.

23
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:45,142
Look, look, look,
sooner or later

24
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,193
you're gonna have to peek out
from behind those blinders.

25
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:50,832
You boys deaf or something?
I said, "On my whistle!"

26
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,842
Ready?

27
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,772
I'm not gonna tell you again!

28
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,803
Get your asses down there!
On my whistle!

29
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:06,652
So you think
that there's racial problem

30
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:07,753
with the Dillon Panthers.

31
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:08,711
Without a doubt.

32
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:10,573
How so? Are you saying
that black players

33
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,593
are being treated differently
than white players?

34
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,561
No, it's not about the treatment.
It's about the attitude.

35
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,043
Look, all we want
is equality and respect.

36
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:22,040
Well, there are 16 black players
on the varsity roster.

37
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:24,100
That's more than 25%
of your team.

38
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:25,591
And a lot of them are starters.

39
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,670
Are you saying that blacks aren't
getting enough opportunity to play?

40
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:30,610
No, no, it's not about that,

41
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,652
all right?

42
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:33,802
It's about certain people
in charge

43
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,920
making assumptions
about other players on the team

44
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:37,162
just because of they color.

45
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:38,613
And nothing being
done about it.

46
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,191
You mean Coach McGill?

47
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,933
Yeah, you heard
what he said.

48
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,452
Coach McGill has already issued
a public apology.

49
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,310
Yeah, but those are just words.

50
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,872
Are you saying
you want him fired?

51
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:49,460
That'd be a good start.

52
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,343
The loss of Anton.

53
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,292
Seale is gone.

54
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:55,751
Biggums is gone.

55
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:57,511
Woods is gone.

56
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,140
Cherry is gone.

57
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:00,803
Smash is gone.

58
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,003
Greer's gone.
We don't have a kicker.

59
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,790
Anybody else?

60
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,951
Baxter's gone.
We don't have a tailback.

61
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:08,603
All right.

62
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,612
Coach, I don't know what
to tell you.

63
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,483
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna dip into the JV.

64
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,222
On one, ready? Go!
Three days, gentlemen.

65
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:18,862
Three days. Let's go!
Fire it up.

66
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:19,873
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

67
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:20,742
Pick it up!

68
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,630
Set!

69
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:23,652
Blue, 80!

70
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,413
Blue, 80!

71
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,160
H ut!

72
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:28,771
Tyler!

73
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:29,891
- Where you go?
- Tyler!

74
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,643
Tyler!
Tyler!

75
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:32,783
Tyler!

76
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:34,461
Tyler!

77
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,013
What did I ask you to run?

78
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,381
What did I ask you to run?

79
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:38,613
- What's your name?
- Tyler.

80
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:40,253
- What's your grandfather's name?
- Jim.

81
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:41,861
- What's your mother's maiden name?
- Norman.

82
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,640
How the hell can you
remember all that

83
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:45,550
and not remember the route
I ask you to run?

84
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:46,891
I don't know, sir.

85
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:49,973
All right.
Huddle up.

86
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:50,673
Come on.
Bring it in here.

87
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,060
Have you heard what he said 21?

88
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,143
First year or not,
you know this!

89
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:55,643
Fix your chinstrap!

90
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,343
He's good.
All right.

91
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,310
Power right 24 pitch on one.

92
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,372
Ready, break.

93
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,310
Let's go!

94
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:02,860
Set!

95
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,791
White, nine!

96
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:06,413
White, nine!

97
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:07,272
Hut!

98
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,453
What do you think you're doing?

99
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:17,952
Tell me what you're running!

100
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,113
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

101
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,261
You don't know
what you're doing

102
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:21,833
because you're supposed
to be blocking for me!

103
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:23,402
You know how
to block yet, JV?

104
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:24,972
There's no excuse
for that crap.

105
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:25,521
G rady!

106
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,503
You don't even deserve
to be out on this field!

107
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:28,573
- Come here!
- That's a fact!

108
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,222
You don't!

109
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,821
- Shut your mouth and come here!
- Give me a break!

110
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:32,163
Coach.

111
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:33,820
- I was taking a hit like that.
- What the hell are you doing?

112
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:34,853
I need a leader out here.

113
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:36,633
You're the team captain.
I need you to lead.

114
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:37,292
You understand me?

115
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,972
I don't need you breaking
these guys down.

116
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,190
I need you to set the tone,

117
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,513
be the example.
You got me?

118
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,233
Yes, sir.

119
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,402
Can you do that for me?

120
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:44,150
I can.

121
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:46,971
Good.

122
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,621
Allspaugh! Stager! Burdette!
Get over here!

123
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,382
Listen up, we didn't
call you up from JV

124
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:54,481
to scrimmage out here.

125
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,791
The three of you might just be
playing Friday night in Dunston

126
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:57,703
You understand me?

127
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,933
- I can do it, coach.
- Listen, quiet.

128
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,712
You're gonna stick
to him like

129
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,002
paint on a car. 
You got it?

130
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,930
You are gonna
get them up to speed.

131
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,551
Consider yourselves
married now.

132
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:08,951
Congratulations, gentlemen.

133
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:10,912
Coach Spivey, Smith,
come here.

134
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,381
I'm with you, Riggins.

135
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:15,861
Shut up.

Coach McGill has already
issued a public apology.

141
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,053
Yeah, but those are
just words.

142
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:10,582
Are you saying
you want him fired?

143
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,160
That'd be a good start.

144
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,859
You have to admit,
the stakes are high.

145
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,995
Should the Panthers lose
if you guys sit out,

146
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,491
that's it,
the season's over.

147
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,283
Are you and your teammates
prepared to play

148
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,641
on Friday night
should Coach McGill be gone?

149
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:23,991
Yeah. Yes, sir.

150
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:24,790
Yes, we are.

151
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,821
Yeah, we should
totally do that.

152
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:28,290
You did?

153
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:29,770
Your mom is so cool.

154
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,823
Uh, yeah, um,
so I'll see you at school.

155
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:34,791
Bye.

156
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:36,401
Who's that?

157
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:37,173
Tyra.

158
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,692
Your father and I have been
wanting to talk to you about that.

159
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,841
We have some concerns
about this new relationship

160
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,302
you've got going with Tyra.

161
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,072
I'm just kinda surprised
that's somebody

162
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:47,602
you've chosen
to spend so much time with.

163
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,142
Okay, first of all,
you don't even know Tyra.

164
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:51,580
And second of all,
if this is about

165
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,330
the whole cutting class
thing, I mean,

166
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,783
you already punished me
for that, remember?

167
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,671
Oh, no, actually that was
your guidance counselor.

168
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,171
He was just trying to help you

169
00:05:58,277 --> 00:05:59,413
make up a grad

170
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:00,771
This is your mother talking

171
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,841
who knows for a fact
that you never skipped school

172
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,593
before you started
hanging out with Tyra.

173
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:06,091
What happened to Lois?

174
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,392
Lois. What happened to Lois?
She was a nice girl.

175
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:10,391
Okay

176
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,280
so first you don't want me
dating Matt Saracen.

177
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,001
Now you're picking
my friends for me.

178
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,970
So maybe you guys
should just

179
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,281
home school me.

180
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,652
Honey,

181
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:22,471
I don't like your tone.

182
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:24,002
I don't like your sarcasm.

183
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,901
And I really don't understand
what you see

184
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,351
in hanging out
with this girl.

185
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,622
She's been suspended
from school three times.

186
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:30,421
Do you realize that?

187
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,171
One time for drinking on campus.

188
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,203
You know what it is?

189
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,823
When there's one person

190
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:36,843
who's involved

191
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:37,840
with another person,

192
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:38,930
and that first person

193
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:40,283
is a person
who gets in trouble,

194
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,532
who gets suspended,

195
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,210
who doesn't wear enough clothes.

196
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:44,593
That first person

197
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,310
starts hanging around
with the second person,

198
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:47,360
who happens to be

199
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,031
a pretty darn good kid,

200
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,632
very smart,

201
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,373
smarter than what
I'm seeing right now.

202
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,343
And the second person,
who is with that first person,

203
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:57,972
starts going on the wrong path,

204
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,560
that's a bit of a problem.

205
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,411
Do you realize this is
the definition of prejudice?

206
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:04,730
You guys are pre-judging her.

207
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,623
And you know maybe if you
weren't so prejudiced,

208
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:10,151
16 of your players wouldn't
have walked off the team.

209
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:11,271
Watch your mouth.

210
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,352
Maybe you should think
about that next time.

211
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,190
You know what?
Come here a second.

212
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,220
I don't like the way
you're talking, young lady.

213
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,251
You and I are not finished
with this conversation.

214
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,660
I mean, coming back
to school was fine

215
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:24,943
and everything, but

216
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:26,591
I mean,
this is a big deal.

217
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,912
National Quad Rugby Team.

218
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:29,833
They only give out
25 invitations.

219
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,071
There's hundreds of players
across the country.

220
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,013
I'm one of 'em, so...

221
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,512
It sounds like
an amazing thing.

222
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,132
A couple of weeks of school
is a long time to miss,

223
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:38,360
and that's right
in the middle of finals.

224
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,380
I understand that,

225
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:40,121
but--

226
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,283
For you to miss a couple weeks,

227
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,610
it's gonna be hard for you
to come back in

228
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,572
and take those finals.

229
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:44,863
I'll just tackle it all
when I get back.

230
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,702
You know, and Miss Taylor,
if worse comes to worse,

231
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:48,573
then

232
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,891
I'll just take the GED.

233
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:52,281
Cause that's still
an option, right?

234
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,612
- Yeah.
- Okay.

235
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,543
Then it works out great.

236
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,280
It just sounds to me

237
00:07:58,555 --> 00:07:59,733
like

238
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,653
maybe you're putting
all your eggs

239
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,071
in the quad rugby basket.

240
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,002
Yeah, it does.

241
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,481
That's pretty much exactly
what I'm doing.

242
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:08,813
I'm putting
every single one of 'em in.

243
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,203
This better work.

244
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,450
It will, okay?

245
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:15,503
I promise.
Nothing says

246
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,502
I'm sorry like a mix CD.

247
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,491
I'm a little bit worried
about the Bob Dylan.

248
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,590
Gotta try to stay
in this century, man

249
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:23,802
Hey, um, Tyra,

250
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,441
do you know
where Julie is maybe?

251
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,473
at's not what I think it is,
is it?

252
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:30,691
What do you think it is?

253
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,552
I think that's
a mixed CD.

254
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,383
Yeah, I think you're trying to
trade a night in a hot tub

255
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:37,441
with a bunch of rally girls
for a five-cent CD

256
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,272
with a bunch
of sappy love songs on it.

257
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,681
I told you that
that wasn't gonna work.

258
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:43,273
Listen.

259
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,230
Excuse  my friend here,
but I don't even think

260
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,253
we've formally
been introduced.

261
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:48,960
My name
is Landry Clark.

262
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:50,413
You know, I just wanted to say

263
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:51,841
that you are absolutely right.

264
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,621
Yeah, well, how about
you two geniuses go back

265
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,821
to your little lab
and cook something else up?

266
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,311
Something that shows
a little bit more remorse.

267
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,630
Okay.

268
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:00,630
Here's a hint,

269
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:02,650
spend some money.

270
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:03,533
Spend some mon--

271
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:05,183
Exactly, see, that's
what I've been--

272
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,580
that's what I was trying
to tell you.

273
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:08,320
That's the kinda thing
that girls like--

274
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:09,381
You can go now.

275
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:12,012
Tyra, I'm not gonna
let you down.

276
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:13,871
Okay?

277
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,261
Hey, what were you talking
to Matt about?

278
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,030
You'll thank me for it later.

279
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:23,972
Hey,

280
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,722
you wanna go see
a movie tomorrow night?

281
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,202
Um, sure. Yeah.

282
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:32,221
If you launch this into odd-gap,

283
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,911
quarterback plays
into an outlet play,

284
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,683
what do you do?

285
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:35,741
Go, Stager.

286
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,561
- Okay, I know this. 
- Too late.

287
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:39,300
Play's over.

288
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,583
You waited too long
to make a decision,

289
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,051
now we lost the game
because of you.

290
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,150
We're not going to State,

291
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:44,871
and the whole town
of Dillon hates you.

292
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,680
You're never gonna get laid
your entire life.

293
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:47,662
Fact.

294
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:49,900
How's that feel
right now?

295
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,180
Man,  you cracked down

296
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,750
to your blocks.
Look for the quick toss.

297
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,021
- Next.
- If I wanted you to speak,

298
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,122
I would have spoken
to you.

299
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:56,773
Besides, it's
completely wrong.

300
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,171
All you do is check
into your tight end.

301
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,300
Put your lunch away.

302
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:00,131
You're not eating.

303
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:01,992
And neither are you,
for that matter. Put it away.

304
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:08,340
I want you gentlemen to take

305
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,272
a good, long, hard look at this.

306
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,671
He's a quitter.
All right?

307
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:16,543
Man, you see that kid,
Allspaugh?

308
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,733
He took my spot.
Who knows if I'm a get it back.

309
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,201
Be cool.
All right?

310
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,172
It's gonna be all right.

311
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,432
Man, I gotta go to college.

312
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,813
I am this close
to a scholarship.

313
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,523
What you want me to do?
Kiss that good-bye?

314
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,130
Chill out.
We all got something to lose.

315
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,580
But it's a standoff.

316
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,993
It all comes down
to who blinks first.

317
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:32,870
We getting down
to it, man.

318
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:33,743
I know.

319
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,262
Y'all need
to stop trippin'.

320
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:38,872
Let's just focus on...

321
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:40,571
Selmont.

322
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:41,430
We good?

323
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:42,151
Yeah.

324
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:43,492
Here's the schedule.

325
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:45,171
3:45, let's have
everyone out there.

326
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,333
All right.

327
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,581
Thanks, Crowley.

328
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,672
I appreciate the help.

329
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:50,443
You bet.

330
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,550
Guess I missed the memo
about the meeting.

331
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,702
Oh, it was a defensive thing.

332
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,343
Crowley wasn't defense.

333
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:00,691
Yeah, but Crowley 
brought the pork rinds.

334
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:04,700
Tell you what,
I'm not real comfortable

335
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:05,821
about these secret meetings.

336
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,062
I have a meeting with whoever
I want whenever I want

337
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,911
whether it fits
your comfort zone or not.

338
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:10,712
I don't care.

339
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,251
Yeah, I think I'm entitled to know
what's going on with this team here.

340
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:15,870
I think it was
just about the damn stupidest

341
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,171
thing  you could have possibly
done running around saying,

342
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:20,320
"Blacks this, whites that."

343
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,751
And I apologized!

344
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,200
I did your song and dance!

345
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,491
You know what?
The only thing wrong

346
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,910
with your apology, Mac,

347
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,072
was it didn't look like
you believed your own apology.

348
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,121
You know people out there

349
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,770
are calling you a racist,
right now, don't you?

350
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,821
- That doesn't scare you?
- Doesn't scare me at all.

351
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,410
Well, it should!
You know why?

352
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:38,663
'Cause you wanna know
what's sitting

353
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,102
on this table right now?

354
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,462
Your termination, that's what.

355
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,521
You know what, Matt?

356
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:58,570
Tyra was right

357
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,600
about the whole
mixed tape thing.

358
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:01,893
That was really, really lame.

359
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:02,851
That was your idea.

360
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,762
Right, but we both knew

361
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,442
the risks involved
with mixed tapes.

362
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:07,931
They're kind of
an acquired taste.

363
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,562
Actually, come to think of it,

364
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,382
I'm not really the one that

365
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:12,752
cheated on Julie Taylor.

366
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,063
I didn't cheat, okay?

367
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:15,180
Whose side are you on anyway?

368
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,781
I thought you were my friend.

369
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,122
You know Tyra and I,

370
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,152
we're just trying, you know,
to explain to you

371
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,462
that you can't
just go around--

372
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:22,562
Tyra and I.

373
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,800
You really think that
there's any chance in hell

374
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,441
that she'll ever even have

375
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,480
a conversation with you?

376
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:29,950
Stop right now
before you say something

377
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:31,113
that you may
one day regret.

378
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:32,931
Because I can tell you one thing,

379
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,232
stranger things have
happened, Matt

380
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,822
- Stranger things have not happened.
- I felt something with her.

381
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,392
You don't--don't--

382
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,722
I bet you felt something.

383
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,250
Can I help y'all find something?

384
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,232
Okay, he messed up.

385
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,591
Well, how bad
did you mess up?

386
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:46,672
Diamond bad?

387
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:48,223
- Gold bad?
- Diamonds.

388
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,440
What about this one
right here?

389
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,423
How much is
this one right here?

390
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,363
This little marquee?

391
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,330
It wasn't diamond bad.

392
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,170
I'm telling you,

393
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,600
three girls
in a hot tub

394
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,810
definitely qualifies
as diamond territory.

395
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,710
Just reach into those
Alamo Freeze pockets of yours--

396
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,721
Landry,
I got like $50, okay?

397
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,320
Huh, how much
is that?

398
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,440
This ring's $995.

399
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,152
You know what?
Diamonds are stupid.

400
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,371
Think about the Africans.

401
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:10,752
You know, blood diamonds.

402
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,550
How about a nice pendant
or some earrings?

403
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,260
Think about that?

404
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,753
- This one?
- Yeah, yeah. This.

405
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:17,472
It's a little
heart-shaped amethyst.

406
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,243
Right, and that's February,
right?

407
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:20,893
Um-hmm, is her birthday
in February?

408
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:21,653
It is.

409
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,850
Well, then, you see, she'll know
you remembered her birthday.

410
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,162
And how much is the amethyst?

411
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,363
Let's see, it was $100.

412
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,252
But it's half price,
so $50.

413
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,060
How much do you have, Matt?

414
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,521
You have $50.

415
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,003
Take it.

416
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:37,830
Yeah, let's--

417
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:39,210
I'm gonna take that, please.

418
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:40,221
Okay.

419
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,422
Hey, guys.

420
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:44,382
Coach.

421
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:47,972
Hello, Mike.

422
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:48,693
Hey, Buddy.

423
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:50,520
How you doin'?

424
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,061
You know, I've been better.
I've been worse.

425
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,081
Well, whatever happens,

426
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,023
it's gonna work out.

427
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:07,490
Hey, Buddy.

428
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,281
Eric.

429
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:14,201
Those safeties
are as big as our tackles.

430
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:17,073
Run stunts, cross block
every chance we get.

431
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,271
Work the angles.

432
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,082
Yeah, well,
how you gonna protect Saracen?

433
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,442
Just roll 'em out of the pocket.
Have him throw short.

434
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,903
Well, who's he gonna
throw it to, Eric?

435
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,622
I thought you said
on the phone that you had

436
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:28,210
some constructive advice.

437
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,891
We cannot win
this football game

438
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,262
without Smash
and the other guys.

439
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,553
You know that.

440
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,040
The booster club took a vote,

441
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:42,151
and I can't think
of any ideas right now.

442
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:44,402
So, you're gonna have
to get rid of Mac.

443
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,992
That's what they voted.

444
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,313
So do it.

445
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,512
Get rid of him.

446
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,633
How long you
and him been friends?

447
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:51,963
What?
20, 30 years?

448
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,240
Let me tell you something,

449
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,310
we wouldn't be
where we are right now

450
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:56,620
if it weren't for Mac McGill.

451
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,683
You know as well as I do,

452
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,241
Mac McGill is Panther football.

453
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,751
You don't think I know that?

454
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:06,750
I know he's not a racist.
This is media crap.

455
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,132
But you know what?

456
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,570
We got a team.
And we got one man,

457
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,290
and he'll sacrifice for the team.

458
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,412
So go ahead and do it.
Just get rid of him.

459
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:17,992
We'll fix it later.

460
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:32,953
I'm good at math.

461
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:34,073
Hey, honey.

462
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:35,260
Hi.

463
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,723
I got a guidance
counselor emergency.

464
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,690
Well, I'm talking
to Carrie here.

465
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,112
We're just gonna be
finished up here--

466
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,501
I got a guidance
counselor emergency.

467
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,902
- You want me to leave?
- Yes.

468
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:45,451
Really?

469
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,203
Yeah.

470
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:47,650
Thank you.

471
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,090
We'll just be one second.
One quick second.

472
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,202
Right where we left off.

473
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,302
Listen to me,

474
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,260
everything hangs
in the balance right here.

475
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,473
I've got a question, and I need
some advice from you.

476
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:58,302
All right.

477
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,051
I need to talk
to the guidance counselor,

478
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:00,723
not my wife.

479
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:01,940
I need some unbiased,

480
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,940
clear, honest advice.

481
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,590
Everything hangs in the balance.

482
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,663
All right.
Sit down.

483
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:07,890
Come on, sit down.

484
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,130
Sit down.

485
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,610
The Boosters and Buddy
want me to fire Mac McGill.

486
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,030
I don't wanna fire Mac McGill.

487
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:19,372
Mac McGill's a damn good coach.

488
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:22,260
And Mac McGill is
important for me

489
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:23,610
in the playoffs.

490
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,670
I thought this was gonna end
a while ago.

491
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:29,190
I didn't think it would go on
as far as it did. I was wrong.

492
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,541
So what's the question?

493
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,882
The question is what do I do
about firing Mac McGill?

494
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,012
What did he say?

495
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:36,822
Honey, you heard
what he said--

496
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,720
I know what he said.
I wanna review.

497
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,320
Let's review.
Let's review the events.

498
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,560
About Smash Williams, he said,

499
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,720
the black players have a gift
for running the ball.

500
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:46,973
- That they're fearless.
- Right.

501
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,010
Fearless, they got a gift.

502
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:49,502
Wasn't there something else
in that little phrase?

503
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:51,280
And he said a thing
about the junkyard dog thing.

504
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,470
As far as the players,
like Matt Saracen--

505
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,083
You mean your white players.

506
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,302
Yes, the white pl-- he said
they don't have the physicality.

507
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,890
But he said they have

508
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:01,323
more creative thinking,

509
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:02,721
which makes them
well-suited to lead.

510
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,272
That's what he said.
It was a stupid thing to say.

511
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,941
- I understand.
- As a guidance counselor

512
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,053
I gotta say that that,

513
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,631
to me, is a fireable offense.

514
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,091
What he said.

515
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:12,833
All right, well,
let me talk to my wife.

516
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,192
Let me talk to the person
who cares about me

517
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:15,252
and cares about the team.

518
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:16,670
And also has to understand

519
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,012
the relevance
and the importance

520
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:18,942
to our future

521
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,983
of us winning the regional.

522
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:22,850
There is nothing more
clear to me

523
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,143
that your team

524
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:26,133
is way more important
to you than Mac McGill.

525
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,831
Is there anyone else
I can talk to?

526
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,871
You can talk to your friend.

527
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:34,301
What does
she have to say?

528
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,803
This is not
about Mac McGill.

529
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,330
It's not about the team.
This is about you.

530
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,022
And you've been put
in this position now

531
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:40,451
where you've got
to make the decision.

532
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,331
If you don't fire him
at this point,

533
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,071
you are condoning
what he said.

534
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,512
Honey, he said something stupid.

535
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:46,710
- He's not a racist.
- I know.

536
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:47,550
He's a friend.

537
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,551
But that is not something
for a kids' assistant coach to say,

538
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:52,892
no less for a government
employee,

539
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,353
which is what he is.

540
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,530
The three of you scare me.

541
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:03,891
I know.

542
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:05,192
Here, come on.

543
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:06,510
She's ready for you.

544
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,582
On one side I got Rig and all
them dudes hating on me.

545
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,863
And on the other side
I got Seale and everybody

546
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:13,681
looking at me like I'm
the key to they future.

547
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:15,531
I'm beginning to wonder if I

548
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:16,702
should have walked off at all.

549
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:19,342
No, you stood up
for what you believe in.

550
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,152
And baby, that takes guts.

551
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,572
Yeah, but what if it
don't work, Angela Davis?

552
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,242
You ain't
gotta worry about that.

553
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,211
That's what they want,

554
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,603
for you to doubt yourself.

555
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,823
Think about
what I could be losing.

556
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:32,002
Think about what
you're not losing,

557
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:34,113
like your rights
and your integrity.

558
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:37,583
You could do so much more
with your life besides football.

559
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:39,942
I don't know
about all that.

560
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:41,980
Well, you don't have
to worry about it

561
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:43,823
because Mac McGill
is gonna get fired.

562
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,093
Yeah, how do you know?

563
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:46,681
'Cause

564
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,232
even I know
that the Panthers

565
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,911
can't win without you guys.

566
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,190
Yeah, well,

567
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,212
you right about that.

568
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
I'm what?

569
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,782
Now, don't let it go
to your head.

570
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:03,812
I'll get it.

571
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:04,542
Thanks.

572
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:11,521
I'm, uh, sorry
to bother ya.

573
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:12,563
Is the coach here?

574
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,191
Yeah, Mac.
Come on in.

575
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,140
Get out of the cold.

576
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:17,172
He's right back there.

577
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:20,713
My dad wasn't a bad man.
You know?

578
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,203
He had a couple real passions
in his life.

579
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:25,452
He loved to bass fish,

580
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:27,172
and he loved Razorback football.

581
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,051
I remember one time
when those

582
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,780
poor girls tried to integrate
Central down in Little Rock.

583
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:33,371
Well

584
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,242
My dad was pissed.

585
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,862
He'd have gone down there
with his Kiwanis boys probably,

586
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,912
done no-telling-what
if my mama hadn't stopped him.

587
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:44,241
Well, it's different times.

588
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,863
I didn't agree with it
or anything.

589
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,253
I never thought it was
the right thing to do.

590
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:50,622
But

591
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,192
stuff like this kinda
works its way into you

592
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:54,581
if you're around it
long enough, you know?

593
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,573
Mac, I know one damn thing
for sure.

594
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,613
You're the one
that integrated this team.

595
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,211
Look, I'm a simple man, Eric.

596
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,701
I love my girls.

597
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,412
I love working
in my yard.

598
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,230
I love playing bridge
with Susan every chance I get.

599
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:13,602
But

600
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:16,191
I know that I screwed
this up here.

601
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:20,122
Truth is, I'm still trying
to get used to a man

602
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,630
that's ten years my junior
sitting in a seat

603
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,091
that I thought would be mine
one of these days.

604
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,573
And I know
that I handled that wrong.

605
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:29,883
And I'm sorry.

606
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,502
I love these boys.

607
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:35,692
I love this team,

608
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,023
and I'm not gonna do anything
to stand in the way of it.

609
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,581
I'm not gonna do anything
to hurt it.

610
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,313
I know y'all got a real
good chance to go to state.

611
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:45,721
- What are you doing?
- My resignation.

612
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,351
Aw, come on.
What the hell you doing?

613
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,670
It's too hard as it is.

614
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,741
Thanks for the beer.

615
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:01,943
Thinking about Mac?

616
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:05,501
Yeah.

617
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,961
Seems like it'll be easier
for you

618
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,971
now that he's turned in his
resignation, don't you think?

619
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:10,213
I know what's easy.

620
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,691
And I know what's right.

621
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,091
The guy's given up 20 years

622
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:14,803
of his life

623
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:16,122
for that program.

624
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,230
And yet he's willing

625
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,162
to sacrifice his ego

626
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,403
and half his damn pension.

627
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,470
But I still have
to do what's right.

628
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:25,252
Right?

629
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:25,952
Right.

630
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,440
Coach! Coach! Coach!

631
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,452
I'll start talking
when y'all stop.

632
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,583
First of all, it's a damn shame
that we're here this morning.

633
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,463
We should be focusing
on tomorrow's game.

634
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,242
And I'll tell you what.
That's exactly

635
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:49,033
what we're gonna do
'cause Mac McGill is gonna stay

636
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,781
as offensive coordinator
of the Dillon Panthers.

637
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,082
That's it.
Thank you very much.

638
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,411
So I guess
this is it, huh?

639
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,031
I guess so.

640
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,281
You're really
gonna do it?

641
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,292
You're not gonna play?

642
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:07,743
Nope.

643
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:09,343
All right,
if you need to hear it,

644
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:10,293
I'll say it, Williams.

645
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:12,522
We need you, man.

646
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,770
We need our leader back.

647
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,372
You know this.

648
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:17,533
This team needs all of us.

649
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:21,172
As far as a leader goes,
why don't you look in the mirror?

650
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,281
You and I both know
I'm not a leader.

651
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,462
Didn't you hear anything
Mac McGill said, Rig?

652
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,010
You're white.

653
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,771
That means
you were born a leader.

654
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:31,793
All right.

655
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,030
All right.

656
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:39,112
That's everything.

657
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:41,733
- Baby, it's only two weeks.
- I know

658
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,240
I know, I know.

659
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,513
Why can't I take you again?

660
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,661
Because it's really

661
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:48,130
far out of the way, and I
don't want you driving at night.

662
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:48,813
And, uh,

663
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,661
it's a really big deal.

664
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:52,363
I just gotta focus.

665
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,511
Gotta get my head into it.

666
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,360
Let's go.

667
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,710
So you'll call me
when you get there?

668
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:04,383
Promise.

669
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:06,361
I'll call you every day,
okay?

670
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:09,430
Hey, whoa!

671
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,172
Oh, did I do that?

672
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:13,180
We gotta make like time
and cruise, huh?

673
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,963
I got several disreputable women
waiting for me in Austin.

674
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:18,623
- I love you.
- Catch you later, Miss Lyla.

675
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:19,253
I love you too.

676
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:21,020
What the hell is wrong
with you?

677
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,840
Hey,
what time is the movie at?

678
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:33,252
I think it's, like,

679
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,693
seven-ish or something.

680
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,682
You mind if we make a stop
at the, uh,

681
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,632
women with low
self-esteem palace?

682
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:41,792
My sister owes me
a bunch of cash.

683
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:44,752
Yeah, sure.
That's cool.

684
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,113
That son of a bitch grabs
my ass one more time,

685
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,403
I swear I'm gonna kick him
in the head.

686
00:23:58,655 --> 00:23:59,433
Excuse me, honey.

687
00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:11,331
Okay, so it's Landry again,

688
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:14,051
which means it's Matt and
it's the third time he's called.

689
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,073
All right, honey.
You gotta wait till the fifth call.

690
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:17,811
- Tyra.
- What?

691
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:18,832
I do like him.

692
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:21,990
Fine. Go head.
Answer it.

693
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,470
Do whatever you want.

694
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:24,773
Hello?

695
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,531
Uh, hey. Hi.

696
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:28,223
Um,

697
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:30,793
look, I really, uh...

698
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,603
I really need to talk to you...

699
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:33,783
in person.

700
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:36,363
Amber, did you take
my baby oil again?

701
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:38,540
Where are you?

702
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,852
Uh, I'm at the Landing Strip.

703
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,332
Uh, it's that strip club.

704
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:45,901
Tyra had to pick up something
from her sister.

705
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:46,900
What did she just say?

706
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:49,142
She said Landing Strip?

707
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,520
Look, can I just come by

708
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:53,860
and meet you?
'Cause I really need to talk to you.

709
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:56,983
Okay.

710
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:59,121
This Mac McGill mess?

711
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,690
It's over. It's done.
You hear me?

712
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,470
No, no,
it can't be done.

713
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,161
I started all this.

714
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,061
I'm up to my neck in it,
but it's my fight.

715
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:09,163
Plus, everybody taken
their cues all from me.

716
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:11,391
Look, I gotta stand firm
and be their leader.

717
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,563
You quitting football

718
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,582
to try and make a
point about racism

719
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:16,973
in a small Texas town,

720
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:18,820
that ain't
the million-man march.

721
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,631
You are 17, and you got

722
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,003
a brilliant future ahead of you.

723
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,250
And I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you throw it away

724
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,983
trying to teach a lesson
to a bunch of fools.

725
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:31,062
You know how you get back at people
that think like Mac McGill?

726
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,362
You get back
on that team.

727
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,222
You play like the star
that you are.

728
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,211
And you get recruited
by an A-list university.

729
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,851
Go on and get your degree.

730
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,181
Now you get up from here,

731
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:45,313
get you something to eat,

732
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:48,302
and get your butt into bed 'cause
you going to that game tomorrow.

733
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:50,970
What about everybody who said
they weren't gonna play?

734
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:52,792
You a leader, honey.

735
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:54,301
They'll follow you.

736
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:06,082
Ok, Matt, first off,

737
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:09,031
you gotta act like you been
to just a million strip clubs.

738
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:11,412
Like, see, her? Like, naked ladies?
That's no big deal.

739
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,582
Look, Landry.

740
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:13,653
I just wanna get in here

741
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:14,540
and then get outta here.

742
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,531
And secondly,

743
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:17,182
look 'em in the eyes,

744
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:19,583
not in the rack.
That's a huge mistake.

745
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:21,593
Hey.

746
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:22,851
Uh, hey.

747
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:24,940
Hey, Tyra.

748
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:26,070
How's it going?

749
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:28,040
What?

750
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,550
Just wondering if I could maybe
buy you a drink.

751
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,393
- Strawberry Daiquiri, or--
- No.

752
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:34,753
Took you long enough.

753
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,703
What, every song have
to be a ballad?

754
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:40,190
What'd I tell you about
bringing your friends in here?

755
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:43,043
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about this.

756
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:44,353
Could I get some singles?

757
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:45,751
What do you want singles for?

758
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:47,670
I mean, for tips, Matt.

759
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:50,123
These women are out here
working hard.  Right?

760
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,431
Were you just--
Were you born in a barn, Matt?

761
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:53,612
Okay, just go.
Just go.

762
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:54,832
You want any nachos?

763
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,453
- No.
- They're two bucks.

764
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:01,812
All right, look.

765
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,413
I got a lot of stuff

766
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,892
that I really wanna talk
to you about.

767
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:06,932
I know, and I wanna
talk to you too.

768
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:08,593
Good.

769
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,001
'Cause there's something
I really wanna give you.

770
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,642
- And it's kinda--
- Can we just wait?

771
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:14,751
It's just kinda gross
and depressing here.

772
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:15,480
All right, y'all.

773
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,501
I'm ready to go.

774
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:17,470
You done?

775
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

776
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:21,350
Wait.
Where's the other one?

777
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:38,263
Have I seen you here before?

778
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:38,800
Maybe.

779
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:42,212
I'm Agent Thomas.

780
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,083
Do you have I.D. on you?

781
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,222
Tyra Collette,

782
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:52,460
Landry Clarke,

783
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,542
Matt Saracen.

784
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:54,532
Your parents are here.

785
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:55,683
Wait, my grandma's here?

786
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,153
Mr. and Mrs. Clarke
vouched for you.

787
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,060
They'll take you home.

788
00:27:58,565 --> 00:27:59,632
But what about me?

789
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,502
Just these three.

790
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:01,041
Let's go!

791
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,250
Then I'll just wait here.

792
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,131
Not an option!

793
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:04,163
Let's go--move it!

794
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,473
Thank you
for your expediency.

795
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,700
Just go.
I'll be fine.

796
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:09,633
Will you call me later?

797
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,173
- Move, people! Let's go!
- I'll call you.

798
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:26,403
How long
we gonna sit out here?

799
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,033
A little bit longer.

800
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,650
All the other parents
have picked up their perps.

801
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:29,862
Why can't we pick up ours?

802
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,600
Because I would like our perp
to sit in there and think

803
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:33,881
for a minute about what
she's doing sitting in there.

804
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:47,800
Look, any time you guys
wanna say something, that'd be great.

805
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,790
Oh, really? Is that the way
you wanna start the conversation?

806
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:51,042
You really wanna know
what I have to say?

807
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,222
You're grounded,
for starters.

808
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:53,063
Fine.
Whatever.

809
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,061
"Fine. Whatever"?

810
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:57,752
What the hell were you doing
at a strip club, Julie?

811
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:58,912
We were waiting
for Mindy.

812
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,140
You were waiting
for Mindy.

813
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:01,601
- Tyra's sister.
- Tyra's sister?

814
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,891
- She works there.
- Of course it's Tyra's sister.

815
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:03,943
Of course she works there.

816
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:04,970
You are so totally
judgmental

817
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:06,070
about anything to do
with Tyra.

818
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:07,432
Yeah, you know what?
I am judgmental.

819
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:08,763
I am judgmental about a woman

820
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,181
who takes her clothes off
for a living.

821
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:12,101
And as a result,
my daughter is not allowed

822
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:12,982
to hang out in strip clubs.

823
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,523
No, we weren't hanging out
at the strip club!

824
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,451
Tyra had to go get money
that Mindy owed her.

825
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,620
Honey, do you have anything
to say about this situation?

826
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:20,953
Yeah, first of all,
it's important that you're okay.

827
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:23,063
She's not okay!
She just spent

828
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,152
the entire evening
watching Mindy

829
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,231
make an honest living--

830
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:27,450
All right, then!
You talk to her!

831
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,081
She's not okay, Eric!

832
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,120
I told you what happened.

833
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,732
And we were hanging out
at the strip club.

834
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,152
But you're too busy looking down

835
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,260
from your ivory tower

836
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:33,913
at Tyra's family.

837
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:34,881
You wanna see what it looks like
from my ivory tower?!

838
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:36,342
From my ivory tower, girl,

839
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,452
you're not hanging out
with Tyra Collette anymore!

840
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:39,892
You can't punish me
like that.

841
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,022
That is not a punishment.
That is a rule.

842
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:41,860
Whatever.
You know what, good night.

843
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,301
"Whatever"?

844
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:46,522
Nice input.

845
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:56,841
Make sure you got your bags.

846
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,353
Everybody get your bags.

847
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,271
Honey.

848
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,271
Turn around.

849
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:09,820
Turn around.

850
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:41,660
Got any more room
on that bus?

851
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,411
- Listen, son--
- No, you listen.

852
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,451
I'm here,
but that don't change a thing.

853
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,372
I know who you are.

854
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,921
Welcome to Dunston Valley, Folks.

855
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,943
The second round of the Texas

856
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,302
High School
Championship play-offs.

857
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:03,923
These Cardinals were not
expecting Smash Williams

858
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,423
and the other Dillon players
that have gone MIA

859
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:07,721
to be here tonight.

860
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:09,261
But here they are.

861
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:10,991
These Dunston Valley guys

862
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:13,370
have a nasty reputation
for getting it done

863
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,370
any way they can.

864
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:15,583
Hey, Williams.
You made it.

865
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,172
You're gonna wish
you stayed home.

866
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,812
We gonna see about that.
We gonna see about that.

867
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:22,510
Come on, 7. Come on.

868
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,723
Come on, baby!

869
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,060
All right, gentlemen.

870
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,183
Listen up, listen up!

871
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,180
Let's take it right to 'em.

872
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:28,520
Let's a have
a good clean game now.

873
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,872
Let's have some fun.
What do you say?

874
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:45,890
Set!

875
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,691
Green, 20!

876
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:49,802
Green...20!
Hut!

877
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:52,920
Smash cuts through the defense

878
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,012
to run up the middle.

879
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,171
Oh! And a big hit.

880
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,072
Oh, man! We knew this was
gonna be a physical game,

881
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,883
and the Cardinals aren't
wasting any time

882
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:07,000
bringing the smack.

883
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,901
They are getting it on
right now.

884
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,393
The Panthers though
are no stranger

885
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:12,810
to hard-hitting
and head-knocking, folks.

886
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:13,863
I'll tell you that.

887
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:15,753
Black, ten!

888
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:16,630
Hut!

889
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:18,572
Saracen opens to his left.

890
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:20,401
It's a swing pass to Smash.

891
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,110
The 40, the 35!

892
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:29,950
And it is touchdown!
Williams!

893
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:32,183
Touchdown, Smash Williams.

894
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:35,612
And just like that,
Dillon takes the lead.

895
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,912
Put up or shut up,
baby!

896
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,160
Put up or shut up!

897
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,972
Defense!

898
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,531
Defense!

899
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,071
Defense!

900
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:46,582
Defense!

901
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,102
Defense!

902
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:49,451
Defense!

903
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:51,172
Tailback cuts off tackle.

904
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,400
He cut's inside.

905
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,411
Oh! And he goes down hard.

906
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:56,590
We keep the clock running!

907
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:57,661
We move the chains.

908
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:58,931
That's all we gotta do.
Move the chains.

909
00:33:58,956 --> 00:33:59,821
Give it to Smash.

910
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:01,062
He can run with the ball.

911
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:02,450
All right?
Let's get it going?

912
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:07,622
Touchdown! Touchdown!

913
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:11,082
And Dunston Valley
ties this game up.

914
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:12,941
Let's go to work, all right?

915
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:14,020
Let's go to work!

916
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:16,170
Saracen drops back.

917
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:17,880
He's got Smash on the outside!

918
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,663
- How can you not see that?!
- No foul.

919
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:24,351
How can you not see that?!

920
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,470
And that is another no-call.

921
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:29,012
And the Panthers can't seem
to get a break tonight.

922
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,523
Smash Williams
off to the left.

923
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,972
He's got some space.
He picks up a nice block.

924
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:38,603
Face mask! Face mask!

925
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,903
How can you not see that?

926
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:41,741
Off the field, Coach.
Off the field, Coach!

927
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:43,920
How can you not know that?

928
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,983
What you looking at?
Face mask!

929
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:47,582
I've heard of letting
them play, folks,

930
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:50,583
but this is starting
to get out of hand real fast.

931
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:52,851
Come here! Smash! Smash!

932
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:54,293
Smash, get over here!

933
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:54,973
Get over here!

934
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,843
Listen to me.
I see what's going on.

935
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:58,991
Do not let them get in your head.
You understand me?

936
00:34:59,048 --> 00:34:59,511
Yes, sir.

937
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:00,660
Play your own game.
Look at me.

938
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:02,292
- Play your own game, son.
- Yes, sir.

939
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:03,050
Get in there.

940
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:04,942
Come on!
Let's go!

941
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,943
Come on, Brian!

942
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:08,910
Early in the fourth quarter.

943
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:11,461
This has been
a real see-saw battle, folks.

944
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:14,030
Dillon with the ball,
up by four,

945
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,510
with a chance to put this thing
out of reach right now.

946
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,162
Black, ten!
Hut!

947
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:20,743
It's a drop play
to Smash.

948
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:22,430
He's got some room
up the middle.

949
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,510
Oh, he breaks a tackle!

950
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:27,053
He's inside the ten!

951
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,261
He's gonna score!

952
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,901
Touchdown!
Touchdown Panthers!

953
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:34,233
Oh!
And Smash is absolutely

954
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:36,500
drilled in the in the end zone
in one of the latest

955
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,010
hits I've ever seen.

956
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:39,752
Oh, you like that?
You like that?

957
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:43,912
Next time,
I'm gonna break you in half.

958
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:45,623
You hear me,
you lazy-ass, tall baby?

959
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,162
- Hey, what'd you say?
- You hear me say it once?

960
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,421
You ain't got nothing!

961
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:49,531
You ain't got nothing!

962
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:52,282
Oh, Tim Riggins just leveled

963
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:53,582
the Cardinal linebacker.

964
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:59,020
Holy cow, this thing
is getting out of hand.

965
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,352
And it's an all-out brawl
on the field.

966
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:32,052
Jack Langer with
the athletic board.

967
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:33,970
It's going crazy out there.
I'm calling the game.

968
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:35,502
- Dillon wins.
- No!

969
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,222
Coach, you don't go in there!
You stay!

970
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:39,281
You stay and play!
You stay!

971
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:40,560
Coach, coach!
I gave the call.

972
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,043
No, we're playing this game!

973
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:43,180
We're playing this game!

974
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:44,393
This is our field!

975
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:45,433
We're playing!

976
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,582
This is not who we are.

977
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,000
This is not what we represent.

978
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:57,743
I don't teach that crap.

979
00:36:57,786 --> 00:36:59,632
These coaches don't teach
that crap.

980
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,762
Y'all are gonna take
responsibility

981
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,601
for your actions.
I guarantee it!

982
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:06,082
Does that mean we're done?
Are we out of the play-offs?

983
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:08,813
UIL considers
three full quarters

984
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,523
a complete game.

985
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,163
We were ahead at that time,
so we get the win.

986
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:14,863
But that is no damn reason

987
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:16,020
for celebration!

988
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:19,033
So wipe those smiles
off your faces, dammit!

989
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:21,352
What I want you to do
right now

990
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,893
is I want you to gather up
your gear.

991
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:25,391
There's no changing.

992
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:26,543
Go get on the bus.

993
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:27,783
We're getting the hell
outta here.

994
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,010
Let's go.
Right now!

995
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:14,183
All right, just sit down
and shut up.

996
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,261
Calm down.

997
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:27,512
What's the problem, Officer?

998
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,871
I'm gonna need the two of you
to step in front of the bus here for me.

999
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:37,841
Right over here, please.

1000
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:39,412
Nobody step foot
off this bus.

1001
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:40,992
What can we do for you?

1002
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:42,453
We're looking for one
of your players.

1003
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:43,722
One of my players?

1004
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:45,022
Smash Williams, Coach.

1005
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:46,611
There's a whole lot
of witness saying

1006
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:47,510
he threw the first punch.

1007
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,393
Now we got an aggravated
assault complaint,

1008
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:50,912
and we are bringing him in
for questioning.

1009
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:52,561
You're telling me that you're
gonna blame one of my players

1010
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:53,803
for what happened
on that field tonight?

1011
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:54,750
This is police business,
Coach.

1012
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:56,121
This ain't got noting to do
about football.

1013
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:57,512
Now you go on there

1014
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:58,872
and get that boy right now.

1015
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:01,231
Or we will go in there
and drag him out ourselves.

1016
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,572
It's your call.

1017
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:07,972
Well, here's my call.

1018
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,370
You got a warrant,
Officer?

1019
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:12,113
'Cause if you don't got
a warrant,

1020
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,060
we all know that you ain't
gonna get on this bus.

1021
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,592
- I can go get a warrant.
- That's fine.

1022
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:23,291
We got all night.

1023
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,141
We'll get you next year,
Coach.

1024
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:05,320
Let's go.

1025
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:35,260
10:00.
See ya at film.

1026
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:39,052
I'll be there, Coach.

1027
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:54,061
Hey, Mac.

1028
00:40:56,618 --> 00:40:57,992
What happened back there
with those cops?

1029
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,210
They made a mistake, son...

1030
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:04,760
just like I did.

1031
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,323
I'll see you
at practice Monday.

1032
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:36,423
Can I, uh--

1033
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:41,983
It's, um--

1034
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:45,172
I was really worried
about you on that field.

1035
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,161
You don't need
to worry about me.

1036
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,721
In a fight, I just kinda stand
in the back

1037
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:51,512
and just yell stuff.

1038
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:55,141
Uh, I got this for you.

1039
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:04,631
It's beautiful.
It's my birthstone.

1040
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:09,490
Look, we kinda been
going out for a while,

1041
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:12,350
but we never really
made it official.

1042
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,430
Will you be my girlfriend?
