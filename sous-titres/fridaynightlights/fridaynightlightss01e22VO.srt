1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,025
Did you ever think
about coaching?

2
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:07,129
Lyla,
it's not what you think.

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,570
- It really isn't.
- You know what?

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:09,889
I'm done.

5
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:11,622
I know you're upset,
but I really need--

6
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:13,104
I'm not upset.
Please don't come back.

7
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:14,638
I just woke up
with the worst feeling

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,849
that we shouldn't move
to Austin.

9
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,238
When you go into TMU today,

10
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:18,810
please just don't commit
to them.

11
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,033
We've gotta know something

12
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:21,539
and we've gotta know it now.

13
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:22,804
Gentlemen, I accept.

14
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:23,713
I'm moving.

15
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:24,803
What do you mean?

16
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:27,383
My dad took this job
at TMU.

17
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm not going
to Austin.

18
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
Dillon is going to State!

19
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:33,052
State, baby!

20
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,330
We're going to State!

21
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:36,952
Let's go, Panthers!

22
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,890
Let's go, Panthers!

23
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:40,670
I said, let's go, Panthers!

24
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,651
Let's go, Panthers!

25
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:43,780
All right,
give it up for yourselves.

26
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,120
Give it up for yourselves.

27
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,581
Look, hey talk to 'em, Matt.

28
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,650
I mean, I just--
I got nothing but respect

29
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:58,691
for Voodoo and that whole team.

30
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,561
No, no, no, no.

31
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,463
We gonna shut Ray Tatom down.

32
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:03,060
You want destiny,
Voodoo?

33
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:04,303
We gonna give you destiny.

34
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,070
Saturday, Dallas.

35
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,510
Lyla, honey,

36
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:11,650
I need to talk to you.

37
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:12,453
Lyla.

38
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,763
Lyla, please.
I need to talk to you, honey.

39
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,580
It's

40
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:20,701
just good to be a part of
the team again and...

41
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:23,361
it feels like
I've come full circle.

42
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:28,720
Hey, Landry.

43
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:30,312
Hey.

44
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,803
So it's good to see
that you're

45
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,330
out of the house
and everything.

46
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,820
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

47
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,292
Well, I mean,
I just meant--

48
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,541
Look, it goes
against my basic principle

49
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,492
to go to this game.

50
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:41,792
But, um...

51
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:43,682
Tim gave me
his players' tickets

52
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,700
and it seemed pretty important
to him that I go.

53
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:46,672
So...

54
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:49,600
you wanna drive with me
to State?

55
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:51,592
I mean, the seats are
on the 50-yard line.

56
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,393
So I mean,
it might be fun.

57
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,532
Okay, so just go
with you...

58
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:57,920
to Dallas?

59
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,372
Yeah.

60
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:01,863
Yeah, sure.

61
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,000
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

62
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:05,132
All right.

63
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:06,270
See ya later then.

64
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:07,263
Okay.

65
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,071
And then I'm working
on my mom.

66
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,503
Maybe she'll let me stay
in August

67
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,280
at either Tyra's
or Lois' or--

68
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,743
I'd-I'd try for Lois.

69
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,532
And then we have Christmas.

70
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:25,523
And we have Thanksgiving.

71
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,250
We'll make it work,
okay?

72
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:29,560
Hey!

73
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:34,543
You all right?

74
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,140
Yeah.

75
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:39,383
Have you seen your mother?
She's supposed to be here.

76
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,060
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry

77
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,123
I couldn't be there.
I had to get that press release out.

78
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:45,840
The stupid computer
broke down again.

79
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,621
Well, that's 'cause you push
the wrong button

80
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,690
on the thing
every time.

81
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:49,400
I know.

82
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:50,491
You know what?
I'm on my way there.

83
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,301
I'm so sorry.

84
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,030
All right.

85
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:53,983
Okay.

86
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,140
Honey, I gotta go.
I'll see ya soon.

87
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:55,723
Bye.

88
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,040
Hi.

89
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,171
Could I have
a pregnancy test?

90
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:18,200
Honey, we are just
extremely busy today.

91
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,043
I see that.
I know.

92
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,710
How--how's next Tuesday?

93
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,770
It's just,
I'm six days late already.

94
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,040
And I--I'm never late.

95
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:28,573
I'm like kind of
a Rolex watch like that.

96
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:29,970
And I ate fish tacos
on Monday night

97
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:30,913
that kind of disagreed
with me.

98
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,921
It could just be the tacos
kinda rumbling around in there.

99
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:34,010
But I just wanna make sure

100
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,401
if it's that
and not something else.

101
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,031
You know, they do have
home pregnancy tests.

102
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:38,452
I know,
but I haven't been home.

103
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,642
I'm going to Dallas.

104
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:40,901
I can't--I can't wait.

105
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,263
I just feel like
I need to know now

106
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,583
if--if that's possible.

107
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,263
Hey!

108
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,681
- How are you?
- I'm good.

109
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,841
I can take care of you.

110
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:50,060
- Oh, that'd be great.
- Come on.

111
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,462
Thanks.
Thanks.

112
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:52,463
I appreciate that.

113
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,510
How pregnant
do you wanna be?

114
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,021
'Cause you extremely
pregnant.

115
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:03,550
Hmm. Okay.

116
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,912
Well, do you wanna be
pregnant, honey?

117
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,433
Do I wanna be--
I don't know.

118
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,681
I wanna be pregnant?
I don't--

119
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,512
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I mean...

120
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:14,951
did you plan this?

121
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:17,460
I mean, we planned it like

122
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,931
13 years ago,ou know.

123
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,803
And then 12 years ago,
and 11 years ago,

124
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,063
and then ten years ago.

125
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,303
And we have
our beautiful girl.

126
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:26,091
We figured, well,

127
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,832
that's what we have.
And maybe

128
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:30,942
having another one just wasn't
in God's plan, you know?

129
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,181
Looks like
God changed his mind.

134
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,790
I just don't understand
why we can't just

135
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,331
put Grandma
in the back of your car.

136
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,753
Hey, can, uh,

137
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,280
can you come over here
and try this?

138
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,540
That's all you need.

139
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:34,952
- Okay.
- Well?

140
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:36,450
Well what?

141
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,700
The cocoa bean
and the chocolate,

142
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,741
among many other things,
is a known aphrodisiac.

143
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,800
The point is Tyra

144
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,143
and yours truly

145
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,929
are going to be driving
in a car

146
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,924
alone for four straight hours.

147
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,391
I'm gonna be playing
some sexy Crucifictorious

148
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,513
and we're gonna be eating
on these very fine,

149
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:53,421
delicate,

150
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:54,710
erotic chocolates.

151
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,713
And this is--this may be
the single most

152
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:57,630
defining moment of my life.

153
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,852
So you may need to tell your grandma
to take the damn bus.

154
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:09,432
Hey.

155
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:10,883
Tim, I thought
we weren't gonna--

156
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:11,843
No, I know.

157
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:13,632
It's not what you think.

158
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:14,993
Look...

159
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,493
these are my State tickets.

160
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:19,432
And I want Bo
to have these.

161
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:21,090
You're at 50-yard line.

162
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:22,642
And they're good seats.

163
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:23,963
And I think
he'd enjoy it.

164
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,192
They're for Bo?

165
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,213
They're for Bo.

166
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,781
So here.

167
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,832
Take 'em.

168
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:31,151
No pressure.

169
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,311
If--if you don't go,
that's--that's fine too.

170
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,551
I mean, you can sell 'em
on eBay or something for--

171
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:38,521
get him a PSP
or whatever he's playing now.

172
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,083
All right.
That's it.

173
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,253
Say hi to him for me,
okay?

174
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,690
Enjoy it.

175
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:47,661
Who is that?

176
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:48,841
It's me.

177
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:49,592
What's up?

178
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,741
Listen,
I wanna ask you a question

179
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:51,790
- before I go.
- Shoot.

180
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:56,382
Did you tell Matt Saracen
I took that job at TMU?

181
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:58,163
No.

182
00:06:58,577 --> 00:06:59,350
You're sure.

183
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:00,012
Yeah.

184
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:03,470
You're sure
you're sure?

185
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:07,501
- Okay, well, I had to.
- Dammit, Julie. What did I tell you?

186
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:09,021
What's going on?

187
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,992
I'll tell you
what's happening right now.

188
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,022
Your daughter,
in all her infinite wisdom,

189
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,640
has informed Matt Saracen

190
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,131
that I took the job at TMU.

191
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,490
That's what's going on
right now.

192
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:18,692
- It's not my problem.
- Jules!

193
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:19,520
What?!

194
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,261
Hey, it's nice to see you.
How are you doing today?

195
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,492
Well, honey, no.

196
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:24,472
I mean, I'm sorry.

197
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,933
I had--I had a number of things
that I had to do.

198
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:28,541
Oh, yeah?
I had a number of things to do too.

199
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,550
I wanted to talk to you
this morning.

200
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,223
I tried to talk to you
this afternoon.

201
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,553
I'm trying to talk
to you now.

202
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:33,911
But, oh, gosh!
You know what?

203
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,500
It's time for me
to catch a bus.

204
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,542
So I really can't do
any talking right now

205
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:38,773
'cause I gotta get
outta here.

206
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,283
Honey, I need to talk to you
just for a brief moment

207
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,063
before you leave
for Dallas, please.

208
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:45,670
Go ahead.

209
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:47,282
What is it?

210
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:48,982
I'm all ears.

211
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,692
- I gotta catch a bus.
- I know.

212
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:54,353
- You know what? It can wait.
- I got a bus to catch.

213
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,283
I'll talk to you
in Dallas.

214
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:57,513
- I love you.
- I hope you have a great trip.

215
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,142
- Bye.
- All right.

216
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,571
Let's go Panthers!

217
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:09,613
Let's go Panthers!

218
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,670
Let's go Panthers!

219
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:15,783
Hey.

220
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:16,863
What's up?

221
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,192
What do you mean, what's up?
Where's my tickets?

222
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:21,842
What do you mean, where's
your tickets? I gave 'em away.

223
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:23,321
I can't believe
you'd do that.

224
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:26,290
You don't even like football
anyways.

225
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:27,700
Well, I know that.

226
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:28,961
But it was nice to,
you know,

227
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,890
have somebody offer me
the good seats for once.

228
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:32,960
You know what?
Forget it, Tim!

229
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,010
No, wait. Hey, hey, hey!
Come here!

230
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:36,832
Gimme one second.

231
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,612
Hey, look.
Four.

232
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,063
Four where?

233
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:40,901
Four tickets.

234
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:41,502
Where?

235
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,242
Those are nosebleeds.

236
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,311
I'll see ya there?

237
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:55,862
Matt.

238
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:56,771
Come here.

239
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:06,020
I know
Julie talked to you.

240
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,171
I-I don't wanna talk
about it, sir.

241
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:09,901
You don't wanna talk
about it.

242
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,881
No, I'd rather just think
about football.

243
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:14,442
Sir.

244
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:17,070
All right.

245
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,120
Hey, Mindy.

246
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:28,692
How's the stripping going?

247
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,800
Momma, let's go!
Our ride's here.

248
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,202
Oh, hey.

249
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,151
Um, I'm probably gonna be riding
up front with you

250
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,680
'cause I get
a little carsick, okay?

251
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:38,622
Grab this one.

252
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,062
There's another one over there.

253
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,951
It turns out
that I got four tickets

254
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,283
instead of two.
So I hope you don't mind

255
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,193
that my mom and sis tag along.

256
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:47,741
There's more--
more bags inside.

257
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,070
Okay, that's no problem.

258
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:54,553
Hurry up!

259
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,010
Oh, God!

260
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,132
These are incredible! Mm!

261
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,021
Have you tried these?

262
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:09,562
I have. I'm really glad that
you're enjoying 'em though.

263
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:10,952
I don't know
what's in these, but...

264
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,442
I just feel sort of tingly
all over.

265
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,733
I'm a little
premenstrual too, so--

266
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,370
I know I'm hogging them,
everybody, but that's all right.

267
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,743
I'll pass it around
in a minute.

268
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,980
Is that Mrs.--
Is that Mrs. Saracen?

269
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,573
- What are you doing?
- Hold on.

270
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:29,273
Mrs. Saracen,
you need a ride?

271
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,430
That's mighty nice of you.
Do y'all got room for me?

272
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,400
Hey, Lorraine.

273
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:35,110
Oh, my Lord!

274
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,380
Is that Tyra?

275
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:37,221
It sure is.

276
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:38,932
Did you bring the booze?

277
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,772
Tomorrow, every seat in this stadium's
gonna be filled up.

278
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,522
It's what
we've been waiting for.

279
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,010
I've what
we've worked so hard for.

280
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:07,241
Does it get better
than this?

281
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:08,660
No, sir.

282
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,660
Ah, hell. I don't think it does.
Soak it in.

283
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:20,123
Listen up.

284
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:21,992
Stay inside yourselves.

285
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:23,760
We can beat these guys.

286
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:29,281
I take Matt Saracen over Ray "Voodoo"
Tatom any day of the week.

287
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:30,240
Matt Saracen?

288
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,052
Yeah, I know him.

289
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,602
I know everything there is
about him.

290
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:34,441
Honestly,
there's not much to him.

291
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,492
Well, I didn't really know
Voodoo that well.

292
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,533
He only played one game
for us.

293
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,210
So I didn't have that much time
to get to know him.

294
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,430
My defensive line is gonna
squash him like a moth...

295
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:43,782
like a flea.

296
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,770
Voodoo's flashy,
but anybody could be flashy.

297
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:46,873
You know, Matt Saracen,

298
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:48,333
he's got a lotta heart,
and he's--he's creative.

299
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,692
And when he's done
getting squashed,

300
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,182
maybe he can sit on the sidelines
and watch me do my thing.

301
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,981
Maybe he can learn something.
It's football.

302
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:55,192
It's nothing personal.

303
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,971
But if you ask me
if it's gonna feel good

304
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,701
to put Ray "Voodoo" Tatom
in his place,

305
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:00,680
you're damn right
it will.

306
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,491
Well, it's a big
football game.

307
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,423
Big stadium,
a lotta pageantry.

308
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,200
Everything goes
as we hope,

309
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,691
we're gonna be taking
that trophy back

310
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:09,882
to Dillon to the fans.

311
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:11,790
It's been a tough year on them.
They deserve it.

312
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,133
So then how does it feel
to be leaving?

313
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:16,821
Excuse me?

314
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:20,913
Isn't it true you accepted the position
at, uh, TMU next season?

315
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,061
Well, no, right now,
we're just focusing on this game.

316
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:25,623
I'm sorry.
You didn't answer my question.

317
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,163
Isn't it true you took
the position next season at TMU?

318
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:33,730
Yes.

319
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,383
Yes, that is true.

320
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,291
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

321
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:46,402
Drive one of this to Dallas

322
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,831
to the game.
Just pick the color.

323
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,241
And if y'all do it today,

324
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,192
I'll give you a couple of 40-yard
line tickets to the State game.

325
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,201
Hold on just a second.

326
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,383
Y'all just think about a color.
I'll be right back with you.

327
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,590
I gotta take care of something.

328
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:57,490
Excuse me.

329
00:13:58,408 --> 00:13:59,281
Hey, baby.

330
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,430
I am so glad you came here.

331
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,702
I cannot believe how glad--

332
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:03,320
What's this?

333
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:04,930
The keys.
I don't want it.

334
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:05,680
What?

335
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,031
Here's the title.

336
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,272
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want it.

337
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,251
What do you mean you don't want it?
You need a car!

338
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,942
I got a car.
I got a used car from Crespo's.

339
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,892
You bought a car
from that rabid crook?

340
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:16,821
I liked him.

341
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,220
Lyla,
where are you going?

342
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:21,090
Where--honey,

343
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:22,142
you can't walk home.

344
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,203
At least let me give you
a ride home. Lyla!

345
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:29,452
Yeah, this must be
my day-ee-ay-ee-ay

346
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,741
You're a little bit
too late

347
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:35,300
And it's a little bit
too soon

348
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,630
And I'm a little bit
too strange

349
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,972
For somebody like you

350
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:42,682
'Cause you're a little bit
too nice

351
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:51,461
Gitchi, gitchi
ya, ya, da, da

352
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:55,423
Gitchi, gitchi
ya, ya, here

353
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:59,290
Ya, ya, ya.
Mocca chocolata ya, ya

354
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:04,412
Ya, ya.
Creole Lady Marmalade

355
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,282
Okay, okay, okay.
I think it's safer

356
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,093
if we just keep the radio off
for about ten minutes--

357
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,631
I think we just took a little detour
into the "no-fun" zone. Shoot.

358
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,971
We're gonna have to stop.
I forgot Tampaxes.

359
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,182
Anyone have one?

360
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:18,790
Don't look at me.

361
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:21,413
I had my last hot flash
in 1990.

362
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,091
Here you go.

363
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,570
Oh, wait a minute.
Did anybody fart?

364
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:30,782
I know I smelled something.

365
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,331
Who is that?
Is that Lyla Garrity?

366
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,872
Wait, Lyla Garrity,

367
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,451
daughter of the car king,

368
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,573
you know, stranded.

369
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:38,390
I like it.

370
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:40,591
Wait, why--

371
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:43,091
why are we backing up
right now?

372
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:44,260
What's going on?

373
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,190
I mean, I gotta stop.

374
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,531
It's the Christian thing
to do.

375
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:47,700
You've gotta be kidding me
right now.

376
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,132
-No.
- You know who that is?

377
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:50,503
You okay?

378
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:51,111
Yeah.

379
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,921
Hey, cheating cheerleader bitch.
You want a ride?

380
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, she doesn't want a ride.

381
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,313
That--that didn't sound
very Christian either.

382
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:58,791
Why are y'all laughing
about--

383
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,952
Let's just keep going.

384
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:00,863
Let's just drive.

385
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:02,960
Tyra, I'm not gonna just drive
away and leave her here.

386
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:03,873
Why not?
I don't--

387
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:04,731
I can't.

388
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,480
- Oh, because of the Christian thing.
- Yeah.

389
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,772
Would you please
just get out and talk to her?

390
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:11,872
Why don't you check
on her?

391
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,640
Well, she needs help,
sweetheart.

392
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,123
- You go on.
- I hate all of you.

393
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,840
- Please don't slam my door--
- Ah.

394
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,840
- Garrity, get in the damn car!
- No, thank you.

395
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:22,751
Garrity!

396
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,991
You know what?
Can I ask you something, Tyra?

397
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,710
- Fire away.
- Why do you hate me so much?

398
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:27,730
Oh, I don't know.
That's easy.

399
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,683
Maybe the fact
that your dad slept with my mom

400
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,463
and then tried to pay her off
with $700

401
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,203
or the fact that you slept
with my boyfriend.

402
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:34,101
- How about that?
- You know what?

403
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:35,572
My parents are getting
a divorce.

404
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:36,451
- I'm sorry
- So you weren't the only one

405
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,600
that was hurt by that, okay?

406
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,811
And you've been flirting with Jason
ever since freshman year.

407
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:40,500
That's what I do

408
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:41,592
That is who I am!

409
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:42,552
Everyone knows that.

410
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:43,723
I wasn't gonna do him.

411
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:44,881
And the thing
that happened with Riggins.

412
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,292
You guys were all ready
broken up.

413
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:49,473
Are you kidding me?

414
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,312
You know, I heard that
you and Jason Street

415
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:53,031
were having problems.

416
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:54,380
Maybe I should go sleep
with him.

417
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:00,603
I'm sorry.

418
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:01,840
Not accepted.

419
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:03,890
You know what?
You're a bitch!

420
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,201
Yeah, you know what?
I am.

421
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,160
But I don't accept it
'cause you didn't mean it.

422
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,302
You have no idea
how that felt.

423
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,661
Actually, you'll be glad to know
I know exactly how that felt.

424
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:20,832
And I'm sorry.

425
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:22,710
Wait.

426
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,493
Jason got
with someone else?

427
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:31,780
Well...

428
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:34,892
we have food.

429
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,583
It's French fries,
but it's something.

430
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,170
They're chocolates there.

431
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,881
- Be careful you don't squish 'em.
- Now can we go to Dallas?

432
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,212
Can you shut up?

433
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,012
I just... I want the commitment
that I can spend

434
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,920
at least four weeks
during the summer in Dillon.

435
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,722
Sweetie,
I've said to you already

436
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,452
I can't talk to you
about this right now.

437
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,053
Why can't we talk about it
right now?

438
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,302
No, no, no.

439
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,110
- My whole relationship with Matt--
- Honey, stop it!

440
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:00,470
You are talking to me
about something

441
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:01,532
that is six months away.

442
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:03,301
We have no idea
what will be happening

443
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:04,672
or where we'll be
in six months.

444
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,093
Right now, I'm just trying
to get us to Dallas

445
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,393
and through
this damn football game.

446
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:08,760
So just stop badgering me!

447
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,202
You don't have to yell.

448
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:14,570
Sorry.

449
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:20,442
Go get 'em.
Bring'em on

450
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:21,461
Coach.

451
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:24,542
Go get 'em tomorrow.

452
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,002
Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

453
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:27,931
Good to see y'all.

454
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:30,713
Coaches.

455
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,280
I heard y'all had some kinda
little game out here tomorrow.

456
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:35,723
Yes, we do!
Y'all ready?

457
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,223
- Yeah.
- Let's go get 'em.

458
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,081
Y'all mind
if I have just

459
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,611
a moment alone
with the coach?

460
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,081
Eric, you mind?

461
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,333
Let me tell you something
before you even start in.

462
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:54,082
When I first took
this job,

463
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:56,570
I took it with an idea
of a five-year commitment.

464
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,461
But when I sat down
with you and the boosters,

465
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,970
I never heard
any similar commitment

466
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,240
come from the other side.

467
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,661
Matter of fact,
all I heard was,

468
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,251
after we lost the second game
of the year,

469
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:06,201
is that my ass was about
to be fired.

470
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,523
I just wanna make that
real clear right now.

471
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,471
So yes, I did put my career

472
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,840
ahead of Panther football.

473
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,091
Eric, I just came by to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you.

474
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:18,753
You're a fine
football coach.

475
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,752
That's what I came
to tell you.

476
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,342
And now, everybody...

477
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:30,581
it's my pleasure
to introduce the man

478
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:32,641
who has taken this team
to State this year--

479
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:36,160
his first year as the head coach
of the Dillon Panthers:

480
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:37,680
my friend...

481
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:39,252
Eric Taylor!

482
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,002
I'm gonna
cut through the crap.

483
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,730
I believe I know what you all
are thinking right now.

484
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,122
Y'all are thinking,

485
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,081
"Coach is a bastard
for taking this job."

486
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,431
I would say to that,

487
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:07,642
that y'all have dreams.

488
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,413
A lot of you have dreams
to play college ball,

489
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,371
pro ball.

490
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,332
There is nothing
more important to me

491
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:16,650
than to help you
achieve those dreams.

492
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,583
I promise you that.

493
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:20,862
I have dreams too.

494
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,301
This has long been
a dream of mine

495
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,802
to coach
a Division One school,

496
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,073
like TMU.

497
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,870
Whatever it is
you're feeling,

498
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:34,893
I don't blame you.

499
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:37,912
It is all pretty raw.

500
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,882
You may not
accept it now.

501
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,811
But I pray
one day you will.

502
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:47,930
I don't like the press.

503
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,703
I never have.

504
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,221
Shoulda been
done different.

505
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,310
I apologize it wasn't.

506
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:17,123
Let's go get State!
Come on, let's go get State!

507
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,713
Panthers!
Panthers!

508
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:21,441
Panthers!
Panthers!

509
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,071
Panthers!
Panthers!

510
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,700
Panthers!
Panthers!

511
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,203
Panthers!
Panthers!

512
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,640
Panthers!
Panthers!

513
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:29,072
Panthers!
Panthers!

514
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,472
Panthers!
Panthers!

515
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:31,320
Panthers!

516
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:32,841
The timing
of the shocking news

517
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:35,072
of Coach Taylor's exit
from Dillon football

518
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,040
couldn't be worse.

519
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,481
Pretty pathetic,
if you ask me, gentlemen.

520
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,302
That's right, man.
How many "all for one"

521
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:41,702
speeches
has he given us?

522
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,112
I mean, one year
and he's out?

523
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,090
Look, everyone
settle down.

524
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:45,162
Stop being babies, okay?

525
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,610
He got an offer to TMU.

526
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:47,930
If any of you
got an offer to TMU,

527
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:48,732
you'd be gone
in a heartbeat.

528
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:49,621
Street's right.

529
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:51,232
Look, forget about Coach.

530
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:52,322
He earned it.

531
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,603
It's up to us now.

532
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:56,130
Who do we have here gentlemen?

533
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,430
Long time, boys.

534
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:02,663
Look who it is.

535
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,033
Yo, Smash,
can we talk a sec?

536
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:14,511
Hey look, trash talk
before the game

537
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:15,712
is a sign of weakness.

538
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:17,260
Look, I ain't here
to trash talk.

539
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,411
I been watching
your game tapes, Smash.

540
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,992
Now you the best damn back
in the state of Texas,

541
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:23,041
probably the country.

542
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:26,113
Next year, come play with me
at West Cam.

543
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,710
A'ight, me and you
together,

544
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:31,612
that would be like nothing
this state has ever seen.

545
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,123
Every college in the country
will want you.

546
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:37,051
At West Cambria, look,
they'll set you up real good.

547
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,631
I got a nice place.

548
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,010
Got a swimming pool.

549
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:41,742
I got a dishwasher.

550
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:43,712
It's nice.

551
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,782
They don't treat us like
second class citizens, a'ight?

552
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,022
They take care of us.

553
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,381
I'm a Panther.

554
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,992
It's just
a uniform, Smash.

555
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,780
Look at your coach,
I don't see him sticking around.

556
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:10,792
I mean, he's basically leaving
just to wear some stupid...

557
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,673
red and gold shirt
and be

558
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,221
a quarterback coach.

559
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,650
And we're just, like,
another stop along the way

560
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,251
for him.

561
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,102
I understand
how you feel, but

562
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,422
all my dad ever does
is think about the team.

563
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,991
He's always
watching game tapes

564
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:28,101
and having
endless conversations

565
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,671
with my mom about you

566
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,052
and Smash and Riggins.

567
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,211
He's always

568
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:35,322
analyzing and strategizing
and planning.

569
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,223
It's his
whole life, Matt.

570
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,670
Yeah, then why
is he leaving?

571
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,140
I don't know.

572
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:48,702
Sir?

573
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:54,113
What are you doing up?
It's past bed check.

574
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,451
I was with your daughter.

575
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,021
I understand
if you're pissed at me.

576
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,103
'Cause I took the job.

577
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,331
That I won't be here
next season.

578
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,782
That I'm taking
Julie away.

579
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,312
All I can say
is I'm sorry.

580
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:19,601
But let me tell you this.
And don't forget what I say.

581
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:21,112
If you're ever...

582
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:24,672
lucky to have a family

583
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,120
like I do,

584
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,872
I promise you,
you will understand.

585
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:35,520
I'll see you
at the game.

586
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:47,441
Hey, hon.

587
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:48,752
Hey.

588
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,022
Honey, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it

589
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,363
to that booster dinner,
I just couldn't do it tonight.

590
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:53,493
The Buddy Garrity
of it all.

591
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:54,680
- I just couldn't--
- It's okay.

592
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:56,732
You all right?

593
00:24:57,648 --> 00:24:58,713
Yeah. Hey.

594
00:24:58,966 --> 00:24:59,652
Chocolate?

595
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,463
No, thank you.

596
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,122
I'm just gonna--

597
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,760
talk to your dad
for a sec.

598
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,130
You all right, babe?

599
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:25,802
Mm-hmm.

600
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:26,790
I'm all right.

601
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,302
I saw that news came out.

602
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,553
Hell, I tried talking
to those kids.

603
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,761
The kids
don't understand.

604
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:37,823
You're a good man, babe.

605
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:40,053
Honey?

606
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:43,051
I gotta tell you something

607
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:45,300
that I've been meaning
to tell you all day

608
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:46,780
and I just haven't--

609
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:48,261
haven't been able to

610
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:49,092
and it's the worst--

611
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,983
worst timing
and I'm sorry about that.

612
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,280
And we haven't talked
about this in a long time

613
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,282
and just don't know
how you're gonna take it.

614
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:00,801
I'm pregnant.

615
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:03,670
What'd you say?

616
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:06,961
I said
I'm pregnant.

617
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:08,642
You're pregnant?

618
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:11,743
Yeah.

619
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,800
You're pregnant, like,
you're gonna have a baby, pregnant?

620
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:27,402
Look me in the eye
and tell me that.

621
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,702
Don't kidding me.

622
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,190
We're gonna
have a baby, honey.

623
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:32,892
You look a little peaked.

624
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:41,040
Come here.

625
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:44,513
Come here.

626
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:47,791
Oh.

627
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:50,613
Oh.

628
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,120
I love you.

629
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,113
I love you.

630
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,023
Babe.

631
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

632
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,050
please welcome
to the Texas State

633
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,500
Football Championship,

634
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:13,810
the Dillon Panthers.

635
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,791
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

636
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:21,940
The wait is over.
We are finally here!

637
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,543
Our Panthers have clawed
and scratched all season

638
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:28,490
and today's game
will not be any different

639
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,593
as rumors of Coach Taylor's
departure

640
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,232
have not been exaggerated.

641
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,201
Now let's see
how his leaving will affect

642
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:37,020
these young players
and his ability to lead

643
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:40,151
here in the biggest
football game of their lives.

644
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:43,061
I think the entire town
of Dillon is here.

645
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,310
The great state of Texas
is watching.

646
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,012
The two best teams
are in the house.

647
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:50,213
But like the man said,
"there can only be one."

648
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,173
Good seats.

649
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,063
Yeah well,
I've got connections.

650
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:56,442
Thank you.

651
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:57,642
All right, listen up.

652
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,891
Let's own this game from
the opening gun, gentlemen.

653
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:01,973
Understood?

654
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,593
- Yes sir!
- Let's go now!

655
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,633
Saracen opens right.

656
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:14,662
He throws. Oh!
And the ball comes up short.

657
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:18,693
Down he goes.
Saracen gets sacked

658
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:20,223
for an 11-yard loss.

659
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:21,163
Look for the slant!

660
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:24,633
Damn it, Matt!

661
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,772
Matt Saracen
and this Panther offense

662
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,892
are off to
a horrendous start.

663
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:32,691
Taylor has to be concerned.

664
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:34,433
His team has come out flat

665
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:36,921
against this ferocious
Mustang attack.

666
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,151
Voodoo opens right.

667
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:40,412
No, no, no!

668
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:42,420
He breaks the tackle!
He's gonna go in.

669
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,713
And touchdown.
Just like that

670
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:46,493
it is seven, zip.

671
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:48,011
Voodoo's back to pass.

672
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:51,260
He's got a man open!

673
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,182
Touchdown,

674
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,690
West Cam up by 14.

675
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:56,711
We're being punished,
I know it.

676
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:58,531
It's the curse of Voodoo.

677
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,320
And Ray "Voodoo" Tatom

678
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,672
is really starting
to light it up now, folks.

679
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:05,380
Don't look at him,
don't even think about him.

680
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:06,823
You understand me?
You stay inside yourself

681
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:07,990
and think about your next series.

682
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,053
This is it.
Coach Taylor's offense

683
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:11,563
is gonna have one more shot

684
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:13,701
to get some points on
the board before the half.

685
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:16,063
Saracen drops back to pass.

686
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,571
- Oh no!
- No!

687
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,110
Picked up inside the 25.

688
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,903
He is gonna go.

689
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:28,661
Touchdown Mustangs.

690
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,262
Holy smokes,
the Mustangs

691
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,611
have jumped out to a
26, nothing lead at the half.

692
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,431
This is truly heartbreaking,
folks,

693
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,750
for these Dillon players,

694
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,011
these loyal fans.

695
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:39,763
These folks

696
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,852
would follow this coach
to the ends of the Earth

697
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,741
and I'm afraid that's exactly
where he's led them.

698
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,661
It's unfortunate,
but I'm afraid

699
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,473
the controversy
of Coach leaving

700
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:50,610
has just been too much
for these players.

701
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:51,811
You can see it
in their eyes,

702
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:55,061
the look of defeat,
the loss of heart.

703
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:56,851
And it would seem
that the hopes

704
00:29:56,897 --> 00:30:00,161
of this once great season
may just end right here.

705
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,642
When Jason Street went down
first game of the season,

706
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,381
everybody wrote us off.

707
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,101
Everybody.

708
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:39,171
And yet here we are
at the championship game.

709
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:41,831
40,000 people out there

710
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:43,660
have also written us off.

711
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,350
And there are a few out there
who do still believe in you,

712
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:49,553
few will never give up
on you.

713
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,501
You go back out on the field,

714
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:54,361
those are the people I want

715
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,961
in your minds.

716
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,652
Those are the people I want

717
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:00,823
in your hearts.

718
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,002
Every man at some point
in his life

719
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,130
is gonna lose a battle.

720
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:11,592
He's gonna fight
and he's gonna lose.

721
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:13,602
But what makes him a man...

722
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,511
is that in the midst of that battle,
he does not lose himself.

723
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,223
This game is not over.

724
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:26,332
This battle is not over.

725
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:34,963
So let's hear it
one more time.

726
00:31:35,855 --> 00:31:36,582
Together.

727
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:38,801
Clear eyes.
Full hearts.

728
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,382
- Can't lose!
- Let's go!

729
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,160
Riggins off the right side.

730
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,390
Big hit, Mustangs.

731
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:52,552
First down, Panthers.

732
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,161
Saracen's got Williams
on a short screen.

733
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:57,632
He's got some room.

734
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:58,690
One man to beat.

735
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:02,252
Touchdown.

736
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:04,581
Dillon Panthers
are on the board.

737
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,100
Oh my,
the Panthers have scored.

738
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,512
Voodoo back to pass.

739
00:32:09,836 --> 00:32:12,512
He gets buried
by two Panthers.

740
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,341
Come on, sack Voodoo!

741
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:15,631
Voodoo drops back.

742
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:17,790
It's a quarterback keeper.
It's a draw to the inside.

743
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:18,853
There he goes.

744
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,371
Fumble! Loose ball!

745
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:23,710
Oh my, it's a hot potato,
greased pig.

746
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,320
Somebody get a hold
of that thing.

747
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:26,852
Oh and the Panthers have it.

748
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,260
The Panthers have it!
He picks up the loose ball.

749
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:31,271
and he's gonna pass---

750
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:34,292
Touchdown Panthers!

751
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:36,542
The Panthers are back
in this thing.

752
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:39,801
You gotta take control
of this game

753
00:32:39,846 --> 00:32:41,493
and you gotta do it
right now.

754
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:42,732
Get in there.
Come on, baby.

755
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,361
Saracen back to pass.

756
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,011
Oh, it's up!

757
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:50,950
Smash Williams
on double coverage.

758
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:53,462
Saracen threads the needle.
And he's got it!

759
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:54,701
Touchdown.

760
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,813
Oh, touchdown Panthers.

761
00:32:56,948 --> 00:32:59,931
Oh mama,
Dillon is one score

762
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,592
from tying this thing up.

763
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:03,551
Hold everything.

764
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:05,642
Hold on.
Smash Williams is down.

765
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:07,113
He's getting up
very slowly.

766
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,030
He went down hard on that play

767
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:10,580
and he is hurt.

768
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:11,701
Let's go, make room!
Make room!

769
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:12,581
Come on!

770
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,330
Where is it, is it your arm
or your shoulder?

771
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,131
It's my shoulder.

772
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:17,211
Get it checked.

773
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,612
Hey, I ain't
going nowhere.

774
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:19,741
Then go get it checked,
damn it.

775
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,290
You have a slightly
dislocated shoulder.

776
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:25,333
We can pop it
back into place.

777
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:26,891
But I just wouldn't advise
that you play.

778
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:28,130
No, no, this is State.
Come on,

779
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,582
- come on, do it.
- Take a deep breath.

780
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:30,840
That's it.

781
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:36,222
Oh, mac daddy,

782
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:37,922
somebody stole my Caddie.

783
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:40,302
Smash Williams
is playing through the pain.

784
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:42,600
And he has inspired
Panther nation.

785
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:44,410
And they are
one minute away

786
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:48,250
from one of the greatest
comebacks in Texas football.

787
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,612
Oh, mercy!

788
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:53,760
All right, 57 yards, y'all.
Let's go to work.

789
00:33:53,987 --> 00:33:56,092
They're keying on the run,
so we're gonna take 'em deep.

790
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,361
Blitz 27 Razor on one.
Ready?

791
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,010
Saracen back.

792
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:03,003
The blocking breaks down,
he scrambles.

793
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,940
Oh, Saracen is sacked,

794
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:06,623
- down he goes.
- Time!

795
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:14,241
Timeout Panthers
with six seconds left.

796
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,002
What are you thinking,
Coach?

797
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:20,733
Wanna go long and we'll
put it in the end zone?

798
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:21,491
What are you thinking?

799
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:23,371
Can't do that.
They're gonna have everyone back.

800
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,333
We got two shots.

801
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:26,413
Coach, we can.
We can run an out.

802
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,810
And then we can
take a shot.

803
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,482
Let's take our shot
right now.

804
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:30,802
We got it,
we gotta--

805
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:31,971
Coach, I got the play.

806
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:33,112
What?

807
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,823
Riggins runs
an 18-yard cross.

808
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,463
Smash mirrors him
on the other side.

809
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:37,771
I'm gonna hit Riggins

810
00:34:37,836 --> 00:34:39,003
and he's gonna come
underneath the defense.

811
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:39,961
And they're gonna
collapse on him,

812
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:41,152
but he's gonna
pitch it to Smash.

813
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:43,023
That's an 18-yard
hook and lateral,

814
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:43,752
that'll never work.

815
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:45,260
You better be sure, Matt,
if you run this play--

816
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,231
- It'll not work.
- We can do this.

817
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:47,212
Come on, Coach.

818
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:52,162
Coach, it'll work.

819
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:54,930
Run it.

820
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:56,672
You run it.

821
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:58,541
All right.

822
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:02,741
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

823
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,873
Saracen back to pass.

824
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,021
He's got Riggins
cutting inside.

825
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:29,131
He fires a beautiful pass.

826
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:30,882
Tim Riggins
catches it short.

827
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:34,332
Oh, it's a pitch to
Smash Williams on the lateral!

828
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,220
Go, go!

829
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:39,110
He's breaks a tackle!

830
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,440
Touchdown!
Panthers!

831
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:51,290
Panthers win State!

832
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,842
Let's go, buddy.
That's yours too.

833
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:17,342
You deserve it, Coach.
You deserve it.

834
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:25,363
Yeah!

835
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:31,761
Come here.
Come here.

836
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,201
Good job.
Good job.

837
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:39,881
Wha-ha-hoo!

838
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,490
Well, that's
pretty intense, Garrity.

839
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,431
Yeah, well, it's been
a really crappy year.

840
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:09,050
Well...

841
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:10,951
Panthers won State.

842
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,391
I think it's time
for a change.

843
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,650
Apparently.

844
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,552
Hey, Tyra.

845
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,083
You want to ride home
with me?

846
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,750
Sure.
Why not?

847
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:39,660
Nice hat.

848
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,212
You feel different?

849
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:50,863
I do.

850
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,090
I do.

851
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,723
So now I want to talk
to you about something.

852
00:37:59,998 --> 00:38:01,201
Here, hold that.

853
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:06,482
This little one
has got me thinking

854
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:08,590
about all kinds of different
things here, all right?

855
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:12,913
There's more important things
than football.

856
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:16,073
There are more important things
than TMU.

857
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:19,791
But there's nothing more
important to me than you

858
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:22,002
and this family.

859
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,140
So here's what
we're gonna do.

860
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:27,551
I'm gonna stay in Dillon.

861
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:30,391
I'm gonna be a father
to this baby

862
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:31,631
and to this family.

863
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:33,363
I am gonna coach
high school football.

864
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:34,971
And you and I
are gonna stay together.

865
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,501
And that's
the way it is.

866
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:38,951
Yes?

867
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,391
- No.
- What do you mean no?

868
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:43,573
You've got to go
to Austin.

869
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:45,152
This is--
this is your dream.

870
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:47,313
That's what I'm telling you.
That's what I'm telling you though.

871
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,570
You are my dream.
This baby is my dream.

872
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,100
Julie is our dream.

873
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:52,572
I'm living my dream
right now.

874
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:54,460
I'm not gonna separate
what we have.

875
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,530
- Honey, listen. You know what?
- All right, what?

876
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:57,610
- Can you just listen to me for a second?
- I am listening,  that's why--

877
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,123
I don't wanna
be responsible

878
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:01,483
nor do I want to have
this baby be responsible

879
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,552
for you not living out
your dream.

880
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:05,882
And that's what I'm saying,
you are my dream.

881
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,550
I have walked with you
all these years

882
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,861
to get to this place,
you and I together.

883
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:11,903
And you know what else
we've been doing together?

884
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,622
We've been
allowing the space

885
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:15,142
to create our dreams,
you know.

886
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:16,443
And--and you've got it.

887
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:18,092
You--you've got it
in Austin

888
00:39:18,097 --> 00:39:19,181
and I've got it
here in Dillon.

889
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,423
I've finally--
I've finally got this job.

890
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,901
And Julie has a big life
here in Dillon.

891
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,292
And it's gonna be hard.

892
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:26,341
I don't know how
we're gonna do it,

893
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,663
but I know that our relationship
means that we can do it.

894
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:35,211
So what's going on?

895
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:20,652
He took a team
that was battered,

896
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,422
a town
that was ailing,

897
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:24,771
and he did more than
put a Band-Aid on things.

898
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:25,640
I'll tell ya that.

899
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,510
He healed this team

900
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,411
and he healed this town.

901
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,892
Now, how a man like that
can abandon his team

902
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:34,053
after one season
is another question.

903
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:37,293
Is he a great coach turned into
an even greater opportunist maybe?

904
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:38,250
Hell, I don't know.

905
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:39,642
Let's take some calls.

906
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,252
Tug from Barstow,
what do you got?

907
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:43,860
I shook that man's
hand once, Sammy.

908
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,173
I thought
he had a heart.

909
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:46,940
I guess I was wrong.

910
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:54,180
Take a knee.

911
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:56,513
All right, y'all.
Today we're champions.

912
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:57,843
Feels good, right?

913
00:41:57,966 --> 00:41:59,091
Yeah!

914
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,752
Enjoy it while it lasts
'cause tomorrow we're targets.

915
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,241
Next season,
every other team in Texas

916
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:05,691
is gonna be gunning for us
'cause we're number one.

917
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:08,133
And I don't know
about y'all, but, uh,

918
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:09,502
anything less than
another state championship

919
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,980
is completely unacceptable.

920
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:12,843
So here's what
we're gonna do.

921
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:14,533
Everyone think about
the off-season.

922
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,533
The off-season's
about development.

923
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:17,373
Development of strength.

924
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,123
Development of speed.
Development of character.

925
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,453
Football is a 12-month,

926
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:22,352
52-week,

927
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,450
365-day commitment,
gentlemen.

928
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,841
Have a great day today.

929
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:28,931
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Tomorrow we go to work.

930
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:29,550
Got it?

931
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,942
Yes, sir.

932
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,361
Clear eyes, full hearts.

933
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,631
Can't lose!
