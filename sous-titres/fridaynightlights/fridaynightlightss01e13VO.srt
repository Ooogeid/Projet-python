1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:01,742
I saw Lyla the other day,

2
00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:03,504
and I wish I could just hate her
and walk away from it

3
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:04,338
and be done with it.

4
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:05,781
But I love her, you know?

5
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:07,873
There's no weakness
in forgiveness.

6
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,293
This is my dad.
This is Coach Taylor.

7
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,004
- This is my Dad, Henry Saracen.
- Coach, how you doing?

8
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,003
You're on leave?

9
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:13,673
Yeah, he's home for two weeks.

10
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:15,810
Just some pick-me-ups
I been taking.

11
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,349
It's just gonna give me
a little edge.

12
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,300
You're an amazing woman,
and you are a damn good mother.

13
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,538
But God, you are such a loser
when it comes to men.

14
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,472
Get the hell out!
Get out!

15
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:28,813
You okay?

16
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:32,200
<i>But how far am I
supposed to go for love?</i>

17
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>I'd would give my heart
and soul to him.</i>

18
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,072
<i>But I'm not sure
I'd do time for him.</i>

19
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:38,002
<i>Well, of course you'd give
your heart and soul</i>

20
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,490
<i>and of course, you love him.</i>

21
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,053
<i>My question to you is--</i>

22
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,680
- All right, that's enough.
- Don't touch that.

23
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:43,790
We're listening to that.

24
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,190
You wanna listen to this girl

25
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:47,123
who's runnin' around town
with her loser boyfriend,

26
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:48,311
robbin' liquor stores--

27
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,422
- that's what you wanna listen to?
- She's robbing for love.

28
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,951
Dad, it's compelling stuff.

29
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,390
Guilty pleasure, babe.

30
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,942
Why can't we listen
to Sammy Meade?

31
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,182
- What's wrong with Sammy Meade?
- Sammy Meade is no good for you.

32
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,552
Dad, Sammy Meade is just
stress in a bottle.

33
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:01,611
Stress in a bottle, babe.
Stress in a bottle.

34
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:03,050
<i>You are in control
of your destiny.</i>

35
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,291
<i>The minute
you truly believe that,</i>

36
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:07,452
<i>- freedom comes with it.
- That's good advice.</i>

37
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,751
<i>You are in control of your destiny.</i>

38
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,513
Right now, y'all are in control
of your destiny.

39
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,942
You remember that.

40
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:16,943
Last week, we were waiting to
see if Arnett Mead would lose,

41
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:17,992
and they lost.

42
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,853
We are in control.

43
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:22,102
Got a big game come Friday.

44
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:24,021
We get out there this week,

45
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:26,322
we take care of business
with this one, babies,

46
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,790
- we go to the playoffs.
- Yes, sir!

47
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,842
Hut!

48
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,181
Catch my Sammy Meade
interview this morning?

49
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:39,700
Aw, heck, Coach,
I didn't.

50
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:42,951
Girls made me listen to some damn
psychologist on the radio this morning.

51
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,251
Dr. Q?

52
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,990
You listen to Dr. Q?

53
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:48,791
I live by her.

54
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,421
Here I am pulling double shifts

55
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:56,060
trying to make ends meet
and put food on the table.

56
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:58,511
And this is the thanks I get.

57
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,901
You could at least
make up the bed.

58
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:13,142
Oh, no.

59
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,201
Come over here.

60
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,123
Mama.
Mom, what are you doing?

61
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,161
What you doing here?

62
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:21,502
You better get in this office.

63
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,192
Mama, look, whatever it is--

64
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,970
I wanna know what kind
of team you're runnin' here.

65
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:27,910
- What are you doin' to my son?
- Mama, what is--

66
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,842
Wait a second, now I don't know
what's goin' on here, but--

67
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:33,250
I'll show you what's goin' on here.

68
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,052
This!

69
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:41,191
And I thought you were
a Christian man, Coach Taylor.

70
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,081
But you messing
with my son's life--

71
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,142
- Mama, he--
- to win football games-- with his life!

72
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:46,433
- He didn't--
- You be quiet!

73
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:48,483
I don't wanna hear one word
out of you right now.

74
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,321
These kids, they're stupid.

75
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:51,630
They think they're invincible.

76
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,291
I see it every day at the clinic.

77
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,410
But Coach Taylor,

78
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:56,340
you supposed to know better.

79
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,532
Ms. Williams, I can promise you
I didn't know anything about this.

80
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,951
You have anything
to say for yourself?

81
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:11,712
No, ma'am.

82
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:23,000

86
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:02,193
You would not believe

87
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,862
who came in the dealership today.

88
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,450
- Who?
- Ed Johnston.

89
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:06,952
- No!
- I'm not kidding ya.

90
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,082
How's his family?

91
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,882
They're fine.
They're all great.

92
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:11,701
I mean, he drove all the way in

93
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,170
from Dallas to buy a car.

94
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,520
Hope you gave him
a good deal.

95
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,811
Of course I gave him
a good deal, sweetie.

96
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,762
That's what makes
your old man who he is.

97
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,470
I give everybody a good deal.

98
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,722
They got that son Ty.
You remember Ty, Lyla?

99
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,292
- Oh, nice boy.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:25,953
Yeah, he's over at SMU.

101
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,052
He's a freshman.

102
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:28,972
And he's in
the psychology department.

103
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,563
He's doing some kind of

104
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,960
paper on cheerleaders and football

105
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,592
and boys and girls and...

106
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,953
some kinda weird
psychological deal.

107
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,150
But anyway, he wanted to see
if he could

108
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:39,442
talk to you, Lyla,

109
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,591
since you're a cheerleader and
you know all about this stuff.

110
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,232
So I told him he could
meet with you Thursday at 1:00

111
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:45,500
to talk to him

112
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:47,943
at that new Oriental place.

113
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:51,590
I've heard it's really good.

114
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,843
Why are we even goin'
over to the Rodells'?

115
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:57,023
We don't have to go
over there.

116
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,313
I don't know, honey. I didn't talk
to her. You talked to her.

117
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,700
Don't lie down, please.

118
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,380
Please get right back up, honey.

119
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,392
Let's go, come on.

120
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,330
I put your ties out.

121
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,932
I put your clothes out for you.
Come on.

122
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,601
I like this one.

123
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,110
What are you gonna
do about Smash?

124
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,430
You tie that.

125
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,153
If I report him,
and I'm obliged to report him,

126
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:19,921
that kid's never gonna play
high school football again.

127
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:21,093
His career's over.

128
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,290
Yeah.

129
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,652
And if I don't report him,

130
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,802
which goes against
everything I stand for...

131
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,631
I can't let the kid
play juiced.

132
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,753
So then he's all, like,

133
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:41,211
"I'm sorry, Tyra. I miss you."

134
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,350
Whatever.

135
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,511
I'm sure there's a certain
throbbing member of his body

136
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,342
- that misses you.
- Exactly!

137
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,822
Oh, stop it--I think you should
give him another chance.

138
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,412
He's very cute.

139
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:54,540
Come on,
you can't argue that.

140
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,251
Well, he is.
He's very cute, that kid.

141
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,930
Mother, you are
a barrel of bad advice.

142
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,123
All right, ladies.
Here's one.

143
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:05,440
Buddy Garrity is looking
for a receptionist.

144
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:06,880
"Administrative Assistant.

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
50 words per minute.

146
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:09,718
Salary commensurate
with experience."

147
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,761
Even Mom can't fake
50 words a minute, dumb ass.

148
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:15,842
How 'bout you stop criticizing
and start helping out a little, Mindy?

149
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,913
Maybe we should stop
discussing this family dynamic

150
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,732
and accept that I pay
half the rent around here.

151
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,430
I don't see you coughing up
any Applebee's money.

152
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,192
Yeah, well, you don't
make the same kind of tips

153
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,683
when you leave
your clothes on.

154
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:26,911
That's funny.

155
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,110
But you know this guy?

156
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,063
Yeah, like when I was 12.

157
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,661
You goin' to that
Japanese restaurant?

158
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,602
Yeah, I guess.

159
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:34,713
Why can't he just come
to the school?

160
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,473
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

161
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,402
Because it's annoying

162
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,220
is why I'm making such
a big deal out of it.

163
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,580
It's annoying that your dad
sent you on a date

164
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,482
with some college boy,

165
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,993
and it's annoying that just you do
whatever your dad wants

166
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:45,591
you to whenever he wants you to do it.

167
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,423
Jason, it's not a date.

168
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,241
If you don't want me to go,
I won't.

169
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,820
Just tell me.

170
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:52,701
No, it's fine.

171
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,490
It's fine.
You can go.

172
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,483
Okay?

173
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,643
Okay.

174
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:58,851
Hi, Lyla.

175
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,620
I gotta go--I'm being rude.
You wanna say hi?

176
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm good.

177
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,321
- Okay, be right back.
- I can wave from here.

178
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,403
Tell 'em I say hello.

179
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:11,793
I'll be back.

180
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,291
So...

181
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,341
explain to me
how I'm seein' what I'm seein'.

182
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,171
After what she did to you?

183
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:26,811
I love her.

184
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,443
- You love her.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:30,871
That's all the explanation
you need.

186
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,460
That's just--
that's great.

187
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:33,840
And you know what--

188
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,130
you can get away with anything
when you're Lyla Garrity, it seems.

189
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:39,672
Hi, Tyra.

190
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,790
Hi, Lyla.

191
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,391
Can I get my seat back?

192
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:44,183
Oh, no problem.

193
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,320
So...

194
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,761
this receptionist/secretary job

195
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,061
that's available
at your dad's dealership--

196
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,602
how much typing
is required?

197
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:55,893
I don't know.
I'm--

198
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,393
What about benefits?

199
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,340
I don't know, Tyra.

200
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,711
I'm really not sure you're
what my dad's looking for.

201
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,310
No, but he might be looking
for my mom.

202
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,743
Barbara comes from a long line
of Georgia democrats.

203
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:15,473
Serious bleeding hearts.

204
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,360
To this day,

205
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,153
they talk about Jimmy Carter
like he was the Second Coming.

206
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,000
Habitat for Humanity

207
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,223
is, like, every third word
out of their mouths.

208
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:26,330
That's right.

209
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,730
And when the two families
get together,

210
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,130
- oh, baby, can things heat up.
- Lord.

211
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,530
And Luce and I, well,
we just don't know what to do.

212
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,093
I'm--I'm sure that--
that must be, uh--

213
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:38,360
That must be awkward.

214
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:39,351
Oh, yes.

215
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:41,672
- Tami.
- Yes.

216
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,602
You know I'm running
for reelection.

217
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,353
Yes.

218
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,571
We're starting to put together
my campaign team.

219
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,690
I want you to be
part of it.

220
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:51,291
Wow.

221
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,211
You're a strong, smart,

222
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,243
charismatic lady.

223
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,651
- Thank you.
- And, um, together...

224
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,290
there's no stopping us.

225
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,250
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

226
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:05,203
That is--that is flattering,
and--and I would love to--

227
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:06,392
to consider it.

228
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:07,880
Thank you, Mayor Rodell.

229
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,262
Where you been?

230
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,460
Things ain't bad enough,
you got to keep me up

231
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,411
half the night,
wondering where you are?

232
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,351
- Where you going?
- To my room!

233
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,570
I'm goin' to my room.

234
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:23,750
You better lower
your voice, boy.

235
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:24,771
Your sisters are sleepin'!

236
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,102
How could you be so stupid?

237
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,190
You better watch your mouth.

238
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,623
How could you go to Coach?

239
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,192
Do you realize what you did?

240
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,041
If he goes to the Athletic Commission,
I'm gone,

241
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:33,610
I'm off the team forever.

242
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:35,181
My scholarships--

243
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,183
oh, yeah, all them letters
they been sending me,

244
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:38,791
they don't mean nothin' now,

245
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,113
they--worthless, gone.

246
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:41,683
All gone.

247
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:44,861
You ruined my life, Mama.

248
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:47,081
No, son, I'm trying
to save it.

249
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,113
You wanna know why
I went to your coach?

250
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,592
- Please tell me.
- 'Cause I didn't want to think

251
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:53,282
you were dumb enough to do
something so stupid on your own!

252
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,010
This was all I got,

253
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:56,453
and you took it away.

254
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,502
You know what?

255
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:58,741
You need to get
out of my house

256
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,982
till you can learn
some respect for your mama!

257
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:02,730
You gonna kick--

258
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,122
Fine, I'm leaving.

259
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:06,971
I don't need this.

260
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,092
I made a mistake.

261
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,792
You tell me something
I don't know.

262
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,462
W-haven't you ever
made a mistake?

263
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,491
Yes, Smash,
I've made mistakes.

264
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:30,871
I've been late for dinner.

265
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,173
I forgot stuff
at the supermarket.

266
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,943
I've made mistakes out in
the field I've come to regret.

267
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:35,422
Those are mistakes, Smash.

268
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,753
What you did wasn't
any mistake, though, son.

269
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,500
What you did is
you screwed yourself over,

270
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,123
and you screwed
this team over.

271
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,682
You know what you call that?

272
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:44,101
You call that a stupid,

273
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:45,701
dumb-ass, cowardly act

274
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,802
is what you call that,
Smash.

275
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,810
You know what--I wanna
know what you're doing,

276
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,271
I wanna know
how long you do it.

277
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,982
I wanna know who else
knows about it.

278
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,040
I wanna know where you got it.

279
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,610
We'll just start right there.
How's that?

280
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,270
Mom, I'm home.

281
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:05,790
Did you call about the job?

282
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,893
I don't think I can
make it without Bob.

283
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:13,921
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

284
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,571
I know you don't like him,

285
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,512
but he was payin'
the bills around here.

286
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,432
Did you call about
the job at Garrity Motors?

287
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,371
Yes, I called about the job,

288
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,862
and I can't even get an interview.

289
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,970
They had about a hundred
people call in, so...

290
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,331
Before we watch the game tape,
I got an announcement.

291
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,681
Smash is not gonna be playing
in the game Friday night.

292
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,100
Quiet! Listen up.

293
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,213
It's a personal issue.

294
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,593
Let me tell you somethin'.

295
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,082
I am not asking you

296
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:47,221
to respect his privacy.

297
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,103
I am telling you
to respect his privacy--

298
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,691
- you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

299
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,383
We're not gonna worry about
the one player

300
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,970
that's not out there.
We're gonna worry about

301
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,422
the 44 that are.

302
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,653
We're gonna take care
of the job at hand.

303
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,162
Gonna win Friday's game
and gonna get to the playoffs.

304
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,462
Are we good with that?

305
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:02,733
Yes, sir.

306
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,420
We got Brian "Smash" Williams
benched,

307
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,210
not playin'.

308
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,813
Mysterious circumstances.

309
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,553
Yeah, grandma,
I know.

310
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:12,720
Well, you know what?

311
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,020
It's too bad we don't
have an insider,

312
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,413
somebody that could shed
some light on some of this.

313
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,641
Please, he doesn't
tell me anything.

314
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:21,071
I just love your daddy.

315
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,881
Coach Taylor is great.

316
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,601
Does he like cherry pie?

317
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Did you see that?

318
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,101
When the quarterback shifts

319
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:29,662
the running backs into the slots,

320
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,243
he shifts 'em to a spread
formation out of single backs,

321
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,870
and the safeties, they just sit
there--they don't even move.

322
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:37,440
So that just leaves, like,
this huge, big gap,

323
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,602
basically an ocean.
I mean, I could just--

324
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,240
I could just fire pops and slants
right into there all night.

325
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,391
Matt, why don't you just
let the coach call the plays?

326
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:46,770
No, no, this is key,
Dad!

327
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,331
This is how we're gonna win
without Smash!

328
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:50,451
You're gonna see on Friday night.
You'll be there.

329
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,001
You're gonna see.
And you're gonna say,

330
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,493
"Matt, you were right."

331
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,160
Matt, I been trying to figure
out how to tell you, but, uh...

332
00:12:58,268 --> 00:12:59,650
W-what?

333
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,341
My unit called.

334
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,852
They need me to ship out
on Friday before the game.

335
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:13,760
All right, that's, um--

336
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,050
Th-that's okay.

337
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:17,772
I'm sorry.

338
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,330
I really wanted to be there.

339
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,171
It's not a big deal, so...

340
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,472
don't worry about it.

341
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,220
Those soldiers over in Iraq,
they might see that game.

342
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:29,572
They see the Super Bowl,

343
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,171
don't they?
Have you heard that?

344
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,663
They've got cables and all
kinds of stuff over there.

345
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:36,201
You know, the highest
technology--that's what I hear.

346
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,153
Every single child

347
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,902
in the independent school
district of Dillon

348
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,541
deserves better.

349
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,580
- She is a smart politician.
- Mm-hmm,

350
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,431
smart politician

351
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:50,060
with an alternative lifestyle.

352
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,671
Shocking!

353
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,192
This town just gets
weirder and weirder.

354
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,430
And why did she choose us to--

355
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,891
to open up to?

356
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,641
Because she realizes

357
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,922
what a forward-thinking
individual I am,

358
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,410
and she felt comfortable.

359
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:07,742
I'm sure.

360
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:08,853
It's different.

361
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:12,503
I did look at her website
today, though.

362
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,803
This education plan she has
is really good.

363
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,182
You know what, though?

364
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,000
With everything that
you got on your plate--

365
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,462
Julie and me and my needs
and demands--

366
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,813
that's an awful lot,
isn't it?

367
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:25,763
Well, I know you do have
many needs and demands.

368
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:26,473
I sure do.

369
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:27,980
But the schools
need a lot of help.

370
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,372
Does she even know that
you voted against her?

371
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:31,561
Details.

372
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:36,453
What--

373
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,731
honey, if that
is Buddy Garrity at the door,

374
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,980
I swear to God
I'm going right now

375
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,741
and gettin' out
your new deer rifle.

376
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:50,070
- You know it's past 11:00?
- I'm sorry, sir.

377
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,101
What you need?

378
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,773
Look, I'm sorry
for what I did.

379
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,931
Am I off the team?

380
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,422
Look, I know I'm not
playing on Friday,

381
00:14:58,427 --> 00:14:59,641
but am I off the team?

382
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:02,540
Don't I deserve to know?

383
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,573
I should have reported this

384
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,443
as soon as it happened.

385
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,961
I'm risking my job.

386
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:10,940
Inside this house,

387
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,782
I've got a wife and a daughter.

388
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,343
They depend on me
to provide for them.

389
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:17,463
Do you understand that?

390
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,402
Yes, sir.

391
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:20,531
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

392
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,363
When I do know,
I'll let you know.

393
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,891
Until then,
why don't you do me a favor

394
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,001
and just try and keep
your mouth shut?

395
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:29,163
Yes, sir.
You got it.

396
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,252
Good night.

397
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,571
Good night.

398
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,302
I told you go ready
asit's an internal matter.

399
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,151
I'm not gonna
talk about it anymore.

400
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,811
I appreciate
y'all coming out today.

401
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,510
There's some doughnuts
and coffee back there.

402
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,522
Coach, do you mind staying
for one more question?

403
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:10,630
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hey, Eric.

404
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,910
What the hell's
goin' on?

405
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:14,261
You know, I cannot
stand you dodgin' me.

406
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:15,500
And to tell you the truth,

407
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,250
I'm hurt.

408
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,482
As I said,
it's an internal matter.

409
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,113
Yeah, well, I am internal.

410
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,911
If anybody's internal,

411
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:23,842
I'm internal.

412
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,603
I'm probably the most
internal son of a bitch

413
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,410
you've ever met in your life--
is that not right?

414
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:28,911
I'm not gonna
talk about it.

415
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:29,902
Until when?

416
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:32,323
Until ever, Buddy.
I can't talk about it until ever.

417
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,073
Ever is a long damn time.

418
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,312
Yes, it is.

419
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,392
- Come in!
- Hang on, Matt.

420
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:40,110
- I can wait.
- Come on in.

421
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:42,242
- Are you through, Mr. Garrity?
- Come on in.

422
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:43,252
Okay.

423
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:46,690
All right.

424
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:48,532
- Okay.
- All right.

425
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:49,843
- Hello, Matt.
- Mr. Garrity.

426
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,433
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

427
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,153
- Thank you so much.
- Have a great game.

428
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,963
- I'm gonna try.
- Yeah.

429
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:56,580
Have a good day.

430
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:00,273
Look, I was checking out
the South Pines game tape,

431
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,401
and I found some holes
in their defense

432
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,750
that I think we can take
advantage of,

433
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,590
so I drew up a few plays.

434
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,502
Now, it's really easy.

435
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,902
We don't need to change any assignments.
We just--

436
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,060
if we audible out
to the spread formation,

437
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:12,830
out of the single backs--

438
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,421
You know what,
I appreciate this, Matt.

439
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:15,862
- It's good work.
- Thanks.

440
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,132
Let me tell you something.

441
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:19,341
Why don't you let me do my job,

442
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:20,860
and you do your job?

443
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,423
Your job right now
is to go out

444
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:23,881
and get the team ready
to play for you

445
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,223
All right?
How's that?

446
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:26,860
And I think this will
get them ready.

447
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:28,383
Especially since
Smash isn't playing...

448
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,662
- I'll take a look at 'em.
- I think this is what's gonna help us out.

449
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,953
Okay, thanks.

450
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,523
- And I really think the first two plays--
- I'll take a look at 'em!

451
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,122
Okay.

452
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,621
Yes, sir.

453
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,323
- Can you do me a favor?
- What's that?

454
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,543
- Turn right here.
- Where at?

455
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,273
Turn right here!
Here, here, turn right.

456
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,470
Whoa, whoa! You mind telling me
where the hell we're going?

457
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,841
I'm just gonna take
a little peek at something.

458
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,720
Well, easy, Unabomber.
What's goin' on?

459
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:54,852
- All right, slow down.
- Slow down?

460
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,452
Slow down, real slow.

461
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,172
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- What?

462
00:17:58,776 --> 00:17:59,742
Stop.

463
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,042
Look through that window
over there.

464
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,262
Is that Lyla Garrity?

465
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,191
Whew!

466
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,942
Now is that
a family friend or a date?

467
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,532
Knowin' her track record,

468
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,081
- that's a date.
- Shut up about that.

469
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,752
You don't know anything
about her track record.

470
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,283
You've known her
for two months.

471
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:14,440
Don't you wanna go in there

472
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:15,992
and pop him one
like you did Riggins?

473
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,451
Yeah, does that look like--like

474
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,950
she's helping him with a paper?

475
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,472
Stalking is not becoming

476
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,302
- of you, I tell you.
- I'm not stalking.

477
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:23,241
I'm not stalking.
Just taking a little look.

478
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,621
- Just go ahead and go. Please leave.
- It's the same thing, right?

479
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:26,560
- Bonehead move.
- You want me to go?

480
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,253
Yes, please.

481
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:28,960
Hi, Lyla!

482
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,013
- Faster. Move faster.
- Hi, Lyla!

483
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,623
Shut up and drive faster.

484
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,243
- Hi, Lyla!
- Faster, faster!

485
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:39,751
Hey.

486
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,153
Hey.

487
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,413
So I need a favor.

488
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,253
And just for the record,

489
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,040
it's not gonna involve any kind
of thank-you sex

490
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,670
or make-up sex.

491
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:52,590
In fact, it's gonna involve
absolutely no sex whatsoever.

492
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,663
Tyra, um,

493
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,622
believe it or not,
it's not all about sex for me.

494
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,272
Well, your timing
is terrible, Tim.

495
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,120
Yes, sir.
I get that a lot.

496
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:06,570
I mean, first of all, I just hired
Matt Saracen's dad to be a salesman,

497
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,343
and I don't mind telling you
that that man

498
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,333
could not sell a life preserver
to a drowning man.

499
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,913
And secondly,

500
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,312
I cannot really believe

501
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,911
that you're comin' in here
asking me for a favor

502
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,713
after that nonsense
that happened with my daughter.

503
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,012
Sir, I know you're
a big man in this town,

504
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,753
and I know you don't owe me

505
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,473
or anyone anything,
for that matter, but Tyra--

506
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,783
all she's trying to do
is help her mom out.

507
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,183
And all I'm asking from you

508
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:38,730
is to consider
giving them a break.

509
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,251
I respect that.

510
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,253
You're a good man.

511
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,793
You tell her to come by
and see me tomorrow afternoon.

512
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,162
There's no guarantees.

513
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,830
I mean, it's just an interview.

514
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:50,900
Yeah.

515
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,192
And tell me about Smash.

516
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:56,120
I have no idea what's goin' on
with him right now, sir.

517
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:57,072
Really?

518
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,170
Absolutely.
No one does.

519
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,771
Well, okay.

520
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:03,611
You're a good man, Tim.

521
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,520
- I appreciate your candor.
- Thank you, sir.

522
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,070
Noannie, go upstairs.
I need to talk to Mama.

523
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,353
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

524
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:31,122
I disgraced myself,

525
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:33,912
and I disgraced this family.

526
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,661
God gave me a way
to support this family,

527
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,763
and I threw it away.

528
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,183
I--I can't even look
at my face in the mirror.

529
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:46,881
Mama,

530
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:50,022
you just gotta know that

531
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,702
I'm trying

532
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,312
as hard as I can
to make this happen.

533
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:57,920
And what if Coach
don't let me back on the team?

534
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,152
Then you let God guide you
in another direction.

535
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:01,982
Mama, you don't understand--
without football,

536
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,031
I know, I know.

537
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,933
Without football,
there's no--

538
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,253
no scholarship,

539
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:09,060
no--no pros,
no big house for Mama.

540
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:11,393
I don't need no big house,

541
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,711
especially if I can't
come by it honest.

542
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,670
Oh, I love watching you
play football, Brian.

543
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,971
Oh, you're so beautiful
out there.

544
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,163
But sometimes, baby,

545
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:25,682
sometimes I just wish
you didn't have

546
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:28,442
all this expectation on you,
all this pressure.

547
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,970
Sometimes I wish

548
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,700
you could just be a kid.

549
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,282
I love you, Mama.

550
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:41,343
Oh, I love you, too, baby.

551
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,460
Hey, Jason.

552
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:57,040
What the heck are you doin'
sittin' out here in the cold, son?

553
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:59,012
I think, uh, Lyla's
in her study group--

554
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:00,431
I know where she is.

555
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,130
All right.

556
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,913
So what are you
doin' out here?

557
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:08,533
Why'd you set Lyla up
on a date with Ty Johnston?

558
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,161
Why?

559
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,193
Yeah, why?

560
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,293
What, you need me
to answer it for you?

561
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,992
'Cause if I was still the quarterback
and wasn't the town cripple,

562
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:18,510
you wouldn't be setting your
daughter up on dates

563
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:20,521
- with college boys.
- Now you just hold on there, son.

564
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:22,061
You just watch
what you're saying.

565
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:23,623
Ty Johnston happens to be

566
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:24,730
a friend of our family's.

567
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:26,440
She went with him
to help him on his paper

568
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:27,770
he's doing for SMU.

569
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:29,393
You know what
I'm talking about, sir.

570
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,630
No, Jason,
I'm afraid I don't, son.

571
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:33,771
You don't want your little girl
to end up with me,

572
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,163
so you're just trying to show her
that there are other choices out there.

573
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:38,040
Bigger fish in the sea, huh?

574
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,670
Now, son, you know
that everybody

575
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:41,510
in this family loves you.

576
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,621
We always have,
and we've supported you

577
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,651
ever since you were
a little bitty boy--

578
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,451
Please, please
do not patronize me,

579
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:48,863
Mr. Garrity.

580
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,573
You sent your daughter
on a date,

581
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,243
and I asked you why.

582
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:56,100
Now can we please just speak
honestly about it?

583
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,971
You want me to be
honest with you, son?

584
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,603
- Do ya?
- Please.

585
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:05,492
I love that little girl
in there.

586
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,601
That's my daughter,

587
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:10,142
and I want her to have
a great life.

588
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,960
And I'm real uncertain
about the future here.

589
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,230
I mean, how is
she gonna get money?

590
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,001
How you gonna get money?

591
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,393
You gonna go to college?

592
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:21,790
Is she gonna go to college?

593
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,122
Are you gonna have babies?
Can you have babies?

594
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:25,783
Can you?

595
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:28,341
Can you have children, Jason?

596
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,043
We haven't quite
answered that yet.

597
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,842
Well, what if you can't?

598
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,362
And what if you can, Jason?

599
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,770
When that little baby's
crying upstairs in the night,

600
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,912
who's gonna go up
and take care of him?

601
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:45,103
I don't want Lyla
to be a caregiver

602
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,681
her whole life, son.

603
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,112
I know that's a bitter
pill to swallow,

604
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:51,052
and I'm sorry
I have to say it to you.

605
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,790
And Lyla Garrity,

606
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,283
she loves you.

607
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:57,421
She'd follow you
into hell.

608
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,900
Are you sure you want
to lead her there?

609
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,082
I mean, that whole family,

610
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,263
the whole Garrity family,

611
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:14,493
I'm allergic to them.
I mean,

612
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,283
Pam, I don't know
who she thinks she is.

613
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,531
She doesn't even look at me
in the market.

614
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,721
And Lyla, well, I mean,

615
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,153
what a little you-know-what.

616
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,642
Well, Mom,
you need a job.

617
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:25,130
I know, but I don't know
what circumstances

618
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:27,960
I would have to be under to
actually work for Buddy Garrity.

619
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:29,642
How about to avoid eviction?

620
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:30,893
I'm just thinking.

621
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,953
You don't have to be--

622
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:42,931
Damn it!
I can't believe this.

623
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,970
What on earth--

624
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,271
Blowout--perfect.

625
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,572
Oh...well, I just think
that is God's way of tellin' us

626
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,703
he does not want us
to go to Buddy's.

627
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,130
Think you got everything, honey?

628
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:01,950
I think so.

629
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,732
Hey, I put a surprise in there

630
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:04,950
for when you get over there.

631
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,661
- You'll find it!
- All right.

632
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:08,310
I hope so.

633
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,721
And don't forget
to watch the game.

634
00:25:09,827 --> 00:25:10,991
- I won't.
- Ask 'em when you get there,

635
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:11,831
just ask 'em.

636
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,990
I think they will if you just
tell 'em right away.

637
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,670
That's what
you need to do.

638
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,191
I will do that.

639
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,762
It's been great
having you here, honey.

640
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,493
Okay.

641
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,302
I guess this is me.

642
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,581
Mama, you be good.

643
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:28,430
'Course I'll be good.

644
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:29,672
Now, you just go
make us proud.

645
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,902
Don't you worry about us.

646
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:32,393
We're gonna be fine.

647
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:34,380
Julie, a pleasure.

648
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,353
Nice meeting you.
Have a safe trip back.

649
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:40,801
Matt.

650
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,750
Keep those damn feet
movin', all right?

651
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:57,380
- You all right?
- Yeah.

652
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,270
All right.

653
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,272
Take care of yourself.

654
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:43,112
We're gonna make it fine.

655
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,771
Come here, sweetie.
Come here.

656
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,381
We're gonna be all right.

657
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:52,473
All right, we know
we're gonna have 8 in a box

658
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,311
with an 11 package, right?

659
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,221
Got motion left here.

660
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:57,303
We got three deep.

661
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:59,343
We got Riggins on a linebacker.

662
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:00,580
Superior athlete--

663
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,153
Riggins should be able to beat him.

664
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:03,422
He's gotta beat him.

665
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:04,730
Hey, guys,
give me a second.

666
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:06,142
Hi, y'all.

667
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:07,793
How's it goin'?
Sorry to interrupt y'all.

668
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:09,182
Be one quick second.

669
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:11,832
Nice seeing you, McGill.

670
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:14,532
- Why are you interrupting my meeting?
- I'm sorry, honey.

671
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:16,070
- I apologize.
- I don't appreciate that.

672
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,223
I'm interrupting
your meeting--

673
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,750
Come on, now, I'm busy.

674
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,142
All right, I wanted
to come down now

675
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,243
and I wanted to tell you
that I have decided

676
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:24,603
that I think I'm gonna
go ahead and, uh,

677
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:28,053
join Mayor Rodell's campaign.

678
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:30,863
Well, that's great.

679
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:32,141
I--it is great.

680
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:33,102
Honestly, it's great.

681
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,132
It's a great opportunity.

682
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,450
I'm gonna be able
to help our school.

683
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:36,981
I'm gonna be able to help all
the schools in the commun--

684
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,370
in the whole county.

685
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,663
I'm sure she realizes
how good you are.

686
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,621
I'm sure she realizes, also

687
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,632
that you're the coach's wife.

688
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,110
That'd help out
with the campaign.

689
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,720
Oh, you think--you think
that's why she asked me,

690
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:48,773
'cause I'm the coach's wife?

691
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:51,030
- I didn't say that.
- That's exactly what you just said.

692
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,571
I don't like...
politicians.

693
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:58,203
The other night,
that little reveal

694
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,440
at the dinner and everything--
just hear me out here.

695
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,141
Something like that
gets out in this town,

696
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,850
that's not gonna do
her any good,

697
00:28:04,907 --> 00:28:06,803
and it is not gonna do
anyone any good

698
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,221
that is close to her--

699
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:09,490
that's what I'm saying.

700
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:11,150
Wait--so you don't want me to

701
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,110
do this because she's a lesbian?

702
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:14,190
I'm not sayin' that.

703
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:15,720
- That's not what I'm sayin'.
- That's exactly what you said.

704
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,223
- I'm bouncing it back to you, sugar.
- What I'm saying is

705
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,553
I'm uncomfortable with it.
I'm uncomfortable with it.

706
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:20,313
Well, you know what?

707
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,350
You're just gonna have to be
uncomfortable with it then.

708
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:27,960
Well...

709
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:30,043
It's never
a dull moment with you.

710
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,393
Well, that's why
you married me, sugar.

711
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:34,310
I guess so--I don't quite
remember why I married you,

712
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:36,503
but there's never
a dull moment with you.

713
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,720
Oh, I'm so happy
to have your support.

714
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,271
Hope you have a great game tonight.

715
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:45,503
Thank you.

716
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:50,601
I don't understand why you're
goin' over and over with that.

717
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,223
You know what, Mother,
I have it.

718
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,240
It's not even touchin' the top.

719
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,801
. Isn't it supposed to--
- It's all yours.

720
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,200
- Go for it.
- Well, I'm just sayin'--

721
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:58,643
- Well, do it!
- Oh!

722
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,003
At least try this thing--

723
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,982
at least try to get that
with this thing, you know,

724
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,350
because that thing
obviously doesn't work!

725
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:09,580
Tyra,

726
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:10,682
you're makin' me so mad!

727
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:11,981
I'm not cut out for this!

728
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:13,471
I don't know
how to change a tire,

729
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:14,883
and I don't wanna
know how.

730
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,931
We can change this tire!

731
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:18,621
It's not the end of the world!

732
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,261
You know, I just don't know
what's gotten into you!

733
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,141
I mean,

734
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,500
was life so bad with Bob?

735
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:25,950
He hit you!

736
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:29,131
- I told you he was workin' on his anger!
- Oh, my God!

737
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:30,820
This has to end!

738
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:33,512
I-if not for you,
then for me.

739
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:35,601
I love you.

740
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,291
More than anything,
I love you.

741
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,300
My worst fear...

742
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:43,670
is to become you.

743
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:47,331
And call me crazy, but

744
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:49,713
we don't change this tire
right here,

745
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:51,672
right now, by ourselves...

746
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,230
we're both doomed.

747
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:09,623
Give you one drink,
you're good to go.

748
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:11,352
Cheap date.

749
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:15,293
I gotta tell you,
I went over to, uh,

750
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,920
Garrity's house
the other night

751
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,153
to confront Mr. Garrity
on sending Lyla on a date.

752
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,682
Oh, I'll bet
that went well.

753
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:21,532
It did.

754
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,840
Because I went over there
specifically

755
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:25,570
to have him look me in the eye

756
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:28,181
and tell me that he did not want me
dating his daughter anymore.

757
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,793
What happened?

758
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,221
He did.

759
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,160
He told me, uh,

760
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,761
he wanted his daughter to have a

761
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:36,400
"good life."

762
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:38,042
- Quad quote.
- Quad quote.

763
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,180
I gotta hand it to him,
though.

764
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:43,880
He went at it.

765
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,622
Direct, honest

766
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:48,003
and I started thinking about, uh,

767
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,612
how selfish I've been
since the accident, you know?

768
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:53,250
Always thinking about me.
Never really thinking about

769
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:54,771
her, and...

770
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,652
how, little by little, over time,

771
00:30:56,697 --> 00:30:58,200
being with me's
gonna define her.

772
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,183
What are you
gonna do?

773
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,392
I don't know.
I think it's a...

774
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,953
maybe time
that I let her go.

775
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,511
Just...let her go.

776
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,001
You know I'm not

777
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:13,311
Lyla Garrity's biggest fan,
but, uh...

778
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:16,101
if you're thinking of
leaving Lyla

779
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,791
'cause of Buddy, you listen to me,
Grasshopper.

780
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:21,653
There is gonna be a million

781
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:24,193
Buddy Garritys out there

782
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:26,023
who will try and tell you

783
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:28,100
that you aren't worth anything.

784
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,210
And you just gotta look him
right in the eye

785
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:31,850
and flip him the bird.

786
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:35,050
Just like that?

787
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:36,970
I'll work on it.

788
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,373
And the Buddy Garritys
of this world,

789
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:45,020
they're a cancer
to you and me.

790
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:53,232
<i>This is another tight one, folks.</i>

791
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,610
<i>No one can seem to get
the ball in the end zone,</i>

792
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:58,293
<i>and there's only nine minutes
left in this contest.</i>

793
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:00,202
<i>Now if Dillon does not win,</i>

794
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,193
<i>they will not go
to the playoffs.</i>

795
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:03,961
<i>But the real headline tonight</i>

796
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,411
<i>is Smash Williams</i>

797
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,731
<i>is ridin' the pine,
and nobody's talkin'.</i>

798
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,831
<i>It's a mystery
wrapped in an enigma</i>

799
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:13,302
<i>hog-tied and shut up tight.
And everybody wants to know why.</i>

800
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,250
<i>Saracen takes the snap,</i>

801
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:16,911
<i>he hands off to Baxter
off the left side.</i>

802
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:17,930
<i>Nice little spin move.</i>

803
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:18,880
<i>He's got some room.</i>

804
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:20,630
<i>- Oh, and he has dropped.
- Way to go, Jim!</i>

805
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:23,640
Go, Matthew.

806
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:24,670
All right, all right,

807
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,351
let's keep it going,
let's keep it going.

808
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,383
Move your sticks!
Move your sticks!

809
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,202
<i>It's second and a long 6
for the first down.</i>

810
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:33,320
<i>Looks like the Panthers
got a little momentum</i>

811
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:34,332
<i>going here, folks.</i>

812
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:35,831
<i>But let's see if they can finish</i>

813
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:37,580
<i>without Smash Williams
in the backfield.</i>

814
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,541
<i>Oh, it's another
9 level run.</i>

815
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:45,992
<i>He's going down</i>

816
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,372
<i>close to the first down.</i>

817
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:50,973
<i>That is gonna bring up 3rd
and 1 for the Panthers.</i>

818
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,033
Make something happen!

819
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,031
Come on, let's go!

820
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,842
Red eight!
Hut!

821
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,530
<i>It's a draw to Riggins.</i>

822
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:06,962
<i>Riggins has nowhere to go,</i>

823
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:08,650
<i>and it is another big loss</i>

824
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:11,180
<i>of 7 yards on the play.</i>

825
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,473
<i>There is a time out on the field.</i>

826
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,953
<i>Now hold on, hold on.</i>

827
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,811
<i>Coach Taylor is not gonna send
the punting unit out.</i>

828
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>It's 4th and 8
from their own 42 yard line.</i>

829
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:25,871
<i>This will be a very,
very risky move</i>

830
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,570
<i>if he decides to go for it.</i>

831
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:29,300
We get the cross
or we get the deep rout.

832
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,380
I been lookin' at those plays
you drew up--

833
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:33,550
What are you thinking?

834
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,720
If we set the X receiver
in motion,

835
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:36,963
the linebacker's
gonna follow him.

836
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,173
That's gonna leave a huge gap
between the safeties

837
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:40,351
and the other receivers.

838
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,251
Then 8 to 10 yards,

839
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:42,590
- linebackers fill the coverage,
- Yeah, exactly.

840
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:43,630
fill the gaps, yeah?

841
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:44,642
So what?

842
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,420
So then I can just
fire pops in there and stuff,

843
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,231
'cause there's, like, an ocean
between the safeties

844
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:49,292
and the other receivers.

845
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,061
You know why they play
those safeties back so far?

846
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,682
'Cause they're the fastest damn
safeties in Texas, that's why.

847
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,733
They got 21 interceptions
between them,

848
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,513
- do you understand that?
- They want you to throw there,

849
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:59,430
- Matt, it's a trap.
- You sure you can hit them?

850
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:01,522
- Yeah.
- You're sure you can hit him.

851
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll him him fast, I'll
hit him right in his stride.

852
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,430
If you get picked,
you know what's gonna happen?

853
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:06,062
We're gonna be watching
the playoffs on our sofas

854
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,932
in our damn houses--
you understand that?

855
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,961
Coach, I got this.
I can do it.

856
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,821
- It's real risky.
- Let me throw it.

857
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:12,790
Risky.

858
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,110
Take your shot.

859
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,822
Take a shot.

860
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,260
<i>And quarterback Matt Saracen</i>

861
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:23,581
<i>is coming back onto the field,
and Dillon is going for it.</i>

862
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,592
<i>Fourth and long
in their own territory.</i>

863
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,482
<i>If they don't get this,
this could be a disaster.</i>

864
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:32,023
Shift 68 high to 11-99.
Niner on one, ready? Go!

865
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,000
Let's go!

866
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>That's 4th and 8th.
The crowd on their feet.</i>

867
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:42,260
<i>And this is a roll of the dice
for Coach Taylor.</i>

868
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:43,580
<i>If they don't make it,</i>

869
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:46,521
<i>the momentum shifts heavily
in favor of South Pine.</i>

870
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:49,023
Go Matt!

871
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,641
<i>Saracen is over the ball.</i>

872
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,292
Red Omaha!

873
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,441
White nine!

874
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,203
White nine!

875
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:00,290
Hut!

876
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:02,193
<i>He's got a man in motion.</i>

877
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:05,112
<i>Saracen fires-- it's a bullet!</i>

878
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:07,062
<i>Pow! Wow, it's right on
the numbers!</i>

879
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:08,902
<i>And Riggins is in the open field!</i>

880
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:11,573
<i>He could score!
He's breaking tackles.</i>

881
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,162
<i>Ho-ho, he will not be denied!</i>

882
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,700
<i>He is in!</i>

883
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:18,412
<i>Touchdown!</i>

884
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:23,021
<i>Touchdown Dillon.</i>

885
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,481
<i>Let's see if the Panthers
can keep their season alive.</i>

886
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:29,061
How about those Dillon Panthers?

887
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,330
Let's hear it, yeah!

888
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,452
Yeah!

889
00:35:33,736 --> 00:35:35,790
Have a good time!

890
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,040
Thank you very much,

891
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:42,911
- thank you.
- Coach, I really--

892
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:44,432
- Hey, buddy.
- I just wanted to say

893
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:46,260
- thank you for trusting me tonight.
- Huh?

894
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:47,633
I wanted to say thank you

895
00:35:47,637 --> 00:35:49,040
for trusting me out there tonight,

896
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,583
and letting me help us
to get that win.

897
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:52,111
It really meant a lot to me.
I just--

898
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:53,672
I just wanted
to let you know that.

899
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:55,170
- You did good tonight.
- Thank you.

900
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:56,410
You had some good ideas.

901
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,082
- Keep your head on straight.
- Thanks...I will.

902
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,602
Then we'll start
congratulatin' each other.

903
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:00,991
Other than that,
you have a good night.

904
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:02,633
- Okay, you too.
- All right.

905
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,860
- Hey.
- So I want you to come over,

906
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:08,221
and we'll have some drinks,
and we'll, um,

907
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:10,373
well, we'll talk about
some serious social issues.

908
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:11,732
- Okay.
- Because I know that you and I

909
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:13,833
are gonna see eye to eye
on lots of things.

910
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,493
- Oh, I'm sure we will.
- Yeah.

911
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,642
and I'm just so lookin'
forward to that.

912
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,041
And that's what I love
about the man.

913
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,352
It's collaborative.

914
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,103
Well, he's a fine coach
because he will take an idea,

915
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,322
and he'll listen.

916
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:37,460
Pretty sure most of them ideas
been coming from you, Bud.

917
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,761
- Well, I don't know about that.
- I'm pretty sure.

918
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,232
Excuse me, Mr. Garrity.
Hi.

919
00:36:44,225 --> 00:36:45,423
Hang on just a second.

920
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,151
I-I am so sorry.

921
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,603
I'm so sor--
it's all my fault

922
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:49,992
that my mama missed
her interview.

923
00:36:50,028 --> 00:36:51,520
We were,
we were driving.

924
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,190
I mean, we were
on our way here,

925
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,002
and w-we got a flat tire.

926
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:57,051
And, so, um, well,

927
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:58,261
that's why we're late.

928
00:36:58,358 --> 00:36:59,833
Well, that's okay.

929
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,433
I filled that position, but..

930
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:03,461
Um, I'd even forgotten
all about that,

931
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:05,032
but it's okay,
don't worry.

932
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,180
Hi, there.

933
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:09,783
Hi.

934
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:13,052
I'm Angela,
I'm Tyra's mom.

935
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,072
I am so sorry--

936
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:16,601
- You're Tyra's mom?
- Yes, I am,

937
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:18,760
- and I'm so sorry--
- That's--that's okay.

938
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,993
- No, I-I'm Buddy.
- Hi, Buddy.

939
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,802
Well, we had a little
car trouble, so here we are.

940
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,642
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

941
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,661
Um, we could--I mean,

942
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,952
I got a little time

943
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,620
if you want to talk now.
We could talk right now.

944
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,783
- Really?
- Sure.

945
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,423
You are such a gentleman.

946
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:36,520
- That is so nice of you.
- Sure, sure,

947
00:37:36,608 --> 00:37:39,053
- let's go in my office.
- That'd be great, all right, thank you.

948
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,303
Uh, Reg,

949
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:43,590
- if you see Pam--yeah.
- I got you.

950
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:45,802
Hey, Corrina, how you doin'?

951
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,752
I'm good, how are you?

952
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:48,003
Good, I'm doing fine.

953
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:49,010
Congratulations.

954
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,310
Thank you very much.

955
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:51,551
Hey, listen,

956
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,962
can I have him for about an hour?
I'll get him back home.

957
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,112
Yeah, you can do that.

958
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,371
Thank you.
Come on.

959
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,401
Yes, sir.

960
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:02,813
I'll see you later.
I'll see you at home.

961
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:04,153
- Good night.
- Take care.

962
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,111
So?

963
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:17,323
I'm the new receptionist!

964
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,871
That's great!

965
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:19,911
God, that's so great!

966
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:21,851
Okay, so, the typing
isn't a problem.

967
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:23,252
'Cause, you know, the ad
said they wanted typing.

968
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:24,513
Yeah, it didn't come up.

969
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:27,382
Okay, so... benefits?
Salary?

970
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,653
I don't know, we didn't
talk about it, honey.

971
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,200
Will you stop?
I just got a job!

972
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,073
That's what you wanted,
and I got it!

973
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,702
Let's go celebrate!

974
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:37,680
- All right, you're right, you're right.
- Yeah!

975
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:38,951
Congratulations, Mama!

976
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:40,280
Thank you!

977
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,571
- Let's get drunk.
- Okay.

978
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:46,763
When I was a kid,
we used to do all kinds

979
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,402
of craziness after a win.

980
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:49,931
Now it's come down to

981
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:52,732
burgers at Lenny's.

982
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:56,972
What I'm about to say

983
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:58,873
stays between you and me.

984
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,692
You're gonna get
yourself clean.

985
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:05,291
You're gonna submit to private,

986
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:06,990
voluntary drug testing.

987
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,960
Until I decide I can trust you.

988
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,972
Which'll probably be
a damn long time.

989
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,513
- Thank you, sir.
- I don't want you to thank me.

990
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:21,913
See that kid back there
washing dishes?

991
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,470
He used to be

992
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,162
quarterback over at Westerby

993
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:26,532
about six years ago.

994
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:29,801
He was on Grady Hunt's
top 100 list at number six,

995
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:31,322
if I'm not mistaken.

996
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:34,613
He never made it
past sophomore at Notre Dame.

997
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:39,081
You got yourself
into this crap

998
00:39:39,158 --> 00:39:41,212
because you didn't think
you were big enough.

999
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:43,823
I hope you see
the irony of that.

1000
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,593
You don't listen
to the Grady Hunts of the world.

1001
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:48,971
You listen to the people
that love you,

1002
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:51,101
and you listen to the people
that you trust.

1003
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:53,371
Most of all, you listen
to yourself.

1004
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,433
I hope...

1005
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,042
you realize just how far

1006
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,311
I am sticking my neck
out for you.

1007
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:04,822
I do.

1008
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:06,822
And I'll never
let you down again, sir.

1009
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:08,391
You best damn not.

1010
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:10,983
Yes, sir.

1011
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:13,132
See you, Lyla!

1012
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:26,312
Congratulations
on the big win tonight.

1013
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:30,152
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1014
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,542
How are you?
You never, uh,

1015
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:32,683
told me how your

1016
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:34,443
lunch date went.

1017
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,381
I think you know how it went.

1018
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,340
Busted.

1019
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:42,890
I was jealous.

1020
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:46,091
- Should I be jealous?
- No.

1021
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,752
Come here.

1022
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,462
You're beautiful.

1023
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,423
And you're smart.
And you're talented.

1024
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:01,041
You got your whole future
ahead of you.

1025
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:03,402
Oh, my God, are you
breaking up with me?

1026
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:06,422
My choices are
much more limited

1027
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,712
than yours.

1028
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,952
Please don't tell me
you're breaking up--

1029
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:16,260
I went out with Herc tonight.

1030
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:18,512
And I basically spent
the whole evening

1031
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:19,791
convincing myself that I was

1032
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:21,352
just a huge thorn in your side.

1033
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,041
And after I got done doing that,

1034
00:41:24,057 --> 00:41:25,412
I started to think

1035
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,173
about Herc.

1036
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:29,082
And why I like him so much.

1037
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:31,231
And I started to realize that

1038
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,000
I think I like him so much
'cause he..

1039
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,392
he...he took his handicap,

1040
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:39,651
and he didn't settle
for just becoming

1041
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:41,233
as good as he was before,

1042
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:43,242
he tried to become a better man.
And he did.

1043
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:45,890
And I think that,

1044
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:47,351
if I could be more like him,

1045
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,480
maybe I wouldn't be
such a bad guy to be around.

1046
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,901
And what...

1047
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,713
what he would do
if he was in my shoes.

1048
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,951
He would dump me
and go after Tyra.

1049
00:41:57,957 --> 00:41:59,491
No, he wouldn't.

1050
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,731
Yeah, he would,
he told me.

1051
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,192
But if it were you

1052
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:06,162
that he loved.

1053
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:08,943
If it were you...

1054
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:12,293
Lyla, I love you
more than life itself.

1055
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,381
And I have loved you like that

1056
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,250
since the first moment
I laid eyes on you.

1057
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:21,730
Lyla Garrity...

1058
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:26,073
will you marry me?

1059
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:30,180
Baby?
